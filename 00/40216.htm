            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system image is an exact copy of a drive. By default, a system image includes the drives required for Windows to run. It also includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer
 if your hard disk or computer ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it's a complete restoration you can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced with the
 contents of the system image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the link below to create an system image.</p>

    <title>How to remove entries for windows installer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to remove entries for windows installer.</h2>
                    Background:<br />
I am running Windows Vista Business 64 bit SP2.<br />
In process of trying to clean up some incomplete installs (HP printing stuff), I somehow added bunch of entries to some task list for windows installer.<br />
<br />
Now when I log in, during all the start up stuff, many applications attempt to install or uninstall.&nbsp; During this process something goes wrong and windows shuts down.&nbsp; This renders Windows unusable.<br />
<br />
I started up in safe mode and stopped the windows installer service from running using system configuration.&nbsp; Now when I log in all the same stuff attempts to install, but eventually all the start up stuff is done and I can do normal windows stuff, except the
 windows installer service is not running.<br />
<br />
I need the windows installer service to run so that I can start Word, and probably for other things.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
All would we well if I could just tell windows installer I didn't really have anything else that needs to be done.&nbsp; Then I could start the service and there would be nothing to do when I log in besides the normal start up tasks.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me where to find the task list that the installer is working?<br />
I am OK doing registry edits if that is necessary.<br />
<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Type Cover only working in one position - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ciaranni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Type Cover only working in one position</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the weekend, I've been having some issues with the type cover on my SP2. It seems to be software related, as in the first kickstand position, the keyboard and touchpad generally work fine. However, if I go to the second kickstand position, it stops
 working (as if it's detected that the keyboard is folded behind the device). I've discovered this morning that if I move the tablet from the first to second position very slowly, the keyboard continues to work ok for a short time, and then it stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure the best way to figure out if this is a hardware or software problem - it feels like software given that it's working in one position and not the other, and it works in the second for a short time if you go to it slowly. I'm not sure if there
 are any settings in the registry around what angle / position to disable the keyboard when it's rotated backwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for replying. I've given the contacts a wipe and it hasn't helped - to my untrained eyes they all look ok; they aren't stuck at all and they are still shiny on both sides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, I'm getting some issues in both positions now. Position 2 never works unless I go into it really slowly, but now position 1 takes a few goes to get it working when I boot up. I need to disconnect and reconnect, fold it into various positions,
 and then eventually it works. The interesting bit is that sometimes when it is attached but not functional (no backlight, no response from keys or trackpad) and I remove it - I still get the "would you like to switch to tablet mode" popup, so the computer
 still 'knows' that the keyboard has been disconnected, even though it wasn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is hardware I don't know how to tell if it's keyboard side or tablet side - so difficult to know what to try next (I don't know any other SP2 owners).</p>

            Thanks Barb, Ill just have&nbsp; to try to get one on ebay. If it is just the type cover it isn't too much of a disaster... Its given me quite a few years of good service! The tablet itself still performs great, so hopefully a new(ish) cover does the job!

            <p>A "Browser App" would be a recognized web browser application like Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and the like.&nbsp; All other applications would be considered "non-browser" apps or applications whose main purpose is something other than to contact
 sites on the internet at your request.&nbsp; It is not unusual for some of the "non-browser" apps to periodically connect to a website to check for recent updates, to check email, or other small updates... &nbsp;but it might be ususual if you had a malware application
 that connects to a website and downloads all your personal information.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download Windows 10 over public Wi-Fi</h2>
                    Apparently, Windows 10 is only going to be accessible to people with home high speed broadband. Have tried every public Wi-Fi from McDonald's to Starbucks (including the Public Library) to no avail. Have tried (as usual)&nbsp;everything suggested online and
 the download will not complete, sometimes because the Wi-Fi connection has been interrupted, though nobody else using the same public Wi-Fi experience any interruption. I don't suppose Windows 10 is going to be available on physical media? You would think
 that after 35 years with virtually&nbsp;only one product and absolutely no competition what-so-ever, you guys could get this right, but it appears that Windows 7 is the only really good OS (was that an accident?)&nbsp;Microsoft is going to make.

            I did finally get Windows 10 downloaded and it upgraded flawlessly as far as I can tell. It definitely looks like something that I got for free! I suppose you'd describe it as clean and functional, but it
<em>looks</em> cheap and amateurish. Edge is incompatible with almost every site I go to, but otherwise it works pretty crappy, too. Either most things are not configurable or else I just can't figure out how to do it. In short, I'm really, really sorry I did
 this upgrade. But, it did do one thing, it solidified my resolve to switch to Apple! I'm going to go back to Windows 7 (You finally got it right, was that the reason you got rid of it?!?) until it doesn't work any more and by then I should be ready to make
 the switch. I don't much like where they're forcing everyone to go either, but there's always Linux.

<h3> namesbrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            System-wide Preset Hotkeys</h2>
                    Windows 7 appears to have preset Hot-Keys which launch Office applications [e.g., with nothing but Windows running, pressing F2 launches Word; F3 launches Excel, etc].&nbsp; This is highly irritating, since these Hot-keys override other programs' Function-key
 assignments.&nbsp; I cannot find any information on how to find where/how these Presets are defined or, more importantly,
<strong>how to delete them</strong> .<br />

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Many thanks!

    <title>Microsoft Installer crashes, riched20.dll - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Installer crashes, riched20.dll</h2>
                    Hello I have been trying to install fallen earth using the windows installer, however whenever i try an error pops up. It says " Error&nbsp;2894.Info 2894.Loading RICHED20.DLL failed. GetLastError () returned: 193 " upon which the application closes. I believe
 that this is caused by a corruption of my RICHED20.DLL file. I do not know where to download a replacement file, and i cannot change it because the file containing riched20.dll denies me access. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
                </div>

<p><strong><span>Hi,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Riched20.dll is a dll file which is also used by Office applications like outlook. If it’s installed
 on the computer, try to uninstall and reinstall the complete Office application.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: Clean boot the computer before you do anything on the machine. Also its just a work around and
 there is no guarantee that it will resolve the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Perform clean boot ( Check the link for Performing clean boot)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Enable half of the services</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Enable half of the startup items</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat the above steps until you find out which service or program is causing the issue</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following
 the step 7 from the article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135. </span></strong></p>

            <p>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</p>
<p>Boot the computer to safe mode with networking and download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update definitions and run in safe mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

My brother got a laptop yesterday and everything was fine, then today he tried to go on youtube and the sound wasn't working. In the bottom right hand corner there is the normal speaker emblem but it has a red cross, and won't un-mute ect. Also I'm not very
 used to windows 8 so I don't have any idea's at all. The sound isn't working on anything at all not just the built in speakers. Any help??

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the <b>
Playing Audio</b> troubleshooter:</p>
<p>a. Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Control panel</b></a>.</p>
<p>b. Click on <b>Troubleshooting</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click <b>View all</b> on the left pane of the screen.</p>
<p>d. In the list of options, click on <b>Playing Audio</b>.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Next</b> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to set the default playback device:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under<b> Playback</b> tab, right click on the empty area and make sure
<b>“Show Disabled Devices</b>” has a check mark on it. If Speakers are disabled, it will now show up in the list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the device and select “<b>Set as Default</b>”. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have windows 10 and same problem. but I have discovered a temporary fix that works every time.&nbsp; Click on the speaker icon on the right side of the task bar. A box appears and has a bar with a green progress streak&nbsp;moving across it and it says it is checking
 for problems. Reports that the speaker is not plugged in (which is not the case). You then have a choice as to which device to fix, choose the speaker one. Then another box appears and checks for ways to fix the problem, then reports that it can not be fixed
 because the speaker is not plugged in. BUT look again at the speaker icon on the task bar and the red x has disappeared and you do have sound. The red x disappears periodically, mainly when you first turn on the pc or restart the pc but I just go through the
 same process and it works. Only takes about a minute. Hope this helps...

            <p>The method of DIANEESTES to restore sound worked when I tried it on my own bat.&nbsp; It told me that enhancements were causing the problem and that they must be switched off.&nbsp; I did that and the result was great sound. BUT it then told me that I must restart
 the machine, which I did, and now I have no sound again.&nbsp; Trying that method just tells me, as it did previously, that the sound device is not plugged in, which of course it is.</p>

            Thank you Anne. I went through all these steps. Same result. The only way for my computer to show on the network is to stop FDRESPUB service and start it then the invisible computer reappears until the next Windows start.

<p>Thank you for the response. If the above link did not work, let's try another workaround. Let's isolate if this is a hardware or a software issue. Disconnect all five computers and connect it one-by-one. If all the computers are working when connected alone,
 try connecting it all together again, switching the connections of each PC. If there is one that can not be seen again, then it might be a product limitation issue. The Internet might not be capable of supporting five PCs.

            Dear Anne,<br />
When I said that I have 5 computers, it is true but very seldom they are all on. I did what you have suggested to discover that it looks like there is a conflict between 2 computers: My computer (No 1) working under Windows 10 Home that has the issue and computer
 (No 2) working under Windows 10 Pro, witch is always on because I use it as a files server for my home. If computer No 2 is off than computer No 1 becomes visible on the network. As soon as computer No 2 is on, computer No 1 (after Windows restart) is not
 discovered anymore on the network. Computer No 2 is the only one to show Computer No 1 on its network places at all time, even though Computer No 1 does not see itself nor all other computers that happen to be on at that time. It is a very strange behavior.
 Meanwhile, I did a clean Windows Install on computer No 1 (on a different hard drive) and that strange behavior disappeared. I can't afford for the moment to have to reinstalled all my programs although I have all the licences to do it but it is a very tedious
 job. I look forward to find maybe a setting change in my actual setup that would solve this issue and I am counting on and appreciate your help.<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Dear Anne,</p>
<p>I think I found the cause of this issue. A month ago, I upgraded Computer No 2 (My server) from 32 to 64 bits. Apparently, the network master browser got screwed up in the process. I reinstalled the 32 bit version from a backup and "bingo" the master browser
 is back to normal and all computers are presents on&nbsp; "Network". Thank you for your concerns, you may close this thread.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Back to square one. I went through the process of migrating computer No 2 (Win Pro X86) to 64 bits by doing a Win Pro X64 clean install and all programs reintallation. The issue remains. If computer No 1 (Win Home X64) is started first and alone it appears
 on the network followed by computer No 2. nbtstat -a computer No1 on computer No 2 reveals that Computer No 1 is Master Browser. If I shut off computer No 1 than computer No 2 becomes Master Browser. As long as computer No 2 is Master Browser, when I start
 computer No 1 it does not appears on the network. This conflict does not occur with any other computers on the network, it occurs only when computer No 2 is on alone and computer No1 started. It's a weird situation and very inconvenient since, in my setup,
 computer No 2 is always on as a file server so computer No 1 never shows up on the network. It's like the cat and the mouse: when the cat is there than the mouse does not show up.</p>
<p>This strange behavior was not occuring with Win Pro X86 working in computer No 2.</p>
<p>Since I did a Win Home reinstall (not clean install) on computer No 1, is this issue coming from a wrong setting transfered from a previous installation to this new installation ???</p>
<p>Does Microsoft still offer a online help where a technician could by RDP takes control over and look for what could be wrong as it was possible in the past?</p>
<p>Any help would be well appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you Anne. I have contacted Microsoft Answer Desk as suggested. Since I am from French Canada and my Windows is in french, I will try to contact Microsoft Canada where, I thing, I can get french support: my english is not fluent enough to tackle such
 a weird behavior and hard for your expert if he does not know french.</p>
<p>I agree with you, it looks like a conflict during Windows reinstallation.</p>

            I did contact Microsoft Canada and has been redirected to Microsoft France.&nbsp; The person I talked to was very expeditive and not helpfull at all. She told me to do a network reset witch I did several times. According to her, there is nothing else that could
 be done. I asked her if I could have someone to check my setting via RDP, she hanged on me. A bad experience and a dead end. Meanwhile, I return computer No 2 to Windows 10 X86 operation.

            I did not give up. Let's concentrate on Computer No 1 that has the issue (not being seen on Network Map). I checked on other computers and eventhough they are disconnected from any network, they show themself on there own Network Map. I think this normal
 behavior, dont you think so? Well computer No 1 does not show on it's own Network Map. A network reset will temporary forces computer No 1 to appears on the Network Map until the next Windows restart. Somethink get screwed up during Windows start. Since Windows
 has been reinstalled several times and the issue is stil there, I suspect something is not properly set in the registry. Any clue about it?

<p>
</p><p><em>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before trying a reset, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>

<p>This did not work. Opening a new profile and the other currently existing user profile both had access to File Explorer. scf scannow did report corrupted files but would not fix them and would not allow me to view which reports and/or find out how to correct
 them. File Explorer is now a useless function which sometimes even disappears in the start menu. I can access My PC, etc. through the search window, but that is it.</p>

            This did not work. I have tried a few times. I've also downloaded 10 since I was told once I did that I could then delete it, return to 8.1 and then it would go away. Didn't happen, still pops up.

            <p>The steps are essentially correct but it's important to "hide" the update after uninstalling, otherwise Windows reinstalls it.&nbsp; Here are the steps that worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel</p>
<p>Click System and Security</p>
<p>Find and click on "View Installed Updates" (small text to the right under the Windows Update section)</p>
<p>Locate KB3035583 (I used the Search box in the upper right of the window) and uninstall it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, go back and search for Windows Update, KB3035583 will be there to install again.&nbsp; Right click on it and and select "Hide update".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As far as uninstalling Windows 10 update.&nbsp; Microsoft allows you to rollback to your previous operating system version for 30 days after the installation of 10.&nbsp; To see if you can, follow these steps</p>
<p>Click the "start" button in lower left of screen.</p>
<p>Click Settings</p>
<p>Click "Update &amp; security"</p>
<p>If you're computer is eligible to rollback, there is an option that states "go back to Windows x".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this option isn't available and you have your original discs or the recovery partition of your computer's hard drive, you can reinstall the operating system that came with your computer.&nbsp; The downside to this is option is it will likely wipe the entire
 hard drive and all your data.</p>

            I am trying to close/remove the "Windows Update" notification that wants me to schedule an upgrade for Windows10 and it won't close the window. I went into "View Update History" and searched for KB3035583, but it isn't in the list. How do I delete this
 notification from my computer system?<br />

<p>I don't know what OS you have, but you need to find Customize Notification (or Area) Icons either in the Control Panel (using search function) or on the tool bar (lower-right side, look for small Up-Arrow, left click this, choose Custimize). Look for GWX
 Get Windows 10 and set it on Hide Icon and Notifications. This will stop most of the annoying notices. On Update function, make sure you don't accidently download the optional update for Windows 10. I have set my computer to "Check for updates but let me choose
 whether to download and install them." When I need to update, I go to Windows Update, I ignore Upgrade to Windows 10, and click Show All Available Updates. Then I make sure I get the important updates for my version and undo MS's default "choice" of downloading
 the optional "update" of Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hello dumbeve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on if you're running Windows 7 or Windows 8, the KB may be different.</p>
<p>Microsoft has several Windows 10 notification updates in addition to KB3035583.&nbsp; I know of these two:</p>
<p>KB2952664</p>
<p>KB3123862</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search for them in Installed Updates and if found, follow instructions I posted on September 1, 2015.&nbsp; After uninstalling, reboot the computer, run Windows Update, locate the KB that was uninstalled.&nbsp; Right click on the KB and select Hide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should do it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I can control when and what updates are applied to my computer and the privacy issues are addressed, I am not updating to Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Under Change Setting in Control Panel, change "Install updates automatically (recommended)" to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download them and install them."&nbsp; When updates become available, anything other than Security click More Information
 to check what the update is.&nbsp; Doing this takes a little time but it prevents unwanted updates from being installed on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>July 31 is coming up so the "free" update notifications will likely stop.</p>
        </p>

            The Windows10 notification was not under my Icon and Notification tab. I did find the KB3035583 file under Installed Updates in the
<em><strong>optional </strong></em><strong><em>pending</em></strong> updates and I unchecked it before updating. I also did a C drive search for KB3035583 and it pulled up about 12 copies of the packet and I deleted them all. When I restarted my computer, the
 Windows 10 update notification was finally gone. thank you for your help!!!

<p>
</p><p>What does Nvidia support say?&nbsp; What have you already tried?&nbsp; You say little about the problem and what steps you have already taken to try to correct this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the release notes for driver version 341.81, it states this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Issue<br />
“Install failed” or “Install Failed, could not find compatible graphics hardware” message may appear during installation, even if the system has a compatible graphics card. This can occur when installing the NVIDIA driver or GeForce Experience software.<br />
Cause<br />
This issue could be the result of a corrupt WMI service on your system. The NVIDIA Installer requires the WMI service to properly install the driver or other NVIDIA software.<br />
Resolution<br />
You must repair the WMI service on your system in order to successfully install NVIDIA drivers. A future driver release will alert the user during installation that there is a problem with the WMI service on the system."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Task Manager by right clicking the taskbar and clicking on Task Manager.&nbsp; Click on More Details, then click the Services Tab.&nbsp;you are looking for winmgmt.&nbsp; Check to see if Windows Management Instrumentation is running.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a Bing search with this text in the search box, Repair WMI Service.&nbsp; This is a link to the results page.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Repair+WMI+Service&amp;FORM=QSRE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bing.com/search?q=Repair+WMI+Service&amp;FORM=QSRE4</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This Nvidia Installer, did you initiate this process from the Nvidia support website&nbsp;or did you download a .exe file to your computer? If&nbsp;you downloaded the file to your computer, did you right click on the file and did you click "run as administrator?"&nbsp;
 Are you logged into the computer with an administrator account?&nbsp; Did you try installing the driver in Compatibility Mode, as suggested in the Wiki article by Mr. Da Costa?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What Antivirus is installed?&nbsp; Disable any real time antivirus scanning before installing a graphics card driver.&nbsp; Do not forget to re-enable this after the test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, take the following steps to check the operating system for errors in the configuration and for corrupt files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can try running the&nbsp;<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong><strong><span>&nbsp;Troubleshooter</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Right Click </span></strong>on the
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> Button, then</span></p>
<p><span>Click on <strong>
<span>Control Panel</span></strong>, then toward the top of the Control Panel window,</span></p>
<p><span>Click on <strong>
<span>View By: Large Icons</span></strong>, then</span></p>
<p><span>Click on <strong>
<span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on </span>
<strong><span>Hardware and Sound</span></strong><span>, then</span></p>
<p><span>Click on <strong>
<span>Hardware &amp; Devices</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Return to the main
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> window and click on <strong>Network and Internet</strong>.&nbsp; Run the
<strong>Incoming Connections</strong> Troubleshooter.&nbsp; This will check to see if Windows Firewall is having any problems.&nbsp; Also, in the
<strong>Programs</strong> troubleshooters, there is a <strong>Compatibility</strong> troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Also, run <strong>System File Checker</strong> to check for corrupt files. An easy way to bring up a command prompt (as administrator) is to,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Right Click</strong> on <strong>
Start</strong>, then </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click <strong>Command Prompt (admin.)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Enter <strong>sfc/scannow
</strong><strong><span>and hit your</span> Enter Key</strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a link with more instructions for running SFC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is also a tool called DISM.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Run the DISM Tool to fix any files that System File Checker can't repair.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Right Click</strong> on <strong>Start</strong>, click on
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Type Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth and&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
Type Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth and&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
Type Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Restart</strong> the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Click on the link below for more information about running the DISM Tool.</span><span>&nbsp;

<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Also, it never hurts to create a Windows 10 DVD or bootable USB drive to keep on hand in the event that a tool asks for files to replace corrupt ones.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can use the Media Creation Tool to do this. Carefully read the instructions and information on the MCT webpage and the information that is provided through the links on that page.
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ask questions if you have any.&nbsp; Please let me know if these things do not work for you.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can always try a reset of Windows 10 if nothing else works.<span>&nbsp; </span>
This is easy stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>Look at this link for resetting Windows 10. Always backup your personal files!</span><span>&nbsp;

                    I run windows 10 1607 version, and my laptop is incompatible with the fall creators update 1709. I also downloaded the update that allows for certain updates to be hidden so they will not download. I had to uninstall the windows update assistance it was
 still trying to update to 1709 even though I had hidden that update. Yet when I logged on this morning, lo and behold, the windows update assistant had reinstalled itself! Is there anything anyone knows that can prevent this? I run most of my internet over
 my cell phone hotspot and have limited high-speed data, which I have lost 4 times because of the computer trying to update to 1709.

            <p>Hey chiahsienhu! It looks like that display only supports 1080 @ 60Hz (<a href="http://www.philips.com.ph/c-p/BDM4350UC_00/brilliance-4k-ultra-hd-lcd-display/specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>link here</u></a>). But you can always try setting the display settings to 4K and let the TV upscale instead of the console. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            NDIS &#40;ndisuio.sys&#41; blocked to access network</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to connect hp compaq t5700 thin client (embedded XP)&nbsp;to Server as Remote Desktop User, on Windows Server 2012 R2, but unable to connect due to error "An application named NDIS User mode i/o driver (file name ndisuio.sys) has been blocked from
 accessing the network".&nbsp;When try to connect to Remote Desktop, a message appear :
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"REMOTE DESKTOP DISCONNECTED", "The client could nto establish a connection to the remote computer". The most likely cause of this error are: (1) Remote connection might not be enabled to at the remote computer. (2) The maximum number of connections was
 exceeded at the remote computer. (3) A network error occurred while establishing the connection.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The ROLE of Remote Desktop Services are deployed in Session based scenario. Administrator user are being connected using thin client but connection is not being established.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the other hand when we connect from Window 8 or Windows 7 PCs using&nbsp;Remote Desktop, it&nbsp;connects easily.
</p>
<p><br />
Can any one held to resolve this matter.</p>

<p>Yes, there are services running through Task scheduler. Maybe check windows update and see if it is process of running.,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your CPU% usage when disk is at 100%</p>
