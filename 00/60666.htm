<h2>            Problems using Windows Hello - Face Recognition with the Intel RealSense Developer Kit 3D Camera</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just sent the following piece of feedback using Windows Feedback. But I feel it's important to share it through here as well in order to try and gather as much information as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I quote myself from the piece of feedback I've just submitted:</p>
<p>"General description: Problems using Windows Hello - Face Recognition with the Intel RealSense F200 Gen2 Developer Kit 3D Camera<br />
<br />
Windows 10 RTM build 10240 clean installed and activated: After my last problem with Windows Hello using the "Intel RealSense F200 Gen2 Developer Kit 3D Camera" to sign in using facial recognition, I've been forced to wipe out my system disk and reinstall Windows
 cleanly. By doing so, I think I'm in the position to give you more details about the issues I'm experiencing.<br />
<br />
Once Windows is installed, updated and each and every system driver has been installed as well, I connect the camera using one of my USB 3.0 ports of my motherboard (ASUS Z87-K [BIOS up to date]). After that, Windows detect the device and start installing the
 appropriate basic drivers. Once it's done, I install the latest Intel software "Depth Camera Manager" (v1.4.27.32425+Firmware 2.60).<br />
<br />
Alright, once the device installation is complete, I proceed to set up Windows Hello. In that moment, I see the screen preview showing colour image and the camera successfully detects me. I rerun the process a couple of times for recognition improving's sake.
 So far so good. But the problem begins the moment I restart the computer. After that first reboot, and once I sign in to Windows, I hear the Windows sounds related to device connection/disconnection; it's as if the device were being connected all over again.
 I quickly open Device Manager and I confirm that some of the drivers are being reinstalled because some of the devices of the camera are missing. After a few seconds the process ends and, when I go to Windows Hello - Face recognition set up, I see that the
 preview screen now shows a black and white image (grey). At that point the camera keeps on detecting me in spite of the lack of colour.<br />
When I restart my computer again after that, I promptly open Device Manager and everything is correct. Besides no Windows sounds indicating a device being plugged or unplugged are heard.<br />
<br />
This is my theory. I reckon that there may be a conflict between Windows 10 drivers for my camera and Intel Depth Camera Manager software. When I first connect the camera, Windows detects it and installs the basic drivers. Then I install Intel software and
 everything is good to go to start setting Windows Hello up (colour preview screen). However, as soon as I restart my machine, Windows takes over the drivers and reinstall them again (probably some of them over Intel's) and from that moment on, I only get a
 black and white (grey) preview screen while setting up Windows Hello. That's why I believe there is a conflict between Microsoft's current drivers and Intel software.<br />
<br />
Let me highlight the fact that the camera works perfectly well with other software, including the Windows 10 Camera app and Skype.<br />
<br />
The only way I see this is going to be fixed for consumer's use is for Microsoft engineers to work in collaboration with Intel's so as to address this conflict and provide a working and satisfactory solution.<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing updates in the future that may solve this.<br />
Thank you very much in advance!<br />
Cheers!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem I refer to that forced me to format and reinstall Windows 10 was the fact that I slept my PC. From that moment on, the camera would only recognise me in Windows Hello if I was way closer than usual. No matter how many times I tried to uninstall
 the drivers and the Intel DCM software (even using latest version of Revo Uninstaller Pro). What I don't know, however, is whether disabling the power management option that avoids powering off USB devices from Device Manager could prevent that scenario from
 happenning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm going to do here what I've done there. I'm going to encourage Microsoft's enginners to work along with Intel's in order to try and solve all these problems.</p>
<p>I have also shared this information on the appropriate Intel official forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to ask any information that you may need.<br />
Cheers!</p>

            <p>Windows Hello is definitely broken on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is connected to a UPS. Every night when I turn off my computer, I also switch off the UPS. Yesterday Windows Hello was working like a charm because I bought a small tripod in order to have the camera closer to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, however, it wouldn't work. Maybe it's related to the fact of turning off the UPS, I'm not sure. What I do know is that when I tried to set face recognition, the grey image in the preview screen was darker than usual again. I removed it, uninstall
 Intel software and system drivers, reinstalled all over again. After that Windows Hello setup worked again, but that's all. Whenever I try to use the camera to sign in using my face, Windows just keeps looking for me and it doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting really tired of it. I'm not going to use it for the time being and I'll keep on waiting for system patches, drivers or new software from Intel/Creative with the hope of being able to actually use it in the near future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guys, any special advice to reinstall Intel Software? If I simply remove it, I use Revo Uninstaller Pro (latest version); but when DCM is installed and I run the installer again, the repair option is not available for me; just remove and change.</p>
Cheers!<br />

            <p>Alright, after much effort I've been able to make it work again; but I had to uninstall everything once more, eject and unplug the camera, restart Windows and start all the process of installing drivers and software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep on testing and report if I find out anything else.<br />

</p><p>PS: Guys, don't install the Creative software for the array mics of the camera or you'll have a broken Cortana.</p>

            <p>Time to bump up this thread!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright, so I was checking out today, and there's a new DCM update available at Intel Download Center:
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25044/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intel® RealSense™ Depth Camera Manager (DCM)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The new one is v1.4.27.41944 and according to the release notes, there are some improvements regarding Windows Hello on Windows 10 to be expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues Resolved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improvement of outdoor recognition for Windows Hello.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliability issues resolved. Several crash scenarios related to Windows Hello reported by Microsoft.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Delay in streaming when resuming from Sleep or Hibernate in addition to scenarios where camera did not continue to stream.</li><li>Error written to event log with "failed to create Config file" message.</li></ul>
<p>You can download the release notes from here: <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/downloads/eula/25044/Intel-RealSense-Depth-Camera-Manager-DCM-?httpDown=https%3A%2F%2Fdownloadmirror.intel.com%2F25044%2Feng%2FRelease%20Notes%20DCM%201_4_HF3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Release Notes DCM 1_4_HF3.pdf</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it installed and I'll test it over the next days in order to see if it fixes the issues I've been bumping into. In my case, sometimes the camera doesn't seem to recognise me when I want to sign in and I have to either restart the PC or just use my
 PIN or password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Just to add my two cents here as well.&nbsp; I have the latest dcm (41911) installed and my behavior is similar to the first poster, well sort of.&nbsp; Once I install the DCM and set up Windows Hello the camera works fine.&nbsp; Log out, Sleep work as expected and&nbsp;the
 SDK apps and apps from the intel app showcase work perfectly.&nbsp; <strong>This is all right after install but before a reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong>After I reboot the camera only stays on for 3-5 seconds after windows starts and stops working all together.&nbsp;

            <p>You should try the latest DCM software (v1.4.27.41944). I haven't suffered from any issues ever since I updated to that latest version (published on Intel website on August 25).</p>

            <p>if you aren't using the SDK , then no reason to install it.&nbsp; Most apps will provide the necessary drivers to make use of the camera . &nbsp;Also uninstall anything you downloaded from Intel, reboot the pc and plug in the camera.&nbsp; Run windows update and it will
 download the latest drivers for the camera (newer then what's posted on the intel site).&nbsp; This solved all my problems and now windows hello works perfectly,</p>

            <p>Windows Hello is being revamped and overall improved for TH2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the latest Insider Preview 10565 and with the latest drivers provided through Windows Update, it's working for me really well. Especially the setup procedure - it finally works in colour and the detection process is much faster. Besides it can detect
 me from further than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to TH2 over here!</p>

<p>I've just grabbed new drivers and DCM version through Windows Update on Windows 10, build 10568.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the Depth driver is up to v1.4.27.52404 and so is DCM. Compilation date is October 15th.</p>
<p>Once you fetch them through Windows Update, you can find the files at "C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository". Just look for the most recent folder with name "realsensef200depth.inf_amd64_4c38452619e410e7"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll test it out and let you know if anything new comes up.</p>

<h2>            User Name is cut short in File explorer</h2>
                    <p>I just put together my computer and did a fresh install of Windows 10. I thought it was my imagination, but I noticed something really wierd. You know how you go to your user folder, the one that contains "documents", "Pictures", "Videos", and Downloads?
 Well the user should be Varxtis Foh, or at least Varxtis, but for some reason its comes up as "varxt". When I connect to this computer from my laptop, it shows Computer Name&gt; Users&gt; "varxt" (without parenthesis)</p>
<p>Does any one know why this is? Ive gone to Computer Properties and to User/Account Settings. Nothing to indicate theres a problem.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 on my Laptop and Windows 7 on another Desktop I have. Neither exhibit this issue. Ive also gone through Afterdawn, Google, Tomshardware, and Microsoft forums to see if anyone has had similar issue. I can find anything.</p>
<p>Please help. this is pretty frustrating.</p>

            <p>Is there a specific "3rd party program" that you have in mind? caus' honestly that's the most vague solution to a problem Ive seen in a while. "3rd party programs" could rightly include drivers.
</p>
<p>So... ya...</p>
<p>I asked a question, and yes I got an answer...</p>
<p>But my question was more in the direction of "Hey, is anyone aware of this problem, and if so, are there any known solutions?"</p>
<p>You gave me "Well it could be anything, so uninstall everything!" lol</p>

<p>This is not an error but most likely malware that&nbsp;wasn't fully deleted and needs to be addressed.&nbsp; The "error" is most likely that your AV program deleted most of it so what is left cannot start properly - which is good because we don't want it starting.</p>
<p><span><span>Go to</span></span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and
 run Autoruns and click on the Everything Tab.&nbsp; Look for anything related to IAstorIcon (it could be any kind of file or entry) and when you find&nbsp;it uncheck the box to stop&nbsp;it from starting at startup.&nbsp; Check the whole list as there may be more than one entry.&nbsp;
 When done, click OK and reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp; The message should be gone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware (or perhaps still be infected with malware). Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode
 with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Let's check for corruption which may have been caused by this problem (just to be
 on the safe side):</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command
 prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they
 can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Please keep me posted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Resolving Windows 10 &#39;Library&#39; error message</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I have recently upgraded to Win 10 and get the following error message when I log-in: 'Failed to load library file' I am on a stand-alone PC at home.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I understand the error is related to TP-Link with Win 10?</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>When I previously had Win 7, I could see TP-Link in Device Manager, but the upgrade to Win 10 has changed that to Atheros AR9287 Wireless Network Adapter (which I didn't invite it to).</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I have the TP-LINK Wireless Configuration Utility icon on my desktop, but when I click it I just get the same error message: 'Failed to load library file'.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I still have the TP-LINK Resource CD that came with the network card. If I install it again, will that remove the Windows 10 error message?</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Thanks.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Windows Update&#58; Windows 10 Upgrade Reserved Not Showing Up</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On some or most computers, it will say in Windows Update "Windows 10 upgrade reserved" as well as "We'll let you know when the upgrade is ready to be installed on this PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can get that to show up?</p>

            <p>I had this problem after trying to install the Windows 10 Technical Preview and shortly changing my mind about waiting for the official release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its no longer available for non-Win10 users so Windows Update doesn't offer it anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is a registry key that enables the preview builds which needed to be unset.</p>
<p>1. Open regedit.exe</p>
<p>2. Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\OSUpgrade</p>
<p>3. The key PermittedOSBuilds was set to 1 on my machine, setting it to 0 restored the Windows 10 Reserved banner in Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That change also resolved a message in the Event Viewer logs, under Application and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/GWX-Ins/Operational, where I was seeing:</p>
<p>Information message: Reservation is not-allowed from Appraiser</p>
<p>
</p><p>It now shows as allowed for me. If the registry key doesn't exist for you, there must be some other problem raised by the Compat Appraiser preventing you from taking the update, though I don't know how to identify what that is.</p>

            Is this what we can expect from Windows 10??? More Microsoft slip and slide around the issues again??? This is not helpful! It is possibly another "Great Glitch" in the Microsoft Windows applications submission event. Gee! What could go wrong?

            Hi steadyeddie,<br />
<br />
A faulty or an outdated driver may have caused a device not to work properly. For our initial troubleshooting steps, I suggest installing the latest Audio driver from the manufacturer's website. You may also want to check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15054/windows-7-automatically-get-recommended-drivers-updates-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to make sure that all your device drivers are up to-date to avoid hardware
 issues moving forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep us posted.

            I have also seen this several times over the past few days. It appears as a window when I alt+tab and has what appears to be a 4 square Microsoft logo but when I select it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It also appears when I start task
 manager but no other info is available. It will not show up on the taskbar or if I minimize all windows (I sometimes have to do this for a popup that will not appear on top of other windows). I can not find any info on google other than this forum. I have
 to close it with end task in task manager and nothing else seems to be out of place after I close it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker is making my audio REALLY choppy&#63; &#40;Answer ASAP&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, PLEASE answer!!! NO ANSWERS FOUND FOR MY CASE....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I opened up WMM to test out a video for speedart and stuff, imported music and sped it up, and it abruptly stops EVERY TWO SECONDS. Literally. Instead of flowing neatly like it should it plays.... plays.. BLIP... plays, pl- BLIP! really annoying. My video
 and audio drivers are completely fine, I may need to check codecs or something, but on this computer this is literally the first or second time I've worked WMM ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 8.1 32 bit (HP Brand if that helps)</p>
<p>Both GPU and CPU are AMD Radeon/Richland brands respectively, so nothing on that end</p>
<p>And of course audio driver is just some generic stuff that anyone could get</p>

<p>My first question is are you judging this from the preview window in Movie Maker? Or are you judging this in the final saved movie file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Movie Maker will try to show you a real time preview, but it can still have trouble when you have applied various effects (speed up, etc.) to the clip. The stuttering you are seeing may not even be an issue, but you need to confirm that by actually saving
 the movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you save as a movie, Movie Maker can take its time with complicated effects and can render better video and audio into the final movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results and if you are still seeing major issues, post a link to a problem clip so we can see the issues directly.</p>

    <title>How do I restore network drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sue namie  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I restore network drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a stock standard Dell 15R laptop running stock standard Windows 8.1 and have a network hard drive plugged into my TP Link router that is (or was) mapped to Z:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After returning from taking the computer for a drive, the network drive disappeared. The drive was still visible to my Ipad, but I did the usual stuff, disconnected and reconnected the drive, rebooted the computer and the router, etc, but noting I did could
 get the drive back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I'd remap the drive. I couldn't remember how to do this, so I went to the Microsoft help page for 8.1 on the topic, and was told to search for "Computer" from the start page, I tried to do it, but couldn't find anything called computer. I found
 a non-Microsoft help site which had screenshots, and it showed a tile called "Computer" so I searched for it again, without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I remembered something called God Mode, so I went to that and searched for map network drive, and found it, under something called "My PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to map the drive to Z: but it wouldn't let me. So I mapped it to Y: successfully, so there is nothing wrong with the drive, the computer or the connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So problem solved? Well, what if it keeps recurring? I'll eventually run out of drive letters. And I like my network drive to be Z:, ****, or I have to change the parameters for all my backups and stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So How can I change it from Y to Z and is there any way of preventing this happening again next time I leave the building?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why is "Computer" "My PC" on my computer? Can I change it so my computer is like everybody else's?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sue</p>

            <p>Hi Shivam</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to fix the problem by eliminating the Y and Z drives from the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network registry and remounting the drive to Z: Hopefully I'll remember how to do it next time it happens!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the sfc thing to make sure everything is shipshape but the DOS window disappeared before I could read what it said. Once upon a time you could add /p to freeze the window on screen, but this does not work any more. What is the trick now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW if Microsoft is going to change the name of its app from Computer to This PC they should update all the help files accordingly, and why change it anyway?</p>

    <title>BitLocker issue in Windows 7 Enterprise Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> satish_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            BitLocker issue in Windows 7 Enterprise Edition</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of days back the laptop did not start normally. It did not ask for the Bitlocker key as it usually does the first thing when I power up the laptop.&nbsp; Instead Windows said it encountered a startup error, would try to fix it automatically, and the
 PC would restart several times during the repair.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a dialog box that came up repeatedly asking me to click "Cancel"&nbsp;button to stop the repair process&nbsp;or "Finish" button to restart. Clicking Finish sent me into an infinite loop with the same dialog box appearing repeatedly.&nbsp; Clicking "Cancel" gave
 some debugging information, notably that the diagnosis was that the system volume may be corrupt.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the hard drive out and made it a slave in another laptop.&nbsp; This laptop can recognize the drive, but it is neither asking for the Bitlocker key&nbsp;or the recovery key (48 character key that the admin has). Instead a dialog box comes up with title "Bitlocker
 Drive Encryption (E:)" and in the body of the dialog box "Error recovering disk E:&nbsp; A recovery key was not found on this drive. The drive cannot be unlocked".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to add, the disk contains a lot of important files, and I need help to decrypt it and recover the files.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> gioracarmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Download of Skype from App Store into my new iPhone caused  the loss of all my contacts and history. Can I have it come back&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new iphone, Iphone 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the App Store and downloaded all the apps that I had on my old phone.</p>
<p>Skype behaved as if it does not know me. I had to create a new password, as the old one did not work.</p>
<p>And the list of all the people that I regularly skype with is lost, includin a few groups.</p>
<p>I have all of them in my computer's Skype. But I used to have them on the phone too.</p>
<p>All I have is all my contacts and those among them who have Skype have the video camera where their name is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not need all the contacts on Skype. How do I get rid of most of that list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And how do I find the history and the people I usually skype with, and bring these to the phone?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, the main culprit in why most updates are not being applied is due to third-party antivirus programs. In line to this, are you using any of those third-party antivirus programs? If yes, have you tried removing them and see if that would resolve
 the issue? Meanwhile, kindly refer to this link <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Keyboard not working after Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colinringie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard not working after Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>In the last couple days, my keyboard input hasn't been working properly.&nbsp; I am able to use Firefox, Steam, Word even File Explorer and have the keyboard recognized normally, but Edge, Mail, Cortana/search box, Settings, all do NOT recognize any input from
 the keyboard, letters, numbers or shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that I have tried which so far have not worked:</p>
<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling the keyboard drivers</p>
<p>Moving the keyboard to a different USB port</p>
<p>Trying a different USB keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I can think of is trying a PS/2 keyboard, but I don't have one around, and even if it worked, it wouldn't exactly solve my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?</p>
