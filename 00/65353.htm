<h2>            Missing MSVCP &#47; MSVCR 100,110 files</h2>
                    <p>Hi - My problem will be longer, because i want to explain what i did, and where the problem began</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am Windows 10 user, from about half of a year - i got it from Windows 8.1 free upgrade. At this time, i saw that your Windows 10 caused problem that my hard drive stop working just after computer shut down. But I will made another ask about this problem
 - let's focus on MSCV files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.12.2015 i installed massive Windows 10 actualisation - it was probably Service Pack 1 if my memory isn't wrong. I don't have any information about this actualisation on my actualisation's history, well it ends on 10.12. It was long actualisation with copying
 files, it lasted more than a hour, and it added me some new staff. It was evening, when I was surfing on the internet with this new actualisation, everything seemed to work fine. I switched off my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10.12.2015 - I turned on my PC. I was greeted by MSVCP and MSVCR110 errors of avguix.exe - it is my Antyvirus AVG, which dissapeared from my icons hided in lower-right corner - under the arrow - you know what I mean. But Windows didn't inform me, that I
 lost my antyvir - just can't open user interface. I removed it, and tried to reinstall it, but it came unknown error of instalation every time. So i had to install Avast Antyvirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I wanted to install MMORPG game, instalation of it got stucked on loading. I saw from their support, that problem is caused of Microsoft Visual C++ programs. Here I have read, that MSVC files also are from Microsoft Visual C++. This problem was related
 to 2010's versions of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They told me to uninstall those versions and install them again. Even when i uninstalled 2010's versions, I got message when trying to install them, that newer version are installed on my PC so instalation failed. OF COURSE i did my PC resets every instalations
 and deinstalations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was angry because i don't know anything about this programs, why they are so important, and why I have more than 10 of this programs installed - I had x86, x64, 2010, 2012, 2005... I uninstalled them all, and installed only 2010's version from Microsoft's
 site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read some of your forum's posts so :&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Now only error I got is from Gameconsultant.exe - it is program which had to help me to run instalation of the game - but it can't open due to MSVCP100 and MSVCR100 errors</p>
<p>- AVG don't want to be installed due to unknown error - but I am almost certain, it is related to Microsoft Visual C++</p>
<p>- TESO launcher don't want to start download game from it's servers, because it get stuck on Loading page.
</p>
<p>&lt;Something with Java software bothers me, because I installed TESO downloader about 5 times, and on every instalation, I got a message, that WIndows firewall had blocked some functions of Java Platform SE binary on&nbsp;C:\users\dawid\appdata\local\temp\i1449927680\windows\resource\jre\bin\javaw.exe
 - it doesn't matter I give Java access to my network or not - my TESO launcher don't want to start a download. &gt;</p>
<p>- I had runned SFC scan - it told me that there are no errors, and operation completed successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I had runned DISM tool - scanhealth and restorehealth - it told me that there are no errors, and operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>- All my MSVC files are lying on C\Windows\Windows 32 and SysWOW64 folders. What surprises me it is that they have very old modyfication date. MSVCP/R100.dll are from 06.2011 and MSVCP/R110 are from 11.2012. MSVCP/R120 are from 10.2013. Almost every file
 on this folder (about 90%) is from 2015 year. Also all MSVC files i didn't mention above, comes from this year. DirectX files are sometime very old, I see their modification date even on 2005. I have my PC since 2 years.
</p>
<p>- I used WinThruster program and it found 200 errors of my registry. Free version allow me to repair 15 errors, so I found on the list 3, that were related to Microsoft Visual C++ and repaired them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- To uninstall programs I am using IObit uninstaller. It uses normal program uninstaller, and then scan folders and registry for leftovers and remove them. Now I remember, that I used it to remove totally 3 games at 9.12.2015 because Windows SP1 actualisation
 wanted me to have 10GB place on C drive. I used it also yesterday to uninstall MVC++2010's versions - but to remove all versions I used "Add/remove programs from Control Panel"</p>
<p>- Yesterday I also scanned my PC by Avast Antyvirus, IObit Malware fighter, and cleaned my PC a bit with AdvancedSystemCare -it searches leftovers, temp files, registry disrupted files and remove/reapair them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- My PC is ASUS 64bits Operating system, processor x64</p>
<p>- Actually I have installed : MVC++ 2008 Redistributable x86, MVC++ 2010 Redist. x64, MV Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime x64, Polish language packet for these Tools 2010 x64, MVC++ 2012 Redist. x64, MVC++ 2013 Redist. x64 and Visual Studio 2012 x64
 and x86 Redistributables from AVG Technologies. All of them were installed by Microsoft pages posted on your forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I have made clean boot of Windows - it Disabled all programs except my Avast antyvirus, but left enabled all of Microsoft services. Problems remained the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I think Avast is not a problem here - I have it since 2 days, and even when I disable it's barriers - downloading won't start, and i get the same MSVC errors as I mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you even know what is the problem ? :) Or you are like me trying to find it ? If you would explain me everything why i receive these errors I will be very glad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Game I am trying to download has free weekend for players - I have time to Monday 14th to play it for free, and they will disable it :) Please do what you can - I gave you as more informations, as I collected - to hasten this process - so I am waiting for
 information from you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really sorry for my bad English - I wanted to contact english support, cause I think only you are able to help me :) I really don't want, to make reinstalation of Windows if it will destroy my files, cause i have no place to store them. I don't know if I
 should wait to you put these files on next actualistaion of Windows to swap to the older ones, or I should try to download them from web (I tried it, but I coudn't swap them, because they were in use of some programs) - Pleaaase HEEELP :)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why this happens on your desktop is because of an option that needs to be changed before we can arrange our desktop icons manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the steps below for us to check:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on your desktop.</li><li>Click on <strong>View</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Auto arrange icons</strong> and <strong>Align icons to grid</strong> (If needed).</li><li>Try rearranging your icons.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>

<p>This doesn't work. It was also one of the first things I tried doing, and unchecking&nbsp;<strong>Align icons to grid&nbsp;</strong>not only goes against keeping the desktop organised, it doesn't help. Thanks for the reply though.</p>
<p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem. Which is one reason I stopped keeping icons on my desktop altogether. (Except for the Recycle Bin, that is). Besides, it gives a nice clean view of my current wallpaper.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7dc6510-c310-442b-bbbe-03f22d82991a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7dc6510-c310-442b-bbbe-03f22d82991a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The BEST place to keep icons arranged to one's satisfaction is on the "Start Menu" although I keep fewer and fewer THERE as time goes on. The main reason for THAT being that Cortana can open all this stuff for me just by my saying "Hey, Cortana, open,,,,"</p>
<p>
</p><p>However! We're not talking about ME we're talking about YOU and you like to keep your icons in a certain order. It won't work on the desktop, I'm sorry. But it WILL work in your "Start Menu."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let us begin: Click the "Start Icon" (Windows Logo) on the left of your taskbar.&nbsp; That's your Start Menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine looks like this:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86d14589-fd41-4923-86aa-2d971da1b10e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86d14589-fd41-4923-86aa-2d971da1b10e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, those icons can be resized (just by right-clicking them) Unpinned from this menu, and rearranged any way you like just by point, click, hold, and drag. And, if you begin with your "All Apps" menu (click start, and select the third icon from the top
 to the left of your screen and you'll see them: &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1712c3ed-6ce3-4f62-ae6f-81832d18fbd3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1712c3ed-6ce3-4f62-ae6f-81832d18fbd3" /></a></p>
<p>Well, one has to keep them SOMEWHERE. You can right click ANY of those, and select "pin to start" then go to your start menu and arrange as before,</p>
<p>How's that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI you might want to set your "Start Menu" to "Full Screen"&nbsp; (and set all the other options to best suit your taste as well:</p>
<p>

<h2>            Three Neros On Windows 7</h2>
                    On this Windows 7 64-Bit, I own three different Nero suits:&nbsp; 2010 Multimedia, 2015 Platinum and 2018 Platinum.&nbsp; I know that by design the most recent MediaHome is supposed to be the default player; but that is only in a perfect world.&nbsp; I have not been
 able to start a playlist and keep the contents of it.&nbsp; Last February my system crashed to where I had to have Windows reinstalled and have a service recover my personal files.&nbsp; It was only my suspicion, but I believe it was due to a non-security Rollup offered
 beforehand.&nbsp; Anyway, the 2015 MediaHome became the default.&nbsp; To get around this, since that version kept crashing and was useless, I had to go into some location under App Date to access individual installers and reinstall each component in order to skip the
 older versions of Kwik Media and MediaHome.&nbsp; Loosing playlist contents is a habit that still persists.&nbsp; Now, what Nero's forum moderators do not get, as if I cannot observe my own comp

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say about Nero, although I have two Nero's installed at the moment myself, and at times have had three... I have never spent much time recently with play lists, and I never install the BackItUp Feature...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually rarely use Nero's Media Playback of any type... It lacks a lot of playback options... I primarily use it's disc burning\imaging features...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Groove Music is&nbsp;the new default App\Program in Windows 10... It replaces WindowsMedia Player, although some machines that were updated still have it...&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe is was introduced in Windows 8, but can't say for sure...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in Apps... Manage Optional Features... Add A Feature... You may be able to get it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, when I am having problems with WMP 12, I use a player called VLC Media Player... It's free, although now they ask for a small donation, but it is not mandatory.. It plays pretty much everything...</p>

            slance310, Nero is hard to replace with all the video tasks it does.&nbsp; Yes, I have VLC Player.&nbsp; These backup files it makes are compressed; and I guess they are good to have for restoring files.&nbsp; Today, I found that my external network hard drive has options
 for backup that are easier to use, especially when I have Nero components that either don't work or disappeared since I installed them.&nbsp; Will Groove Music work on Windows 7?&nbsp; Thanks for the information.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that Nero has useful features for various video tasks... I originally purchased for that reason starting with Nero 6...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like having the features, but no longer spend as much time with video stuff..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Groove Music requires Windows 8 or higher... I hadn't actually checked previously, but was responding to you mentioning it... It is a "App" as compared to a "Program", which Windows 7 can't handle...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your issues with Nero.... You could try to uninstall the 2018 version and then a "Repair" of the 2015... But I'm thinking that you are probably more "Up" on what's going on with Nero than I am...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't particularly like the way they have changed the format or the program... Even though I have purchased every version since Nero 6 (when on special for $25 or so), I don't keep them installed on my machine... After checking them out, I reload an image
 of my OS prior to their installation..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently get by with Nero 8 and 10 or 12... Nero 12 updates to 12.5, which is where it starts the stuff I don't like and gets worse from there..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to save the update files prior up to 12.5 separate so that I can manually update 12 as high as it will go without becoming 12.5...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose that could change in the future if I get more involved with the HD 4k video or such...</p>

            slance310, I distinguish Nero versions by the year.&nbsp; So, I do not know what the version numbers mean.&nbsp; I am not that well up on them.&nbsp; However, Nero prematurely discontinues technical support on its products in order to get customers to buy the most current
 one.&nbsp; Technical support this morning just asked me to do a bunch of things that I know will not only fail but by the sequence of things are impossible.&nbsp; They just asked me to reinstall everything, starting with the most current products.&nbsp; Their installers
 will abort if they detect a newer version already installed.&nbsp; Thanks for Groove Music clarification.&nbsp; Nero must take its customers for granted.&nbsp; I would be ideal if WMP had more features to replace Nero.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nero did not release version by the year until Nero 2014..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nero 6 was released in 2003... Somewhere around Nero 8 the version number and the year are close..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do need to install Nero starting with older versions if you intend to install more than on version... That speaks a bit of Nero's Customer Support in a nutshell..</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I have had good experiences with them, but that was years ago, and things change..</p>

            Lately another moderator got onto my thread in the Nero forum just to argue with the other guy.&nbsp; Nero is such a complicated mess that I guess they cannot train people in using it.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the original moderator said that someone should be able to run
 as many as nine different versions of Nero with no problem at all.&nbsp; In my case he suggested the problem is in my OS.&nbsp; So, last night I ran System File Checker, Chkdsk and Defrag.&nbsp; The first two tests did not reveal anything.&nbsp; However, I saw that Defrag, which
 I ran again, was already scheduled to run every Wednesday at 1 AM.&nbsp; A technician who oversaw my malware removal service said that recently Windows set this Defrag schedule up.&nbsp; At first I though it was this local store.&nbsp; Anyway, is there any way that this
 Defrag could have created a problem?&nbsp; I have A+ training and know that this deep scanning is hard on the system.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Defragging is normally pretty reliable, but I have encountered issues with various different defraggers in the past...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every now and then I would end up with a corrupted file..</p>
<p>I would think this is most likely to happen when the Defrag runs in the background while the machine is doing something else..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say this is what caused your problem with Nero, but it is a possibility...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure the Windows Defrag is set to run automatically by default...</p>
<p>A time is randomly selected based upon the time\day Windows was first installed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally turn mine off, and do a defrag\optimization when it is convenient for me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS drive is a SSD which does not really need defragged, so that is not a issue. My other drives are done manually...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that Windows is responsible for the problem as well, above and beyond the Defrag possibility... It is possible that a Windows Update could have somehow damaged Nero's functions, but I don't think I have ever encountered that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered Nero Updates causing problems, but don't remember the circumstances, or even which version... A couple versions of Nero had a lot of problems... I think Nero 9, and Nero 11 in particular, had issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nero has experimented with it's installers over the years, and some had problems..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct that Nero is quite complicated... Most features work independently, but some overlap... especially the audio\video you are having problems with..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT... Just to make a point about Windows... I am currently running a Windows 10 Preview of a future release...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have certain Windows System32\shell32.dll files from previous versions of windows, clear back to XP... This file, and a couple of others, contain all of the default system icons... I like to use some of the old Icons so I copied the files, renamed them
 slightly, and added a "+" to the name so they would appear at the front of the list... I then place then in the System32 folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had a problem with this until the last six months or so...</p>
<p>Every Windows 10 preview Build I have installed insists on deleting them..</p>
<p>No warning... No Notification or warning... Nothing..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not just these files either... anything that has a "+" at the beginning of the name</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt that something has changed in your Windows 7 that would cause this... I still run Win 7 Pro on this same machine, and have not had a problem with anything disappearing or getting lost... at least that I am aware of..</p>

            I don't know what kind of hard drive I have.&nbsp; Properties says it is ATA.&nbsp; There is no other program on this computer that does Defrag, just what Windows contains.&nbsp; Before yesterday I thought Nero's updates would have been the more likely cause.&nbsp; If we
 can't figure it out, then they definitely won't.&nbsp; Just a minute ago I turned off Defrag, which I wish I had done sooner.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I am now considering switching to Cyberlink products, which received high praise for their burning abilities.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is probably a standard hard drive... </p>
<p>Only recently did computers start coming with a SSD for the OS...</p>
<p>I added mine myself... Dramatic improvement in Boot\Restart time, and program loading...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Cyberlink in the past, and sometimes still do... I think the version I have installed is something like Version 8 !!! very old... It works, but like Nero, it requires it's own way of doing things...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use a program called Magix Edit Pro... It will do some things that I don't think the others will... One thing I have used it for is to crop videos like you would a photo...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if Nero 2018 caused your problems, or if they are just a consequence of the other problems you have had.. Both are possible...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possibility I thought of... Perhaps your various Nero versions installed Nero Updates AFTER a newer version was installed... I would think&nbsp;that might cause problems... When they were originally installed, one version was probably old enough that there
 may have been no more updates before you installed a newer version..</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reality, the best thing you could try would be to completely reinstall Windows 7 and start over... Very time consuming, I know from experience..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that your Windows 7 has not been quite right since it was reinstalled by the tech.... There are TONS of updates that must be installed, and I have had them fail on multiple occasions when reinstalling Win 7...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you start with Win 7 SP1 there are a lot... Some of the .Net Framework 3.5 updates can cause Windows Update to crash because the first ones to install try to run some process that crashes the ones still downloading... Just one example...</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT... Even though I run Windows 10, and sometimes Windows 7, my Windows 10 is actually an upgrade of Windows 7 Pro SP1 with all of the Nero, Cyberlink, Magix, and a bunch more stuff already installed...</p>

            <em>"In reality, the best thing you could try would be to completely reinstall Windows 7 and start over."</em>&nbsp; No, thanks.&nbsp; This installation is fairly new, during a time which I had to pay for data recovery.&nbsp; I am not getting anything worthwhile done
 as it is, having started projects and reaching a point where I cannot continue without difficulty.&nbsp; In fact, early 2016 my XP crashed and I have not brought it back up yet, thinking that much of the hardware went with the OS.&nbsp; If this system crashes for good,
 then I will not get another computer at all.&nbsp; Supposedly the team that reinstalled Windows did the updates.&nbsp; As of the last crash, I do not do either non-security or preview rollups.&nbsp; Of Windows Updates, I do not remember anything failing to install after
 I chose to hide others.&nbsp; With my Nero versions, I did not install updates, even though its ControlCenter detected them, until I had all three versions installed, skipping over the outdated MediaHome versions while only installing the latest one.&nbsp; Initially
 there were many; but their updates since are extremely rare.&nbsp; No, I am not reinstalling Windows as long as my Office programs run without problems.&nbsp; However, you identified a problem that Nero ignored in that while restoring Nero their technical support should
 have covered the updating in detail.

<p>
</p><p>To further investigate on your issue, have you tried to call using Skype on&nbsp;a different device? Check that you have dialed the number correctly. Remember to select the country from the drop-down, or enter a "+" and then the country code plus the number you
 want to call.</p>
<p>

<p>I&nbsp;think that what is happening is that Skype is taking on my cell phone number. So when I call my own number (admittedly for the purpose of finding my phone!) it thinks I am checking for voice mail.&nbsp; It shows on my phone that I received calls came from my
 own number. Also, when I called friends from Skype, the call showed up as coming from my cell phone number. There may be some benefits to that, but not helpful for finding my phone.</p>

            That is exactly what is occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you misplace your phone and you need to find it, or simply want to ring your phone,
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/main-page?page=callerIdhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
disable Caller ID</a> in your Skype settings.&nbsp; With Caller ID disabled, you will no longer be spoofing your own mobile number.&nbsp; This way you be able to call your phone without being redirect to your provider's voicemail system.&nbsp; Once you have located your phone,
 you can re-enable Caller ID.<br />

<h2>            Unable to use the Quick Assist app from Windows Feature Update Build 1607</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently installed the Windows Feature update Build 1607 also known as the "Anniversary update" and I was pleased to see the new built into Quick Assist app that was added. However, when trying to use the Quick Assist app it just shows a loading circle
 and never enters the app. Would anyone know how to solve this? Has anyone else had this issue? Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to&nbsp;run the below Windows Store apps troubleshooter and&nbsp;check if it helps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I would suggest you to run the DISM command as explained below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on the start button and click on the option 'Command prompt ( Admin)' to run the command prompt in admin mode.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press <span>Enter</span>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></div>
<span>Important</span> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps and let us know the results; we'd be happy to help you further.</p>

            Here is how to fix this problem, Go to the Internet Properties and then go to the advanced tab, make sure under "security" the box in front of "do not save encrypted pages to disk" is left uncheck.&nbsp; If it is checked uncheck and then apply and Quick Assist
 should work perfect at least for me it did.

<p>Hi SoMaji,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please make sure the Personal settings are set correctly like below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f192a5d-3ebf-4849-86c2-607b3924aeae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f192a5d-3ebf-4849-86c2-607b3924aeae?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you can try following steps to check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Open Registry Editor.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to&nbsp;<strong>“HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run”&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>3. Right click and select <strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>String</strong> <strong>
Value </strong>to create a new one. Named it as Lync.</p>
<p>4. Double click on this value and type the below commands in Value data:</p>
<p><em>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\lync.exe" /fromrunkey</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If it doesn’t work, you can choose to delete this manually created key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

            EXACT same situation. Windows 10 downloaded but I hated it and let it uninstall self. Did terrible job and now I have to hit refresh key every time a couple minutes pass without typing or something. AND this problem with iTunes left in aftermath of uninstall.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>1. Why are you trying to register the file?<br />
2. Do you get any error message that prompts you to register the file?<br />
3. Does the error occur when you try to launch any particular application?<br />
<br />
Make sure you are typing the command correctly. &nbsp;It is <strong>regsvr32 mswinsck.ocx</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the following location and check if the file exists there.<br />
C: Windows\System 32\ mswinsck.ocx</span></p>
<p><span>If the file is not present, then copy it from a different computer running Vista and save it on the same location.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try these steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><br />
</span><span>Run System file Checker (SFC) on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>SFC scan will make Windows replace corrupt or missing system files on your computer.<br />
a. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.<br />
b. Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.<br />
c. In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 System Reserved Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started to get the following&nbsp;error in Win 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You are running out of disk space on System Reserved (H:)</p>
<p>Click here to see if you can free space on this drive"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive H is 32Gb approx. and the free space is just under 2Gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see any files in Win 7 but if I use Paragon Hard Disk Manager 2010 then in the File Transfer wizard I can see folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>$recycle bin</p>
<p>Boot</p>
<p>System Volume Information</p>
<p>
</p><p>$recycle bin looks to have one sub folder with a desktop.ini file in it</p>
<p>Boot folder looks to have sub folders with the language info and these folders either have bootmgr.exe.mui and memtest.exe.mui</p>
<p>System Vol Info folder has bootmgr and bootsect.bak in it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can delete all or some of these files and if I do will I end up causing myself more problems than just getting an annoying message now and then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>

<h2>            Removing Access To Block my Files Being Deleted From TrustedInstaller</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is very cluttered and I'd like to clear up some files that previous forums have resolved, yet the options on my laptop are not available. As I believe I'm running an updated version of Windows I would like your advice on giving myself full ability
 to delete my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also trying to remove a secondary Administrator from my laptop which appears in the security settings for permissions yet not in User Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This advice would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>(This is not Microsoft. It's a community forum.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the beginning of the PC industry - if not earlier - computers have been designed on the 'principle of least privileges' (you can Google that) which is to say that each user has the least amount of privileges necessary for its role. That's why you cannot
 give yourself the ability to delete any file you think should be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't agree with this principle, that is your right. I obviously can't speak for an entire industry, but I would guess that no one really cares if you want to cause damage to your own personal computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that computers are interconnected through networks, the largest of which is the internet, so one computer with compromised security can cause damage to thousands of other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this reason, Microsoft makes it difficult, virtually impossible, to give a user carte blanche to do whatever they think is right in their own mind.</p>

<p>Thank you forum friend and community member! I was under the impression this was the place to enquire. My PC is being slowed by alot of these files which a search engined clarified as dud files. I don't particularly want to post my private email on a forum
 but you can take my word that when I run "NETPLWIZ" I appear as my only administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feature to remove the rights from TrustedInstaller has been removed to my knowledged, as out of date guides and walkthroughs online show this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd be able to provide me with further advice to how to give my administrator the same rights to rename and delete files as TrustedInstaller then that would be fair and appreciated :)</p>

<p>TrustedInstaller has superior permissions to Administrators, that is true. Here's why: Administrators is a&nbsp;<em>user</em> account - you have to sign in with a username and a password - while TrustedInstaller is a
<em>system </em>account - used by Windows itself so it doesn't have a username or a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user account is relatively easy to hack -- the attacker can guess or otherwise obtain the password. A system account is harder to hack. If an Administrators account gets hacked, the attacker still has to find a way to overcome TrustedInstaller to disable
 or uninstall software, for example: your anti-malware software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll hate me for this, but I ain't telling you how to weaken TrustedInstaller. If you lack the skills to search the internet for instructions, you're in no position to fool around with Windows security.</p>

I use a Dell Inspiron 1420. Hopefully what I say below will apply to your model, because most users of other makes could not follow my method.<br />
<br />
Right click on an open space of the desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; Mouse Pointers ( yes, mouse pointer ) &gt; here is where others could not follow.....<br />
Do you see Dell Touchpad window ? If yes, click it &gt; click Device Select, Button Settings &gt; under Touchpad, click Enable. Note you might also want to check " Disable Touchpad/Pointing Stick when external USB mouse is present &gt; OK<br />

<p>Hey Mickelind thanks for taking the time to bring this inquiry to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We found&nbsp; that<span> a DVD designated Region 2/4 is suitable for playback in Western Europe, Oceania, and any other Region 2 or Region 4 area. So-called "Region 0" and "ALL" discs are meant to be playable worldwide. Most DVDs sold in Mexico and
 Latin America carry both region 1 and 4 codes. So it should work, give it a shot and let us know how it goes!</span></p>

            Hello!<br />
<br />
If it's strictly a region 4 DVD my understanding is that it will not work in Europe unless you a have a DVD player from that region (Australia, NZ, &amp; Asia) or you have a region free (Region 0) DVD player.&nbsp; I wouldn't think it would in the Xbox one since all
 consoles are region locked.

    <title>In Windows 10 v1709, file explorer has become all but useless. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            In Windows 10 v1709, file explorer has become all but useless.</h2>
                    <p>Since my laptop was upgraded to Windows 10 v1709, file explorer has become all but useless. It immediately goes to Not Responding, and hangs forseveral seconds. When it finally does come back, any attempt to scrolling up and down the folders list sends it
 into Not Responding. (I remember having similar issues with NT4, XP, Win2000, Vista, etc etc etc. Surely after 20 years you have some way of resoving this.) I believe it's related to Recent Items which have been deleted, or are on a network drive which isn`t
 accessible from home/hotel/remote office, or any other situation where mobile computing is required. If I remove or minimise the recent items the problem goes away.</p>
<p>I didn`t suffer from this issue in the previous version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Is there a fix ?</p>
<p><br />

            Open Start, type: file explorer options 
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under the General tab, click in the Open File Explorer to then choose  "This PC". 
<br />
<br />Try WinKey + E now. If it opens fine, then the problem is with Quick access cache, which can be cleared by deleting *.automaticDestinations-ms from the following directory, using Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: %AppData%
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Then navigate to that folder. 
<br />
<br />Could be an issue with your display driver.
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Display adapters
<br />Right click the current display adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />Exit Device Manager
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />You can also try temporarily disabling your Antivirus and also perform SFC and DISM:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
