    <title>iTunes and iPhone synch - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            iTunes and iPhone synch</h2>
                    <p>I have office 365 university installed and I use Outlook for my calendar, contacts and notes as well as email on my pc. After years of Blackberry use, I switched to an iPhone 6 two weeks ago. Initially, it was quite happy synching my calendar, contacts and
 notes with the iPhone via iTunes. But something went wrong last week (I believe because I temporarily enabled cloud-synching on the iPhone, since turned off) and and now, although the contacts and notes still synch ok, the calendar does not. Two symptoms arise:
</p>
<p>1. new entries made on the iPhone do not replicate to Outlook on the pc (but new entries and changes made on the pc, do replicate on the iPhone) and</p>
<p>2. each time I synch, two extra calendars with the name _modcal followed by various digits appear in Outlook on my pc and I have to delete them manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be really grateful for an explanation and for advice, please, on how to get Outlook and the iPhone synching properly again ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have tried a full uninstall and reinstall of iTunes; I have tried the reset synch history button in iTunes but it does not seem to do anything)</p>
<p>With many thanks indeed for your help<br />
</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the type of email account configured in Outlook 2013? For example POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync (EAS) or Microsoft Exchange. To check the type of email account configured
 in Outlook 2013 click on <strong>File &gt; Info </strong>&gt;<strong> Account Settings &gt; Account Settings</strong> drop-down. EAS account refers to Hotmail.com, Outlook.com or Live.com email accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note, for syncing of data between computers and devices, it is always advisable to use a EAS account like Hotmail.com, Outlook.com or Live.com, which will allow seamless syncing
 between various devices. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Outlook always plays a passive role when syncing with a handheld device since it doesn’t include any feature to control sync settings. All sync settings need to be adjusted using
 the software which acts as an interface to connect the handheld device with Outlook. I would suggest you to check with iTunes support.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you</span>

<p>On Outlook 2013 on my pc, I have 4 email accounts set up. 2 are POP3 (leaving mail on server) and 2 are imap.</p>
<p>I have never used an outlook.com email address.</p>
<p>I have just set up an alias for the first time.</p>
<p>Is there some practical way of importing all my calendar events, contacts and notes from Outlook 2013 to outlook.com ?</p>
<p>Can I add my four proper email accounts to outlook.com ?</p>
<p>And reply to emails as though from four different email addresses ?</p>
<p>And would doing all this enable iPhone synch ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been talking with iTunes support at an escalated level. They seem to think that Outlook 365 cannot not synch calendars with iPhones. That seems really strange since there must be many tens of thousands of iPhone users who have Windows pc's and using
 Outlook 365. </p>
<p>What is Microsoft's view on this claim by Apple ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank you in anticipation of your reply</p>

            <p>Outlook does not participate in the sync process.&nbsp; It is up to the add-in like the iCloud or iTunes add-in to perform the sync functions.&nbsp; Those are supplied by Apple.&nbsp; Here are some articles about issues you may face when using Outlook with iCloud:</p>

            <p>If you connect Outlook 2013 to Outlook.com allowing Outlook to configure the account automatically, your Contacts and Calendar should sync.&nbsp; No export/import needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can add as many accounts on Outlook.com as you wish or you can add extra addresses to your single account as aliases.&nbsp; With the former (i.e., each address is a separate account) you can send/receive in Outlook 2013 and people to whom you send mail will
 see the separate addresses.&nbsp; If you use aliases (multiple addresses but one account), you can send/receive in Outlook 2013 as well. Incoming mail can be delivered all to one Inbox or you can use&nbsp;rules to separate the incoming mail into separate folders (either
 on the server side or the client side), but&nbsp;it will still be one mailbox. If you send, the recipients will see only your primary address.&nbsp; If you send from the outlook.com web site, however, your recipients will see the sending address, which can be any of
 the aliases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set up a connection to your Outlook.com mailbox on the iPhone and it will sync the calendar and contacts to the phone as well so your phone and Outlook 2013 will contain the same data.&nbsp; If you use separate accounts, you can see multiple calendars
 (one per account).&nbsp; Outlook 2013 will show multiple Contacts folders as well, but I don't know what the phone will do with multiple contacts folders.</p>

<h3> robertwands  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Explorer 9 The mouse pointer does not calibrate with the page to click on items and there is a black bar on the right of the page</h2>
                    <p>When using Explorer 9 with windows 7 the pointer is not correctly callibrated with the page. In order to click on items eg scoll bar the mouse pointer needs to br about 1/2 inch to the right of the item. There is also a black area on the right of thescreen
 of about 1/2 inch . All other progs and other browsers are ok.</p>
<p>Having checked again the problem appears to be related to Switchable Graphics rather that Explorer 9. When I switchother progs to High Definition rather than Power Saving I now get the same problem. Looks like an Intel graphics rather than Microsoft problem.</p>

            I live in Finland and set that as timezone, but language setting is Swedish, because there is no&nbsp; "Finland (swedish) " alternative in there. Seems not all Americans don't know, Finland have 2 native languages.&nbsp; Anyways, i got Insider newsletter in English
 first, then i logged in and it changed to Finnish, i guess it read from my IP INSTEAD of my settings :P

    <title>Creating email &#47; new account for friend. Verification SMS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_1369  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating email &#47; new account for friend. Verification SMS doesn&#39;t arrive...</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>This is so frustrating. My friend tried to log in to her skype account. "Invalid password / account", and she is locked out now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried creating a new hotmail account, and sign up as "New User"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get to the "Send Verification Text", I click, Send Code and wait. And wait. And wait...</p>
<p>
</p><p>She gets the text to her phone AFTER the code expires !!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried, "Send to different email."&nbsp; Which I get the Code immediately, then when I enter the information to reset the password, etc. It tells me the "information is wrong"...lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here we are. No accounts for her. I did another "SMS Code" about 11:20 pm 3/23/18. Still not code and the number will be invalid, if we do get the code.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the issue, what are you trying to do as&nbsp;you were asked for a verification code:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Creating a new account? </li><li>Password reset?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>
</p><p>BOTH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She had the problem with her regular account, logged in, "Invalid password / account", and went to the verification page to "Reset Password"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when I tried to create a new microsoft account (hotmail.com), when it goes to the verification page, the sms doesn't come in a timely matter. I tried last night at 10:30 pm. She sent me a message that she received the text at 5:00 am !! And it is now
 11:30 am, when I am finally online, almost 12 hours later. The code will not be valid, plus the fact, my computer turned itself off -- another issue with Windows 10 that is still unresolved, that will happen, then not, depending on the update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>May I know if you would want to recover the account or just create a new account?</p>
<p>Have your friend tried to recover his/her account using the password reset page?</p>
<p>If so, what was the response?</p>
<p>Also, are you and your friend located in the same country?</p>

<p>Like I said in my previous reply to Susan. I did both. I tried with her account, then I tried creating a new account. As did she.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets to the SMS Verification page, "Sending Code", then 8 hours later, the code was sent to her phone. Which, when entered, it gives a response, "Invalid Code", because I was assuming, 8 hours later, the code is invalid. Most things that require a code
 usually say, "The code will be valid for 30 minutes..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new MS account, had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She tried to reset the pw, etc. They take her to the MS verification item, then say, "Invalid", or when it says SMS Code, the code never goes to her phone.&nbsp; She lives in the Philippines, I live in the USA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why is this so hard?&nbsp; I have asked Uncle Google, and the SMS Verification issue has been happening with MS for over 5 years, yet, it is still an issue.</p>

                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Nokia Lumia 930 and just realised that when I add a new calendar event from my phone, its suppose to sync and appear on my desktop outlook, but it doesn't. I'm wondering how do I get that working .</p>

            <p>Did you add the event to your Outlook/Hotmail calendar? Open the event and make sure that is the case. The calendar let you add events to all calendars so it is an easy mistake to add it to the wrong one if you are not careful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is in the right calendar, male sure the account is syncing correctly under
<strong>Settings &gt; email+accounts</strong>.</p>

    <title>Freight calculator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> venkat &#40;live.com  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freight calculator</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have the below two tables - Import Rates and Export Rates with the weights and Zones. Now in order to have a freight calculator could you please advice me the best formula to arrive at the below output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 1</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Type</td>
<td>Import</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Origin/Destination</td>
<td>Zone 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Weight</td>
<td>125kgs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pieces</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Freight Cost</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Example 2</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Type</td>
<td>Export</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Origin/Destination</td>
<td>Zone 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Weight</td>
<td>150</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pieces</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Freight Cost</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p><br />
From the below tables- ( Export &amp; Import Rates) I need to work out the freight cost based on the above inputs provided. I could chose any of the below Zone and type ( Import/Export rate) based on need and therefore the formula should automatically calculate
 the freight based on the Zone and Rate type combination as mentioned above. Also for weight &gt;70 kgs. the calculation has to be as follows- for the first 70kgs take the actual rate mentioned + the balance kgs * the rate that is mentioned against the &gt;70kgs.</p>
<p>Please advice what combination of formula I should use to arrive at the said output and if you could provide me one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Export Rates</p>

<p>
</p><p>First, you can use any file-sharing website that you want to; for example, onedrive.live.com, which uses the same login as answers.microsoft.com, this website. I never use it because many people find it difficult to set up the file access permissions correctly.</p>
<p>

<h2>            change size of GIF picture to fit into the image control</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;am using an image control to display graphs. These graphs different Width / Height values. Is there a way to fit these graph ( with different dimensions) onto the image control without loosing any part of the&nbsp;picture (something like&nbsp; reducing size when
 the picture is larger than image control and fitting the picture into the control when it is smaller than the image control).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<u>I</u> tried using Image.PictureSizeMode&nbsp; = fmPictureSizeModeClip but it did not work.<br />

            <p>I don't think Image controls on userforms have scroll bars.&nbsp; To do this, I would create a Frame control.&nbsp; Set the ScrollHeight and ScrollWidth of the frame to equal the dimenssions of the image (see here:
<a href="http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/showthread.php?t=292134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/showthread.php?t=292134</a>&nbsp;to get the dims of the image).</p>
<p>In the frame, add an image control, and make the size of that image control the same as the picture.&nbsp; Set the Left and Top properties of the Image control to zero (in the frame).</p>
<p>User should then be able to scroll around the image using the scrollbars of the frame.&nbsp; You could add other buttons to enable zooming, but you'd need to keep the frame's scroll hight&amp;width the same as the image control's height and width.</p>
<p>You also need to set the frame's ScrollBars property to frmScrollBarsBoth.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

<h2>            using excel to track a stock quote daily &#38; with historical data</h2>
                    Background: I am trying to create an Excel spreadsheet that will house the price of a certain stock since a new CEO was appointed. This appointment happened fairly recently, so I want to load all the daily prices since he started on 1 September AND I would
 like the spread sheet to get a daily update with the closing price on a going forward basis.

<div>I've seen some tutorials illustrating one or the other, but am having trouble combining these data sets.</div>

            I was able to figure it out. I used the Data-&gt;From Web tabs, used Yahoo Finance and clicked on the Historical Quote. I configured the Properties to refresh when open or automatically. Today, I open the excel book, and it was updated to reflect the stock's
 most recent closing price.

<h3> nicholasrehn-debraal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why outlook changes the send from email address when I reply, reply-all, and forward from the email address that received the email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 e-mail address set up in my outlook, and I recently did a software update and now when I reply, reply, or forward an e-mail Outlook on its own will change the e-mail address that I am sending from.&nbsp; See example below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>E-Mail 1 (default)&nbsp;</p>
<p>E-Mail 2</p>
<p>E-Mail 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I receive an e-mail to E-Mail 1 or 2, and I want to reply or forward, Outlook will automatically change the send from e-mail address to E-Mail 3.&nbsp; If I receive an e-mail to E-Mail 1 or 2, and I want to reply all, Outlook will automatically change the
 sent from e-mail address to E-Mail 3, and it adds the original e-mail address (E-Mail 1 or 2) to the list of send to e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though E-Mail account 1 is set as default it will change the send from e-mail account to E-Mail 3, if I am trying to reply, etc.</p>

    <title>Configuring webserver to use smtp for account with mx record pointing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesseedenreign  say:</h3>
<h2>            Configuring webserver to use smtp for account with mx record pointing to live.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>A few years ago, I signed up for my personal domain to use live/hotmail as the mail server. So let's say my domain is xyz.com. The MX record is pointing to live.com and everything is working just fine with my Outlook clients and phone, etc... I configure
 all these devices as one would for Hotmail.com and it works great.</p>
<p>The problem occurs as I'm trying to direct&nbsp;an installed service on my WordPress site to use smtp.live.com to send e-mails. The following are the settings I'm using:</p>
<p>Enable SMTP: Yes</p>
<p>SMTP host/port: smtp.live.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Port: 587</p>
<p>Protocol: TSL</p>
<p>Authentication: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Password: [correctpassword]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every combination of ports 25/587 and ssl/tsl/no protocol and every time I get the same result: SMTP -&gt; ERROR: Failed to connect to server: Connection timed out (110)SMTP connect() failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a totally separate server that I'm doing this same type of thing on, except it's using my actual outlook.com account instead of an account which is pointing to live.com via mx record redirection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just not a possibility or is there a different port I should be using for this particular scenario?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone? </p>
<p>Thanks!!!</p>

            <p>I have also set up a FreeNAS server at home and am encountering the same problem when setting the e-mail settings for the root user.</p>
<p>The error I'm getting when sending the test message is:</p>
<p>"Your test email could not be sent: Connection unexpectedly closed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this seems to eliminate the possibility that the problem is on the part of my webhosting&nbsp;company (in the first example).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, same settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>smtp.live.com</p>
<p>port 587</p>
<p>TLS</p>
<p>Using SMTP authentication with correct username/password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the middle of writing this message, I checked the account to make sure my password was correct, and found this in my inbox:</p>
Hello Hotmail User,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We noticed some unusual activity in your Outlook.com account. To help protect you, we've temporarily blocked your account."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I got that unblocked. So I can't smtp send from my own website? Is this something that can be unblocked since I'm the legitimate user of the account?</p>

            <p>OK - another update. Somehow overnight, the FreeNAS thing began working. So that's a good sign. The original issue with my WP site remains, however. It's a different account, but the same domain, etc. As far as I can tell, all the setting are exactly the
 same between the two servers except for which account I'm sending from. And I've confirmed on multiple attempts that the account and password are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just changed the credentials on the WP to match those of the FreeNAS that DID work, and the test message still didn't go through. So I'm starting to wonder if the problem is with the WP plugin. Will be looking into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>...looks like this is just going to be an online documentation of my discovery process since I'm not hearing anything from anyone else. lol</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let us help you on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having trouble sending emails on your website. It's possible that the SMTP address you're using is incorrect. Try using smtp-mail.outlook.com instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what you'll find.</p>

            <p>That didn't work either. I'm guessing it's something at the hosting site - a firewall blocking those ports to discourage&nbsp;spam operations or something. I'm giving up and am just going to set up a separate mail server on my own subdomain.</p>
<p>Thanks for your input.</p>
<p>If anyone ever reads this who is experiencing the same issue, and eventually finds an answer, please feel free to post said answer here; I'd be curious to know what you found out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I found that in my case with a similar issue the problem was that Microsoft was blocking the connection. &nbsp;i received an email from MS saying they were seeing unusual activity on my account. I logged into MS and clicked the this was me button and everything

    <title>Hard Reset a E65 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adelaros  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Reset a E65</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I upgraded my e65 to the latest firmware and installed all my software back. I decided to boot the phone and when it restarted it will not go past the NOKIA screen. After a while the screen just goes blank.<br />
<br />
I try many things, like form example this guide i found:<br />
<br />
If you encounter situation like below on your phone,<br />
1. Blank screen phone unable to reboot.<br />
2. Phone only able to boot-up to "Nokia" word screen.<br />
3. Install some program but not able to uninstall it after that.<br />
4. Unable to delete unwanted files on C drive.<br />
<br />
Do a Full phone formatting on your phone! as steps below,<br />
<br />
<br />
Switch-off your phone.<br />
<br />
Press and hold 3 keys; Green dial key, * Star key, no. 3 key on keypad and then press the power on/off to switch on the phone.<br />
<br />
Remember, do not let go the 3 press and hold keys until you see a formatting word screen show!<br />
<br />
After a few minutes when the Full phone formatting completed, your 6600 will back to original system and factory setting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any new thing i can try??

            keep pressing the edit key and turn on ur mobile (keep pressing<br />
<br />
to start ur phone is the safe mode<br />
<br />
then do a hard reset using this code *#7370# (ALL DATA WILL BE DELETED)<br />
<br />
<br />
if this way did not work go to the nearest nokia care point.

            Hope this helps as it worked on my E65.<br />
I was configuring a few E-65’s for push mail with exchange, all but one were on the same network and built one did a backup using the Nokia software tool and restored all the others, all worked fine apart from the odd network unit.<br />
<br />
The error I would get was. “Phone start-up failed. Contact the retailer”<br />
<br />
I was able to access the phone very limited by continually pressing the red/hang-up key but not while the sim was in the phone.<br />
You need the sim to reinstall the firmware.<br />
<br />
So from powered off. Insert SIM card, press the pencil key on the side of the phone, power on the phone, and keep the pencil key down until phone boots to a form off “safe mode” and you should be able to reinstall the firmware bringing the phone back to life.<br />

            Intention behind this message - owners of an E65 who get the message "Phone start-up failed. Contact the retailer" can work around it.<br />
<br />
Solution is from point 8 onwards.<br />
<br />
Sequence of events:<br />
1. Purchased an E65 off e-bay, phone locked to Orange(UK).<br />
2. Decided to unlock it as I am a T-Mobile subscriber<br />
3. Took it to gsm-support, they had to downgrade the firmware and unlock.<br />
4. They then had to upgrade the firmware as the phone hung at start up. Upgraded to 2.0633.62.03<br />
5. Being the weekend, installed apps like Fring etc<br />
6. Decided to upgrade to Nokia's latest firmware as per site - 2.0633.65.01<br />
7. Took a backup of Phone memory to memory card and upgraded to 2.0633.65.01. NB: Upgrade was fine and successful.<br />
8. Restore of settings from memory card to phone memory screwed things up. Phone kept getting stuck at "Phone start-up failed. Contact the retailer"<br />
9. Panicked - came across solution to keep hitting the "end call" (Red) button while switching phone on.<br />
10. This took the phone in to offline mode, deleted installed apps (Fring etc)<br />
11. Ran the command *#7370# from safe mode and accepted to flash.<br />
12. Phone has come back to life since, have had to restore all user data.<br />
<br />
Had been worried for a while, as the retailed (Orange) would have charged for services.

            My solution.<br />
<br />
I finally got the phone to work.<br />
<br />
I had to flash the phone with a earlier version of the OS.

<h2>            PC does not start up after windows 10 reset failure</h2>
                    Been having problems with windows 10 since upgrading from windows 7. Primarily the PC kept crashing and eventually Outlook failed to work. A reinstall of Office proved it was an issue with windows 10. Created a media USB and reinstalled windows 10. Continued
 to have occasional crash issues but Outlook now functioned properly. Then had a PC crash resulting in error message "Operating system not found". Restarted PC and decided to run a Windows reset. All went well until I got an almost there message when I noticed
 the hard drive was no longer spinning. Looking on the internet I was advised to wait 24 hours. I did but no change and the PC was in effect frozen. Turned off PC and tried to turn it on again but the hard drive will spin for about 2 seconds before shutting
 down. It seems that Windows 10 has effectively killed my laptop. Any ideas? I have a media key but as the PC will not start not sure this will help.

<p>I am trying to help another insider long distance who also has a dead PC from about 3 builds back.&nbsp; That PC just does not see the O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every PC should have the option to enter BIOS and then load an O/S from either a bootable USB or DVD.&nbsp; We have tried both methods but have been unable to get a functioning PC.&nbsp; It seems to fail as not seeing the disk partitions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS option may be your best bet.&nbsp; It is the only choice if you cannot get to an O/S.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is really just like a newly built PC with no O/S and the new O/S can only get there through BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is likely that you are well versed in BIOS and how to get there.&nbsp; There are a lot of posts on clean installs, etc.&nbsp; Your best bet is to post more data about your system and then the help can be better directed.</p>

    <title>My outlook won&#39;t send emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edking_892  say:</h3>
<h2>            My outlook won&#39;t send emails</h2>
                    I have been trying to send an email for the last few days using outlook. I've tried a new email and copying the address in there as well as replying to previous emails but everytime it just says delivery failure notification but doesn't say why. I can
 recieve and open emails but not send them. I can't add the person to contact lists because i have a tablet which doesn't let me add contacts for some reason. Tried installing outlook app but it says it can't authenticate my details, and i've tried syncing
 it with another account which again doesn't work, and to further add to the annoyance, on my other account i can't open emails people reply to so again it's useless.
<div>Any help greatly appreciated.</div>

<h2>            Excel array formula - leave blank instead of 0</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create an array formula to pull rows from a table based on whether or not the cell in a certain column is blank. I successfully created the formula, but when I drag down and it runs out of rows to pull, it leaves a 0. I'd like it to just be
 blank if there's no data. How can I accomplish this? Here is the formula so far:</p>
<p>
=INDEX(A:A,<br />
&nbsp; SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",$I$1:$I$2271)),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ROW($I$1:$I$2271),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MAX(ROW($I$1:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1))

            There's several ways to go about it. The first is a bit cumbersome because your formula is long:
<br />=IF(INDEX(A:A,
<br />SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",$I$1:$I$2271)),
<br />ROW($I$1:$I$2271),
<br />MAX(ROW($I$1:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1))=0,"",=INDEX(A:A,
<br />SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",$I$1:$I$2271)),
<br />ROW($I$1:$I$2271),
<br />MAX(ROW($I$1:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1)))
<br />
<br />Another alternative is to custom format the cells in the column to display zeroes as blank. Select the column, right-click &gt; Format cells &gt; Custom
<br />Use the custom format 0;-0;;@
<br />
<br />You could also base an IF statement on the value in another cell - presumably it returns zero when the corresponding cell in columns A or I become blank? So use
<br />something like =IF(I5="","",=INDEX(A:A,
<br />SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",$I$1:$I$2271)),
<br />ROW($I$1:$I$2271),
<br />MAX(ROW($I$1:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1)))       
        </p>

</p><blockquote>There's several ways to go about it. The first is a bit cumbersome because your formula is long:
<br />
=IF(INDEX(A:A, <br />
SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",$I$1:$I$2271)), <br />
ROW($I$1:$I$2271), <br />
MAX(ROW($I$1:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1))=0,"",=INDEX(A:A, <br />
SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",$I$1:$I$2271)), <br />
ROW($I$1:$I$2271), <br />
MAX(ROW($I$1:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1))) <br />
<br />
Another alternative is to custom format the cells in the column to display zeroes as blank. Select the column, right-click &gt; Format cells &gt; Custom
<br />
Use the custom format 0;-0;;@ <br />
<br />
You could also base an IF statement on the value in another cell - presumably it returns zero when the corresponding cell in columns A or I become blank? So use
<br />
something like =IF(I5="","",=INDEX(A:A, <br />
SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",$I$1:$I$2271)), <br />
ROW($I$1:$I$2271), <br />
MAX(ROW($I$1:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1))) </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, the custom formatting worked!!! Now I've run into a new problem. I wanted to move the array table to a separate sheet and when I did, somehow the whole thing broke. Now it's just returning #NUM! and #REF! even though I updated the formula with the
 new cell ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
=INDEX(Sheet1!B:B,<br />
&nbsp; SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("true",Sheet1!$I$2:$I$2271)),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ROW(Sheet1!$I$2:$I$2271),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MAX(ROW(Sheet1!$I$2:$I$2271))+1),ROW()-1))

            Another thing to check - in moving it to a separate sheet are the formulas still array formulas? Click on a cell containing a formula and in the formula bar check that the formula is still surrounded by braces { and }. If not, click in the formula bar to edit it and type CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. If you do this for one you can probably then drag and/or copy-paste the formula to all the others.

It was broke the screen ( and the touchscreen ) of the Lumia, and my friend asked me if I can save all his photos on a usb key, but there is a password in the lockscreen, so my PC don't see anything : considering that Windows Phone don't support OTG ( at least
 not natively like Android ) I can't unlock the phone. There is no one way to insert the password via PC? Maybe with a tool? Sorry for my bad english.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>The only way is if the contents of the feed folders sync up to outlook.com and in my experience, the folders used for RSS are not synced up to the server. You'll need to subscribe to RSS feeds directly on your phone.

                    <p>My daughters laptop was reset to its factory settings resulting in MS office being removed. &nbsp;How do I 're-share' my Office365 subscription with her? &nbsp;I'm reluctant to remove her subscription in case she loses all of the data in OneDrive. &nbsp;I have de-activiated
 the install, not sure if that was the right thing to do or not now. &nbsp;I can't find a way of resending the invite to install MsOffice to her, I can only remove her subscription, not manage it.</p>
<p>

<p>My daughter doesn't live with us, I am thinking a weekend trip to see her is the way to go here though.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to be in the same situation if either daughter ever changes their laptop in the future too, I'll have to visit them to do the re-install (or talk them through logging on with my account details). &nbsp;At least this daughter lives in the same
 country as me :)</p>

            <p>This is a known issue and there is registry key to fix it. Using RegEdit, navigate to:<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Excel\Options]<br />
Add a new DWORD value:<br />
QFE_Boston<br />
Set the new DWORD value to 1.</p>

    <title>Cannot edit calendar in outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot edit calendar in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to edit personal and shared calendars in outlook <strong>online</strong>. Clicking edit series or edit occurrence results in it trying to open a dialogue box. The dialogue box never opens fully. It sits there with circling blue dots. I've
 tried on multiple machines using IE, Edge, Chrome and FF dev edition. All are Windows 10 boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also noticed the following. If I open my <strong>personal</strong> outlook calendar online (without any shared calendars showing) then I
<strong>can</strong> edit existing events and create new ones. If I then add a shared calendar to the view (e.g. a family calendar) I can still edit personal events. But, as soon as I try to edit an event from the shared calendar it fails. As soon as it has
 failed on the shared calendar I am then unable to edit or create any events on the personal calendar. This is true even if I remove the shared calendar from the view. Removing the shared calendar and then refreshing the page allows me to edit personal events
 again. It seems that something in the shared calendar is breaking some of the page functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi
<strong>Mike</strong>,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue could be due to conflicts with the shared calendar. It can also be an account related concern. As what was mentioned, you’ve already tried
 multiple machines, different web browsers and you’ve encountered the same issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I’ve replicated your concern using an Outlook account and accessed it through Outlook.com as well. On my end, I was able to edit the calendar event that
 I’ve created right after clicking on it and then the dialogue box did appear. This is what I’ve got:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e36c3cf1-4292-4fb7-88c3-a894ee3221eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e36c3cf1-4292-4fb7-88c3-a894ee3221eb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dd04064-d090-472c-8857-c6814360db12?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dd04064-d090-472c-8857-c6814360db12?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In line with your concern, since you’re unable to edit a calendar event as the dialogue box never opens and you’re unable to edit an event directly from
 a shared calendar, we’ll try some steps to have this isolated. You may perform the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check the
<strong>Microsoft Online Services status</strong> </span></span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></span></strong></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.
 This will determine if there’s an on-going issue on your area that may affect this action.</span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have another
<strong>Microsoft account</strong> or <strong>Outlook.com</strong> account, you may try creating a calendar event and edit it after to check if the dialogue box from that account will appear. This will isolate if the issue with the dialogue box that never opens
 also happens to the other account that you’ll access on your end.</span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the shared calendar in your account is shared to by another person, you may have them double-check if you have the
<strong>full permission</strong> to edit that calendar. Then, have them <strong>re-share</strong> the calendar to your account and see if you’ll get the same issue.</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
