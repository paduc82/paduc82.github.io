<h2>            Touch Screen Remains Active Upon Closing Lid While Using Docking Station</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for some help with my Samsung Laptop (NP680Z5E) running Windows 10. While the lid is closed, when using the docking station (StarTech #USB3SDOCKDD) my cursor starts jumping around my two external monitors. The issue here, despite the laptop display
 being disabled, is that the touchscreen remains active. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed this to be the issue by hooking up a coworker's laptop to the same docking station and the issue was not duplicated. Also, I have gone ahead and disabled the HID Touchscreen driver on my machine and the issue has resolved as well. Obviously,
 I don't want to have to enable/disable the touchscreen driver every time I hook up and disconnect the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suffice to say, this is certainly a software issue on the Windows Platform or a driver issue with Samsung. I have no idea where to begin but certainly need some direction.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We recommend following these methods to resolve the issue you're experiencing with your Windows 10 device:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check for Windows 10 updates.</strong></p>
<p>Here is an <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3159635/windows-10-update-assistant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> where you can find information on how to make sure that you're on the latest Windows 10 build.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update the drivers&nbsp; for both your docking station and display adapters for your device.</strong>We recommend doing an
<strong>Automatic driver update</strong> which lets Windows 10 download the driver for you. Here is an
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for instructions. We also recommend doing a<strong> Manual driver update</strong>
 where you look for the device's driver ID and download it from the manufacturer's website. Follow JMH's instruction on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">article</a></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the methods helped.</p>

            <p>Ian,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried these methods. Actually, I've stripped my machine back to factory settings (Windows 8) to test if the issue existed, and it did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I proceeded to upgrade to Windows 10 V.1607 (most current) and the issue is still persisting. I've checked the drivers, and that too is the latest available according to the automated Windows search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to use a silly work around of disabling the HID Touchscreen driver every time I hook up my laptop to the docking station. Cumbersome and certainly unnecessary. I am certain this issue is not pertaining to the docking station as well, as my coworker
 has the same model laptop as mine (though 2 years newer) and the issue does not occur on his machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for a solution as this is certainly a nuisance. Thank you for your help :)</p>

<div><strong>Problems with touch screens and DisplayLink technology</strong></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>DisplayLink do not provide the touch screen technology or drivers on products containing DisplayLink technology.

<p>
</p><p>For issues with touch screen drivers, please contact the product manufacturer.</p>

            <p>I spoke with them two days ago, they insist this is a Windows issue. Their tech hopped on my laptop and had zero success.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>In reading some other forums, it seems other manufacturers have had the same issue as well, but nobody has encountered a solid solution, just a bunch of work arounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tried the Safe Mode as well. I was unable to use the docking station while in safe mode, so I opened up a blank MS Paint page and shut my lid.

<p>

            <p>Do you know what type of touch screen is used on your laptop (capacitive or resistive)? If it is resistive, you are just dealing with the nature of the beast and need to accept that your particular laptop may not be suitable for the noted usage. If it is
 capacitive, you need to ask yourself why the screen is being activated without the presence of a human body part (finger) acting as an electrical conductor, touching the surface of the screen resulting in a distortion of the screen's electrostatic field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Capacitive touch screens are sensitive to EFI/RFI. It is possible your particular laptop is leaking EFI/RFI beyond design specs and can be fixed. Perhaps a keyboard replacement is indicated or additional shielding can be placed under the keyboard.</p>

<h2>            Driver Power State Failure &#38; Video Dxgkrnl Fatal Error BSODs during and after Windows 10 v1809 update</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I decided to update my Asus laptop from Windows 10 v1803 to Windows 10 v1809. My update got interrupted by driver Power State Failure &amp; Video Dxgkrnl Fatal Error BSODs a several times. After rebooting and reinstalling windows several times, I finally succeed
 to install Windows 10 v1809 but I keep getting those BDODs. I googled online and tried almost everything such as deleting drivers using DDU and reinstalling them (from windows itself and the manufacture), sfc /scannow (which says:&nbsp;Windows Resource Protection
 did not find any integrity violations.) and I even did a system recovery, which installed a clean windows 10 v1809. I restarted my pc 3 times (2 days so a total of 6 times) after the system recovery to see if the bsods is still happening and it was not I thought
 it was finally fixed, but sadly it is not. Yesterday my laptop rebooted itself after I let my laptop on standby/sleep mode and today I got the bsods again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am out of solutions. Any help would be appreciated!<br />

            Hi. JC_SR
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Apparently the problem is in the Nvidia Video drivers, try to update the Video drivers. If this does not work, then you have to try previous versions of that driver.
<br />Check these drivers, I hope it helps.
<br />In Download Location download the corresponding according to operating system.

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Fen Star.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See here for how to remove Microsoft Family:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10555/microsoft-account-remove-members-from-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10555/...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then I suggest you speak with the Family representative here who will respond to thread Comments and also gives his Twitter handle:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security-winpc/troubleshooting-family-safety-features-in-windows/29533738-5766-4ba5-881c-c588e45201dc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            That link tells me how to remove family members. I don't want to remove family members. I don't even have the feature activated. I just want to remove the feature so I don't get popups. I use a local account, not an online one. Again, the links you gave
 are for managing a family account. I do not have, and am not linked to, a family account. I simply want to remove the family account services and related popups.

            I gave you that link so that you knew how to get to the Family controls to check and if necessary remove them in case someone had set them and you weren't aware.  
<br />
<br />But since you said you hadn't I also gave you a direct link to the key representative for Microsoft Family to contact him directly in a thread he monitors, and even mentioned his Twitter address is there too if you want that.  
<br />
<br />You're welcome.

<p>I have posted on that thread at your suggestion, but I should note that it is for "Troubleshooting family safety features in Windows 10." As I am not having trouble with the features of the family safety, and given that your first link seemed to ignore what
 I had originally posted, I was under the impression that you had not actually read my post and that posting on that thread would be inappropriate.</p>

            I help people by the thousands in forums for over ten years, and everyone who works politely and cooperatively with me gets there problem fixed.  There is nothing I will not do to help someone and I have unlimited resources to call upon as an 8-year MVP which is the highest award in the tech field for doing this.  
<br />
<br />Instead of trying to find fault with my approach to your problem, why not redirect that energy into the steps I suggested.
<br />
<br />There is no possibility that it would impose family controls if none were set.  That's why I suggested to go over the settings closely in case something was inadvertently set or set by someone else.  
<br />
<br />If not then we have a very rare case here where one of the top developers is accessible and I gave you the way to contact him directly, something which would happen in only about one out of every million help posts in a forums.

(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to
<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take
<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Stop updating the Xbox dashboard. This one is complete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brokentwinblade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop updating the Xbox dashboard. This one is complete &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;.</h2>
                    <p>This new Xbox dashboard update is the worst to have been released so far. It is implemented so many more steps to do anything. &nbsp;The new dashboard layout has made it so much harder and annoying to do simple things. For example, I can't used to hit the Xbox home button and press the up arrow to see which of my friends are on and what they are playing. Now I have to go through an extra two steps just to see what my friends are playing. That's just a simple task. All this new update does is slow down my ability to search for anything. In or to the new xbox dashboard layout I see complicated, annoying and confusing. They should at least implement an option to choose what dashboard you want to use.</p>

            <p>I agree. This update was supposed to make things "Stream lined" but all it did was make things more difficult to do. Guide is absolutely horrible now and not even aesthetically pleasing to look at.</p><p><br /></p><p>The xbox UI team is changing things we're used to too much and making them terrible. Even voice commands were stripped making everything controller manual and making the kinect beyond obsolete.<br /></p>

    <title>Update for Windows 7 &#40;KB2952664&#41;&#47;Upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wfb2362  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update for Windows 7 &#40;KB2952664&#41;&#47;Upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi all,</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've just received and installed Windows 7 update KB2952664 which is described as "a compatibility update to improve the upgrade experience to&nbsp; the latest version of Windows".</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Does this mean I should now be able to successfully complete the reserved upgrade of my Sony VGN-FW21L laptop from Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit (originally Vista) to Windows 10 Pro?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Up till now and since the November update (version 1511 - 10586 - 2032.8 MB) was released and I received confirmation (via the GWX notification icon) that my laptop PC is compatible, I must have attempted the upgrade at least a
 dozen times with the same negative result each time. The upgrade always stops at 32% (installing features and drivers 6%) for up to 24 hours and I then have to&nbsp; force the laptop&nbsp; to close down, reboot and subsequently revert to Windows 7 again.&nbsp; As far as
 I'm aware all my drivers are as up to date as they can be and I've tried virtually every suggestion that I've come across in this community using both the Windows update and Media creation tool options with exactly the same result each time. Everything comes
 to a halt when the upgrade reaches 32%!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The only suggestion I haven't yet tried, before re-attempting the upgrade, is to run (as an administrator) the command line:-</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>This command will not actually run because PNPCLEAN.DLL does not appear to&nbsp; be present in my C:\windows\system32 folder! Where does this
 DLL come from and what does it do? Is it possible for Microsoft&nbsp; to supply a genuine copy?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard">In any case, IMHO, users should not have to "jump&nbsp; through hoops"&nbsp; to get the upgrade installed. Given that Microsoft
 wants everybody to upgrade to Windows 10 as soon as possible why&nbsp; have they made it so difficult? Surely it must be possible for them to include routines in their upgrade program that take care of all such problems? Researching the internet seems to indicate
 that this is quite a common problem for many laptop users so I can't understand why&nbsp; Microsoft seem to be dragging their heels over the matter.
<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">For now, I'm reluctant to&nbsp; try the upgrade again until&nbsp; I feel reasonably certain that KB2952664 will help. Can anybody give me any guidance about this or offer any other suggestions? I'd hate to think&nbsp; that my only option will
 be to download the Windows 10 ISO file,&nbsp; install it, losing all of my favourite programs and precious data and starting all over again! If this is the only way the upgrade can be done, then I think it would be better for me to stick with W7 for a few more

            <p>OK Jayant</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already seen and tried pretty much everything mentioned in your reply (except, of course, the clean install of Windows 10), including all the tips from Andre Da Costa, but without success so far. However, I will read through everything and try again
 in the coming days/weeks just in case I missed anything and will let you know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still of the opinion that Microsoft hasn't yet done anywhere near enough to make the upgrade as simple and seamless as possible; although I read in the press today that hard work is currently in progress to improve things in this respect before the free
 upgrade deadline at the end of July.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep&nbsp; my fingers crossed and hope that there will be some good news on this front well before the deadline!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be in touch with further (and, hopefully, good) news as soon as I've had time to re-visit all of your suggestions and attempt the upgrade again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I've already tried&nbsp; running the command line&nbsp; SFC /SCANNOW as an administrator and no integrity violations were found. However, PNPCLEAN.DLL still seems to&nbsp; be missing from my system. Is there any other way I can obtain or recover a genuine
 copy of this file?</p>

            <p>Hi<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay in replying to your recent email reminder about this post. Because of other commitments, I've not had much time to continue testing the Windows 10 upgrade until a couple of days ago.<br />
<br />
I attempted the upgrade again re-using several of the previous suggestions from&nbsp; Andre Da Costa but, unfortunately, the result was still the same. The upgrade process stopped at 32% (Installing features and drivers 6%) and, as before, after waiting for any
 further signs of activity for several hours, I had no alternative but to reboot the computer and revert to Windows 7 yet again. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>I incorporated many of Andre's suggestions before starting the upgrade after which I chose the "Start download, upgrade later"&nbsp; option from the GWX notification icon. After the download had completed, I accepted the license agreement and set the upgrade
 phase to begin 2 hours later. I then shut down the computer temporarily whilst I was away for an hour or so. However, after restarting, the upgrade DID NOT begin at the previously scheduled time. I therefore opened "Windows Update" where I was prompted to
 finish off the installation by re-starting the computer. I did so and then the upgrade continued as expected until, as mentioned above, it stopped again at 32%.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Several hours later, when I reverted to Windows 7, Windows Update was, and still is, prompting me to restart the computer to finish off the installation again! I have also downloaded and run the "Windows Update" troubleshooter (</strong><strong>WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab)</strong><strong>
 but this made no difference. I'm still being regularly prompted to restart but I'm very wary of doing so in case the whole abortive process starts all over again. Can someone please let me know what I can do to rectify this?</strong><br />
<br />
To be perfectly honest, my feeling now is that after so many unsuccessful attempts, although I would obviously like to take advantage of the free upgrade, my best course of action would be to stay with Windows 7 (with which I have been perfectly happy) for
 a few more years until I need to get a new PC.<br />
<br />
<strong>It also strikes me that many, if not all, of the preparatory steps that I took before the beginning the upgrade could and should have been anticipated by Microsoft with appropriate work around routines being built into the upgrade process to&nbsp; make life
 easier for everyone.&nbsp; Will Microsoft actually be doing anything about this before the deadline date in July this year?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am by no means an expert but have been using computers for over 25 years (going&nbsp; back&nbsp; as far as the MS-DOS era) and therefore consider myself to&nbsp; be reasonably computer literate. Even so,&nbsp; unlike previous Windows versions, I found the overall upgrading
 experience to be quite daunting. Far too many of the preparatory steps could go wrong with potentially disastrous consequences. With all the resources that Microsoft have available, surely more time could have been spent in anticipating problems before the
 upgrade was released. I dread to think how&nbsp; less experienced users will cope. This situation cannot be doing much to enhance Microsoft's reputation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think it might be worthwhile, I will put together the sequence of events that I followed during my last upgrade attempt in the hope that somebody might be able to suggest if/where things may have gone wrong and/or additional&nbsp; steps that could be incorporated
 in the upgrade routine (ideally by Microsoft).&nbsp; At the moment, I am&nbsp; reluctant to make any more attempts (each of which wastes several hours) until I feel more confident of success.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Lastly, as I mentioned&nbsp; in my first post, before attempting the upgrade, I tried to run (as an administrator) the suggested command line:-</strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN</span></strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>This command would not actually run because PNPCLEAN.DLL does not appear to&nbsp; be present in my C:\windows\system32 folder! Where does this DLL come from and what does it do (it's absence does not appear to otherwise
 affect the day to&nbsp; day running of my PC)? Is it possible for Microsoft&nbsp; to supply a genuine copy?
</span></strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Save your pictures, documents, and other personal stuff on extern harddisk and USB-stick</strong> before going Windows 10, (Or trying to...) Because MANY users have lost EVERYTHING when upgraded to Windows 10!! And remember, saving your stuff onextern

<p>
</p><p>What browser do you use now? Internet Explorer, Firefox or other? If these, you can export the Favorites to a file, and save this on USB-stick. If Google Chrome, and you have a gmail, you simply log on Google Chrome when upgrading is finished.</p>
<p>

            <p>OK Micael</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; make a point of taking a full backup onto an external hard drive every week and ALWAYS before attempting any major system changes as I did in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For good measure, I also made a system image on DVD in case it w2as needed for recovery/repair purposes. My default browser is Firefox and I use the free CloneApp tool to backup my program settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avast is my anti virus program which I fully uninstalled(using Avast's own uninstall utility) before the installation phase of the upgrade process. However, I didn't deactivate Windows Defender because I assumed. rightly or wrongly. that Microsoft's upgrade
 routine would be aware of that automatically.&nbsp; If my assumption is incorrect then I'd be amazed that Microsoft didn't include it (it is their own program after all!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I'll make a note of this for when/if I attempt the upgrade again although I'll still need a lot of convincing that it would be worth my while. As I've said before, I find it unbelievable that Microsoft expect users to jump through so many hoops
 to&nbsp; get the upgrade done when most, if not all, of the preliminary steps could and surely should be built into their upgrade routine.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks again Micael</p>
<p>
</p><p>If what you say is true, it really is unbelievable that Microsoft's own program (Windows Defender) could be responsible for all these installation problems and that nothing appears to have been said or done by Microsoft to implement a work-around in their
 upgrade routine to&nbsp; deal&nbsp; with this or any of the other reported issues!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp; be perfectly honest, I've never been a fan of Defender in Windows 7 anyway. It seems to&nbsp; me to offer only minimal protection and I was considering uninstalling and replacing it with either SuperAntiSpyware or SpywareBlaster. Are either of these likely
 to cause a problem with Windows 10 too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice about potential Avast problems with Windows 10. I have used Avast for several&nbsp; years. I think it is one of the best anti-virus programs and will be very sorry to lose it. Is there anything else you can recommend in its place?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I pluck up enough courage to attempt the upgrade again, I'll let you know what happens but I think I will wait a little while to&nbsp; see if any of my other questions are answered before I feel confident enough to do so.</p>

            <p>When buying a new PC, or reinstalling the old one, Windows Defender is better than absolutely nothing, until we get another antivirusprogram on it - if just it's being updated!! And antispywareprograms isn't ANTIVIRUS-programs. But we need to get rid of
 the McAfee-garbage, and Norton-trial, if or rather WHEN installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8, and never, Windows Defender is upgraded to be an antivirusprogram - perhaps, that's why it isn't good i Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>AVG runs on Windows 10 - and you don't have to get an account, and get the program registered, like you do with Avast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't uninstall Windows Defender - it will only automatic get deactivated, when throwing another antivirusprogram on it - if the other antivirus works correctly. I am now using a paid program - BullGuard - and only using Windows Firewall - not BullGuards.
 And I don't use the online back up in BullGuard, because this is some Bull**** <strong>
:-D</strong>&nbsp;(I have only tested it) Only the Antivirus-feature is used! When backing up my personal stuff, I only use the good, old Copy / Paste-way. This method have NEVER let me down for years!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antispyware-programs or Malwares Anti Malware can be installed but only use the free ones, so you don't have 2 programs with Realtime-protection - this will slow down the computer. I don't know anything about the programs, you mentioned, but check their
 websites, for the specifications. Forgot SuperAntiSpyware... I HAVE tried that, but I got problems with it after some time, so I uninstalled it. When used it, I couldn't shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it wass me, I will prefer, buying a new computer with Windows 10 installed from the factory, instead of upgrading my old Compaq 615-wreck, and not use the free upgrade, where I will have to "pay" hours and tears for getting it up and only HOPEFULLY running.</p>

            <p>Hi Micael</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in the UK, for the last few years, Kaspersky has been rated as the best paid for Antivirus program with Avast being the best free antivirus program.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, when my current PC was new, I immediately got rid of the preinstalled Norton trial and replaced it with Avast. I have been happy with Avast for many years and I'm truly disappointed to&nbsp; hear that&nbsp; it can cause problems with Windows 10.&nbsp; I hope
 Avast will put this right before too long.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, under Windows 7, Windows Defender can be used purely for anti-spyware. This is how it came with my PC. If I wanted to use it as an&nbsp; anti-virus program as well&nbsp; I would have to download the full Microsoft Security Essentials package. I've never used
 Windows 8 so I guess, as you say, for Windows 8 and newer it must have been upgraded to&nbsp; an uninstallable full antivirus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few years ago,&nbsp; I tried the full Microsoft Security Essentials package but I found that it slowed down my PC&nbsp; far too much so I uninstalled it and went back to Avast which was much much better. Similarly, I also tried AVG but this also slowed down my PC
 even more than MSE and, in any case, AVG have had quite bad press reviews recently. I don't know anything about BullGuard antivirus but I did try their anti-spam software a couple of years ago which caused a few problems and&nbsp; I had to uninstall that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Zone Alarm free firewall instead of Windows firewall and SyncBack Pro for scheduled backups. In my opinion, both of these programs are very good and have never caused me any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, like you, I also have Malwarebytes free anti-Malware program which I use to manually scan my PC once a month. Malwarebytes also have free Anti-Exploit and Anti-Rootkit (beta) tools which you might like to try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm sure you can imagine, uninstalling/deactivating all of these as well as trying all the other things recommended by Andre Da Costa and backing up everything before even attempting the Windows 10 upgrade is quite a chore; especially when each attempt
 is unsuccessful and you have to revert to Windows 7, reverse all the changes and reinstall everything again in order to carry on using the PC safely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certain that Microsoft should be able to find ways around most, if not all, of all this unnecessary hassle and build appropriate routines into the upgrade process that will maximize the chances of success for everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I'll be getting answers to my other questions soon so that I will feel confident enough to attempt the upgrade again. Preferably, Microsoft will be offering a much improved upgrade and installation update well before the free upgrade expiry date or,
 better still, extend the deadline for another year or so to&nbsp; allow them to&nbsp; get things right.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until then, as you say, it's probably better for me and probably many others to reluctantly wait for a few years until I need and can afford a new PC with Windows 10 already installed and thus avoid any more wasted time and frustrating effort&nbsp; in trying
 to get what should be a simple and straightforward free upgrade properly installed and working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>As promised and to keep&nbsp; you updated, I've attempted the upgrade to Windows 10 again since I was last in touch. Despite incorporating a few more options that I have learned about over the last week or two. I'm afraid I'm no further forward. As before , the
 upgrade routine restarts my PC at 30% but then stops at 32% (installing features and drivers 6%)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my last attempt yesterday, I used the Media Creation Tool but that did not make any difference. When I&nbsp; subsequently forced my PC to shut down and then reverted to&nbsp; Windows 7, I got the following message:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>0xC1900101 – 0x30018</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during SYSPREP operation.</span></strong></p>
<p>Does this give anyone more of a clue as to&nbsp; what may have gone wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'll now delay any more upgrade attempts until I feel more confident of a successful outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are still several as yet unanswered questions from my previous posts. For the sake of convenience, I'll repeat them below:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) During a previous upgrade attempt, I chose the "Start download, upgrade later"&nbsp; option from the GWX notification icon. After the download had completed, I accepted the license agreement and set the upgrade phase to begin 2 hours later. I then
 shut down the computer temporarily whilst I was away for an hour or so. However, after restarting, the upgrade DID NOT begin at the previously scheduled time. I therefore opened "Windows Update" where I was prompted to finish off the installation by re-starting
 the computer. I did so and then the upgrade continued as expected until, as mentioned above, it stopped again at 32%.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Several hours later, when I reverted to Windows 7, Windows Update was, and still is, prompting me to restart the computer to finish off the installation again! I have also downloaded and run the "Windows Update" troubleshooter (</strong><strong>WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab)</strong><strong>
 but this made no difference. I'm still being regularly prompted to restart but I'm very wary of doing so in case the whole abortive process starts all over again. Can someone please let me know what I can do to rectify this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) It also strikes me that many, if not all, of the preparatory steps that I took before the beginning the upgrade could and should have been anticipated by Microsoft with appropriate work around routines being built into the upgrade
 process to&nbsp; make life easier for everyone.&nbsp; Will Microsoft actually be doing anything about this before the deadline date in July this year?</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>3) Before attempting the upgrade, I tried to run (as an administrator) the suggested command line:-</strong>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN</span></strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>This command would not actually run because PNPCLEAN.DLL does not appear to&nbsp; be present in my C:\windows\system32 folder! Where does this DLL come from and what does it do (it's absence does not appear to otherwise
 affect the day to&nbsp; day running of my PC)? Is it possible for Microsoft&nbsp; to supply a genuine copy?
</span></strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            program priority keeps changing while running</h2>
                    <p>Why would a program's priority keep changing while it is running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set the program priority in Task Manager to 'normal' but it will change to &nbsp;'low'. I have observed this toggling while Task Manager is open and the program is running.</p>

<p>Getting error codes ever since the update came out on December 4. Pretty angry since I just bought 12 months of LIVE 2 weeks ago. Paid $60 and now I can't get online. Good work, Microsoft.</p>

<p>I'm in the same boat. </p>
<p>Connection test succeeds until the link from internet&gt;XBL. As soon as it gets to here it tells me an update's required, I agree to it and I get the error.</p>
<p>I've downloaded an unzipped the update to a USB drive, says it's extracting but nothing seems any diferent. I've also removed my profile to no avail.</p>
<p>I've reset the network settings to factory defaults, no joy.</p>
<p>Anyone have any other ideas?</p>

<p>start here, you need to click the box for which is your OS click next and go from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you do not need the cd, HP lets you install your printer online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. first uninstall your printer, preferably with their uninstall program, should be located in the program files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. disconnect your printer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. download the installation package to your desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. install and reconnect your printer when prompted to do so.</p>

 my Email address, because since I posted here I have gotten 20 spams including one with a microsoft official logo.<br />

<h2>            Canon Printer Pixma MG3650</h2>
                    I bought the above printer yesterday, and as hard as I try, I am unable to get the laptop to recognise the printer, and it is telling me that it is offline in my network, and I have no idea at all what to do. I have read so many articles, but am no further
 forward. Is anyone able to tell me please how I can get m wireless printer online. I have the printer plugged in, the wireless light is on...and still nothing. Each time I try to install it, it is telling that the laptop is unable to locate my printer...please
 help if you possibly can. Thanks....Lynn

<h2>            Gears Of War 3 disconnects constantly in multiplayer</h2>
                    
<p>I get disconnected constantly. I usually play horde mode but I think this has happened in every multiplayer mode I've tried. Of course I've been penalized for leaving. Basically, multiplayer is unplayable for me. &nbsp;This is the only game this has ever happened
 with for me in LIVE. I get the message something like "You have been disconnected from Xbox LIVE"</p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            BCD Error, cannot complete a repair.</h2>
                    I had a BOOT\BCD error 0xc000000e. I did make a recovery DVD but it has taken over 8 hours each time I let the system repair the startup. I takes an hout or so just to allow me the option. I tried a repair install from a Windows 7 DVD and I can't select
 upgrade for an option. Now the laptop freezes at the initial splash screen. How do I fix this without a clean install?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get this error message when you try to boot to desktop?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did try booting computer in safe mode?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When exactly do you get this error message?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to rebuild rebuild BCD (Boot Configuration Data) store and check for the issue. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the system recovery options mentioned in this article, select command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>Bootrec /RebuildBcd</b>, and then press ENTER. </span></p>
<p><span>If the Bootrec.exe tool runs successfully, it presents you with an installation path of a Windows directory. To add the
 entry to the BCD store, type Yes. A confirmation message appears that indicates the entry was added successfully.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the Bootrec.exe tool cannot locate any missing Windows installations, you must remove the BCD store, and then you must
 re-create it. To do this, type the following commands in the order in which they are presented. Press ENTER after each command.
</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>Bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup.</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old.</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><span>Bootrec /rebuildbcd.</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>

            I have a similiar problem. I get a BSOD when trying to boot but my SSD is healthy (tested in another computer). I can enter into Windows REpair mode and when I try the bootrec /rebuildbcd command, it always fail to locate a windows installation, even when
 I remove the BCD.

<p>For more clarification with loading your Windows 10 issue after sleep mode, we would like to know the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say "Checked all drivers and there are fine", did you update your drivers (e.g. video card driver)?</li><li>Have you tried connecting your laptop to an external monitor? If yes, what is the result?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply is most important to us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</p>

            so, I uninstall NVidia and intel graphic cards and I install them again, update all drivers. I scanned for corruption files , checked startup and all is fine. Why I should connect external monitor if this just happened after sleep mode ? boot from shutdown
 is ok &nbsp;

<p>We appreciate your response, Marcin. Since you have stated that you are getting a white screen with some colorful strips, we would like to isolate the issue by connecting your laptop to an external monitor. By doing this, we can determine if the issue is
 from the video card or the monitor itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 keeps asking for an administrator account.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please...My computer keeps asking me for an administrator password and I don't know what it is.&nbsp; I therefore cannot download anything to the hard drive.&nbsp; I am the only one in the home and must have done something to change things, but don't know what
 I did.&nbsp; It also says I have to sign on as an administrator, but even if I had the password...it doesn't give me that option.&nbsp; Can someone help me?&nbsp; This all happened after I downloaded windows 8.1.&nbsp; I have tried all the suggestions I've found posted and nothing
 helps.&nbsp; I'm happy to give you print screens, etc. so you can get the info on my computer just so someone can help me solve this problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me say it has nothing to do with getting things from the Store...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I want to download to the hard drive, other than the miscrosoft updates (automatically) will not download without the admin password.&nbsp; I've seen this problem posted all over the internet and I have done about everything I know of to do.&nbsp; Also, I
 don't know if this makes a difference or not, but for some reason, my account is a "guest account".&nbsp; Man oh man...I have no idea what I could have done.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know my password..it's this administrator password that it keeps asking me for, if I want to download anything to my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send any screen shots needed to help me solve this issue!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU,&nbsp; Maggie </p>

            If you set up a Microsoft Account, that is the password it is asking for not an admin password. A MS acct is needed to download anything from the Store. Could that be the problem?&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Maggie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for delay in reply. You may face this issue if Windows system files are corrupted. Follow these steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:
</strong>I would suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning
 and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also refer to this link:

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong>
The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would suggest you to run System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) and check if it helps. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted
 system files and repairs them.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Go to Start Page.
<br />
b) Type: CMD<br />
c) The Apps page will come up. <br />
d) Right click CMD.exe<br />
e) Click “Run as Administrator” on the bottom pane.<br />
f) If you get the User Account Control prompt. Click Yes to continue.<br />
g) At the Command Prompt, type: sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span>This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong><span> I would suggest you to boot into safe mode and check if you face similar issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 4</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>:</strong>

    <title>Sea of Thieves not appearing in insider hub - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hanabizero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sea of Thieves not appearing in insider hub</h2>
                    <p>I was emailed saying I have been invited to the Sea of Thieves technical alpha for PC, however, it hasn't shown up in my Insider Hub. I tried logging out of my account on all devices and logging back in. Then chatted with live technical support who suggested I post here. My computer is up to date. I double checked that the Times and Dates were accurate and also reset the windows store. The email says "It's time to install the <i>Sea of Thieves</i> Technical Alpha onto your Windows 10 PC. " So I know it's for the PC version.<br /></p>

            <p>I was having a similar issue, and the fix was, since I originally signed up for the alpha, I had changed the Gamertag associated with the email address I got my invite too.&nbsp;So I had to remember the Gamertag I used to register with, and find out which email is is now associated with, as I changed it since joining.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is happening to a number of people.&nbsp; I would suggest trying any and all MS accounts you have to see if any give you access. You can also sign in to the sea of thieves site here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seaofthieves.com/account</a>&nbsp; and it will tell you If you are an insider, and if you are invited to the technical alpha or not. Do you have more then one gamertag you have used at some point in&nbsp;the past? Do you have more then one MS account?&nbsp;</p>

It should be showing up in your Xbox Insider App. Are you launching the app on your windows 10 pc? Does it indicate that you are signed into the same gamertag in the insider app?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For those that are 100 percent sure they are signed into the hub using the right gamertag (the one that has Technical alpha access, like is showing in&nbsp;the the first&nbsp;screenshot listed)&nbsp;: some people were sent invites to the wrong platform, so they were sent Win 10 invite emails, but it actually was an xbox invite or vice versa.&nbsp; I would check on your xbox (if you have one) to see if it is showing on the xbox, in its insider hub.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I would also make sure you have the most up to date version of the insider hub, You try completely logging out of all Xbox and MS&nbsp;apps and websites, and try logging back into the insider app. Rebooting the PC of course as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m a PC gamer and I have recently bought a new computer and have reinstalled Fallout 3 from the CD. However when I try logging into live in game I’m asked for my Live Access key for the game under the same Live profile that I had on
 my old PC. I know the key will not work. Is there some kind of work around for this or do I need to get a new key? And if so will I have to pay for the new key? Or am I missing something? &nbsp;

<p>Thank you in advanced. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are sorry for delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error related to 'ntdll.dll' may occur due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corrupt Windows user profile</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a></p>
<p>Non-Microsoft application / service conflicting with Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persist, restart computer in Clean boot<span>&nbsp; </span>following the steps from the KB below and check if you are able to work with Word.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Ensure you restart the computer in normal mode after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persist then <span>I would suggest you to disable and enable Windows media player Under
<strong>Media features</strong> from Windows features turn on or off and check. Here is the link which says how to go to Windows features screen and how to enable or disable an application.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Turn </span><span>Windows</span> features on or off</strong></p>

            <p>No - that is not the reason for the error related to ntdll.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are just more wild goose chase ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is that it is impossible to register ntdll.dll because it is not a registrable file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it work on your system?&nbsp; The answer is no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why whenever there is an error message that includes ntdll.dll the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" suggest registering the file and then when it fails (which is always) the "experts" suggest all kinds of other things to try to get
 it to work and it will never work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you try to register ntdll.dll on your own system and see what happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see why registering ntdll.dll will never work read my reply from May 18th in this topic:</p>

            <p>I care barely spell media player but if other media players are also crashing (the only one I've ever heard of is VLC) then I was thinking maybe somehow you got hold of a bad codec that is used by them all and I'm not sure how to start troubleshooting that
 (except guessing).&nbsp; Maybe you can remember installing some new codec recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there is a way to debug media player crashes but I don't know how to do that either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seriously doubt there is a problem with the ntdll.dll since it is a fundamental core system file and if it was afflicted many other things would not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that many folks like the VLC player better than the Windows built in one and if you have not looked at it you can get it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have VLC now or if you install it (just to see if you like it) and if it also crashes they have a support page and community where they may be able to help you troubleshoot the VLC player and when you get that working perhaps the Windows player will
 get fixed too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't like VLC you can always uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience in the MS Community is once the "experts" have run out of their 4-5 troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>New User Account</p>
<p>Repair Install</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or when a community volunteer replies to a topic, you will never hear from the "expert" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future Windows issues in this community my tongue in cheek advice is to take with a grain of salt replies that begin with the word "Hi" or "Hello", contain
<strong>Methods </strong>and <strong>Steps</strong>, contain suggestions that begin with the word "try" and end with "check it it helps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folks would sure save a lot of time.</p>
