<h2>            Creating barcode or QR code using VBA from data in textboxes</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a form in Word I'm trying to generate a QR-code or barcode (either is fine). This form contains a three textboxes (Textbox1,&nbsp;Textbox2 and Textbox3) that contain data that I want to merge and display as a single QR/barcode as soon as each field is filled.
 This QR/barcode should then be displayed next to Textbox3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this should be possible with the DISPLAYBARCODE field but my knowledge of VBA is not good enough to make this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everybody for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michel</p>

            Hotmail Plus hasn't existed for a while. It's called <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Ad-free-Outlook-com-b949a6d1-aeb4-4a9f-9766-a5038ea812fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ad-Free Outlook.com</a> and it has been called that for quite some time (about three years). I'm pretty sure it's still available. It's not exactly the same as Hotmail Plus, but it's nearly the same.

<h2>            Help activating old Student&#47;Teacher Office XP software on a new computer after others crashed through the years.</h2>
                    <div>UPDATE May 2012 with SOLUTION:</div>
<div>The phone number provided in the thread was exactly what was needed.</div>
<div>The problem in short summary: &nbsp;Could not activate Student/Teacher Office XP 2002 on Windows 7. The phone activation wizard did NOT provide a phone number by default or when telling it the region. I called, they provided the confirmation, and all worked
 fine. The number provided in the thread was 888-352-7140. &nbsp;I chose option 3 for the problem and NOT the volume licensing menu option.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ORIGINAL Oct. 2011</div>
<div>Help activating old Student/Teacher Office XP software on a new computer after others crashed through the years. Proper methods are not working and phone number to call won't show up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot find any way to actually e-mail my question or a number to call that relates. Every link redirects my back to the main "call/email" page but never actually gets me there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to install my "old" XP Office student &amp; teacher edition software from 2002 (2003?).</div>
<div>This is about the 4th computer I've put it on as they've all died. My last one died about 6 weeks ago. I have a new one and want to install my software. I see no need to buy the new Office, nor do I like it. I've had to use it at my work computer and do
 NOT like it. I've never had problems activating the software on a new computer after a previous one died. This is the first problem. It won't do it via internet. I tried the phone route, but it will not pull up ANY phone numbers for any country. Mine is USA
 in particular. There is no information on this site for this problem, only on how to run the wizard to get the number; however, it doesn't show.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Please help, I am about to run out of my "activate later" uses. &nbsp;I also would not expect that I should have to buy new software because of another MS blue screen of death and complete failure.</div>

    <title>Office for Mac 2011 - Upgrade 14.4.2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goldgremlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office for Mac 2011 - Upgrade 14.4.2</h2>
                    <p>After recently opening Word I allowed <strong>Office for Mac Home and Student Version</strong>, regularly used successfully since 2011, to upgrade to
<strong>14.4.2</strong>.</p>
<p>Following the upgrade it was not possible to open either Word or Excel, the only two applications that I use from this suite.</p>
<p>Instead of the applications opening when the appropriate Icon was hit a Message Window appears stating that Office cannot open and the application will have to close. Then a following message suggests sending a Report to MS, this is duly processed and very
 many reports have been submitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workaround is to C&amp;P the <strong>MS Office Folder</strong> from my BackUp System over the appropriate Folder within my Mac OS X 10.9.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having repeated the scenario allowing the Upgrade to control the closing of, <strong>
apparently problematic applications</strong>, and closing these applications prior to initiating the upgrade makes nil difference to the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike similar Threads here there are nil messages received about other <strong>
Applications</strong> or <strong>Services</strong> not running or missing etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice will be most gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. This is affecting <strong>Office for Mac not only Word for Mac</strong>.</p>

            <p>Sincere thanks Phillip for a wonderfully clear and detailed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed all your directions in the order set out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Font Book 38 suspect Fonts were identified and removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There were a few items that the System dealt with although I run the DU Repair fortnightly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I moved my version of Normal.dotm to the Desktop because it has a Footer</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. All the com.microsoft plists were moved to the Trash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing above helped the situation, including Re-starting and re-running DU Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved on to the Microsoft items.</p>
<p>Firstly I downloaded MS Office, to be sure that I would have it ready to install, although the original Media is to hand along with the Serial #/Product Key. The other plus to doing this was that the Download includes up to Service Pack 3, saving some essential
</p>
<p>updating time.</p>
<p>Then I worked very carefully through the MS Office Complete Removal Instructions.</p>
<p>I believe that all the mentioned Files and Folders were duly located and dragged to the Trash.</p>
<p>Only the Files where the instructions state '<strong><em>Note</em></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em><strong>&nbsp;These files are not always found on the computer'
</strong></em>were not found.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the Computer Re-starts were observed as were the directions to Empty the Trash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having achieved a complete removal the Mac was again Re-started.</p>
<p>The new installation progressed very smoothly indeed and I was abled to open Word with out any apparent problems.</p>
<p>Then it was time to 'bite the bullet' and Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will appreciate my dismay on finding out that this reintroduced the problem that it was designed to resolve.</p>
<p>The outcome gives exactly the same results as the original problem.</p>
<p>DU Repair was again run but only showed one issue, believed to be a repetitive but benign item connected with Safari.</p>
<p>In case it helps this is the Report Content being sent to MS:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft Error Reporting log version: 2.0</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Error Signature:</em></p>
<p><em>Exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS</em></p>
<p><em>Date/Time: 2014-06-06 16:44:05 +0000</em></p>
<p><em>Application Name: Microsoft Word</em></p>
<p><em>Application Bundle ID: com.microsoft.Word</em></p>
<p><em>Application Signature: MSWD</em></p>
<p><em>Application Version: 14.4.2.140509</em></p>

<p><em>Application LCID: 1033</em></p>
<p><em>Extra app info: Reg=en Loc=0x0409</em></p>
<p><em>Crashed thread: 0</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have not used my workaround, but I may have to soon due to commitments that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of these procedures the System was allowed to close 'offending' applications automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help and any further that you may be able to offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>&nbsp;First run FontBook and Verify Fonts to see if there are any new duplicates.&nbsp; If nothing shows&nbsp; you don't need to go through whole procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next go to Microsoft's website and look for downloads. Download the update (be sure to download the correct one for the your product (Office365 or Office2011).

</p><p>They may have corrupt version on the AutoUpdate Channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now using directions above in previous thread, uninstall again. then reinstall software again, and using this downloaded version of 14.4.2 and try this update again.</p>

            <p>Font Book reported that no Duplicate Fonts exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded Office for Mac 2011 Update 14.4.2 direct from MS as directed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Completely removed MS Office again.</p>
<p>This time I took the opportunity to check the following even though Mavericks 10.9.3 is in use:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><em>On the&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Go</em></strong><em>&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Go to Folder</em></strong><em>.</em></li><li><em>Type this text in the&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Go to folder</em></strong><em>&nbsp;box, and then click&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Go</em></strong><em>:</em><br />
<p>This revealed 349 items, going way back, these were duly Trashed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled using the previously downloaded and successfully tested DMG File.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked that Word opened as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted to install the&nbsp;Office for Mac 2011 Update 14.4.2 just downloaded direct from MS.</p>
<p>The outcome after progressing through a few windows was a Message with Exclamation Marks in Yellow Triangles advising that 14.4.2 could not be installed because '<strong>...no qualifying software was found on this computer</strong>'.&nbsp;This warning applied
 also to my Clone Drive.</p>
<p>Clearly there is something amiss with the combination of 14.4.2 and my Mac, but at least the MS Direct version does not allow what would eventually be a failed Update to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggest I will have to wait for a revised Update.</p>
<p>I have advised MS via various Feedback Forms regarding this situation and in an upcoming report a Link to this Thread will be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks once again for your splendid assistance, very best wishes,</p>
<p>Stan</p>

</p><p>I am going to copy this link in to a moderator link and ask for someone with higher powers than I to send this up to proper channel. I have a question about the SSD seems like I remember when SSD first came out there was an issue but I believe they have
 fixed that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the notice about no qualifying software that was caused by you removing the receipts. They have to be there for updates to verify that you actually have something to update.</p>

    <title>Unable to access Hotmail via Nokia smartphone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to access Hotmail via Nokia smartphone</h2>
                    <p>Hi.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For no good reason at all I am unable to access my Microsoft account from my phone.
</p>
<p>It's worked perfectly fine for the past 2 years, I could access Hotmail no problems at all, however I keep being told that the account or password are incorrect.</p>
<p>Obviously I know my details are correct because I'm logged on here and can get into my Hotmail. Despite this, my password is being rejected on the device. I've completed a full factory reset to no avail, and it's driving me bonkers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ta,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<p><br />
If the user did this, they couldn't access Ovi Mail, post-migration.<br />
As the result of work done by both Yahoo! And Nokia:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The user's Yahoo! ID no longer contains their 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** as an alias. </li><li>The users who accepted TOS can now login to Ovi Mail. </li></ul>
<p>The emails for these users are in the process of being migrated.&nbsp; Some users affected by this issue may not have all their emails yet.</p>

            Yeah, I have done all of above and still have the same issue. By the way svl78, please read your last reply with the eyes of an enduser. Its complex, and even worse, It does not help. Please Provide solid answer for users now lost on 4th week of the migration
 without access to their inbox. I still get the same message when trying to login as described by ashtap in first entry of this discussion.

<p>@Superbast and others, &nbsp;The Ovi Mail, powered by Yahoo! mailbox &amp; contacts migration is completed. All users should see their emails, folders and contacts now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you cannot see them or sign in your Ovi mail account, you need help. To help you, we need your OVI mail address, and your contact info. That is not possible via this forum.</p>

<p>If you want to use a field then download the DateCalc.zip file from here:</p>

<p>This will give you examples of many type of date calculation fields that you can use in your document.</p>
<p>If you just want a process for inserting the date + 3 days as plain text then you can use a macro like:</p>
<p>Sub ScratchMacro()<br />

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took over as General Manager and the person who left our not-for profit organisation will not disclose the Office 365 Administrator password. We desperately need to control our security and privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to contact you to arrange a new admin password?</p>

<p>Carlos, you have not understood the problem I've described. We cannot login to the admin account, that is the issue.</p>
<p>How can I sign onto the admin account without the admin login?&nbsp; None of the other accounts have admin access.</p>
<p>I need to reset our admin account password. When I try to log on to the admin account it tells me I dont have access rights, does that make sense?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>No sets feature for me in Windows 10 build 17618 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No sets feature for me in Windows 10 build 17618</h2>
                    Hello everyone, hope you all are doing great.<br />
I have a question regarding Windows 10 latest build 17618,<br />
According to my knowledge, this build comes with sets and tabs in file explorer,<br />
But I don't see them and there's no way to enable them from multitasking tab (I need serious help about this).<br />
<br />

            &nbsp; I thought I'd seen the poorest implementation of various computer things, but this has to be the absolutely worst, dumbest, most ridiculous implementation I've seen of anything in decades of working with computers.&nbsp; MS writes a blog ballyhooing sets,
 doesn't say a word about what it does, and doesn't say a word about how to make it work.&nbsp; Anybody who had anything to do with sets in 17618 should be given strong opportunities to work at another line of endeavor.&nbsp; :(&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Sets is there for me, i think, it was already enabled in settings and so far every app I have tried has the ability to open a new tab. But when I click plus I only get a new Edge tab.</p>
<p>The worst thing I can see is that no one has told us how it works.</p>

</p><p>I do have Sets in both my Skippy machines and as mentioned, it only opens up Edge. Tried the Control key trick and made no difference in File Manager. What reason for this nonsense. There needs to be choices when clicking the + key to add a tab. Multi tabs
 in explorer would be great, why do I need edge in there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hated Timeline just for tracking every thing I do on my computer, another poster suggested how to turn it off, result was computer crash. Great.</p>

<p>Now that I know the Ctrl key method it works fine for me including in file explorer and in Money not had time to test others yet.</p>

            <p>All you need to do is install the new hard drive, install windows 10 and when asked for the serial key</p>
<p><strong>click "I do not have a product key"</strong> then when connected to the internet it will activate again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need a windows 10 product serial key because you have a forever digital entitlement to windows 10.</p>

<p>will install windows 10 build 10586, so you will need to setup your computer for Insider builds again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to login with your Microsoft account, click start, settings, Update &amp; security,</p>
<p>advanced options, tick [/] Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows,
</p>
<p>then click [Get insider builds], move the slider to the right for FAST.</p>
<p>Click start, settings, System, Power &amp; sleep, set the screen to go off only, set sleep to never.</p>

</p><p>So leave your computer on and it might take 24 hours before the latest insider build 14271 is downloaded and installed.</p>

<h2>            Windows mobile 6.1, outlook mobile, activesync mobile, and exchange server 2007 sync problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>I was an early adapter of WM 6.1 on a motorola q9c phone. Every since I upgraded I have had problems with outlook on my phone syncing with exchange server 2007 on my job. I have trouble shot this for over a week with Sprint, Motorola, and my
 tech support&nbsp;department at my job. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem seems to be the connection for direct push email is not staying on. I can connect as I do have all my email in my inbox. I get the problem most often when trying to send an email, it becomes stuck in the outbox. The activesync program
 will activate but seemingly hang. Each attempt at syncing will actually send the message in the outbox but never clear it thus sending a message multiple times. Sometimes I get an error 0x8500200c and the activesync icon turns orange like with the arrows pointing
 away from each other. Other times it appears dormant with a time of last sync shown, yet the outbox is not cleared. When activesync get hung up doing the task a blank white screen shows up. Sometimes this screen will show up at random while I am doing other
 things on the phone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read a few things regarding the WM 6.1 has the exchange server service pack 1 and this some how has reduced the amount of time connecting to the server, but somehow I am having issues reconnecting properly. This problem did not exist at all
 with WM 6.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I am using the right password as the whole thing will work if I try to send and email when the activesync is showing an active connection.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have included in this post&nbsp;a pictorial account of the windows mobile 6.1 outlook activesync problem I am having. Hopefully it will clarify the problem in regards to&nbsp;the phone staying connected to the exchange server, particularly the blank
 white screen, and the message being stuck in the outbox. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here is the link to the images:<br />

            Hi All,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Just want to give everyone a heads up that there is a fix for this now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;had the&nbsp;exact same problem&nbsp;as everyone else was (Windows mobile 6.1, Active sync configured through&nbsp;eGap (IAG) Exchange 2007).
<br />
<br />
We ended up making a small code change on the "Activesynclogin.asp" file in my eGap 3.6.
<br />
<br />
Contact MS support, you should not get charged as it was a bug. (Dan Herzog and John Redding know the fix)<br />
<br />
***Note this is an IAG/eGap fix <br />
<br />
Thanks

Tech support has been working on my pc remotely for over a week with no success.  Running Windows 7 and trying to get 365 on my NEW machine.  Machine is a dell xps 8500.   I'm hard wired to the internet and no other programs have been loaded on the machine other than McAfee (which is turned off for the installs, troubleshooting etc)  



It has been escalated to a level 3 support team...but still nothing.  


My understanding is that window 7 has problems with 365.    After a week of them working on my computer remotely, installing this and installing that...uninstalling, installing, uninstalling, installing...still nothing.   Now my new machine has all these strange downloaded programs,...permissions have been changed and the PC has been useless for over a week. I don't even have my regular office suite to work with. 



My confidence in the tech support team is at an all time low.....    this is the most frustrating experience ever... 


It's their operating system, its virtually a fresh mach

            I have seen a lot of issues related to the lack of understanding of the product in MS tech support.
<br />
That said Win 7 and Office 365 should work together, that the issue occurs on a almost new system needs definitely to be investigated. Hopefully one of the T3's would get in touch with you soon.<br />

            I too had this problem when I first got it, had microsoft remote controlling etc....don't do anything the above have mentioned. When you go to the install instead of doing the 32bit install, try the 64bit. For some reason 2 out of 3 of my machines worked
 on the recommended 32bit install but 1 didn't. I figured it out myself and installed the 64bit and it is running perfectly. Give it a go and let me know.<br />
<br />
edit: for what it's worth, I did complain to MS about the techs not knowing something as simple as this and questioned why they recommend 32bit but have 64bit available for install when they themselves say there are compatibility issues....I've had it running
 since it first came out and not had one problem with the 64 bit...naturally they didn't respond to my complaint and for the OP, my error msgs were exactly the same and wouldn't show up on my list of installs eithers. As soon as I did 64bit, bingo it was there<br />

<h2>            Recent dramatic increase in Junk &#47; Spam email</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else experienced a recent dramatic increase in Junk / Spam email? Over the past month or so I have been receiving a ton of spam emails in my Inbox. I never had junk email in my inbox before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is just me, or if it is a systemic problem with Outlook.com. I have not responded to spam, signed up for emails from a untrusted source, or clicked any ads.<br />

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have been receiving lot of junk emails lately. To&nbsp;troubleshoot this issue, first check a few basic setting on your outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sweeping and blocking the junk emails that you received is not enough to stop them from coming through on your inbox. Even if you use these two, still there's no assurance that they will stop sending those spam/junk emails as spammers sometimes tends to
 change the username of the email address that they're using but sending the same content. Just to prevent this from happening, I would recommend that you set you junk mail filter to Exclusive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps listed below and check if&nbsp;helps.</p>
<p>Click on the settings icon (cog wheel)&nbsp;and select options. Click on Filters and reporting and check if the Choose a junk email filter to Exclusive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check other Junk email settings and set it to your preference.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for responding to my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this answer did not help because it did not answer the question I asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question was:<strong> "Has anyone else experienced a recent dramatic increase in Junk / Spam email?"</strong> not "how do I deal with junk mail in Outlook.com". I was attempting to ascertain if the increase in spam was specific to me, or something more
 widespread with Outlook.com users.</p>

            I have not experienced a an increase of any kind of junk. My mailboxes receive a lot of junk every day, but I set my mailboxes up so that only my contacts can reach my Inbox. everything else gets shuffled to the Junk folders in the various mailboxes and
 I review those folders periodically looking for false positives. Of course, this require me to not have my own address as a contact.

            But where to they arrive? Do they arrive in your Inbox or in the Junk folder? If they're in the Junk folder, then obviously the junk filter is working as designed. If they arrive in the Inbox, that's a problem.

            <p>My situation isn't nearly as bad as Igmarg JW's, but for me they are going into the Inbox. I don't care about the ones going to the Junk folder - that's what it is there for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find Microsoft's suggestion of setting up mailboxes so only contacts can reach to inbox to be completely shocking. I generally prefer the Microsoft world so I really want to switch from Gmail to Outlook.com... but getting spam in my inbox on a daily basis
 is a deal breaker. Especially when I have only used my Outlook.com email for a handful of sites - most of them being MSFT sites. I can't imagine what would happen if I replaced it as my primary!

            <p>Yes, I have also received a large increase in spam e-mail.</p>
<p>It seems that a majority of these have a suffix of a four digit number appended to the description.</p>
<p>What we need is the ability to generate a rule that will block <em>any and all
</em>e-mail that has a space followed by a four digit number appended to the description.</p>
<p>The number may be random, or it may be keyed to the particular spammer.</p>
<p>We also need the ability to mark an e-mail in the INBOX as a phishing expedition or as my friend's been hacked.</p>
<p>I suspect that the Bayesian filtering is not as robust as it could be.</p>

    <title>Customer support is utterly useless. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giannis thalassinos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customer support is utterly useless.</h2>
                    <p>Dear <strong>utterly </strong>useless Microsoft employees and everybody else,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having a lot of fun today, wasting my time talking to multiple "support" staff at Microsoft over the phone to resolve an issue I have. Basically, I've been trying to move my Office 365 University subscription to another account. (I know, I was
 doomed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, how the **** is that not an option? You would think for something that lasts 4 years you'd have some control over which account it's assigned to, what happens to people who misspelled their email address? Anyway, as you would expect, I couldn't
 get anywhere with your "support". I know I couldn't get a refund, I'm well past the 30 days refund period. So I suggested they deactivate it on one account and give me a product key to activate it on another while keeping the same expiration date. How that's
 not an option is actually beyond my comprehension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to talk to 4 different people for them to basically tell me: <em>too bad, we already have your money, but, you could buy Office 365 Home and that'll solve your issue</em>&nbsp;(I may have paraphrased slightly). That last piece of "advice" was it for me.
 I was so insulted I hung up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it got me thinking, I don't think I've ever seen Microsoft's support staff actually solve anything. You guys are utterly useless.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No no no, let that sink in a for a minute, take a break, have a coffee.&nbsp;<strong>Utterly. U</strong><strong>seless.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually when I have a problem I'll do a Google search and hope to find a solution but all I ever see you guys do on forums (and over the phone) is dodge problems with unrelated generic responses and call it a day. Or, I love this one, you ask for our specs
 or something detailed, and then&nbsp;<strong>never</strong> get back to us. Solutions seem to only originate from other frustrated users who've gone through hours of troubleshooting etc. It's a joke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dream of a day when you can provide useful feedback, but at this rate, I don't think you even understand what that means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tired of your ****<br />

            <p>The support staff on this site are obviously to help people with problems like "how do change my desktop wallpaper" and they have no idea when it comes to questions like "can I set my portrait monitor to only use portrait images as it shuffles my wallpaper".
 Which is a real problem considering how many questions from tech-savvy people are asked on here and which the auto-reply bots don't understand because it's an actual problem instead of just using a working feature.</p>
<p>If they are real people and being paid, they should be fired. The whole department should be fired for being a waste of time.</p>

<p>Have tested for both mcafee and symantec and this is somethings you might try but remember this is unreleased OS and virus protection programs made for other versions of windows don't always do so well on RC OS"S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First and I know this will cause most of you to go "Duh" run the setup as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>second open up task manager and force end all processes that are not required to run windows.&nbsp; note be careful here force ending a process or application can cause system crashes</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>and also i know both Mcafee and Symantec both have divisions that focus on quick integration of their software into upcoming OS releases and a polite and comprehensive email to them might give you an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind memory dump files are always welcome by all support people working on new&nbsp;software so don't be surprised if you response is a request for you to repeat the process and give them a memory dump file.</p>

<p>The brand of PC or laptop has nothing to do with McAfee not installing with windows 10 TP. I have a dell laptop with 32 bit with windows 10 TP on it and McAfee stayed on it and runs normally. I have a 64 bit Acer desktop&nbsp;computer I had windows 10 TP on it
 and during install windows 10 TP removed McAfee and it will not reinstall on a 64 bit system and after a very long conversation with McAfee this is their conclusion and they have no planned fix for it which scares me about the release of full version of windows
 10 if this issue isn't addressed early and a fix found soon. Lets face it windows defender and firewalls do not have a good reputation as being able to protect a system in the PC community. I like windows products a lot or I would not be a part of this program,
 but you (insiders program) asked for our help and honesty is rolling out this latest version of windows. Show us that you are listening to us.

</p><p>I also experienced the issue where (as on my previously stated comments in this thread) Running Windows 7 (64 bit), upgraded to Windows 10TP, had the issue where my McAfee All Access product was removed/ignored during the upgrade and Windows Defender and
 Firewall was turned on. &nbsp;I have tried, uninstalling the product (McAfee All Access), disabling the Win10TP defender and firewall, running as 'Admin' from the website, saving the file and running as 'Admin' from the local disk. &nbsp;Deleted McAfee from all the
 registry keys and tried again. &nbsp;I had a licence for Win8 and I've installed and upgraded to 8.1 without any issue(s) with the McAfee product. &nbsp;I have not attempted to make the move back to Windows 10 TP till I saw the issue is/was resolved. &nbsp;The only common

<p>&nbsp;I decided to rolled back to windows 7 for a few days (about a week) making sure McAfee and other programs where reinstalled and updated. I decided today to give windows 10 TP another try and after everything installed and I once again had windows 10 TP
 build 9926 I noticed that this time for whatever reason McAfee stayed install during the upgrade and seems to be functioning completely normally. It may be due to the fact that this time BEFORE I installed windows 10 TP I went to my temp folder and deleted
 all temp files, then ran the windows 10 TP upgrade.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the OneDrive app, you need to hit the "..." at the bottom and select the "Recycle Bin" from the bottom menu item.</p>
<p>When in the Recycle Bin, use the "select" tool to select which items you want to delete and then hit the trashcan item. Files will then be permanently deleted from your OneDrive
