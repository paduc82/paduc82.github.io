<h2>            Make outlook 2007 faster with IMAP Gmail&#40;search and downloading message&#41;</h2>
                    I recently switched to using outlook 2007 with gmail with IMAP. I have two problems<br />
<ol>
<li>I have configured outlook to check for messages after every 1 minute. Also, in teh sending and receiving group, I have configured inbox and draft folder to download entire message. For the rest of folders, it downloads only headers. Despite this, when a
 new mail comes in - it takes over 1 minute to download the message. This is on a 2 mbps connection with a message less than 10 sentences.</li><li>Also, is there a way that outlook downloads ALL the message bodies if I keep the computer running for say overnight</li><li>The side effect of step 2 is that I may get searches done as fast as that on the web with gmail. I have to do a lot of searches in my work and need this feature. Computer keeps on saying that it is indexing but it never finishes indexation.</li></ol>
<p>Any help appreciated<br />

            <p>Mail is not an instant message medium and you should not be checking for new messages any more frequently than about ten minutes.&nbsp; You can introduce timing problems if you go much lower than that.</p>
<p><br />
Since mail is rarely delivered to any folder other than Inbox, synching folders other than the Inbox is probably not necessary.&nbsp; Outlook will sync them if you open them.&nbsp; When you move messages from the Inbox to another folder, Outlook will transfer the data
 from the server to the local folder.</p>
<p><br />
You can tell Outlook to include the entire messsage by selecting that option in&nbsp; the Send/Receive Group properties.&nbsp; While viewing Inbox, press Alt+Ctrl+S.&nbsp; Select the Send/Receive Group containing the IMAP account and click Edit.&nbsp; Select the account in the
 left-hand pane, then click the radio button on the right that's labeled "Download complete item including attachments"</p>

            Thanks. I will increase the time to 10 minutes. However, I have already done the changes on including download complete item and yet it does not download fully.<br />
<br />
The other two points are not addressed. Can you please see if there is any information on it?<br />
These are connected with doing a search which is a very important feature for me<br />

            That depends on your gmail settings - it's possible to configure gmail settings to limit downloads. Log into the account using web access and check the email configure settings.

            Thanks. I did check gmail account settings. The default is to sync everything. Yet, when I go to older emails in inbox, it says that it just downloaded header and will now donwload body. For newer emails that are received now, the body is downloaded.<br />
<br />
In any case, downloading years of email should take some time and I have not seen that. Maybe there is something that I am missing.<br />

            Hello <br />
Thanks for your response. Yes, all of these are selected. Now I see *most*, not *all* past mails downloaded. The new emails are downloaded and is not a problem. However, I do not find the search on IMAP as fast as it is on Exchange e.g. as I start typing in
 the search string, the matches come up with partial string in the case of Exchange folder. In the case of IMAP, I have to wait for quite some time (order of minutes).<br />
Is Outlook 2007 not indexing IMAP folders?<br />

            It is indexing it, but depending on your exchange config, the search might be offloaded to exchange. Also, if you are using instant search, the imap folders need to be enabled for indexing and indexed. Check your indexing options to be sure.

            Thanks for the response. I did check the indexing options. I checked it via control panel -&gt; indexing. It says that indexing is enabled on the IMAP folders - yet, I see the behavior as mentioned earlier i.e. instant search does not happen for IMAP folders.
 I checked the indexing status through instant search-&gt;indexing status and it says right now that 0 items remaining across all mailboxes.<br />
From your response, I understand then that IMAP folder should provide the same behavior as that in exchange i.e. typing a letter should make outlook start searching so that by the time I complete a word - I may already have some searches that are relevant.
 Is this correct?<br />

<h2>            Unicode character appears colored on screen, prints as black and white</h2>
                    <p>In Microsoft Word, I am using Unicode characters U+1F000 through U+1F02B.&nbsp;(These are the tiles used for the game Mohjang so you know). On the first page I am using the font "Segoe UI Symbol". This shows up as black and white. That's fine. On the second page
 I am using "Segoe UI Emoji". This shows up as colored. Awesome right? (1st Screenshot) So I thought that if I printed this I would get what I see, right? Wrong. It prints as black and white. Both fonts. Here's the number of ways that I have to work with this
 issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing to printer produces only black and white</li><li>Printing to Adobe PDF&nbsp;produces only black and white (2nd Screenshot)</li><li>Microsoft Print to PDF produces only black and white</li><li>Printing to Microsoft XPS Document Writer produces only black and white</li><li>Saving to PDF&nbsp;produces only black and white</li><li>Saving to XPS&nbsp;produces only black and white</li></ul>
<p>My printer can print in color. My printer has plenty of ink. I have the latest drivers for my printer. I have made sure that "Printer Properties-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Print All Text as Black" is set to Disabled. (This menu item is not available under print to PDF or
 print to XPS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this on two different computers and have the same results. Computer versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>10.0.16299 Build 16299 (Windows 10 Home)</li><li>10.0.15063 Build 15063 (Windows 10 Education)</li></ul>
<p>I am using Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 (Version 1711 Build 8730.2175) on BOTH machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: Other applications like Adobe Illustrator render both fonts as black and white only. Google Chrome renders these characters as colored, though different style because I don't know what font Chrome is using)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshots of what I see on screen and what I see when I print/save.</p>

            I found something Interesting. If I save the Word document as an html file and open it in IE or Edge and print, I get colors. Google Chrome renders page in color, but prints it in black and white. Now my question is why are some applications rendering/printing
 this font in color while others don't? Of relevance to this thread, why doesn't Microsoft Word print this page in color correctly?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that we could see is because each applications could have some compatibility issues when it comes to printing Unicode characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, what we suggest is to share your thoughts and feedback about Microsoft Word on our UserVoice in order for us to improve the program in the future updates. Just click on this

<p>The coding in font characters&nbsp;does not include color, just outlines. You can apply a single color as a font property of a given character, but the icons you show in multiple colors would have to be images rather than font characters in order to print in
 color. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that the font name is Segoe UI suggests that it is intended for display only.</p>

<p>I've dug into this problem a little bit more and came across some interesting sites that talk about color in fonts.
<a href="https://www.colorfonts.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">colorfonts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://color.typekit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">color.typekit</a>&nbsp;(Open in IE or Edge to view properly). Of most interest is&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/ot-svg-color-fonts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OpenType-SVG
 color fonts</a>. Apparently there is an extension to the OpenType font format where characters can use an embedded SVG that encodes color instead of just plain black and white. I just started getting into fonts and Unicode so I didn't how new or old any of
 these features were. So, I have boiled my question down pretty well: when will Microsoft Word implement OpenType-SVG? (This question is rhetorical, I have found a way to print these characters in colors, it just takes a few steps: Word-&gt;save as html-&gt;open
 html-&gt;print to PDF-&gt;open in Illustrator-&gt;edit/use/whatev)</p>
<p>

            More information is needed to determine specifically what infection you are dealing with since there are many variants of crypto malware (file encrypting ransomware).
<br />
<br />
Are there any obvious <strong>file extensions appended</strong> to or with your encrypted data files? If so, what is the extension and is it the same for each encrypted file or is it different?<br />
Did you find any <strong>ransom notes</strong> and if so, what is the actual name of the note?<br />
Did the cyber-criminals provide an <strong>email address</strong> to send payment to? If so, what is the email address?<br />
<br />
The best way to identify the different ransomwares is the <strong>ransom note</strong> (including it's name), samples of the
<strong>encrypted files</strong>, any obvious <strong>extensions appended</strong> to the encrypted files, information related to any
<strong>email addresses</strong> used by the cyber-criminals to request payment and the
<strong>malware file</strong> responsible for the infection.<br />
<br />
You can submit samples of encrypted files and ransom notes to <strong><a href="https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/index.php?lang=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">ID Ransomware</span></a></strong> for
<strong>assistance with identification</strong> and <strong>confirmation</strong>. This is a service that helps identify what ransomware may have encrypted your files and then attempts to direct you to an appropriate support topic where you can seek further
 assistance. Uploading <strong>both</strong> encrypted files and ransom notes together provides a more positive match and helps to avoid false detections.

            <p>I have been testing using an External USB 3.0 caddy with a 320 GB drive.&nbsp; The external drive had been used to hold Image backups previously but I deleted all of those before I started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I got exactly the same error message as you.&nbsp; I believe the situation is caused by the backup drive but not really sure why.&nbsp; I will go through my steps of the things I tried, maybe you will draw a different conclusion than I.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First attempt, USB 3.0 port - Got error messages and imaging <strong>failed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved the drive to a USB 2.0 port, same messages and <strong>failure.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Used Diskpart to clean the drive, then Disk Management to re-initialize the drive as GPT.&nbsp; Same error messages and Imaging<strong> failed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Used Disk Management to delete the volume on the drive and converted to MBR.&nbsp; Imaging
<strong>worked....</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved the drive back to the USB 3.0 port, Imaging <strong>Worked.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted the volume again and re-initialized the drive as GPT, Imaging <strong>
worked</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ended up in the same configuration as the initial failure, except the drive had been reconfigured.&nbsp; Maybe converting the drive to MBR removed whatever was causing the problem.&nbsp; I will be doing more testing and will post back if I discover anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Microsoft seems to want to remove the Imaging capability, I will not be counting on it in the future.&nbsp; Hopefully, it will remain in place and usable.</p>

<p>In WordPad, use File&gt;Open or CTRL+o and then in the Open dialog, you can change the type of files that you want to open, but leaving it as All Wordpad Documents, should allow you to see documents created in Word that have a .docx file extension</p>

<p>Do you have any other versions of Word installed? If I remember<br />
correctly the pip file is used in earlier versions of Word. See:<br />

 920 phones and it's the same story with them all. My PCs are top of the line. I also have a Surface 3 and it's the same story there.&nbsp; I have tried restarting my phones and PCs, reinstalled drivers, switched cables (including those that came with the phones).&nbsp;
 What is it about Windows 8 that makes my phone not sync which was not a problem with Windows 7?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help!

            <p>Thank you,- I appreciate your help.&nbsp;I have shut the phone completely per your instructions multiple times using different cables and ports. The PC detects the phone for 2 seconds then loses it and it goes on like that forever if I let it.&nbsp; On rare occations,
 the Windows Phone app will show content on the phone but nothing gets synced. Then after few minutes, it will lose the connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows app on my Surface 3 gives me the following message "Your phone is having troubles" suggesting I restart the phone.&nbsp; Thing is my wife's phone (also Lumia 920) is doing the same with her PC so it cannot be just my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>..any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Sure - I had actually tried to be sure the&nbsp;drivers were installed.&nbsp;The devise manager shows the drivers ..but one has a yellow marker on it. "Unknown USB Devise (Device Descriptor Request Failed)".&nbsp; I wonder if there are drivers that I don't have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone does not show in Windows Explorer but I can sometimes catch its properties in 'devises and printers'. Most of the time it does not show ..or comes in as 'unknown devise'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in the devise manager, I do not see the 820 drivers.&nbsp; I feel I had seen two or three of those a long time ago.&nbsp; I have tried to update and reinstall but nothing works. I also let the phone be connected for long period of time, which normally should
 allow drivers to load. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the Windows Phone app.&nbsp; Still no luck.&nbsp; Very frustrating.</p>

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp; The phone works perfectly in all other ways but syncing with Windows 8.1. I am a semi advanced user and never had a problem I can't fix myself. All my PCs are top of the line but none of them will sync my Lumia 920. So, it must be the phone ..or
 Windows 8.1. not recognizing it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the suggestions above many times.&nbsp;Maybe Windows 10 will bring joy. I survived 8.1 without a sync ..probably deserve a badge of some sort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            Thanks Ira.&nbsp; - It turns out Windows 10 fixed the issue.&nbsp; Although Windows 10 sync is good at syncing your phone with the computer, it does not allow you to delete content off the phone through the computer. (I hate doing that manually on the phone).&nbsp;&nbsp;In
 conclusion, my issue is solved but it raised another issue. Thanks to all who helped out.

<h3> dragonforest  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to fill in Word Form</h2>
                    <p>I inherited two similar Word documents. Both are in table structure. Some of the cells are empty, to enter text, and some have ActiveX checkbox controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use the ActiveX checkbox controls, I need to have the forms in Restrict Editing mode. In one of the forms, when in Restrict Editing mode, I can still type into the empty table cells, but in the other form, I'm unable to enter text into the cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able both to check the checkboxes, and enter text into the empty cells. Does anyone have any idea why the second form is not allowing me to do this, and what I can do to fix this situation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

<h2>            need some definate answers to questions about the change from win7 to win10</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop that was running a registered version of TP build 10525 alongside a version of Win7home COEM (dualboot). SLMGR /XPr told me in both OS's that the machine was permanently activated.</p>
<p>I formatted the Win10 partition a couple weeks ago and did not re-install Win10. I would now like to try the upgrade process through windows update from Win7 to win10rtm</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have the Original Win7 COEM disk (NO recovery partitions on this machine)that i bought at my local Pc shop in late december, i also have the .iso's, of builds 9879/10041/10130/10147/10162/ and 10525.</p>
<p>its still pretty unclear to me if i can re-install&nbsp; Win7 at any time in the far future( say 2 years from now) from the COEM install media if i decide that win10 does not fit my machine's needs.</p>
<p>I really want to try the so called"upgrade process" but i am not prepared to lose a perfectly legitimate license in the process. What exactly happens to that 25digit license key after it has been used in the the upgrade process to win10?</p>
<p>does it become un-useable after 30 days like the recovery partition files that most have on their pc's?</p>
<p>if it doesnt, will i have to phone MS activation line for a re-issue of a license key for win7 say , after 18months?</p>
<p>
</p><p>so many questions, just not enough answers!</p>
<p>

<p>I think the best solution is for you to replace your HDD with new one. Than install</p>
<p>fresh copy of Windows&nbsp; 10(10240 to 10547). Skip entering license key and it will be activated.</p>
<p>Old HDD put in USB HDD cover and use it as USB drive. One day you want back to Win 7,</p>
<p>just put it back in your laptop. So, you used Insider license (Entitled) and license</p>
<p>of your Windows 7 is untouched. </p>

            <p>Rollback from Windows 10 to the previous OS has a <em>maximum </em>limit of 30 days. &nbsp;Some user changes to Windows 10 can cancel the rollback availabilty before 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot use the Windows 7 key to reinstall Windows 7 without deleting the Windows 10 upgraded from it. &nbsp;An upgrade from 7 to 10 for free is an
<em>entitlement </em>upgrade. &nbsp;The Windows 10 activation that results is an <em>entitlement activation</em> (Microsoft's terminology) as opposed to a
<em>product key activation</em> (also Microsoft's terminology). &nbsp;If you used the Windows 7 key to install another copy of Windows 7 your Windows 10 would no longer be entitled to activation, so when you enter the Windows 7 product key in the new Windows 7 installation
 you will see "product key in use" or "product key not available."</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>does it become un-useable after 30 days like the recovery partition files that most have on their pc's?</strong></p>
<p><strong>if it doesnt, will i have to phone MS activation line for a re-issue of a license key for win7 say , after 18months?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No such things happen. &nbsp;The Windows 7 key is simply "consumed" as Microsoft describes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a simple choice. &nbsp;Let the key be consumed by the upgrade to Windows 10 or purchase a retail copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have consume a product key sometime, either the Windows 7 key or a Windows 10 retail key.</p>

<h2>            Transfer Outlook 2007 emails and settings to Office 365 on a different computer</h2>
                    <p>I am changing computers and at the same time I am transitioning from Office 2007 to Office 365 Home and I would like to move all of my email settings, and old emails (from multiple accounts) to the new machine and have access to them using Outlook 365.&nbsp;
 I have tried copying the .pst files to the new computer but when I go to open them into Outlook 365 I get an error message "File Access Denied" even though the permissions on the files are set to allow access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a step by step guide to do this?</p>

            Hi Steven,
<br />Did you copy the pst to the internal hard drive and open it using File, Open &amp; Export, Open Outlook Data file?  You can't open it by double clicking on it and should not open it from a removable drive. 
<br />
<br />Moving mail is easy, other settings not so easy. Rules are stored in the pst file, but the accounts are stored in the registry - you'll need to add them to the new profile using the add account wizard.

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, I’d like to suggest you try cleaning the OneDrive for Business cache to see the issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clean the MacODB cache, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>Close ODB&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Microsoft/AppData/Microsoft/Office/15.0/OfficeFileCache&nbsp;</p>
<p>~/Library/Application Support/OneDriveBusiness/Settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.ms/&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: ~ is shorthand for the user’s home directory in the file system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart ODB&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work, I suggest you uninstall OneDrive for Business and then reinstall it to see if it works.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after trying the two steps above, please provide us with the information below:</p>
<p>1 The screenshots related to the issue.</p>
<p>To upload the screenshot, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click <strong>Edit/Insert Media</strong>.</p>
<p>2 Could you mind telling me if your OneDrive for Business has been updated to the latest version?</p>
<p>3 What is your Mac operating system?</p>
<p>In addition, I’d like you to know the new OneDrive for Business app will be released at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cliff</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>The mail product in F1 plan (formerly known is K1) is Exchange Online Kiosk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus to get an equivalent to Business Essentials you need to get Exchange Online Plan 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exchange Online Kiosk supports Outlook Web and Email on mobile phones (Active Sync). It is designed for light users who would check their emails on shared PCs (i.e. Kiosks). Think of nurses who would check their emails in the staff room terminals via webmail.
 It will not support Outlook desktop.</p>

<p>For example, when I select the "Update &amp; Security Section" of Windows Settings, and then navigate to the "Windows Insider Program" sub-menu, it says "Get Started" indicating that I am no longer in the Windows Insider Program, correct?</p>

Can you paste whatever it is into Notepad?&nbsp; If so, then copy it from there and try to paste that wherever it is that you are trying to paste.&nbsp;&nbsp;A problem is that you can copy stuff which is in the wrong format (e.g. not text) and therefore can't be pasted into
 a field which wants to receive only text.&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide a detailed publicly accessible example if you need more help.</p>

Have you done something with your security settings? Try using Default Level for all zones. You&nbsp;might get a prompt about pasting if the Gmail scripts are overriding a normal text paste.</p>
<p>Also, what happens if you try something simpler, such as pasting into an Edit frame in these forums?&nbsp; FWIW I don't even see one when I try changing the security level, though I have occasionally (inexplicably) seen the prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that it would be possible
 to disable or enable instead of prompt, so if you would be in a state which would normally show the prompt and the setting was at disable you would have the conditions established to reproduce your symptom more reliably.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Customer concern  if the internet goes down&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I trust that you are well.</p>
<p>I have customer that wants to&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;O365 but is concern&nbsp;about the internet connectivity issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>their main concern is, with internet down they will not be able to send email with office 365.</p>
<p><b>What if the internet goes down?</b> <b>What alternative solution is there? </b>
<b>Or what is the back plan here?</b> before deciding whether go full<b>&nbsp;cloud or Hybrid</b> solution?</p>
<p>Well we know is not&nbsp; going to be end of the world if it goes down but,&nbsp;We&nbsp;have told the customer that its the same scenario with&nbsp;other email&nbsp;providers.</p>
<p>- they&nbsp;would need your own domain to send emails internally without internet connection. But still customer wants more answers to defend his case when presenting to Business decision makers. (Its a Bank)</p>
<p>what will be the different scenarios will Hybrid and cloud only bring, What is the differences between the two and what are the advantages and disadvantages?</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos </p>

<p>Hi Carlos,</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. In Office 365, we cannot send emails if internet is down and it’s the same scenario with other email providers based on my knowledge. Also, I’m afraid that no workaround is available from Office 365 side and there is no difference between
 Office 365 cloud-based environment and under a hybrid deployment in this case. We appreciate your understanding on this.<br />
In addition, please feel free to post a new thread in our forum if you have other problems working with Office 365. We will do what we can to assist you.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>

<p>It will be best to purge all existing traces of downloaded Insider build files. Delete C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution and C:\$WINDOWS.~BT folders. Because of file rights or files in use, it may be easiest to boot with Windows 10 install media, such as a
 bootable USB, and use SHIFT-F10 to get a Command Prompt. Then:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>rd /S /Q&nbsp;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>rd /S /Q&nbsp;C:\$WINDOWS.~BT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is to start an install of Windows 10 by running setup.exe from within Windows. Cancel it just before it actually proceeds to install. Apparently purging any Windows setup files is one of the first things it does prior to an in-place upgrade like
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Cleanup may also do it. I believe running it from an Administrator Command Prompt may be more thorough:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>cleanmgr /sageset</strong> &lt;-- select every option</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>cleanmgr /sagerun</strong> &lt;-- deletes files preselected above</p>
