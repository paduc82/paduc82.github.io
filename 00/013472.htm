<p>Have you tried using File Explorer to connect your Windows 10 computer to the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested this with my wife's laptop that is running Windows 7. Her computer could not see my computer as a File share but could see the Media share I had setup before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the File Explorer Address bar on her computer&nbsp; I typed &nbsp;&nbsp; \\My computers Device Name\</p>
<p>And her browser had a dropdown that had choices for the next available addresses. It even had the one of my Backup Drives that I used Properties&nbsp; and advanced share option&nbsp; to give it a share name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some image samples of File Explorer Address bar with edited input in it but what showed using my computer to make it easy for me to make the samples.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The next one is a snip from her computer showing My Computer was not visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50582af9-5377-4c17-8496-4aca1233e85a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50582af9-5377-4c17-8496-4aca1233e85a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next I edited out My Computer info but left the Folders she found.</p>

<p>Yes on the Sample above I moved some NotePad files and anything my wife wanted from my desktop Backup_Drive_Share to her laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything on the&nbsp;<span>Backup_Drive_Share was available for her to use and it is a 1 TB drive that I partitioned&nbsp; to the size you can see in the snip. It has a lot of different type of files on it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I made a Snip of it with the Properties showing the Sharing tab open so you can see how I named it but I edited out my computer info with Paint 3D.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you can see I'm logged in on my FastRing Drive which is (C:) at this time, The way windows works on my desktop which ever drive I boot to is always Drive C: when it is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; I should add my desktop is connected to our home network by Ethernet Cable and my wife's laptop did not have Home Group set up and&nbsp; only uses the wireless side of our home network.</p>

<p>OK, now I kinda see what you are getting at.&nbsp; Yes, using your method of typing the PC name into Explorer in any PC on the LAN does indeed show the shared folders on the Insider build PC.&nbsp; However, that PC is still NOT shown under "networks" like it should
 be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the first time I typed the PC name in the browser on that PC, it magically appeared under networks on both the local PC and other PCs on the LAN.&nbsp; However, after a reboot, it is back to the original behavior.... not showing under "networks".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a possibly related issue.... last night we were suddenly unable to print to our HP networked (WiFi) printer.&nbsp; It showed as "offline" although it seemed to be OK otherwise.&nbsp; First time in a couple years.&nbsp; After a couple reboots of the PCs and printer,
 it started working as if nothing happened.&nbsp; This morning I noticed that after I started the insider build PC, the printer was not shown under "networks" and was shown as "offline" on other PCs.&nbsp; As soon as I rebooted all PCs, the printer came back.&nbsp; If I had
 to guess, I would guess that MS broke something in the computer browser function and/or the Insider build PC takes over as the master browser (it is after all the build with the most recent date) but does not have the full device list.&nbsp; As such, this missing
 information propagates to the other PCs on the LAN (if I understand how network browsing works).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think you are right that something on build 17063 is still not quit right as on my wife's win 7 she only sees the media sharing as a device and her media player opens when she clicks on that device in her File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the File share is nowhere to be seen unless the network share address is typed in.:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also could get to it with a web browser but I had to include a folder inside the shared drive for it to show.:)</p>

<p>Thanks for the link.&nbsp; I upvoted your feedback and also added a comment clarifying the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't find your feedback when I searched prior to creating this thread because the title doesn't include any relevant keywords.&nbsp; If it is possible to edit your title, it might help to make sure it includes something like "file sharing" or "shared folders"
 and "missing" or something to that effect.&nbsp; Otherwise, no one searching for the same issue will find it to upvote it.&nbsp; And no upvotes probably MS will just ignore it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendaring Suggestions From An Experienced Senior Level Administrative Professional</h2>
                    <div>

<div>
<p><span>As a senior level administrative professional I utilize the Outlook application on a regular basis, I basically live in this tool!! Over the years I have found some areas that I believe can be improved on so our jobs are made easier.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Locked Meeting:</strong> Option to have a meeting invitation locked. This would make it so the invite cannot be forwarded to other attendees. This is beneficial for meetings/events that need to be secure. (I was able to do this
 in a previous version with about 10 steps. I believe it was version….1997).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Shadow Meetings:</strong> Option to keep a meeting on the calendar rather than decline it when there is a conflict. The owner of the meeting would have notification that the participant has a conflict but should their schedule
 change, they might be able to attend.&nbsp; The status would be available on the Tracking page.&nbsp; The shadow meeting would show up on the calendar with lines through it showing its status.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Attendance Tracking:</strong> Option to input the reason that a meeting cannot be attended when declining a meeting. This would show up on the Tracking page.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For example:</p>
</li></ol>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hello, I am new to the the Community so hello to all!</span><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I was wondering if someone can please help me;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have created a mail merge from excel into a word email message and have added an IF function to the merge-field using the "Rules" tab. ( I can edit the field codes by "Right clicking and toggling Field
 codes)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am using the "IF" function which works fine but I would like to get an additional option on the inserted text.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Rather than have it insert the additional text if the merge-field is "equal to" something, I would like to be able to add the text or for it to "trigger" if the merge-field "contains" a certain word or
 phrase. (I think the function may be called "Search" or "ISNUMBER")</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is because I have two possible paragraphs &nbsp;depending on the merge field content but would like a third option where if the merge-field contains both "chosen words" or "phrases" then it will show both
 the additional inserted text (without creating a third option).</span></p>
<p>For Example:<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>So instead of using "Answer_1" or "Answer_2"" as the Contents of the merge field to trigger the insertion of each respective paragraph of inserted text, we would be saying if it contain
<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>So instead of using "Answer_1" or "Answer_2"" as the Contents of the merge field to trigger the insertion of each respective paragraph of inserted text, we would be saying if it contain
 "1" anywhere in the Merged field or in the second merge-field if it contains "2" anywhere in the merge-field it would insert the respective text. I could then achieve&nbsp;my desired result where if I had a third option that was added to the merge-field, for example
 "Answer_1_2" because it contains both the numbers 1 and 2 it would add both paragraphs.</span></span></span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">i have tried changing the IF state using "SEARCH" but without success, I think I am getting confused with the correct formulas because we have {} and () in the field codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">i hope I have explained this clearly and not put anyone to sleep!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would really appreciate it some one could help me with this.</span><br />
<br />

<p>What is your data source? (Word document, Excel sheet, Access Database, ?)<br />
</p>
<p>How long can the text you are searching and the text you are looking for be, in total?<br />
<br />
Can either text contain double-quotation marks or single-quotation marks?<br />
</p>
<p>Is this for your own use, or for distribution?<br />
<br />
There are a couple of possible approaches if the text lengths are not above, say, 230 characters or so, there are no quotation characters, but both approaches require that you have a small external file, and they can only work with fairly recent desktop versions
 of Word on Windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from double-quotes, for which there are workarounds, there is no particular issue regarding how long the conditional text might be or what it might contain. The output from an IF test can span multiple pages and can include images and tables - all
 without recourse to external documents. The difficulty with what the OP wants to do though, concerns testing whether a mergefield *contains*&nbsp;certain content, viz:<br />
</span>Except for when there is only a single&nbsp;number in the mergefield's output - and that's what you're testing for - that simply isn't practicable.</p>

            Just because you haven't thought of a way to do it doesn't mean that such a way does not exist, but the conditions do have to be right, and I'm not going to go into the possible solutions unless that is the case.

    <title>How to get Sharepoint to work on Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasminehughes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get Sharepoint to work on Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2011 for Mac installed on my Mac and am unable to open and edit any of my files on Sharepoint even though I have the relevant software on the computer. I usually use Chrome as my web browser but whenever I try to open up any documents from
 any of the Office applications on Sharepoint I get this message: <br />
<br />
<em>"The document could not be opened for editing. &nbsp;A Microsoft SharePoint Foundation compatible application could not be found to edit the document."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then read some other things online and they said that the best web browser to work with Sharepoint and Mac is Safari, so I then tried using Safari to open up my Office documents using my Mac. These are the sequence of pop ups which appear when I try to
 open and edit a document:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Do you want to open the file?</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>File name: time_planner.doc</em><br />
<em>Server name: hr-sharepoint.hrsfc.ac.uk</em><br />
<em>Some files can harm your computer. If you do not fully trust the source, do not open the file."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then click "OK"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next thing that then pops up is a "Welcome to Office Mac" window for 2011 <strong>
This is what I already have installed onto my computer.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The window gives you 3 different options: (I have included a picture of the window below)<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c6f1d45-4baa-4cd7-8c8d-2acca051be6c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;None of these options apply to me as I shouldn't need an Office 365 subscription to open and edit files on Sharepoint just because I am using a Mac as I am able to edit and open my files on other computers and PCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried entering in my product code again that was provided with the Office for Mac 2011 package which I purchased, however as I have already downloaded this onto my Mac the product code is now invalid and it does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the last option to use it for free all it does is show me a blank document, so that option is no good either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just wondering if there were any way of me actually being able to edit and open my files on Sharepoint and use them on my Mac?</p>

            <p>Hey! I honestly can't remember if I was able to solve this issue or not. This was nearly 2 years ago now and I no longer have to use Sharepoint - which is a Godsend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do remember having to work in a really unusual way when dealing with Sharepoint. To be honest I probably had to download the files I wanted to edit onto my Mac and then upload them again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry I can't be of anymore help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, well it is always difficult to try to figure out what is happening fromm limited knowledge but I might try this first:</p>
<p>Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connection USB to PC. Check or uncheck Advanced network functionality. Soft reset your device then connect your device again and see if it starts&nbsp;the partnership process.&nbsp;

<br />
<br />You can open jpeg file click on it with right mouse click, choose copy image and then paste it into Word.
<br />
<br />Or you can open just a jpeg and press CTRL+P to print the file

            You can't "open" a JPEG in Word, but you can insert it, using <strong>Insert | Illustrations | Pictures</strong>, or you may be able to copy and paste it. You can then save the document that contains the picture, but you can't convert the JPEG into a Word
 document.

<p>Whether it can be done for free or not is rather determined by what is in the image. If the aim is to print the text, what you appear to require is OCR (optical character reading) to convert the file to text which can be inserted and printed from Word or
 any other program that accepts text input. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of OCR options around. I still think FineReader is the best of the bunch, but as you want 'free' try one of the on line converters.<br />

            The "NoReReg" fix usually more appropriate for situations when you have multiple versions of Office installed.<br />
<br />
Another possible cause for this problem is windows not giving you appropriate Access Rights when you are doing the activation. As a result the changes made to the registry are only good for the session. Here are several alternate ways of fixing that problem:<br />
<br />
<b>How to fix Access Rights problem</b>
<p>Sometimes the problem has been that Windows has had problems granting the right access to files, folders and the registry. The following tips provide some workarounds.</p>
<p>As you go from XP to Vista to Win7 certain operations require higher access rights to perform. These access rights are “higher” than even those granted to the Administrator ID by default. These “elevated” rights are accessed by way of
 the UAC confirmation dialog which is invoked when you select to “Run As Administrator”.</p>
<p>In theory, any one of the following tips should work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The process is: run one of the fixes, run each affected Office app, reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo”
 at play here. We do it because it works!), try the office apps again to confirm the fix worked.</p>
<p>If you want to first confirm that access rights are a problem this article describes how:

<p><span>FYI: for this situation, you can consider Vista and Win7 to be essentially interchangeable with only minor differences between the user interface in the 2 versions.</span></p>
<p>In Windows 7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have “run as administrator”
</p>
<p>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information.</p>
<p><b>What you need to do is "runas admin":</b></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the start menu, right click on the shortcut for any Office app, select “RunAs Admin”<br />

<p>I am running Windows 10 with Outlook 2016. Before Outlook 2016 I received emails that were something like; Outlook would no longer sync my email and gave instructions to follow, I din't follow instructions until to late and outlook didn't work, thats when
 I went to Outlook 2016</p>
<p>My regular outlook account is a POP3, that email is fine. It is another email account that comes into outlook that is a IMAP account that was fine until the last month. No changes have been made with that account prior to these email messages about permissions.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to assist you better with this issue, we also would like to know more details about your concern. Are you getting the error message "Microsoft Outlook does not have permission to get mail for" when trying to access your Outlook Inbox, creating an
 email message or when opening Outlook directly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you repair your Office application and check if it helps. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button (lower-left corner), and select
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> on the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>2. Right-click the Microsoft Office product you want to repair, and select <strong>
Change</strong>.</p>
<p>3. From the "How would you like to repair your Office Programs" screen, select
<strong>Online Repair</strong> to make sure everything gets fixed, and then select
<strong>Repair</strong>. The <strong>Quick Repair</strong> option is also available, which runs faster but only detects and then replaces corrupted files.</p>
<p>4. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please verify if you will still receive the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting regarding the issue you are having with getting your phone recognized on your laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most basic thing we always want to do with an issue like this is to restart the phone and the PC you're trying to sync with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned that you use the USB cable for charging, has this cable worked on a different PC previously for syncing?&nbsp; Some USB cables are charging only, so that's something we'd want to check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, have you already downloaded and installed the Zune software, to make sure the Windows Phone drivers on that laptop are up to date?&nbsp; You can get Zune here if not:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27163</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already have Zune installed, we'll want to make sure the drivers were properly installed.&nbsp; Here's a link to a FixIt designed to correct driver errors:</p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9767934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9767934</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't resolve the issue, we'll want to see if there are any errors in Device Manager.&nbsp; To check, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>On your computer (with your phone plugged in), click Start, right-click Computer, and then click Properties.</li><li>Click Device Manager.</li><li>Your connected Windows Phone should be listed under "Portable Devices."</li><li>Double-click the device and view the General tab.&nbsp; </li><li>In the information box, see if there's an error code listed there.&nbsp; If there is, please provide that error to us, so that we can see what the appropriate next troubleshooting steps are for it.</li></ul>
<p>Please keep in touch so that we can look into this further for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Kevin J S</p>

    <title>How indent text next to text box&#47; frame contained in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catbill  say:</h3>
<h2>            How indent text next to text box&#47; frame contained in header&#47;footer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like advice about how to indent text that is next to a text box or frame that is part of a header/footer.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have read that in this case, “indent” mysteriously does not work.&nbsp; I have found that this is correct.&nbsp; However, there must be some way around
 this.</p>
<p>Background:&nbsp; I have created a stationery template in which the first page contains a list of endorsers&nbsp; on the left &nbsp;side of the page.&nbsp; This list is contained in a text box that is part of the footer. &nbsp;I thought that I could solve the problem by inserting
 another text box next to the text that I want indented. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I have run into 2 problems:</p>
<p>The new text box indents the text farther than I want but I can’t reduce the indent even when the text box is smaller.&nbsp; For example, when the text box is 3/8” wide, the text to the right is indented ½ “ on the ruler bar. &nbsp;When I decrease the width of the
 text box to 1/8” the text to the right remains indented ½ “ on the ruler bar.&nbsp; (Distances are not exact and are for illustration purposes only.)&nbsp; “Distance from text” is set at .1” and does not change.</p>
<p>Question:&nbsp; Is there a better work-around to get the text to indent?</p>
<p>Question:&nbsp; If not, how can I get the text to indent less than ½”?</p>
<p>I am trying to understand the logic behind these problems and &nbsp;would appreciate any insights.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You are encountering/describing the problem documented in

 Object</a><span>.” And no, there is no good way around this. You can increase the paragraph indent to clear the text box and provide the desired indent, but then that increased indent will continue on the
 following page where there is not a text box in the margin.<br />

            <p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess I was not clear enough. &nbsp;To clarify: &nbsp;there are two text boxes. &nbsp;One extends down the right-hand side of the page. &nbsp;The other text box is much smaller and is what I want to use for indenting several--but not all--lines of text. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no other work-around, then the question is: &nbsp;why doesn't the size of the indent decrease when I decrease the width of the smaller text box? &nbsp;It is a relatively small point but am trying to understand the logic behind what seems like inexplicable
 behavior. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>Seems to me that you are getting Left and Right mixed up.&nbsp; In the background section of your original post, you said that you had "a list of endorsers&nbsp; on the left &nbsp;side of the page.&nbsp; This list is contained in a text box that is part of the footer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, just increase the width of the textbox so that with it formatted so that the text wraps around it, the text in the body of the document will be positioned where you want it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To maintain separation between the text in the textbox and the text in the body of the document, you can set Left of Right indents as the case maybe (opposite to the side of the document on which the text box is located) to the paragraphs INSIDE the textbox.</p>

            In that case, why not just add indents to the paragraphs instead of using the smaller text box? That is, if you are wanting a left indent on paragraphs that are already displaced by the text box on the right. Perhaps a screen shot would be helpful.

<p>This caught me by surprise. It has been a long time since I attempted it. My response would have been the same as Suzanne's. I first wanted to try putting an intervening text box in the body to see if it made a difference, but it wasn't needed!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text in the body has a 1/2" first line indent through the Style Body Text.&nbsp; The horizontal ruler shows the margin and indent settings for the body text. It looks like I am going to have to revise some web pages and tutorials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text box is in the header. I don't know if the footer would make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you working in an older template in compatibility mode?</p>

            <p>Ah. OK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, in Word 2010 I am not having a problem using a text box set for tight wrapping in the body moving the text in small increments by simply changing the size of the textbox. This one is shown with borders.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>A little wider...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b97194d3-e23b-46be-a4b3-414290ee4b44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b97194d3-e23b-46be-a4b3-414290ee4b44" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And, hanging... </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I deeply appreciate all your thoughts and help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Doug is correct.&nbsp; I mistakenly said that the large text box is on the right-hand side of the page when I should have said “left.”&nbsp; Glad you could figure that out.</p>
<p>Susan is right that without screenshots, it is not easy to understand my question.&nbsp; In the original file, when I decreased the width of the smaller text box, at a certain point the body text would not move any further to the left.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I did not want
 to show the original text, I tried to duplicate the issue in a new file but couldn’t.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5d120828-fb07-405f-8ab3-ed53a6ea6852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5d120828-fb07-405f-8ab3-ed53a6ea6852" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Finally I realized what appeared to be the problem:&nbsp; I had applied the “indent” format to the text to confirm that it does not work.&nbsp; However, I had not removed the indent formatting.&nbsp; Evidently, when a text box was put next to the text, the indent code
 kicked in.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the code was removed, the text moved as expected.</p>
<p>Yet I was not able to duplicate this issue in a new file.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, applying “indent” did not seem to affect the position of the body text next to the text box. &nbsp;This is puzzling and I would appreciate any insights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>You say "the dropdown"... which dropdown?&nbsp; How did you create it?&nbsp; Data Validation, Form Controls or ActiveX?</p>
<p>If it's a Form Control Combo Box, right-click on it and Format Control.&nbsp; Then change the settings on the Properties tab.</p>
<p>If it's an ActiveX Combo Box, you'll need to enter Design Mode (on the Developer tab) before doing the above.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

    <title>m3u playlists not recognized on the N8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aezust  say:</h3>
<h2>            m3u playlists not recognized on the N8</h2>
                    
<p>I created a few .m3u playlists (from a different application) which open fine using programs like VLC and such. The paths are relative from the location of the .m3u file, so I have .m3u files mixed in with my tracks (not in a separate "Playlists" directory).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi Suite has no option to preserve directory structure of tracks, so I am copying the tree of files directly using windows instead of using it's brain-dead sync. I lost all my playlists once and I don't want to use that program to generate them again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the n8 Music Player app, I refresh library and can see the playlist entries corresponding to each of my .m3u files, but each playlist contains 0 tracks. It seems that the music player app is finicky about the playlist format? Does it allow for #EXTM3U
 tags? What are the specs? Where do I file a bug report against this application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Am having the same problem. I cannot get the music player to recognise m3u playlists that worked on my N86 and N95??</p>
<p>As a work around, I noticed if you open the playlists via file manager. You can open the playlist and play. Half the&nbsp;tag info&nbsp;is listed but it works fine.</p>
<p>WHY should I need to is the question? Why can't I run the playlist through the music player directly?</p>

<p>@davesmith, thanks, good workaround but I wonder if anybody knows the reason for not being able to load the playlist from the player.</p>

<p>I had this same problem, I could see the playlist in the music player, but it contains 0 songs. Even if I tried to play the playlist directly from the file manager, I couldn't play it cause it keeps having a system error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the music player Foobar2000 to create the playlist, and it seems that the problem when I first created the playlist for my N8 is that when I plugged it in the PC, the N8's memory card was registered as drive F, while the phone itself recognizes it
 as drive E. So when the playlist was created, it was created following the path drive F, which the N8 could not follow since it reads the memory card as drive E. So I connected the N8 again, changed my memory card's drive letter to E and created the playlist
 again, and my N8 recognized the playlist and I got it to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>My N8 used to recognise m3u playlists until some months ago after a software update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is a real easy way to make playlists if not already discovered - with the phone connected to PC with USB in Media Transfer mode,&nbsp;use Windows&nbsp;Explorer to select all the tracks on the phone wanted in the playlist (you can select folders&nbsp;and tracks,
 and pick and choose using CTRL and SHIFT keys to select groups),&nbsp;right click the selection &nbsp;and in the context menu that appears select Create Playlist and its done apart from giving the list a name.</p>

<p>The 520 isn't compatible with the Zune software. Instead, you will need the Windows Phone app for desktop</p>

<p>Windows Phone 8 uses MTP for media files transfer. While this is supported it is highly unstable and unreliable on XP, even in SP3 with Media Player 10 (Both must be installed for this to even work). Also Windows XP is known to have serious USB issues with
 certain hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes, maybe it's time to move awayd from an ancient and near EOL OS and get WIN7 at least.</p>
