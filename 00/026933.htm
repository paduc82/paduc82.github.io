<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I already have a subscription to 365 Office 365 Business Premium.&nbsp; Would it be possible to add "mailboxes users only" Exchange Online, to the same 365 account that I am currently using to reduce cost.</p>
<p><br />
thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have the following issue with a Lumia 950 XL, Current Branch Build 14393.953 (the most recent one): sometimes I cannot open Excel Word or pdf files attached to email messages.</p>
<p>It does not happen for all the emails, it is not happening only for some email addresses (it is general, it can happen for emails coming from any email address/domain), there are email messages with 2-3 attachments and only one is not opening. I receive
 sometimes reports by email that I cannot open, but the next day, when I receive the same report with updated information, I can open it.</p>
<p>The files that are not opening are showed with an unknown file extension icon and, If I click them, it takes me to Store in order to find an app to open the files. In Store I get the message "Your search for "." had no results".</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and installed, of course, the Office and Adobe Reader apps, but it did not help.</p>
<p>I had the same issue in the previous build and after the last week's update nothing happened.</p>
<p>I have discussed with 3 chat experts from Microsoft and B2X and they told me to wait for the next build which might solve the problem, but this is my main device, so I need a solution.</p>
<p>I have also posted the issue in the Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking about reinstalling the OS using Recovery Tool to see if that helps or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you seen this issue before?</p>
<p>Is this known?</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Word crashes when scrolling during save - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word crashes when scrolling during save</h2>
                    <p>I am working now on a rather large document, about 150 pages. Word crashed a lot during save. I noticed that it happened when I tried to scroll the document before the save process was finished. This being a rather large document, saving it takes a couple
 of seconds (which I also find a bit strange, since I have a new and fast computer), so when I try to scroll down during these few seconds, Word crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be solved?</p>
<p>

    <title>Manipulating shapes with code runs slower and slower - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jahbur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manipulating shapes with code runs slower and slower</h2>
                    
<p>My application needs to manipulate shapes with code. However in PowerPoint 2007 and also PowerPoint 2010, simply moving a shape takes an increasingly longer period to do. In other words, the same code runs slower and slower - in testing I have got this to
 over 15 seconds for a routine that started out taking 0.1 seconds! This occurs both in edit mode and when running a slideshow.<br />
<br />
There is also a simple, but strange 'fix' to all this. If the user manipulates a shape manually on the slide, or even types in a letter into the notes pane, say, then the routine will suddenly run again at optimum speed. However, this has to be done manually.
 Any programmatic changes I make do not do this.</p>
<p>Here's some sample code to 'do it yourself'.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add some shapes to slide 1 of a presentation (the more you add the quicker you'll see the results - 10-15 is enough)</li><li>Open the VBA editor (ALT-F11) </li><li>Click on Insert and Module </li><li>Paste the following code </li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have posted this previously to the PowerPoint forum before PP2010 came out, but although useful suggestions were made no solution was found. I also 'sent a frown' to Microsoft during the 2010 beta testing and posted on the Beta forums. No one from MS replied,
 and the bug was not fixed in the release version of PowerPoint 2010. I post it here again, because I know I am not the only one who is suffering from this, and it would be nice if a workaround can be found while a permanent fix is created. If MS have decided
 never to fix it, it would also be nice for them to say so.</p>

<p>I can just confirm that the same behaviour is shown for Powerpoint in Office 2007 on Windows Vista.</p>

<p>I did this same experiment earlier in the year for PowerPoint 2007.&nbsp; I have a utility that creates multiple slides automatically, adding a bunch of shapes to each slide.&nbsp; As slides are added, the code runs slower and slower.&nbsp; I have found no programmatic
 solution to this.&nbsp; Just as you have observed, simply making an edit manually speeds up the code again.&nbsp; It's frustrating, because the reason for automating repetative actions is to speed things up, and yet in this case it seems to slow things down!</p>
<p>Come on, Microsoft - this has to be an easy fix!</p>

<p>Try setting the objects that your code creates to Nothing when your code is finished using them in order to free memory.</p>
<p>For example, your code contains the following lines.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim sl As PowerPoint.Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Set sl = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)</span></p>
<p>When your code is finished using sl, it should be set to Nothing by adding the following line.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set sl = Nothing</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, but as sl is local and declared within the subroutine, unless I'm missing something it doesn't need to be set to Nothing - that's done automatically when the sub exits.</p>
<p>In any case, setting it to nothing makes no difference to the results I'm afraid.</p>

<p>I have had this problem with 2003 and 2007. It's as though a restore file is being accumulated somewhere which just builds up forever and slows everything down. It would really help to have a solution or work around for this.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my original post, I did post this in the PowerPoint 2010 beta forum. A later poster queried whether anyone from MS actually paid any attention to all the information and this came back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We definitely do pay attention to this forum and the many others out there. We don't always respond because there are a lot fewer of us than there are of you, for the most part. :)</p>
<p>We use dozens of different sources of information to help us figure out what to build and fix, including everything from usage data from our opt-in "Customer Experience Improvement Program", to crash data from Watson, to feedback on our blogs, and questions
 from forums like this one. During the beta processes, we use Send-a-smile/frown quite a lot. It is a terrific way of getting feedback to us. We've made literally dozens of noticeable improvements to the product based directly from SaS feedback (not to mention
 100s of bug fixes from crash data). The MVPs also do a really fantastic job of surfacing issues they've found to be common in their wide-ranging travels across the web, and interaction with the community.</p>
<p>Just because we're not responding, doesn't mean we aren't listening. :)</p>
<p>And thanks for all of the feedback that you and others have been giving on this forum. It's been much appreciated.</p>

Hopefully Sean or a colleague is watching and can let us all know what is happening here, and whether it is ever going to be fixed.<br />

<p>I did a test of the suggestion that saving the file would clear out the Undo cache and speed things up.&nbsp; The code below allowed me to run my test case (build 50 slides, each with 250 random shapes) with varying periodic saves of the file during the run.&nbsp;
 I first ran the code without saving the file at all - this was the slowest case.&nbsp; The amazing thing is, the fastest case is the one where the file is saved after creating each slide.&nbsp; There was a factor of almost 20 speedup in total time required between the
 slowest case (don't save at all) and the fastest case (save after every slide is created).&nbsp; I guess the file save action is pretty fast for subsequent saves, because it does not seem to increase the time per slide at all.</p>

            Thanks a lot for the info. I'm not sure I like the idea of having to save the file through code as we run live events with large presentations, but it might be the lesser of two evils for the moment. It just looks like PowerPoint is crying out for a simple
 ActivePresentation.ClearUndoCache method.

<br />
Agreed!&nbsp; Until then, I've written a simple macro that creates a temporary file to save to while I'm running.&nbsp; The only problem with that is remembering (or reminding the user) to save to a real file in the correct folder.

<h2>            How to remove word add-ins&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Using Microsoft Word Professional 2010 on Windows 7 Ultimate service pack 1.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the Add-Ins Tab I get 3 groups, the last one is from an Add in I’m working on at VS but the first 2
<b>I need to remove</b>. The tool tip of the button of one of the add ins I'm trying to remove shows DocSmartzToolBar : TrialDocSmartz Import PDF.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In word I tried: Developer|Com Add-Ins. But there only shows mine, 2 unchecked from OneNote and the visual studio tool for office.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>


<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, with show hidden files option went to …/Program Files (86x)/MicrosoftOffice/Office14/STARTUP but it is empty (maybe shouldn’t be).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Back in word: File|Options|Add-In. Several files, including mine but none that looks as it could be one of those I’m trying to delete plus no action I can take on those shown there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then tried:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Developer|Add-Ins. Nothing there. </span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Developer|Add-Ins. Nothing there. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ran word as administrator, retried everything, no changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Went to control panel | uninstall or change program. Pretty sure had previously uninstalled those since I’m in the habit of doing so with anything I install and then find no use for it.
 Sure enough couldn’t fine anything DocSmartz related.</span></p>

            <p>It you still see the Add-Ins tab in Safe mode, then something strange is going on. That was my point.<br />
<br />
I would expect the commands you mention to be missing in Safe mode. This points us back to the previously mentioned sources: a Startup folder add-in or a COM add-in. Or, which I forgot to mention, code added to the Normal template.</p>

<h2>            OneNote 2010 for Project Management</h2>
                    I'm considering using OneNote 2010 for Project Management, how do I secure content on specific tabs but still allow others to view it? I can password protect individual tabs but the content isn't viewable unless the tab is unlocked. I want to have a Project
 Overview type tab but I don't want just anyone involved with the project to be able to modify it!

            You could try setting the relevant .ONE files as "Read-Only" in Windows. I haven't tested that, but it might work.

<h2>            Getting recovery CD from manufacture</h2>
                    HP gave me the option to create recovery flash drive prior to installing tech preview. &nbsp;I want to go back to stock 8.1 and tech preview wont run the recovery from flash drive, so I called tech support for HP and hopefully tomorrow i will be sent out a
 recovery cd to get my 8.1 back.

<h2>            Windows 10 NX&#47;PAE</h2>
                    I would like to know if the people developing windows could remove the need for the no execute bit. I am unable to install this to multiple computers that run windows 7 perfectly fine just because of a small cpu feature that is unable to be activated in
 the bios of the machine. Could it be removed or would that cause the whole OS to fall apart? Not sure whether to put this in discussion or question.

            <p>...and there are many laptops that lack that option in BIOS as well. &nbsp;I sure hope that the Windows 10 compatibility scanner will detect that and alert folks before going through with the install on July 29.</p>

<h2>            Improved 808 PureView Software version 022.014&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Today software updater on my 808 is showing an "Improved 808 PureView software" update with version 022.014. Screenshots are attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version 022.014 reminds me of Symbian Anna from a few years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone has product code 059P4K1 and is running 113.010.1507 software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this update real, or problem with the update server? Exactly what does this update do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3> julia harris  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need to insert a &#34;legend&#34; at the bottom of an Excel spreadsheet.  The table that I want to insert was created in 2007 Word and it needs to be the footer in a 2007 Excel spreadsheet.  The inserted table is 4 columns wide and 3 columns deep.</h2>
                    I was trying to create the table as a picture to insert into the footer.&nbsp; However, formatting the table is next to impossible...need someone smarter than me to figure out my "bright idea".

<div>I have been using (previous to Win 7 install) ActiveSync) and have</div>
<div>been able to set it up to sync from Outlook to my phone - one way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can't for the life of me see how to do it with Win 7's Sync Center,</div>
<div>although MS mentions it.</div>

<p>As Prof Julie said, you cannot specify the direction of the sync, it will always be two way. You can specify what to do if there is a conflict.</p>
<p>A conflict is where an item has been updated on both device and PC - you can specify which change to use.</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint to PDF - Page Border Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have formatted my powerpoint such that when it is printed there is about a half inch border. This puts the edge of my text and images at the very edge of the powerpoint screen, but it looks as I want it to printed. I am trying to convert the powerpoint
 to PDF with this white border. Basically, I want a PDF of what the print preview looks like. Please tell me how I can do this.</p>

<p>PowerPoint's slide size (page setup) and the printer (or PDF software) page size are two different things.</p>
<p>You'll need to create a custom printer page size that matches your PowerPoint slide size&nbsp; OR adjust your PowerPoint page size so that it's the same as, or at least proportional to, the printer's page size, which is probably letter (8.5x11) or A4, depending
 on where you live and your computer's settings.</p>
<p>Once the two match up, choose the "Scale to fit paper" option in PowerPoint's Prnit dialog box, pick any other options you like and print.</p>
<p>When you do that, PowerPoint&nbsp;will print your slides as large as it can w/o distortion on the printer driver's current page size.&nbsp; If the two page sizes (PPT's and the printer's) match, your border will be preserved.</p>
<p>That should do ya, I think.</p>

<div>Here is a Macro to overcome the problem with propagation of mail merge field
<div>fields with a label type mail merge when using a Tablet PC and some other </div>
<div>Computers that have Tablet PC Functionality available:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sub MailMergePropagateLabel()</div>
<div>Dim atable As Table</div>
<div>Dim i As Long, j As Long</div>
<div>Dim source As Cell, target As Cell</div>
<div>Dim myrange As Range</div>
<div>Set atable = ActiveDocument.Tables(1)</div>
<div>Set source = atable.Cell(1, 1)</div>
<div>Set myrange = source.Range</div>
<div>myrange.Collapse wdCollapseStart</div>
<div>ActiveDocument.Fields.Add Range:=myrange, Text:="NEXT", _</div>
<div>PreserveFormatting:=False</div>
<div>source.Range.Copy</div>
<div>For j = 2 To atable.Columns.Count</div>
<div>Set target = atable.Cell(1, j)</div>
<div>If target.Range.Fields.Count &gt; 0 Then</div>
<div>target.Range.Paste</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div>Next j</div>
<div>For i = 2 To atable.Rows.Count</div>
<div>For j = 1 To atable.Columns.Count</div>
<div>Set target = atable.Cell(i, j)</div>
<div>If target.Range.Fields.Count &gt; 0 Then</div>
<div>target.Range.Paste</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div>Next j</div>
<div>Next i</div>
<div>atable.Cell(1, 1).Range.Fields(1).Delete</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is suggested that you put this code into a template that you save in the </div>
<div>Word Startup folder so that it becomes an add-in and will be available </div>
<div>whenever you need it. As the macro has the same name as the Word Command </div>
<div>that is supposed to do the job, this macro will run when the Update Labels </div>
<div>button is used when setting up the mail merge label main document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- </div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<p>What is the purpose of your macro?</p>
<p>Show us all of the code that you are using?</p>
<p>When if bombed, was the document on which it was being used a label type mail merge main document?&nbsp; I can imagine that command causing an error if it wasn't.</p>

<p>Hi Doug - thanks for taking a look. I need to run these labels each day for our dietary department to place on menus. They contain the Patients Name and Room Number only. I have placed the sub routine you had for regular PC's (not tables) into the startup
 folder and recorded the following Macro called DietLabels: ( it bombs at the <strong>
WordBasic.MailMerge.PropagateLabels </strong>line.)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>(The idea is that /your/ version of MailMergePropagateLabel is used instead of the standard one, but I suspect that by using the "WordBasic.MailMergePropagateLabel" syntax you are forcing Word to use the standard Command, not your replacement.</p>

<p>1. or perhaps try</p>
<p>Call&nbsp;MailMergePropagateLabel</p>
<p>2. However, to eliminate the possibility that there is a naming problem, you could change</p>
<p>Sub MailMergePropagateLabel()</p>
<p>to (say)</p>
<p>Sub MMPL()</p>
<p>and call it using&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call MMPL</p>
<p>At the very least, you may find that you can identify a line within MMPL that is causing the problems.</p>
<p>3. FWIW, if your label layout is the kind where there are narrow "spacer" columns between the "label" columns, I think the code you are using may /function/, but I think the code in the second macro listed in&nbsp;http://tips.pjmsn.me.uk/t0005.htm is more likely
 to do what you need. Unless you also have spacer "rows".</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com account deleted. How do I restore it&#63;</h2>
                    Hello Support<br />
<br />
I did not realise that MAPI is server side stored emails. I deleted my Outlook.com account, then went to Outlook 2007 and tried to move my mails but couldn't, as the account couldn't be accessed anymore.<br />
<br />
How do I recover my account?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>Hi MicrosoftUserMU,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow me to assist you on the issue about your deleted account though I would like to clarify some details about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your post, you are using Microsoft Outlook 2007 when accessing your account. If you have deleted or removed your email account from the said application, then you wouldn't be able to access it anymore. You have reconfigure your account and then
 access it again using the said application. To do this, I recommend getting in touch with their forum through this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office">link</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not the case which only means that you have already cancelled or closed your Outlook.com account, please know that you can still access it as long as it is still exisiting in the system. Account removal from the system takes about 365 days wherein
 after that the accout will no longer be accessible. If you have other concern about accessing your account, please contact the Microsoft account moderators through this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, please provide us more details about your issue on your next reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to post back if you need clarifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

            Hi Melanie
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Allow me to explain in more detail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have several domains that I have setup to use Outlook.com. I created my own email accounts for those domains by going to domains.live.com and creating them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then downloaded Outlook Connector and setup each email account inside Outlook 2007.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then moved all my old emails (from previously being POP accounts) into the new MAPI email accounts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After extensive evaluation, I chose to no longer use Outlook.com. I went to domains.live.com and deleted the email accounts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The accounts are still active inside Outlook 2007, but when I try and copy all my old emails from the MAPI Inbox and MAPI Sent Items to a POP account folder, I get an error message telling me that an error has occurred and that the email can't be moved
 because the account can't be accessed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That is why I asked for my Outlook.com email accounts on domains.live.com to be restored, so that I can access my emails again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried to recreate the email accounts online, using the same email address and password and it told me that the password is invalid. It suggested that I enter a new password, but I am concerned that if I choose a new password with the same email address
 I will loose all my emails as the system will think it is a brand new account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

            Do you have connected or link account to your Hotmail account? Does the contact you wanted to edit was manually added to your contact list or imported from your connected account?<br />
<br />
You can only edit contacts which you have manually added to your contact list. If the contact is imported or sync from another email account, then the option to delete and edit contacts will not be available.<br />

            <p>cjharris23 -&nbsp; you are not going to believe me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked Microsoft forum about this a while back.&nbsp; All of a sudden when I went back to my addresses, I clicked on the name, and lo &amp; behold - the edit button was still there, so I was able to change the address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really weird, because it's happened again - as if mysteriously someone has crept in and fixed it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who knows what it will be like next time I need to change an address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to delete the contact altogether and re-enter it.</p>

            The maps themselves come with a limited amount of data that sometimes needs additional input from the Smart2Go server. If you allow your phone some kind of network access it usually grabs this extra data and it then works.<br />
<br />
Also, the v11.x firmware update fixed a lot of mapping issues where it was not finding a route or result because of a memory issue. If you are able to, upgrading your firmware might help.

            Are you sure those maps have been properly downloaded onto phone's memory card ? If so, have you given your phone enough time to sync with satellites ? You need at least 3 synced satellites (as shown by 3 black bars in the Map &gt; options &gt; View &gt; satellite
 info.<br />
<br />
Once it is all synced, the gps will be ready and able to plan routes and also perform navigation.

<h2>            Files and Apps Corrupted &#47; Deleted on Nokia 500</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, while using Xplore App, I deleted many files from <strong>C Drive</strong> and now many of things of my phone isn't working. Nokia Store's icon has gone and nor its working, Gallary and some pre-installed apps are not working. Also, I found some wierd
 apps on the Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to re-install my firmware from Nokia Store, but after it completed successfully, I found not changes. Also, when I connect my phone to my PC, in Nokia Suite I found that something like "Support Software" isn't getting installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, please help me out to solve it. I'm really frustrated in it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance!</p>

<p>farby, it didn't worked for me. However, I fixed it by flashing the original firmware using Phoenix. By the way, thanks!</p>

<h2>            Text Message Notification</h2>
                    Is there a way to configure Windows Mobile to continually notify when there is an unread text message?<br />
<br />
For example, a group of us at work share the phone when it is our turn to be on-call.&nbsp; Our old on-call phone, which was not a smart-phone, would continually beep, like every minute if there was an unread text message.&nbsp; This notification worked well for when
 you are on-call.&nbsp; But, we have not found a way to configure our new HTC / Windows Mobile 6 phone to do this continual notification.&nbsp; We have the new phone set to notify by playing a sound when there is a new text message, but it only notifies one time, as
 soon as it receives the text message.&nbsp; Can we configure the phone to notify until the message has been marked as read?<br />

<h2>            OneNote 2010&#47;Windows 7 - Unable to Connect to Microsoft OneDrive 0x800701F4</h2>
                    <p>When I open OneNote 2010 on my Windows 7 desktop all of my notebooks are red and I get the following errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/194a8d6e-894d-4352-a313-39d9c3429367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/194a8d6e-894d-4352-a313-39d9c3429367" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>After some time it will eventually connect and sync as designed. Can anything be done to make it connect right away like it has done for years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note: The recent problem with my notebooks closing every time I open the program was just recently resolved, and that's when this new problem began.</p>

            I turned on my desktop this morning and it worked fine. Then I turned on my laptop and none of my notebooks would connect. The problem still exists...
