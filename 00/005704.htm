            You may be seeing Outlook.com because your account was automatically upgraded from Hotmail.
<br />
<b>Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.</b><br />
<br />
Why was my account chosen to be upgraded automatically?<br />
<b><br />
When we launched Outlook.com preview, we shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com.
</b><br />
To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process.<br />
<b><br />
Can I switch back to Hotmail?</b><br />
<br />
If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.<br />
<b><br />
To see if you have the option to switch back, check for the Switch back to Hotmail link in Outlook.com.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring to the new Outlook interface, you can refer to JMH3143's post on how to switch back to Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have renamed your account from @hotmail.com account to @outlook.com account, you can refer to this article on how to change back to your old Hotmail account:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your issue here in&nbsp; Microsoft Community Forum.</p>

<p>As I understand your concern, you are unable to log in to your Hotmail.com accounts which is now Outlook.com. For us to identify what might be the cause of this issue, can you verify if you get any error message when you tried to log in to the account(s)?
 We also need you to provide the affected email address(s) to check it on our end.

    <title>Default email account not accessible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jnoneal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default email account not accessible</h2>
                    <p>I have an outlook.com email address that is the primary address associated with my Microsoft account.&nbsp; If I look on my Lumia 640 LTE under Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Your email and accounts, the address shows up there at the top under my name, under "Email, calendar,
 and contacts" (right below "Add an account") and at the very bottom under "Accounts used by other apps" since it's the address I created my Microsoft account with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I tap the email account, it brings up the Manage button and allows me to change my sync settings and account settings and so forth.&nbsp; Yay! My phone recognizes that I have an outlook.com email account!&nbsp; However, if I open Outlook Mail, it just says "Not
 synced yet" and there is no option under anything to sync it.&nbsp; If I open Accounts, the Manage Accounts screen opens, and there is no account shown on that screen.&nbsp; I get the options to Link Accounts or Add account.&nbsp; If I select Link accounts, that's a dead
 end, because it doesn't show any accounts to link.&nbsp; If I "Add an account", I can go through the process of entering my outlook.com username and password, after which the phone tells me (paraphrased) "Great!&nbsp; You're all set up!"&nbsp; and then takes me right back
 to where I started in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone a couple of months ago had this exact problem and posted it somewhere on Microsoft's site.&nbsp; However, his problem was solved two days later when his phone updated to a new version of Windows Mobile.&nbsp; That didn't help me.&nbsp; My phone is set to auto-update,
 and both Windows and Outlook are up to date.&nbsp; I can add other email addresses just fine (although I don't have any installed/active right now).&nbsp; It's only the default email account that I have any issues with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not like I'm dying to have my outlook.com emails accessible at the tap of a screen, but nonetheless I find it extraordinarily annoying that it's not working.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>

 else, so how can I do it?

            It doesn't matter whether you have an electronic download or a physical retail copy (DVD), the Analysis ToolPak is not included with Excel 2011.<br />
<br />
The Analysis ToolPak was dropped from Mac Office effective with the Office 2008 release due to that version having no support for VBA (required for the add-ins to run). It was not added back in Office 2011. See the alternatives here:

<p>Do you know what build you were on. If it was an older build you could download the ISO from the Insider Advanced site which is at 17127 and burn it to a bootable USB key to Update with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or go to the Public download site and use the media creation tool to make a Installer for 17134.xxx and update to that. But if your build was later than either of those you will only be able to do a clean Install.</p>

            So that means you will have to wait for an ISO that is newer than 17604 or you will need to do a clean install of the Public Build 17134.xxx from the Public Download site. Then rejoin it to Insiders if you want.<br />

            <p>raghuraj3584,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time this is caused because you are trying to move the pagebreak past the automatic pagebreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the print settings can only handle 60 rows, many people try to put in a manual pagebreak at say 70 rows and then wonder why it doesn't work.&nbsp;
 You can't make the printer print more rows than it is configured for just by changing the pagebreak.&nbsp; It will work if you want to make it print less than 60 rows (referencing my example).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am just guessing at your situation, but this is usually the problem when someone registers your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel 2013 undo list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donna birch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 undo list</h2>
                    <p>Hello, using Windows 8 with Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In previous versions of Word and Excel, there was a drop-down "history" list of the last operations done.&nbsp; We could click on an item in the&nbsp;Undo&nbsp;list and it and&nbsp;all the operations preceeding it were undone.&nbsp; There does not seem to be a list in Office 2013.&nbsp;
 I checked to see if there was another Undo button that I could add in the Quick Access Toolbar and there is not.&nbsp; In order to undo several operations, I would have to click the Undo button several times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this normal and why would Microsoft change this useful feature?</p>

<p>The drop-down undo history list is disabled when Office is in touch mode. Took me quite a while to figure that out!</p>

            Tom,
<div>Sorry that wasn't successful. I still believe it's file corruption but perhaps the corruption is so strong that the normal methods just don't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I assume you didn't save back to a previous version of Project. Correct?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I recently saw a response on another post in this forum or in the main Project forum (i.e.&nbsp;http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/projectprofessional2010general) about a commercial product that claims to be able to recover corrupt Project files.
 I don't remember the post but you can do a search.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to be sure the bases are covered, can you create a new Project file, save it and then re-open it? If not, then something is wrong with Project itself. However, if a new file works fine, you may need to bite the bullet and revert back to the last valid
 version of the file and start from there.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Company just purchased the program and this file was created in the same MS Project 2010 pro just last week. I have contacted MS and they were no help without a credit card payment of $296.00. Love customer support these days.. HA&nbsp;. &nbsp;I do not have a backup
 of the file. and may have to recreate the file from scratch. </p>

            Tom,
<div>Yeah, unless you have a support contract with Microsoft, you're not going to get much help. That's just the way the business works. That's also why forums exist.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Very unfortunate that you do not have a backup. I know this is stating the obvious, but there is a lot to be said for save and save often and do backup on a regular basis. One other tip, I always use Save As back to the same filename, unless I'm creating
 a backup, then I save to a different name. I never use just a straight Save. I'm told it doesn't matter with today's apps, but I've never been burned with my method and I don't have file corruption or bloat issues either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm curious. You mentioned that you saved to PDF. Why is that?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, it is rather rare that a single stand alone Project file becomes corrupt. Corruption normally results when the user is doing something different. For example, linked structures, whether external predecessor/successor links between files, a master/subproject,
 a resource pool/sharer, a file with paste links, or working with different versions of Project, are much more prone to corruption. Do you have any of those?</div>

            <p>Good Morning John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is a stand alone project, no links to any other data. I did back up often and worked on it over several days&nbsp;closing it at the end of&nbsp;each day with no issues opening it the following morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;I made a PDF file to send to my reprographic printers I find
 it much easier to email in a PDF and I don't have to worry about someone else accidently making any changes.&nbsp; Is there a way to go back to an earlier saved version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Pardon me for bumping in - just a couple of quick questions.&nbsp; Do you have SP-1 installed to Project 2010?&nbsp; When you attempt to open the file are you opening through Project or attempting to open through Windows explorer?<br />

            Tom,
<div>I'm a little confused. In an earlier post you said you did not have a backup but now you say you backed up often. Maybe its the terminology. When I say "backup" I mean a separate copy of the file that is saved and no longer used as the active file for
 editing. So going back to an earlier version is as simple as going to the folder where you saved your backups and open up the latest one. This is not the same as the autosave feature available with most applications. Some operating systems do have an auto-backup
 feature, but it has to be setup by the user at some point.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Okay, I understand about the PDF save. Sharing Project files via e-mail only works if the recipient also has Project. I wouldn't expect that to have any bearing on the fact that you now cannot open your file?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm still assuming your file is corrupt but there are a couple other things you could try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, trash your working Global by moving it to the trash, but do not empty the trash. If you have a normal installation you should find your working Global at: c:Users/[your computer name[/App Data/Roaming/Microsfot/MS Project/14/1033. When you restart
 Project it will automatically generate a new default Global file. Note: You will lose all custom formatting, view, tables, etc. If this doesn't fix the problem, you can recover your original Global from the trash and put it back in the working directory.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second, you could have a corrupt user profile. Try creating a new user account and see if that allows you to open the file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Julie makes a good point. I normally ask if the user has SP1 installed but I didn't specifically ask in your case. However, if you company just recently bought Project 2010, then it is likely the version you have includes SP1.</div>

    <title>Initial ipressions of Build 10158 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Initial ipressions of Build 10158</h2>
                    <p>I was one of the lucky ones who managed to upgrade yesterday without incident.&nbsp; I've been able to upgrade successfully to each release since 10041 &nbsp;which was a disaster for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry to hear about the problems so many of you are having
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some of the things I have noticed on&nbsp;Day 1:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The UI looks pretty much the same. The problem with text being truncated on the live tiles has been fixed.<br />
</li><li>The People App still loads and then crashes.<br />
</li><li>Still don't have the ability to selectively install only the updates you want<br />
</li><li>Mail App shows no improvement. Still can't select all messages in a folder, nor create mail folders. Given the many other mail programs out there, I can't see anyone using this app.<br />
</li><li>The browser is now know only as Edge and has an icon that is very similar to MS Explorer.&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>Lots of enhancements to Cortana announced, but I haven't had a chance to check these out. My laptop doesn't have a mic so Cortana is of limited use to me anyway.<br />
</li><li>The error message on shutdown has been fixed<br />
</li><li>A new problem for me: sometimes when I launch an app from the start menu, the start menu doesn't go away and the app is opened behind it, not useable. I need to restart to get around this problem.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I would like to see some assurances from MS that the way in which Windows handles&nbsp;device interrupt problems&nbsp;has been fixed so that the BSOD DPC watchdog errors can no longer happen. These errors only started happening in Windows 8 and were a huge problem
 for many users. As we have seen these errors have continued to be a huge problem in earlier builds of Windows 10. Surely they can come up with a better system than this.<br />
</li><li>Flixster now shows up in the store. I think a lot of the other missing apps will&nbsp; re-appear over time.
</li></ul>

 after pressing the "run" icon was stopped and this notice appeared &nbsp;saying "Sorry. We ran into a problem streaming Office. Try again later. Error Code 30015-25 (-1610612708)". What does that mean? and how can I install Office 365 in my laptop?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>None of the Office 365 programs on my laptop will open at all, when I click on them nothing happens. When I try to open a document it comes up with an error message saying: "Window's cannot find "insert file name and location here'. Make sure you typed the

<h2>            How do I get my inbox folders re-aligned after upgrading to outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>After the upgrade to outlook.com, I now have my hotmail.com inbox as a sub folder of the inbox. This is a real pain for accessing this mailbox on using the hotmail connector on my smartphone as the hotmail..com sub folder is not the primary inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also lost my juink mail filtering that I had set on my hotmail account, and although I have set it to exclusive only I am getting lots of junk into my hotmail.com inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>bottom line is how do I get all of my messages from the hotmail.com inbox moved to the outlook.com top level inbox so that the filters are being applied correctly.</p>

                    I manage a couple calendars.&nbsp; Lately, a bunch of appointments&nbsp;from myself and others aren't posting to one particular&nbsp; calendar.&nbsp; I can't seem to pin-point a similarity in the appt.'s that aren't posting.&nbsp; This is not good considering my job is to manage
 the calendars!&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p>Sure.&nbsp; Yesterday someone was calling to confirm that an appt. with my boss was taking place.&nbsp; I advised it wasnot on her calendar when looking at the invite list, she was on the distribution list.&nbsp; Also, I sent about a dozen appt.s to her as well. When comparing
 side by side....the appt.s weren't there.&nbsp; I selected (Send Update) and it popped onto her calendar.&nbsp; I can't seem to find a common thread with the missed appointments.....any ideas?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; The KB article described that screen clipping may not be available due to Information Rights Management (IRM) and recommeds clossing any documents or application that is protected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, I closed all application, but screen clipping is still not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to note, on the Insert tab in One Note 2011, the "Screen Clipping" icon is grayed out also.</p>

<h2>            Add endnotes page to Table of Contents</h2>
                    I am formatting my paper and using endnotes. I am using styles to create a TOC. I use a style called Header 1 and Subhead to populate my TOC. I have highlighted the section titles, chapters, etc with Header 1 styling. Unfortunately all sections but ENDNOTES
 appear in the TOC. It is as if the auto formatting can't see the ENDNOTES page at all, much less that the title of that section is highlighted correctly.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have made sure that my styles are correct. They are that is why the other sections are showing up correctly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Question:</div>
<div>How do I format the endnotes section of the paper to be recognized and added to auto formatting for TOC creation?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW, I am using the built-in endnotes/footnotes not the Endnotes.app</div>

            After I closed and opened the file, the spacing issues seemed to fix themselves. I think that Widow and Orphan Control adds an extra space of Body Text to fill the gap. I don't know why it was added to the beginning of the document. Regardless, saving,
 closing, and reopening it the next day seemed to fix the issues I was having.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>To account for the extra empty space where the Endnote separator would have gone I copied the formatting of the header ( the one with ENDNOTES ), created a new style from that and reduced the space at the top to give me correct spacing from the top of
 the page.&nbsp;</div>

It's based on Word for Windows but there's virtually no difference on a Mac.<br />
<br />
In your case, it looks as though some extra space at the top of the page is because of Space Before/After or other paragraph attributes of the style used in the heading. There also appears to be some instances where the return key has been used to force vertical
 spacing -- I'd suggest getting rid of those empty ¶s, although the ones for Header/Footer cannot be deleted.<br />

            <p>I have never been required to calculated WACC in the past, hence this is my first attempt on this. The formula for WACC (as per google) -</p>
<p>
</p><p>WACC = (Equity / Total Capital) * Cost of Equity + (Debt / Total Capital) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, your calculation would be -</p>
<p>
</p><p>=(0.6*0.14)+((0.4*0.1)*(1-0.3))</p>
<p>
</p><p>= 11.2%</p>
<p>
</p><p>0.6 - Equity proportion</p>
<p>0.14 - Equity Cost</p>
<p>
</p><p>0.4 - Debt proportion</p>
<p>0.1 - Cost of Debt</p>
<p>0.3 = Tax Rate</p>

<h2>            Need help cancelling Office 365 subscription so I can sign up my domain with Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been having headaches over the last year with trying to get Windows Live Admin Center to manage my domain (<a href="https://domains.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domains.live.com/</a>). Somehow my domain was restricted, you can see the thread where it all started
 (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-wlsettings/this-domain-name-cant-be-used-because-it-contains/58789744-1a60-41f3-9ced-f3974df8162d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-wlsettings/this-domain-name-cant-be-used-because-it-contains/58789744-1a60-41f3-9ced-f3974df8162d</a>),
 I then moved to another thread where the first problem was resolved (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-signin/unable-to-sign-up-to-windows-live-admin-center/daacb805-15a8-4118-9294-226053075003">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-signin/unable-to-sign-up-to-windows-live-admin-center/daacb805-15a8-4118-9294-226053075003</a>).
 Now apparently I am signed up for Office 365 which needs to be cancelled before I can have my domain managed by Microsoft, at least this is what Alden from Microsoft tells me, and then he pointed me here for help. I don't know what Office 365 is exactly, I
 don't remember signing up for it and don't see any option to cancel my subscription (I was never billed).... so I am very confused. I tried following the help (<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/cancel-your-office-365-home-premium-subscription-HA103984711.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/cancel-your-office-365-home-premium-subscription-HA103984711.aspx</a>)
 but I can't find those screens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do? One thing that I've been wondering about, I have a windows phone and there is Office installed on there, is this somehoe related???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Nic</p>

    <title>Yahoo Mail and other sites not working with IE9 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nopn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yahoo Mail and other sites not working with IE9</h2>
                    <p>websites such as NY Times, Yahoo, etc. tell me to upgrade my browser since they no longer support ie9. However, IE9 is the current browser for Vista. After clearing everything out of my system IE9 is still not functioning the way it should. It takes hours
 to compose an email message in yahoo and sometimes in windows live as well. If I use a different browser, i.e. Mozilla firefox, composing an email goes smoothly. What is the problem and what can I do to rectify the issue? It is very frustrating since I do
 not particularly care of Firefox, Opera, etc. and would like to continue using internet explorer.</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi NoPn,<br />
<br />
the web and personal computing&nbsp;has changed a lot in the years since Vista was released (8 years ago)&nbsp;and since IE9 was developed and deployed.... the demands for the modern web (streaming media, super-fast fibre connections, mobile handheld web devices (your
 smartphone) have meant that older browser versions and operating system versions are just not capable of technical and security requirements of the modern web.<br />
<br />
Most operating system vendors like Microsoft have a policy of releasing a new version every three years (to coincide with tax depreciation allowances) and to release the latest technology advancements as fibre connections are rolled out around the world.<br />
<br />
The next release of Windows, windows 10, is due next month... <br />
<br />
If you wish to continue using Vista for your computing needs, then there is no problem with that... but some websites and 'services' (like voice recognition, media streaming, interactive games) will just not work on your Vista machine and IE9. Depending upon
 which version of Firefox of Chromium you have installed, they too will not be able to display all sites or connect to all online services.<br />
<br />
If you are a casual home surfer, then continuing with Vista may be fine for your needs.<br />
Alternatively you could buy a gaming/internet console like Xbox and connect it to your TV for your streaming media and gaming needs. You can also use your mobile smart phone or xbox to surf the web as a replacement for your Vista machine...<br />
<br />
Eventually though, support for IE9 and Vista will end..... you will not be able to receive updates and patches from Microsoft (I beleive this will happen as early as next year)...<br />
<br />
To make the most of what you've got at the moment I would recommend that:<br />
1. You contact your service provider (your cable guy).... Prices have dropped considerably over the past few years... they are sure to have cheaper plans, but if you don't ask they won't give you a cheaper new plan.<br />
2. To speed up your web browsing on your Vista/IE9 computer, disable any addons that you may have installed over the years.....<br />
<br />
Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, uncheck "Enable third party browser extensions"... (close and restart all open IE windows for the changes to take affect).<br />
<br />
3. Seek the assistance of Family or Friends who may be able to assist you with fine tuning your current PC or advise you honestly on the choice of an upgrade platform. (PC, Table, Console, Smart Phone)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Install an anti-virus product like Microsoft security essentials (download and install it from
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a><br />
<br />
and&nbsp;keep your machine up-to-date with the latest releases and patches from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Start menu&gt; Windows Update (remember Windows update for IE9 will reach its end of support life early next year)...<br />
<br />
I trust I have been of help... I do not work for nor represent MS... these are public support forms... answers are provided by both MS staffers and other general public computer enthusiasts.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

Thank you for your prompt and incisive reply. However, please know I have done the basics in an effort to "fix" my problem.
</span><br />
As a rule I keep my computer as clean as possible by monthly or sometimes weekly running programs to run interference with any "junk" that has been hiding in my system. I use CCleaner and have Norton 360 as my anti-virus. My add ons are disabled as well as
 start up programs and I keep my system updated as the updates become available. I have wiped, swiped, defragged, cleaned and re-cleaned every aspect of my computer.</span><br />
I do not download games and stream certain programming using a ROKU set top box (which I have been using for several years).&nbsp; I have one basic service with Cablevision and that is for internet service.
</span><br />
This issue to me is relatively new and do not know anyone with Vista who is experiencing this problem. My cable service recently upgraded everyone's service in compliance with Tom Wheeler's newer rules toward Internet Neutrality according to a newspaper report
 (Cablevision, a/k/a Optimum). Other than the browser I cannot figure out wherein lies the problem.</span><br />
I understand what you're saying about the world wide web and it's wiring (copper and/or fiber optic) and its operation and I do agree with what you're saying. I assimilate that with upgrading your home's electrical panel to handle things like microwaves, dishwashers,
 etc. that were high-end luxury items years ago when a majority of houses were built after WWII with 150amp electrical panels.
<br />
<br />
However, typing a simple e-mail or a document the browser should not be stalled every other letter or word to take hours to complete. That is the crux of my problem.
<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your input and I hope this will provide clairification to the actual problem. I am not a "youngster" and am "self taught", so please bear this in mind so that your solution is in as basic terminology as possible.
<br />
Thanks again and Regards,<br />
Nopn<br />

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. You said my choices are Chrome, Firefox or Opera. Are any of these NOT connected to Google?
<p>I am not saavy enough to use Tor or probably one of the Ubuntu programs (Linux?) and don't know anyone who is computer literate to help me with one of them. Any other suggestions?
</p>
<p>I use my computer for light browsing, streaming programs thru my Roku set top box to my TV. I stopped working from home this May, so I'm not madly typing documents, etc.
</p>
<p>I know I'm going to lose Vista support, but I'm not sure how much that will matter considering the internet will only be used for personal educational enrichment and streaming entertainment. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Many Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>Nopn</p>

<p>OLEOLOGY,</p>
<p>Project 2010 is three versions old, well beyond still being available for download from Microsoft. If you already have a valid license and product key I suggest you contact Microsoft support and explain your dilemma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not already have a license then you can find older versions of Project from various on-line sites but be very careful, a good many of websites I've seen are for illegal counterfeit versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Best EQ setting for bass&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> __l__  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best EQ setting for bass&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
Well i am not able to get a proper EQ setting to get high bass(even higher than the bass boost, something like mega bass :) ). SO anyone can help me with this EQ setting?<br />
ITs for n96(and pretty much every other current nokia's offering).<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            firstly, that depends on what specifications the phone has itself which you cannot change save for the EQ settings. and secondly, the "best" EQ settings is a subjective setting, it will be different for everyone depending on their tastes/preference for
 bass etc. so basically all you can do is play around with the EQ settings until you find something that suits you.

            yea so i am basically asking what's best for others as i can try those.<br />

            Getting really good bass out of the supplied headset isn't easy.<br />
<br />
The best way to improve the bass is to invest in a good set of earbud style headphones. This makes more difference than the equalizer.<br />
<br />
If you want to modify an equalizer for more bass your should copy the rock or bass booster preset and increase the two or three sliders on the left as these effect bass.<br />
<br />
It really is a trial and error process that you will have to tweak to your own tastes.

            Bose are expensive but not very good IMHO.<br />
<br />
I think Sennheisers HD450 or higher grade big cans are better.<br />
<br />
IF you really want good headphones here's a list for you:<br />

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>In the future, use InPrivate mode when accessing your e-mail account on a computer that's public, shared or owned by someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get to InPrivate mode from Tools on the IE menu Bar. After you finish and close all Internet Explorer windows, there should be no record of your activity in Cookies, History or Temporary Internet Files.</p>
