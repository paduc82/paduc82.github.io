            <p>Hi, </p>
<p><br />
Please check if you have performed these steps to disable the driver signature enforcement in Windows 10 Technical Preview.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>a. Press the <strong>Win + C</strong> and click on <strong>PC settings. </strong>
</p>
<p>b. Switch over to the “<strong>Update &amp; recovery</strong>” section.</p>
<p>c. Then click on the <strong>Recovery option</strong> on the left hand side.</p>
<p>d. Once selected, you will see an advanced startup section appear on the right hand side. You will need to click on the “<strong>Restart now</strong>” button.</p>
<p>e. Once your Computer has rebooted you will need to choose the <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>option.</p>
<p>f. Then head into<strong> Advanced options.</strong></p>
<p>g. Then <strong>Startup Settings.</strong></p>
<p>h. Since we are modifying boot time configuration settings, you will need to restart your computer one last time.</p>
<p>I. Here you will be given a list of startup settings that you can change. The one we are looking for is “<strong>Disable driver signature enforcement</strong>”. To choose the setting, you will need to press the
<strong>F7 </strong>key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. </p>
        </p>

<h2>            Charged without my consent for &#36;20&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox live expired a while ago, I logged in to play CoD: Ghosts and use the 7-Day trail code. I was prompted to update my account payment option or play offline. Ok so I updated that and next thing I know, there was no option to select IF I wanted to buy
 what membership sub, and that my next billing date is on the 2nd of next month. WDF? I checked my bank account and I'm being charged $19.99 by microsoft? I didn't authorize that and since when does a 1-month which is what they charged me for, cost $19.99?
 How do I get that canceled I didn't even choose to buy anything. I keep getting the option to call them, is emailing not an option? This is bogus! If microsoft wont do anything can I get my bank to cancel it?</p>

<h2>            Two step validation for Skype is sending verification code to an email address that doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
                    I have had a Skype account for several years, with a small amount of credit on it. Recently, using it on a new device it asked me to set up two step verification. I must have mistyped my email address because now every time I try to get in, I get in a
 loop where it tells me it is sending a code to (email)@aok.com, when of course my real email is @aol.com. There seems no way for me to get my identity and credit back because it won't let me change it again without the code that I cannot access. Any ideas?&nbsp;

            <p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If WMP appears to be missing then it&nbsp;is, for most users,&nbsp;"reloaded"&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;downloaded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not available as a download except for those special Windows N or K or KN versions sold in Europe or Korea that were&nbsp;deliberately sold without WMP already installed.&nbsp; If you have one of those special versions then you can see that stated in the window
 of Control panel, System - the top of the window will show the version as Windows 7 Pro N/ K /KN rather than just Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have one of the special regional N/K/KN versions then use this link
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">WMP for N-K-KN editions - download Media Feature Pack - Microsoft Download Center</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;
 [<em>this download does not work for normal versions i.e. ones that shipped with WMP already included]</em>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a normal version then use this procedure to "reload" it:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Control Panel, </span></li><li><span>P</span><span>rograms and Features, </span></li><li><span>[left-hand side] Turn Windows features on or off, </span></li><li><span>Media Features, </span></li><li><span>set the Windows Media Player checkbox, </span></li><li><span>Yes, </span></li><li><span>OK, </span></li><li><span>Restart the PC.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all the above, I have responded to your description of the problem.&nbsp; It might be the case that WMP has not disappeared but for some reason your shortcut to it has disappeared.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make a new&nbsp;shortcut to it&nbsp;by right-clicking on the exe file &amp; selecting
<em>Create shortcut</em>.&nbsp; The exe file is at</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe"</p>
<p>or {on&nbsp;for a&nbsp;64 bit Windows computer}</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own shortcut, made by Windows and never altered is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe" /prefetch:1</p>
<p>or {on my 64 bit Windows computer}</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe" /prefetch:1</p>
<p>so it seems appropriate to add those extra terms to the shortcut once you have made it.&nbsp; Just right-click on the shortcut, select
<em>Properties</em> &amp; add {leave a space before it} &nbsp;<em>/prefetch:1 </em>to the end of the entry in the target box.</p>

<h2>            Windows Experience Index Causes System Reboot</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Let me just start by saying that I build computers as a hobby, so I have a intermediate knowledge.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem occurs when I attempt to run the Windows Experience Index.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The CPU goes at 100% usage and it causes the system to reboot somewhere around the time that it performs the Geometry Assessment.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's ran before and never had a problem until now. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried the following with no results: Uninstalling and then Re-installing the video drivers, memtest, sfc scannow from the command prompt, chkdsk, deleting prior results and resetting the WEI scores from the data folder in performance, formal WinSAT
 run from the command prompt, and updating all available drivers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've ruled out overheating, lack of power from the PSU, and bad graphics cards as I've been able to run 3dmark 11 xtreme and also played Skyrim at max settings and it doesn't cause any problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My system specs:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 Home Premium x64</div>
<div>Intel Core-I5 2500k @ 3.3Ghz with Turbo enabled</div>
<div>Asus Sabertooth P67 Motherboard</div>
<div>2x EVGA GTX 570 HD Superclocked SLI enabled, Driver V: 290.53 beta</div>
<div>8 gigs Gskill Sniper DDR3 1866mhz</div>
<div>OCZ 1010w PSU</div>
<div>Crucial M4 64 gb Solid State Drive, SATAIII (boot drive)</div>
<div>Western Digital Caviar Black 1tb HDD (Storage)</div>
<div>Acer 23.6" 120hz 3d Monitor</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please let me know if you need any additional information!</div>
                </div>

            Well, okay here's the deal.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I tried the "Disable automatic restart on system failure"</div>
<div><br />
<div>This method didn't work. I also tried disabling turbo mode on the CPU, which also didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried disabling Aero and setting everything to classic view, also didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To answer your question, yes I had added different RAM, I used to have Corsair 8gb 1333 ddr3 and I switched to the G-Skill 8gb 1866 ddr 3 which mem-tested flawlessly at the advertised settings. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also tried downloading and running WinASO Registry Cleaner and ran it until no problems were detected...still couldn't run WEI.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was finally able to get the ratings from Windows Experience Index, but only after I did one little thing...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I disabled SLI and set the 2nd GPU at a dedicated Physx processor.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I'm not sure if I have a defective card, which I'm not sure how seeing how it runs 3dMark 11 with SLI no problems as well as extended gameplay, or that WEI just flat out doesn't like SLI rigs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, thank you for the help! I'll report again if I have any additional problems.</div>

<h2>            How can I add folders to the Desktop Toolbar in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    My Desktop Toolbar in Windows 10 lists folders and allows you to peruse the folders and contents. Two of these folders are Onedrive and Box Sync and neither one of these folders reside on my desktop. I would like to add additional folders that do not reside
 on my desktop to the Desktop Toolbar. How can I accomplish this?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to Desktop Toolbar on taskbar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then let me confirm that OneDrive option will appear&nbsp;in the list by default. Placing any item on desktop will automatically appear in the Desktop Toolbar list. I understand you require the items should appear in the toolbar list, even though they
 won't reside on desktop. If that is the case, you can go with the <strong>New toolbar
</strong>option. Right-click on the taskbar, point to <strong>Toolbars </strong>/&gt;
<strong>New toolbar. </strong>Once you create a new toolbar, place all the desired items into it that you think should appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>
        </p>

            <p>It also appears that my "Box Sync" folder appears in the list by default. The question isn't about how to create a new toolbar, the question is how do I get additional folders to appear in the Desktop Toolbar list without placing it on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clearly since other folders appear in the Desktop Toolbar list (OneDrive and Box Sync as examples) this must be possible.</strong> How is this accomplished? Please note...I want the folders to appear in the Desktop Toolbar on the taskbar; I do not
 want to create a new toolbar.</p>

<h2>            Microphone quits working during calls.</h2>
                    When using Skype, my microphone works at the beginning of the call, but cuts out after a few minutes. Now, when I do the sound test call in Skype, it says my microphone is muted. How can I un-mute it or keep it active throughout my calls? Thanks.

<p>I installed malware software and apparently one of the things it found had taken control of my microphone. Once that was swept, the problem went away. So I think everything is good for now.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft downloads throttling at 0,5Mbps</h2>
                    Hello, I just noticed this issue while I was trying to download the windows iso with the media creation tool to reinstall windows. The download speed did not get over 0,5Mbps from the task manager, tried with a different pc on the same network too. When
 I finally reinstalled windows I noticed updates was throttling at 0,5Mbps too, now I'm trying to install Visual Studio and it's doing the same thing. Every other download, like torrents and direct downloads via browser are not having problems.

            Mavis Beacon is not free. You need to purchase the software legitimately. Sounds like you downloaded a deluxe edition that requires a serial number.

<br />It depends on your laptop, some laptops have that sensor, some do not, we need to check that out - what is the Make and exact Model No. of your Laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . .

<br />Most XPS 13's don'r have a fingerprint reader, if you do have one on your model, see the image below for where to find that:

</p><p>You are unlikely to ever get your Windows 7 working correctly again until you re-install it from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Win10 back to Win7</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process, it is called a “Custom” install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit versions) KB3083710 and KB3102810 in advance, and store on a USB stick,&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; When you search for the&nbsp; 64 bit version of these KB’s specify 64 bit.&nbsp; The 32 bit versions do not say which version they
 are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>BEFORE the newly installed system can go online for the first time, <em><strong>disconnect
</strong></em>the computer from the Internet.&nbsp; This timing is critical.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>
<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.</p>
<p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about 2 days after the 2nd Tuesday, they receive an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015 and since, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will

<p><em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time. You need to wait till you see the number at the bottom of the search window exceed a few hundred.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed (the number at the bottom again exceeds several hundred), enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p><em>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>

<h2>            Ethernet &#40;No Valid IP Configuration, No Network Access&#41; Windows 10 Version 1803</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So after one of the previous Windows updates messed up my tablet monitor and photoshop canvas, I installed the most recent Windows 10 update (version 1803) hoping it would fix it. When it was finished my ethernet completely stopped working. I am relatively
 new to Windows and I had help building my current build but Ethernet is the only source of internet I have. My router is fine, WIFI was still up and I even tested the ethernet cord on my laptop with WIFI off and it worked. I spent hours on my laptop trying
 any solution available and even resorted to calling customer support which was no help at all. The troubleshoot lists the issue as the ethernet having no valid IP configuration. In CMD ipconfig lists an unrelated IPv4 address, no connection-specific DNS suffix
 or Default Gateway and no DNS server addresses even listed. The closest I believe I got to fixing it was going into the TCP/IPv4 properties and manually entering the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and the two DNS server addresses. The internet was
 still not working but troubleshoot listed it at as 'no network access' rather than 'no valid ip config'. This was possibly because I entered the address or gateway wrong but either way, I've been working to fix this for nearly an entire day now and I'm unsure
 whether I should keep trying, give up or just uninstall the update (if I can even do that). Either way, help of any kind would be appreciated and I'd really like to get this fixed with a working canvas in photoshop and no issues with my tablet driver as I'm
 currently hard at work at arts college.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
TLDR; Ethernet Status lists IPv4 and v6 connectivity as 'no network access', ipconfig is missing components and lists an unrelated autoconfig v4 address, troubleshoot lists problem as 'no valid ip configuration', internet, wifi and ethernet is all up and running
 fine the device is connected but can't access the network</p>

            Try disable Norton 360 temporarily to see if it makes a difference. 
<br />You can keep monitoring for a week to see if it stops. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps
<br />Disable all Background apps.
<br />
<br />Also, check whats starting up with Windows.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click Startup tab
<br />Disable all except Windows Defender.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, 
<br />hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: problem reports
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Delete any failed or pending reports.
<br />
<br />Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications and actions &gt; Turn off "Show me tips about Windows."
<br />

<h2>            What programs to disable and Uninstall to stop Windows 10 Fan from constantly running</h2>
                    <p>There are windows programs that you can uninstall/disable to stop the fan from running top speed constantly, I've done it before, but my computer needed to be restored two days ago, and my fan is now running top speed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What programs can I uninstall/disable which Microsoft/windows uses that I can take off? Please state how to uninstall it if you know how to do it, but I can google it if you don't know how.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE NOTE:</p>
<p>1. There is a problem with windows 10 with respect to the fan needlessly running, DO NOT tell me to reduce CPU usage, or change power settings, this are not the problem, it is a program in the background which either runs constantly but not detected as large
 usage by the task manager, or gives false signals telling the computer the fan needs to run at higher speeds.</p>
<p>2. DO NOT post links to other windows forums, they do not exist nor have the answer except for that mentioned in note 1.</p>
<p>3. DO NOT clutter this forum with agreement that you also have the problem, please only answer with programs I, or anyone else, can uninstall without causing windows to crash (or just mention what you're losing by uninstalling it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, I know others have the same frustration.</p>

            That was very helpful, I will look into those. I attempted speed fan, yet it was unable to control the fan speed, although this could be from my lack of knowledge of how to get it to do so despite looking online. Thank you for your efforts!
