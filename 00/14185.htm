            <p>Hello ChrisT2,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the available Zune devices or Windows Phone 7 support <em>
Track Control</em>&nbsp; or <em>Variable Playback</em> options at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Susan, you have every reason to be frustrated, but sarcasm and exaggeration aren't going to make things any better. It's also important to be accurate when explaining your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Of course this is about Outlook Live ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export my emails from Outlook Live </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time anyone mentions Outlook Live. Are you talking about an account provided by an (educational) institution?&nbsp;These accounts should now all come under the Office 365 umbrella, but there may still be some organizations that are a few years
 out of date. If this is your situation, then you should consider asking the institution's IT help desk for assistance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
</p><p>I advised&nbsp;the&nbsp;enquirer&nbsp;in the thread you originally posted in to check his security protocol settings in Internet Options. I specifically mentioned that SSL should

<p>
</p><p>In what way has 'everything changed' so that you can 'no longer use the information on the web'? If you want us to help, you'll have to use a few more words to explain what has happened. If you see an error message, it's important to say what you were doing
 when it appeared and to give its content verbatim.</p>

            <p>Hi Noel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many, many thanks for such a prompt response.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I am totally restraining myself from any witty replies as I&nbsp;am not sure you are in a happy place at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your most serious concerns,&nbsp; may I start by apologising profusely, and clarifying my obviously mentally challenged statements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- "Of course this is about Outlook Live ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export my emails from Outlook Live "</p>
<p>My previous Windows live web email account now proudly says OUTLOOK and the web address says
</p>
<p>'https://outlook.live.com/owa...'.&nbsp; I was unsure if the product had actually changed and thank you for releasing me from this confusion.</p>
<p>My Windows Live email is linked to my Microsoft account (login.live.com)</p>
<p>My personal email is the primary email on that account</p>
<p>My service provider is one of the largest internet providers in Australia (iinet) who use IMAP servers</p>
<p>I do believe I contacted iinet and spent an hour on the phone trying various solutions with them on October 30 2016 to no avail.&nbsp; I could be wrong though.&nbsp; It may have been the 31st October 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- 'I know you were going to advise to check my internet security setting ... but yes, they all have SSL ticked'</p>
<p>:)&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually did try that on one machine.&nbsp; Of course it would not have made any difference.&nbsp; The update to Windows Live Email only happened on one of my devices and all of them stopped working at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- 'I can no longer use the information on the web as everything has changed'
</p>
<p>I cannot send, receive any emails from my primary account at all.&nbsp; I have deleted the account and now I am trying to set it up again and this is when I am getting the error. I do now have an Office 365 account with Outlook 2016 at home.&nbsp; If all else fails
 I would like to export all my emails from Windows Live to Office 365 Outlook 2016.&nbsp; The current web instructions that I have found do not seems to be for the new platform that is Windows Live email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do apologise for any further omissions' and inaccuracies in the naming conventions used in the above rhetoric.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have not often had to request such assistance and am totally ignorant of the standards.&nbsp; Please understand that no breaches of the above mentioned
 standards are intentional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In further answer to you question about what has changed, please see my original question below</p>
<p>I have this (A TLS API failure occurred, error=0x80090326 when trying to connect email)&nbsp;problem on all devices and various platforms.</p>

<p>OK. Just so you know, Outlook Live ≠ outlook.live.com. Microsoft have the world record in nomenclatorial bamboozlement, so we have to be clinically accurate when referring to their various offerings. I take it that you're

            <p>OK, thank you. I think we can state now with some confidence that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a)&nbsp; you are not using an Outlook Live account, despite your claim a couple of days ago that
<em>Of course this is about Outlook Live;</em></p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; there is no mention of Windows Live anything in your screenshot, so your references to Windows Live were probably simply based on a misunderstanding;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp; you are not using Windows Live Mail, the program to which the forum you originally posted in is devoted;</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp; you access your email at the Outlook Mail website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the red herrings out of the way, I'm going to guess&nbsp;that you have added an iiNet account to your Outlook Mail account so that it became a
<em>connected account - </em>what used to be called a <em>Send &amp; receive account</em>.&nbsp;Can I assume that the Outlook Mail account uses the same iiNet email address as its username, and this is what you use to sign in wherever you need a Microsoft Account, e.g.
 at this Community site? (This is what I think you mean when you write <em>My ' 'email is linked to my Microsoft account (login.live.com) ... My personal email is the primary email on that account.</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is in fact the situation, then I'd ask whether you have any aliases for this Microsoft Account. Connected accounts have proved to be difficult for many users after the migration from Outlook.com to Outlook Mail, especially where the Microsoft Account
 has a non-Microsoft email address as its primary alias. The solution for some of them at least has been to set an address @outlook.com as the primary alias for the Microsoft Account and to use that alias to sign in. This is done by selecting the
<em>Add email address</em> option on the <a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manage how you sign in to Microsoft</a> page. The choice of primary alias has no other real significance.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>&nbsp;I would like to export all my emails from Windows Live to Office 365 Outlook 2016.&nbsp;
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Follow the instructions on this page: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-your-Outlook-com-account-in-Outlook-for-Windows-642c1902-bdd9-4dc3-abe7-76d60b148b23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add your Outlook.com account in Outlook for Windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And last:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>...&nbsp;we are still having issues deciding what to call the email platform I am using.&nbsp;<br />
</blockquote>
<p>That wasn't the object of my irritating questions. If you had actually been using Outlook Live or Windows Live, we should have had to make completely different suggestions. It wasn't clear until today - with the help of your screenshot - that it became possible
 to establish which program or service you were actually using to access your email. There are dozens of possibilities, and Microsoft doesn't make it any easier to nail it down. Now we know.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer on Windows XP</h2>
                    My parents' computer is still running Windows XP. A while ago they got a message that Internet Explorer is not supported anymore. So now they don't have any Internet Explorer. They are using Chrome and Mozilla. Is it possible to install any Internet Explorer
 version on Windows XP or do they have to change OS? Which OS would be best for them?

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not just the&nbsp;IE web browser on Windows XP that Microsoft no longer supports, it is the entire Windows XP operating itself too. Please see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/en-gb/xp/end-of-xp-support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/en-gb/xp/end-of-xp-support.aspx</a>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are still supported, Windows 10 is the latest version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choice is always personal, but if it were me, I would be looking at a new PC running Windows 10 as the best/most cost effective solution. It is worth spending some time researching what you want and the features/implications of the change.</p>

<h2>            Password Change Problem and Rescue Account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I just began using office on the web a week ago and have had to create passwords for several other accounts in the meantime. I am a bit nervous because I've forgotten my OWA password (I've tried to change it to something I can write down, but can't get the
 old one correct). If I hit forgot password, I am wondering what the rescue account is where the reset password request will go? I'm afraid to try it until I know.</p>

<p>hi linda,</p>
<p>could you help us to confirm whether you are administrator or common user? for common users, self-service password reset is not available if you tenant don't have azure ad basic or azure ad premium edition.<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/613/t/291459</p>
<p>for administrators, when you click "can't access your account", alternate email address will be used in the verification process. or if you have filled your phone number, you can also choose texting or calling your phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d2dd8c5b-972f-4e96-a273-e1a99b3d3738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd2dd8c5b-972f-4e96-a273-e1a99b3d3738" /></a></p>
<p>in addition, if there are other administrators in your tenant, you can ask them to help you reset password to let you sign in, then you can change password by yourself: click gear icon in the upper right corner &gt; password &gt; change password.</p>
<p>let us know if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>            Flagged contacts not showing up on my To Do list.  icloud contacts.</h2>
                    <p>I have almost 2000 contacts in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a process in place where I would open a contact card, and click on the flag in the upper right corner, and then hit enter.&nbsp; This would add the contact to my To Do list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed icloud.&nbsp; All of my contacts are in a different folder now:&nbsp; iCloud/Contacts.&nbsp; When I go through the same process of flagging a contact, they are not added to my old To Do list.&nbsp; On the contact card itself, it shows the contact as being flagged
 like it always has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get flagged contact in the iCloud/Contacts to show up in my To Do list.&nbsp; Thanks!!!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Anula,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to view flagged contents from other folders in the To-Do list.&nbsp; I can flag emails from Outlook/Inbox folder, and I can flag contacts located in Outlook/Contacts folder, and these all appear in my To-Do list.</p>
<p>Two months ago I got an iphone and got on the cloud, and now have a iCloud/Contacts folder.&nbsp; For some reason when I flag a contact in this folder it does not appear in the To-Do list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clicked on your link to the other forum.&nbsp; At first I thought that it was taking me down the right path to get this solved.&nbsp; It told me to right-Click to get the (Local) data file properties and turn on the option "Display reminders and tasks from this
 folder in the To-Do Bar."</p>
<p>&nbsp;I right clicked on the iCloud folders and clicked on "Data File Properties" and I could not find any option to "Display reminders and tasks from this folder in the To-Do Bar."</p>
<p>I then right clicked on iCloud/Contacts folder, clicked on "Properties" and I could not find that option there either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!!!</p>

<br />
With Windows 10, Microsoft has decided to change its strategy around Windows RT and regular Windows. All devices which has screen size of 8-inches and above will run full Windows 10.&nbsp; Other device [sic] which has [sic] screen size [sic] less than 8-inches will
 run Windows RT which is Windows on ARM."<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too good to be true?&nbsp; I&nbsp; hope not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the plan to have one OS for a talking watch up to and including a major multidisplay workstation was a guaranteed fail from the get go.&nbsp; There would have to be huge sacrifices of functionality, adaptability, and usability for every system in that
 range.&nbsp; The net result would be that everyone would be very unhappy with the final result.&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the back down from their previously held strategy, if it is for real.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Extremely slow map download to N8 and download failed</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to update map in my Nokia N8 using Nokia Suite&nbsp;and after few hours, not even a single map downloaded into my N8. Download was extremely slow and no map downloaded.&nbsp;I just need to download total 160mb plus map and this&nbsp;caused all my map deleted and
 can not download map again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone facing same problem here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Please fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Suite version : 3.8.30</p>
<p>Phone Model&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : N8</p>

<p>Any issues are more likely to be related to your exisiting installation upon N8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try deleting exisitng E:\cities or F:\cities as appropriate + .qf file, re-start Nokia Maps to re-define necessary folder structure and try re-downloading regional maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using Maps Suite 2.0?&nbsp;<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/265481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/content/265481</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is always possible to download map data directly, decompress and install manually if all else fails but should not be necessary. Which country/region/state are you after?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete contacts from People in new web-based Outlook</h2>
                    I guess Hotmail/MSN just launched a big overhaul of web-based Outlook.&nbsp; All of a sudden there are a bunch of OLD contacts that have appeared in my People list.&nbsp; These contacts are&nbsp;ancient&nbsp;imports from a separate gmail account.&nbsp; I cannot delete them and
 they're cluttering up my contacts list.&nbsp; When I select one of them, the option to "Delete" is NOT there.&nbsp; Instead, there's a button inviting me to ADD them to my contacts.&nbsp; If I do add one, I then get the option to delete it&nbsp; ...but if I now delete it, it
 reappears within seconds in my contacts list.&nbsp; What's going on??&nbsp; Is there no way to get rid of them??

            <p>Hi Monica.&nbsp; Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I've deleted all the unwanted contacts from my Gmail account, but they remain in my Hotmail/Outlook People list (but again, NOT yet as true contacts&nbsp; ...I'm basically just invited to "add" them as contacts).&nbsp; I wonder
 if I somehow need to "resync" my Hotmail/Outlook with the Gmail account.&nbsp; (There are actually two Gmail accounts associated with my Hotmail/Outlook, but only one of them is the source of these unwanted names.)</p>

            OK, it's fixed, as follows: I deleted the old contacts from my separate gmail account.&nbsp; It took a while (at least a day, I think), but eventually these contacts then dropped from my Hotmail/MSN People list.

<h2>            Error when copying data from Excel web app into Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>I tried to copy data from the Excel Web App to my desktop Excel 2013. It wasn't a lot of data - 3 columns (of which 2 were mostly blank) x 140 rows. On pasting into Excel, the cell displayed the message, "Retrieving data. Wait a few seconds and try to cut
 or copy again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting and then pressing Ctrl-V produced the same result. I tried using Paste Special &gt; Text, but that didn't work either. Any thoughts on a possible solution? Thanks.</p>

            I found a work around that may work for you. Select [File] [Save As] and then [Download a Copy]. Save to you computer and open with a Desktop version of Excel so you can cut and paste freely.

    <title>How can I automatically enable macros for selected spreadsheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hjc3  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I automatically enable macros for selected spreadsheets only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I frequently develop spreadsheets that use macros.&nbsp; I would like to be able to enable those macros automatically every time I open my own spreadsheets, without automatically enabling macros in spreadsheets that come from other sources.&nbsp; As far as I can tell,
 none of the available Trust Center options allows this, since my choices (in Excel 2007) are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Disable all macros without notification</strong> -- clearly not what I want.</p>
<p><strong>Disable all macros with notification</strong> -- this is my current setting, but I must manually enable macros in&nbsp;<em>all</em> spreadsheets that contain them, including my own, every time I open them.&nbsp; This is a frustrating nuisance!</p>
<p><strong>Disable all macros&nbsp;except&nbsp;digitally signed macros</strong>&nbsp;-- means that I need to digitally sign my spreadsheets, which would be ok except that the signatures become invalidated as soon as I make any changes to the code.&nbsp; Having to continually re-sign
 is more of a pain than having to re-enable the macros every time I open the spreadsheet.&nbsp; Also, if I choose this option, all
<em>unsigned</em> macros will be <em>disabled <strong>without </strong>notification</em>, when I would prefer to be notified (and allowed to enable them if I choose to do so.)</p>
<p><strong>Enable all macros </strong>-- One of the few things about which I can agree with Microsoft unequivocally...this option is very dangerous!</p>
<p>Thanks very much for any help you can provide!</p>
<p>HJ</p>

    <title>How do I turn off the Suggested Meeting notifications&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iffam  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off the Suggested Meeting notifications&#63;</h2>
                    When I receive an email with any time or date, it underlines the sentence and wants to add something to a calendar. &nbsp;How do I shut that off? &nbsp;I received an email where all but 2 sentences in the entire email. &nbsp;It's pretty annoying. &nbsp;I've checked every
 place in the settings and options that I can think of and then some that didn't make sense. &nbsp;No luck.

            <p>This person is talking about the message being parsed for dates and places. &nbsp;The app (Outlook and Outlook Web) both do this and then "suggest" that a meeting be set up on the calendar. &nbsp;We are seeing the same issue here and would like to turn it off. &nbsp;It's
 a terrible implementation because it sends a meeting request back to everyone in the original email--and in a campus wide distribution list that's EVERYONE.</p>

            <p>Hi Douglas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input and clarification regarding this issue. You can follow these steps to turn off Suggested Meetings on Outlook.com:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the gear icon on the upper right part of the page and select <strong>
Options</strong></p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>General</strong> tab on the right side of the page</p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Manage ad-ins</strong></p>
<p>4. Uncheck <strong>Suggested Meetings </strong>to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            There was no "Suggested Meetings" to uncheck. It looks like maybe "Boomerang" is what needs to be unchecked. &nbsp;I turned off all the add-ins since I didn't actually add any of them. &nbsp;Hopefully that does the trick. &nbsp;It's been extremely frustrating.

            <p>So, I followed your instructions on my own account and it worked.&nbsp; I forwarded the instructions to one person here who was complaining the most and he said that he didn't have any add-ins enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to my account to see if maybe I'd missed a step and now there is no "options" setting under the "gear icon"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see a "Manage Add-ins" link, but when I click that I don't see anything close to "Suggested Meetings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digging further I see that NOW there's a link for "Mail" under "My App Settings."&nbsp; You have to click that now to get to the "Options" page.&nbsp; Also, the General tab is on the left side of the screen (at least for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the gear icon on the upper right part of the page and select <strong>
Mail </strong>under <strong>My App Settings</strong></p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>General</strong> tab on the <em>LEFT </em>side of the page</p>

<p>4. Uncheck <strong>Suggested Meetings </strong>to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>How about leaving things alone for a while?&nbsp; The O365 Portal is a huge mess.</p>

            <p>It happened right after the massive "update" MS did to Windows 10!!! So, no, <strong>
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I </span></em></strong>did not make any changes to any settings - MS did!&nbsp; It was the very lengthy Anniversary (?) update - Whatever it was called.</p>
<p>I tried one of the options offered and it worked. (So far anyway.) The one I used was signing in to email, tools, options, add-ins, then unchecked suggested meetings.
</p>
<p>Since this update I have had to change other things back to the way they were before. My display for one. One would think after so many years MS would know how to leave user settings alone during MS updates.</p>
<p>Thanks for getting an answer to those of us who don't care <em>how </em>it works, we just want it to

    <title>Trapping Excel Chart Axis Scale Change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e.j. gun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trapping Excel Chart Axis Scale Change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm developing a routine that creates a gradient background on a chart's plot area&nbsp;to simulate horizontal bands behind the data.&nbsp; The bands are specified as pairs of values along the y-axis (or value axis), for example, one band will go from 0.5 to 1.0.&nbsp;
 Each band is a solid color.&nbsp; This part I have working fine using some VBA.&nbsp; The VBA creates the gradient, sets the gradient stops and colors, etc, and does a great job of simulating the color bands I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I'm having is that if I change the minimum and/or maximum values on the y-axis scale, the bands end up in the wrong place.&nbsp; I can re-run the VBA routine manually and the gradient is re-created.&nbsp; What I want to be able to do is detect the change
 in axis values and automatically update the color bands.&nbsp; However, I can't find a chart event that lets me do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to detect a change in the scale values for an Excel chart?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            It's not very robust but it might work for you.<br />
It simple keeps track of the which chart elements was selected. When the previous selection was the value axis it runs your routine.<br />
<br />
<br />
paste code in chart sheet object.<br />
<br />
Private m_lngLastItemSelected As Long<br />
Private Sub Chart_Select(ByVal ElementID As Long, ByVal Arg1 As Long, ByVal Arg2 As Long)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If m_lngLastItemSelected = xlAxis Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SetPlotAreaGradient2 ActiveChart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_lngLastItemSelected = ElementID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

            There is no option within Excel which controls this. This is most likely due to an add-in or due to corrupted installation. You should try following - 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Try performing online repair of your Office installation. 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Office &amp; click &gt; Modify &gt; Quick repair / Online repair
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>Thanks for the swift reply on this. Infact i have tried all of above option in my computer (company provided laptop with corporate MS Office version) but none of them have worked including the Safemode. my MSO got corrupted while doing the online repair.
 Finally i have uninstalled the entire MS office version and installed the downgraded MS Office to 2013 and now it is all working as expected. thanks for your advise.</p>

                    I have a new Mac. I installed Office 365 yesterday and got it all running fine. I even worked on some documents. Tonight I updated the OS to Mojave, and now Word won't open - says it may be incompatible with my OS. Power Point and Excel are fine. Do I
 have to reinstall Office 365 or reinstall Word? My Office 365 is up to date.

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear that, right now Mojave is presenting some issues with some none Apple apps, take a look at step number 8 in the following article and see if that works for you.

<p>I still cannot open Word. I have tried starting in safe mode, with no success. I have version 16.19. iMac OS is Mojave 10.14.1. I tried resetting the app with Clean my Mac as suggested below with no change. The other Office apps all work fine, and I can
 also run Word as well as the other apps on my MacBook. Can I reinstall just Word or do I have to uninstall the whole Office 365, which took hour and hours to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word was working on the iMac until I installed Mojave, which was only a day or two after I installed it. It seems that the problem is Mojave and not the Word app itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating. Please help!</p>

<p><span>Hi KatharineWorthington,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In your earlier post you mentioned
<em>“</em></span><em>3. It will to open from Finder.”. </em>I would like to confirm if you can open Word application from
<strong>Finder</strong>&gt;<strong>Applications</strong> folder. Do not double click an existing Word document to open, simply click Word icon in
<strong>Applications</strong> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot open from <strong>Applications</strong> folder, try creating a new user profile on your affected mac. This will help us confirm if the issue is with Mojave profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To know how to create new user profile on Mojave, please see

            My earlier message should have said "It will NOT open from Finder." I tried using a guest profile and it still would not open. The other Office 365 apps all seem to be fine. And Word was working prior to my updating to Mojave. Under System Preferences,
 my software is up to date. Is it possible to reinstall just Word - is that something I can try?

<p><span>Hi Katherine,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m sorry for the inconveniences this issue has caused you. Please try quit the Office applications, then search for the com.microsoft.word folder in Finder, and delete it to clean the cache
 files, and then open Word again to see if it would work. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, you may also download the standalone Word for Mac install package from

<h2>            Outlook 2013 won&#39;t highlight search results</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem with Outlook 2013 as well as my coworkers who are running Office 2013. The results of Instant Search will not be highlighted when the search is performed. It's still coming up with results, just not highlighting anything. I've check
 the settings and tried turning Instant Search off and on, but it doesn't change anything. According to the system, it should be highlighting, just nothing is showing.</p>

<p>My coworkers who are running 2010 do not have this problem. </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<br />
First of all thanks for trying out the My Phone service.<br />
<br />
Regarding the SDK question, as you can understand we can't reveal our planning for next versions (bug fixing, features, etc).<br />
<br />
Keep an eye in next versions to see if our plan goes in directions of your ideas.<br />
<br />

 to 'Protect sheet' the only other greyed-out button is 'Allow Users to Edit Ranges'. All other buttons in the group are available. The drop-down box on the Protect Worksheet button shows 'Unrestricted Access' is ticked.</p>

<h2>            access 2007 sp3 - no sp compatibility</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home I use vista sp2 with access 2007 sp3. However, a computer in my work place is using access 2007
<strong>without any service pack installed,</strong> despite having win 8.1 installed (no internet connection)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I develop an access accdb with my access 2007 sp3 and&nbsp;deploy it seamlessly on my work pc whose Ms access&nbsp;doesn't have any SP installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My fear is that after developing the accdb on my access 2007 sp3 (on my home pc) I cannot open it on my work pc (access 2007 with no SP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, IMT</p>

            <p>Access 2007 originally came with a boatload of bugs. SP1 also broke some things. I certainly would not trust an unpatched version of Access after so long of a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you could do is download SP3 and put it on a CD or thumb drive and take it into work to patch that computer. I don't think an internet connection is necessary for an update, but I've never tried it.</p>

            I can't guarantee there will be no issues. All Service Packs make big changes to the software. Developing in two different versions might break something. But developing on the one with SP3 and opening it on the unpatched computer probably won't be a problem.
 Just make sure you keep current backups on the SP3 computer.

            <p>From what I can find online this seems to be a common issue with&nbsp; creative mediasource player.&nbsp; Your best bet is to find a forum relating to&nbsp;creative mediasource player.&nbsp; Personally, I'd contact the company directly through their contact/support web page.</p>

<p>I also read a few post that stated that once they update their OS and Office, everything worked.&nbsp; So you might want to ensure you have performed all your updates!</p>

            <p>Hi Grant,</p>
<p><br />
Are you able to open up a sample or new Access database on your machine?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If so, then as Daniel mentioned, the problem most likely isn’t with Access or Jet but most likely with the 3 party product you are using.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are unable to open a sample database or new database, then what error do you receive when you try to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,
</p>

            Its not something I use really . Can you tell how to do that its not in my list of programs . I searched the forums at creative and the only fix they give is to &nbsp;'blame windows ' and then tell you to run jet 4.0 sp 8 etc. which i can't do yet . &nbsp; Do you
 think it's worth giving Jet comp a go I d/l already but not sure where to point it ? Thank you all so far . :)

<h2>            VBA Windows for Excel Mac 2011 not organized</h2>
                    I recently changed from Windows 2007 to Mac 2011.&nbsp; The VBA windows (modules, properties, forms, etc) are unorganized with different sizes, placed all over the screen and in no order (module 1 may be between modules 3 and 4).&nbsp; Sometimes when I open code
 behind a form, I can't find the window.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how I can have this organized for all macros?

            This is the editor's tool bar. make sure the windows are docked and the toolbar is visible. look in the view menu to view the tool bars and make sure all your windows are visible.<br />

            No, you just have to arrange them. They should hold that position for successive uses of the VBE.
