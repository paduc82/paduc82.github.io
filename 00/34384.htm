<h2>            Windows RT 8.1 Support&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Why has the MSN News App been removed from the app store for Windows RT 8.1. This is just wrong. I have a Surface 2. Legacy RT apps that shipped with Windows RT 8.1 should not be removed from the Windows Store. Is Windows 8.1 Still supported by Microsoft?
 If so Microsoft has an obligation to preserve all Apps in app store that were available as part of the Windows RT 8.1 release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hay Microsoft, answer please!!!!</p>

            <div>Thank you for the reply.</div>
<div>I am using a Microsoft Surface 2. I was experiencing crashes from the News App. In past, per recommendation, I have uninstalled and then reinstalled the News App to correct the problem.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>The News App is no longer available in the Store for reinstall for Windows RT.&nbsp;&nbsp;The support date for Windows RT 8.1 does not end until 1/9/20018. The News App was installed on my Surface 2 when in bought it and was installed after I upgraded to Windows 8.1.&nbsp;I
 am surprised that Microsoft thinks&nbsp;it can deprecate parts of a&nbsp; supported operating system.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide me with the means to install the News App, as it is part of what I purchased from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS the link you provided for MSN News App says "<span>This app does not work on your device.</span>"</p>

            You didn't purchase the app.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apps may be changed or discontinued at any time, and you have no entitlement just because the app was installed when you bought the device.&nbsp;

            <p>Wrong. It was installed as part of the OS install image of the surface 2 I purchased. The Out of Box Experience&nbsp;is that the app is there on first boot. W/O being connected to internet, or installing from the store. I have a right to be made whole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your logic is flawed, what if mail, calendar,&nbsp;reader, weather, were to&nbsp;suddenly&nbsp;not be available for your surface RT? What if all RT apps were gone? Would I still&nbsp;have what I was sold, what I paid for.&nbsp;No not at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been screwed enough by Microsoft in their choosing not to provide upgrade to Windows 10 on Surface RT, they have no right to start removing functionality that was part of the original package I purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So but out.&nbsp;You have nothing of value to add.</p>

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t boot up</h2>
                    I shut down my computer safely last night but this morning when i turned it on the windows didn't boot up. The moment i turned my system on it displayed the lenovo screen as it usually does but after that i couldn't see the welcome screen..Just an underscore
 kept blinking on a black screen in the top left corner. However the power is on, keyboard and mouse are working absolutely fine. I tried booting it many a times but to no avail. I checked all the wires, even tried cleaning the RAM to make sure no dust particles
 are creating a problem but it still doesn't seem to work. Has my window gone corrupt ??
<div>P.s- I upgraded to windows 7 from windows xp 20 days ago and many a times the computer used to shut down in between after a blue screen displaying an error message.</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hello Neha, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. We are glad to help you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the model number of your Lenovo computer? </span></li><li><span>What was the complete error message that you were receiving with the blue screens?
</span></li><li><span>Were any other significant changes made to your computer prior to this issue?
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may try following the methods given below in order to troubleshoot the problem.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices plugged in to your computer, and try to check if the problem persists.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to boot your computer using <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong>. You can follow these steps to do so.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Restart your computer by clicking the <strong>Start</strong>, clicking the arrow next to the
<strong>Shut Down</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Restart</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold the <strong>F8</strong> key as your computer restarts. You need to press
<strong>F8</strong> before the Windows logo appears. (If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by shutting down and restarting your computer.)</span></li><li><span>On the </span><span><span><strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong></span></span><span> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight
</span><span><span><strong>Last Known Good Configuration (advanced)</strong></span></span><span>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
</p><p><strong><span>Refer: Using Last Known Good Configuration </span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/using-last-known-good-configuration#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/using-last-known-good-configuration#1TC=windows-7</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe Mode </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click the link and follow the steps “<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong>”
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot. </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer: How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> <span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the computer does not boot in Safe Mode, I would like you to perform a startup repair on your computer. You can refer to the following article in order to perform a startup repair on your computer.
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the Startup Repair fails, I would suggest you to try doing a System Restore on your computer from Windows Recovery Environment.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 5: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to boot the computer to <em>system recovery options </em>using the Windows 7 installation disc and try to perform a system restore. You can try to do a system restore from
<em>Windows Recovery Options</em> by referring to the following link: </span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></p>

<h2>            Machine_check_error infinitely checking</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using my PC regularly today until it suddenly crashed as I was using a ProLog editor. It then presented me with a screen with a blue backgroung and white text. The text says "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some
 error info, and then we'll restart for you." then the counter goes all the way up from (0% complete) to (100% complete) and just stays there. It also says "If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It stayed there for about two hours, so I tried a hard shutdown, and then start it again in Safe Mode. That didn't work, and now whenever it opens up it only gives me the blue screen. Please help me fix this problem. I desperately need my PC for my studies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Search pane &#40;ish&#41; functionality in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> misterfocus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search pane &#40;ish&#41; functionality in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One of the things I like best in windows 8.1 is the search pane (and hero page results). These seem to be missing completely from Windows 10. Instead, I get a pretty much uncurated list, the same as I'd get in a web browser, or, in fact, the search box shunts
 me into a web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a more curated search pane experience for windows 10? Anything on the way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I not only prefer the presentation, but I MUCH prefer the way clicking a link panel in the search panel opens a browser window for me, snapping it to the side. As implemented in windows 10, shoved to a regular web page, clicking a search result navigates
 directly to that page, necessitating a lot of back and forth, which is a waste of time. Or, best similar solution, is to sit around right clicking and opening in new tabs. That's also a waste of time and to me a pretty annoying step backward from the elegant
 search panel in 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something obvious?</p>

<h2>            Custom gamer pictures for child accounts</h2>
                    <p>So basically I was hyped about the new insider thing to have custom profile pictures and such. Today I went to go and change it but I couldn't, it kept saying I'm not 18 or older. I tried everything I could from changing settings to my birth date and I even contacted support. They said that the Xbox recognizes that I am not actually 18 from when i changed my birth date and I literally have to wait until my account matures and stuff before I can change it which is ridiculous! Its not fair for everyone that didn't know this was gonna happen that have a dumb child account, my account is a child one because my mom made it and she used her email to lock it down. I have everything on unrestricted so why am j not able to enjoy a custom profile picture like everyone else? I dont wanna have to wait 3 more years just to be able to do it, or make another account for no reason. Custom pictures need to be made for everyone or at least people that have child accounts but have their settings on unrest

                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased an IBuyPower computer and it has had two Blue Screen of Death. The first one was related to kernel system security failure and the other one was about memory management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs of the computer:</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 8700K</p>
<p>NVIDIA RTX 2080</p>
<p>16 GB DDR4</p>
<p>1 TB SATA SSD</p>
<p>Liquid Cooling&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to save the mini dump from the second crash with hope that somebody could determine the issue. I ran system diagnostics and it did not find any problem with the RAM, CPU, or Hard Drive. I also used the 4 pass memtest and it did not find any problem
 with the ram. I have run the computer on benchmarks and I also have tested multiple games such as BF5 and it has performed well. However, the crashes were at random so I do not know what could have caused the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the crash report obtained from Mini Dump Analyzer.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi ArielGutierrez1  
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Purchasing a game download for multiple consoles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcmaxey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purchasing a game download for multiple consoles</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple 360 consoles. I purchased a game for download and installed it on my first console. I tried to buy the game again to install it on one of the other consoles, but the system tells me I've already bought the game. When I download the game to the second console, it makes that one the full game and the installation on the original console a trial version.</p><p>Is it possible to purchase a full version of the game for each of my consoles?</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            fingerprint scanner not working after approx 20 windows updates and installation of internet explorer 10</h2>
                    After installing approximately 20 windows updates and/or after previously upgrading to IE10, my fingerprint scanner is available and functional ONLY at windows startup; previously, had access to several websites with fingerprint scanner and it asked if
 I wanted access upon logging in to other websites.&nbsp; A review of the descriptions for the windows updates revealed nothing obvious.&nbsp; How do I recover this function?

            Can you please answer previous to what? have you made any changes which would have effected the drivers of the finger print sccaner If yes then&nbsp;Have you tried the latest version of Digital Persona Fingerprint Reader Software which is available and recommended
 by HP. I had the same issue when I clean installed my HP DV6 laptop and I managed to fix it by un-installing and re-installing Digital Persona I also tried a different driver for the validation then one which was automatically detected and installed by windows.

            I'm experiencing the same problem. Same time frame, probable same slew of most recent Windows updates (20+ recommended/important updates that I installed on 9/11/2013). HP 2740p with fingerprint scanner and HP ProtectTools installed. All worked fine until
 this week, now windows login still works but login pages in IE10 are no longer recognized. Would love to have that really useful functionality back....

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If the issue is specific to Internet Explorer, then there may be an add-on in Internet Explorer that allows this to function properly, you may check to see if it is disabled. While in Internet Explorer do the following:</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">1. Click <font><b>Tools</b>, from programs tab select
<b>Manage Add-ons</b></font></font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>2.<strong> </strong>Where it says “<font><b>Show:</b>” drop down the menu and select
<b>All add-ons</b></font></span></font></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">3. See if you can find an add-on that is related to your fingerprint reader, select it, and click
<b><font>Enable </font></b>if it is currently Disabled.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If you were able to find an add-on in there that was related to your fingerprint reader, but it was enabled, you may try disabling all other add-ons to see if there is an add-on that is interfering with the fingerprint reader
 working properly. If it works with all other add-ons disabled then you need to go through the list of add-ons and through trial and error figure out which one is causing the conflict.</font></span></p>

            <p>@mitchellUX and anyone else who might have been struggling with this problem. I finally did what I should have done earlier: I repaired my HP ProtectTools Security Manager installation via Windows' "Programs and Features" control panel. (<em>Control Panel
 / Programs and Features /&nbsp;Double-click on HP ProtectTools Security Manager /&nbsp;(in wizard now)&nbsp;click Next, then select Repair and let the wizard do the rest</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fingerprint scanner is&nbsp;back to doing what it should in IE 10. In fact, I just used it now to log in here to post this comment. ^_^</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I did not go back to earlier restore points or take any of the other repair steps suggested above (other than disabling/re-enabling IE add-ons as described earlier). I'm confident that repairing the installation&nbsp;would have worked fine had I tried it
 immediately without touching add-ons, etc.</p>

<h2>            Change File&#47;Folder Permission en masse</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I can change the file permission individually by left right clicking them and changing the properties. The problem is I want to do it all in one go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>I was trying to mask a hard drive from Guest but instead of doing that, I masked it from Users by denying permission for Users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts:</p>
<p>I then took ownership of the hard drive which worked but each file in the hard drive kept the old file permission where Users are denied (I have ownership of these files). I can see the files but I cant read them</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing it en masse from the harddrive as suggested here</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/changing-multiple-file-permissions/b09c0415-3607-4979-9ce7-c87be95229e6</p>
<p>but it keeps telling me access is denied.</p>
<p>

            For the most part they are media files so I dont think its case 1. As for case 2, I doubt it because I can access them normally prior without doing anything special. I also noticed its mostly top level files that have this issue. By top level files, I
 mean E:\file. They are mostly mkv.

    <title>Dban drive erasure, side effects if any. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haroldrobinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dban drive erasure, side effects if any.</h2>
                    After a disastrous experiment with linux ubuntu 12.04 lts&nbsp; on my&nbsp; dell laptop, windows 7 was wiped out on a faulty install. After trying a host of different ideas from the ubuntu forums which mostly led nowhere and added more confusion , I&nbsp; was finally
 able to boot back into windows using my windows xp sp3 installation cd&nbsp; to reformat the entire drive and do a clean install. When I lost win 7, I lost my internet and my wireless connection plus the dvd/cd burner which was restored with xp back but no internet
 and wireless remains a problem.To fix this(hopefully) I am going to use dban to scrub the drive and make a clean install with my windows 7 installation disk since there's no data to worry about. My question is since everything is erased will the drive C: be
 automatically created during the reinstall process?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows install will prompt you if you need to partition the drive. And you could
<br />
just install over XP without the scrub. <br />
<br />
You may need to install the latest drivers from Dell after the install (or download them<br />
to external media or USB drives to have them available).<br />
<br />
Check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues.<br />

Hi, so basically every time I adjust the volume mixer for playback devices, the actual volume does not change. Everything plays back at a constant volume (loud) whether it's at 100% or 5%.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I've updated all drivers, reinstalled and have restarted.</p>

<p>Hi Xavier,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find out what's causing the issue, we would like to know what changes were made on the system prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would also like to know how you updated/reinstalled the audio drivers, because sometimes, automatically updating/reinstalling the drivers through Device Manager doesn't resolve the issue. We suggest checking the manufacturer's website for the latest audio
 driver for your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try rolling back the driver to a previous version by selecting
<strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> in the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply is most important for us to assist you accordingly.</p>

            Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll further down and make sure Camera is toggled on.
<br />
<br />Check your antivirus software
<br />
<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company’s website.
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />    In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If your webcam still doesn’t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer’s website.

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail will no longer open</h2>
                    <p>Let me start off by saying I for the most part like Windows 10. Up until today, my Mail app was working fine, I had 3 accounts attached to it, and checked it regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, the Mail app will not open. When I click on it, all I get is the blue splash logo. It doesn't show up in Task Manager, so it's like it isn't even running. After installing updates and rebooting, it still will not open.</p>

            I think I have deduced that the problem with Mail not opening is caused by a partially-completed update in the store, which is not downloading. It, like everyone else's, is stuck at 0MB...&nbsp;

            <p>Given up, going back to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really frustrated that Windows 10 Mail would be a backward step from 8.1 with things like forced conversation groupings, not being able to select the "From" email address and folders not syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now with the Mail app constantly&nbsp;freezing, I've given up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And "NO" Microsoft Engineers please don't tell me to use a Windows 8 trouble shooter or look for Windows 8 settings that are simply not available in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like all the effort for Windows 10 Mail has gone into look and feel, with no thought&nbsp;given to&nbsp;functionality, productivity, flexibility&nbsp;and reliability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people still just need the email&nbsp;app to work as a reliable email app!!</p>

<p>You aren't alone.&nbsp; I just did a clean install of a Windows 7 machine, was running fine until I tried to install the new Service Pack.&nbsp; I've seen a similar issue with Vista failing on Service Pack 2 as well.</p>
<p>This fresh install is hung @:</p>
<p>Fatal error C000003A applying update operation 5780 of 77101 (System...)</p>
<p>Well done Microsoft.&nbsp; Not a big issue for me, just wasted time @ work.&nbsp; Lucky Windows 7 installs are fairly quick.&nbsp; Although, I feel for the OP.&nbsp; He probably has his whole business on his machine (hopefully he has backups).</p>
<p>TO THE OP:</p>
<p><br />
1. Turn your computer off (Hold the power button if it is on and stuck at the update).</p>
<p>2. Turn your computer on.&nbsp; Keep tapping F8.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Select Repair my Computer.</p>
<p>4. Enter Windows user credentials.</p>
<p>5. Select System Restore.</p>
<p>6. Select the restore point prior to the Service Pack 1 updates, and set the restore going.</p>
<p>7. Wait untill the process completes.&nbsp; Ignore it if it says it failed and didn't change anything.</p>
<p>8. Once you're back in Windows, go to Windows Update, right click on the Service Pack update and disable it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>so using an ubuntu live usb (vist their website, a cd is just as good if not better) i copied important files off onto another HD</p>
<p>wiped computer</p>
<p>reinstalled (WIN 7 64 bit)</p>
<p>Only using basic procedures i updated to SP1 but it hung at a similar point with this error (Therefore I conclude that it is a third party hardware incompatibility, there is a hotfix avaliable for a similar error code but the best thing to do is dont update
 it. until a fix is made)</p>
<p>GL</p>
<p>update:</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>This procedure is good if you know exactly where your files are located &amp; have an extra internal/external HD avaliable &amp; this installation discs</p>
<p>a restore is better if you have stuff all over the place. I am fixing the same problem on my system at the moment, if you would like help please email me @:</p>

<p>I have got a simlar problem although mine is freezing at the registry part which is a few files along (sorry dont have the exact file number) My problem is when I got to repair, restore or boot in safe mode nothing happens. I get an error saying unable to
 repair and the same for restoring. When I boot in to safe mode it hangs at one of the drivers that in loads. Sorry I cant give any more details other than this but I am currently at work and unable to give details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I am having these problems is it possible that I can run Ubuntu or something like that so I can access the PC and may be delete some files from there so windows will load or repair its self? I am really trying to avoid a rebuild as there is a lot of
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I apologize than, I thought it is microsoft personal here, my words were coming out of total frustration . 5 years ago I had server crash and lasted entire day and I had thousands unhappy customers calling headquarter&nbsp; entire day before we fixed and I could
 understand them even it was hard to listen <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt;
</span>from their side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>back on the subject.....I left similar threads on few other places, called Microsoft Croatia today, called two IT guys and so far nobody did anything</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so , since it is really desperate situation I really need if somebody could tell me now is it possible somehow from commands prompt to copy my docs from C: to external hard drive ? I am seeing that as last option in this moment . if I would be able to do
 it I would be very happy and than I would just reinstall everything and move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to clear few things out again<br />
<br />
pressing F8 button only lead me on page where I have to choices, lunch reapir and start windows automatically</p>
<p>System restore doesnt works since it is said that I dont have any restore points set<br />
all I can access is CMD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>since I made a mistake with<span style="font-weight: bold"> &lt;removed&gt; </span>in my first thread , cause I was thinking it is Microsoft official here I truly apologize one more time to everyone.<br />

<p>I would like to throw my hat into this ring ...</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1525, 3GB RAM, 250GB HD, fresh Windows 7 install with Office 2007 and nothing else. I was just finishing up the updates when it came to SP1 for Windows 7. Left it running the update overnight and came in this morning to find it locked
 up with a "Fatal Error c000003a" on the screen.</p>
<p>Rebooting didn't do the trick. It won't even boot into Safe Mode in order to get to System Restore. It gets to loading the classpnp.sys file and stops there.</p>
<p>Going to try System Repair using the install disk next. I will inform you all to the results.</p>

            I just successfully booted the computer up after using the Start Up Repair on the Windows 7 install disc and everything seems to be back to normal. Of course, I'm wondering if and when SP1 for Windows 7 will get fixed enough for me to install it. :-(

            I also had trouble with the fatal error, but after rebooting and selecting repair and waiting for 30 minutes I was able to start Windows 7.&nbsp; I had 18 updates 1 of which was SP1, so I left SP1 off continued with the rest then thought I would try SP1 again
 and this time it worked ok.&nbsp; My computer is running slower but perhaps it will fasten up once I have defragged.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am running a Dell Inspiron 560 with 4gb ram.<br />

            Hi Gary.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates using the same tool above.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the advanced suggestions.&nbsp; However, I did not go back to a set point yet, nor rollback the last Win10 update.&nbsp; I think there's a setting in Windows yet to be discovered by me that's causing the problem.&nbsp; Let me take a moment to be more specific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) previously, the network icon only appeared BEFORE I log in.&nbsp; I could click and view networks and attempt to connect to mine.&nbsp; But it couldn't (it would time out without connecting).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) then, after a network reset attempt (or several of them), it would connect sort of, but no internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) as soon as I log in, no icon, no network connection visible to Windows.&nbsp; However, the network card is enabled and visible, properties are all running OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) the driver (Realtek) is current for this card.</p>
<p>e) new trick: I logged with my alternate login, went into the network adapter IPV4 tabs and put in an IP address and gateway to my network as a manual request.&nbsp; After another troubleshooting exercise, the network wizard said the DCHP wasn't set to wifi,
 so it fixed it.</p>
<p>f) Now I started the browser because there's no wifi icon to see a status.&nbsp; But hooray, I'm on the internet. I look at the wifi properties and it shows a different port than I asked for, but all is well, connected to my wifi, on the internet.&nbsp; The system
 has switched back to auto-connect instead of manual.</p>
<p>g) I logged out and logged back in with my other user ID.&nbsp; The connection was still on through the card and I was able to get on the internet.</p>
<p>h) BUT, Windows still does not SEE the wifi, greys out the icon switch on the taskbar and no wi-fi on the list of network options on the status screen.&nbsp; Windows does not think I am connected to a network, even though I physically have the connection and
 details (addresses, etc.) and the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on within Windows?&nbsp; A service not turned on (I've tried to review all of those).&nbsp; Something somewhere else?&nbsp; I think the above tests verify it's not the card/adapter, driver or the router/wifi connectivity.&nbsp; It's simply an indicator or switch
 in Windows somewhere.&nbsp; Hmmm?</p>

            Hi again Gary -
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is highly volatile - much more than Windows 7 - so if there's not a perfect install to begin with, problems like this can almost be expected.  So while support for Windows 7 was generally enjoyable and a celebration, with Windows 10 we're just trying to keep users afloat on a daily basis.  
<br />
<br />You can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />But do remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Many thanks for the links to the varous upgrades/fixes.&nbsp; I think I will wait for the next upgrade and do the clean install as you suggested.&nbsp; It's just the network icon that missing per Windows and if the workaround I mentioned will do the trick for now,
 I can wait to do the upgrade.</p>

</p><p>Since all my other Windows 10 devices worked OK after the last upgrade, I'm not sure what happened on this one device.&nbsp; It's a travel PC, so I don't have to use it every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for all the help and suggestions.</p>

            Sounds like a plan, Gary.  If you like the present install you may only need to run the Spring Creators Version by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you think it can be greatly improved over that then there's nothing like the performance of a good Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
