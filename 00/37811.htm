            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the steps but each them comes back with an unable to do this answer of some sort.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error codes may have done so, it worked perfectly for quite while (activated and with no issue). The firewall issue is the first issue I recall so it could very well have started before the activation issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing unusual in terms of software that I am aware of.&nbsp; I do not appear to have Norton Internet Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting quite desperate, I can no longer open Outlook as it simply closes after failing to do a repair which is prompted upon opening. I am unable to work and I have paid for the Windows and The Office 365. This is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>Need custom outgoing voicemail message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph_morris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need custom outgoing voicemail message</h2>
                    <p>I bought a SkypeIn number. After buying it, I realized that Skype with a custom SkypeIn number does not have a custom voicemail message, you can only get this anonymous "you have reached 867-5309" message. I need people to know who they have reached. Is
 there any method to get a custom voicemail message for a SkypeIn number? I would like to keep the existing number since I have already given it out to some people before I realized this problem. If it is not possible, can I get a refund for the SkypeIn number?
 Custom voicemail messages are 1960s technology so I assumed they were ubiquitous for anyone offering telephony services in 2017.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is no option to set-up a custom voice message as this no longer supported by Skype. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Skype does not offer refund for paid-for services when they have been used. As defined by Skype's refund policy, a Skype Number can receive calls and can be used as soon as the product has been purchased, therefore, no refunds can be issued
 for Skype Numbers. </p>

<p><strong>Greetings brain trust,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I've been tinkering with virtual machines for years now and it just occurred to me that it should be possible to backup or clone my desktop onto a (big) USB drive in the form of a virtual disk. &nbsp;Could you point me in the direction of specific steps
 to take to do this? &nbsp;Ideally, I'd like to have a pristine version of Win7 (with a different license of course) and do all of my work inside of a virtual machine (my current to-be-virtualized desktop) so that I can carry it around with me on a 32GB (or more)
 USB drive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guidance is greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
<p>MT</p>

<p>As a former MVP for Virtual Machines, I have been down this path.</p>
<p>You cannot do what you want to do with a single retail license for Windows 7.&nbsp; The license does not allow installation&nbsp;on more than one device or partition at the same time.&nbsp; A virtual machine on the same host computer is considered a separate computer or
 device for licensing purposes.&nbsp; Installation is the key concept.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While retail (boxed copies) are transferable, if your copy of Windows came preinstalled on your computer by the manufacturer (OEM) then you cannot clone and install it on any other computer or device (even a virtual one)&nbsp;regardless.</p>
<p>What you can do is purchase a new copy of Windows (retail) and install that in a virtual machine.&nbsp; You can store the virtual files on a usb drive.&nbsp; However, in my experience usb drives are limiting.</p>
<p>What I would do is purchase a small pocket-sized hard drive that is usb powered and use that for the virtual machine.&nbsp; Then you don't have to mess with the legalities of installations on multiple&nbsp;devices and you can&nbsp;use the vm on the&nbsp;computer of your choice
 by simply plugging in the hard drive.&nbsp; See</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822149185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822149185</a></p>
<p>Other issues include the hardware differences between your host computer and the emulated devices in a virtual machine.&nbsp; Messy stuff.</p>
<p>I have dozens of virtual machines, all legally licensed, on a pair of external drives that I move between computers all the time.&nbsp; Portability is one of the great advantages of virtualization. Obviously the one prerequisite is that VPC 2007 be installed
 on each of the machines or that all be running Windows 7 and have VPC7 installed.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify on your concern, when you say&nbsp;"Skype program" do you mean the&nbsp;Skype for Windows Desktop&nbsp;application? Please try to uninstall and reinstall your Skype for Windows 10. Kindly provide a screenshot here of the error you are getting so I can have a
 better view of the issue. Thank&nbsp;you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If that does not fix it:</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>

<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<p>You should get rid of the McAfee software completely, as it will sooner or later lead to grief (if it hasn't already).&nbsp; The built-in Windows Defender and firewall should be all you need.&nbsp;</p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck at lock screen, PC repair not working, No media found on USB boot disk</h2>
                    <p>My sons desktop PC running windows 10 has become stuck at the lock screen. I successfully managed to access system restore to one available backup and get it running again, only for a day after which it reverted back to being stuck at the lock screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now find that I have no further restore to go back to. I have run PC repair, but the PC returns a message saying this is not possible. Further to this I have tried to download the official windows 10 ISO file to create a bootable media USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accessing the BIOS, I have changed the boot order to the USB which was identified in the list, but on exiting and getting the PC to boot, I receive a message that there is no media present and it therefore reverts to the normal boot - which appears to be
 corrupt/broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please.</p>

            Hi AA.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Quote above was not an answer to the original Question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>" Where can I find ways to get Return on Investment (ROI) in Windows 10?</p>
<p>To make matters worse, I waited a day and there were no other useful input ideas besides the wrong assumption ( Answer ? )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you gave me another Microsoft Link. This one to the Store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a Picture ( JPG ) of the Results with a more clear Question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice the Best that the search could match (Did you mean . . . ) I certainly did not mean to look for games with no hope of ROI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver verifier is a helpful tool in identifying and detecting any driver issues that can cause file corruption or system failures. This is usually used when encountering blue screen errors. For us to better assist you, may we know what exactly happened
 that made you utilize the driver verifier tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we recommend that you upload or send us a screenshot detailing this concern. Refer to this Wiki article posted by
<strong>MVP Shawn</strong> on how you can include your screenshots: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">

<p>I did it because I am getting Kernel-Power error all the time, and my pc just freezes randomly. Temperatures are good, no overclocking, memtest done, reinstalled graphics card drivers, uninstalled realtek sound driver. No change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With driver verifier I got bluescreen and couldn't boot it up again and it didn't say which driver is broken, so I went to safe mode and disabled verifier.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96e5ee19-89ac-4283-8873-634b6a94479b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96e5ee19-89ac-4283-8873-634b6a94479b" /></a></p>

<p>Thank you for posting back with the screenshot included. You are definitely on the right track. Blue screen errors may arise due to hardware related issues which can cause the device to crash and malfunction. Another possible factor is outdated or incorrect
 drivers. Just to make sure we have not missed on anything, may we know if everything is working fine now after you started the PC in safe mode and disabled the driver verifier?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Right-clicking EXE files closes &#40;crashes&#63;&#41; File Explorer.</h2>
                    <p>This just started, and I don't know why:<br />
</p>
<p>From File Explorer, right-clicking ANY file correctly opens the context menu, EXCEPT EXE FILES. Right-click one of those, and the File Explorer window instantly closes. Same thing, if I right-click an EXE file on my desktop. Right-clicking ANY other file
 type ... no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RELATED: In searching for an answer, one possible solution instructed me to open an Admin COMMAND PROMPT. Can't do it. Can't open a regular Command Prompt, either. No error messages ... just nothing happens.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Rajeshwari.<br />
<br />
The problem described in this posting is, regrettably, only one of SEVERAL CRITICAL PROBLEMS I'm dealing with right now. Exhaustive tech support from Dell has just made things worse.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To answer your questions: The first time I noticed this problem was less than 48 hours ago ... following one of my tech support sessions with Dell. They fiddled around with all my startup services and who-knows-what. I can't say they CAUSED this problem; maybe
 this problem's existed for a long time. (How often do I right-click an EXE file?) So WHEN it started, I can't say.<br />
<br />
The other question: I am SOOO confused about this, Rajeshwari!! When I first set up this new computer last November, I used a local account, as I've always done. Later, something I did with Microsoft forced me to change my login to the Microsoft account. And
 then, sometime after that, some problem of set of circumstances caused me to switch back to the local account. I don't understand why I need both, I don't remember WHY I felt it was necessary to stop using the Microsoft account to log in ... I'm just completely
 confused about this whole subject.<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
In an effort to resolve some of the OTHER problems I'm experiencing, a Dell tech person instructed me to reboot in Safe Mode, just as you have. When I did that, however, when Windows began to load, I got this message: "Get Started can't be opened using Built-in
 Administrator account. Sign in with a different account and try again." And CLOSE was my only option.<br />
<br />
Since I had no idea what that meant, or what I was supposed to do, and since Dell is clueless (their solution to every problem is, "Reinstall Windows") ... I don't know if trying to get into Safe Mode AGAIN would work. Do YOU understand what that message was,
 and what it wants me to do?<br />
<br />
Sorry to sound so needful ... I'm just a confused old person, and this is really all way too much for my brain.</p>

            <p>On the list of SEVERAL things that are wrong with this 8-month-old Dell desktop ... ONE of them is, I cannot open Command Prompt (as Administrator). I can get to the regular CMD just fine, but not the Admin prompt. When I try, the cursor spins for a couple
 seconds, and then goes back to the normal arrow. So ... I can't try either of the solutions you recommend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've nearly lost track of all the things that are wrong. In addition to the can't-right-click-EXE-files problem, I'm getting a red-flag error in Event Viewer repeating EVERY 30 SECONDS ... and it's been happening for months! One of the solutions recommended
 for THAT problem is to make changes to the Task Scheduler, but THAT won't open, either ... get an error message when I try. Last time I tried to boot in Safe Mode ... it wouldn't ... got an error message on that, too. My system somehow LOST every Restore Point
 that had been created, up to the last time I checked. There's something screwy with my Credential Manager (whatever the **** that does). And probably worst of all, I'm old and stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only good news is, the computer's WORKING, so I'm inclined to just forget all this nasty stuff, and hope I die before the computer does...... ;)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me assist you to resolve the issue this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I suggest you to download the <strong>Windows 10 ISO </strong>and create a Media Creation tool from&nbsp;another computer and then perform Automatic Repair using the same ISO media.
</p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Refer to the section <strong>Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool&nbsp;</strong>in the above article for creating the tool).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to
<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>, do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the
<strong>Install Windows</strong> page, tap or click <strong>Repair your computer </strong>
link to start the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2.&nbsp;In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
3.&nbsp;Click, <strong>Advanced Options </strong>and then click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
4.&nbsp;After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> There will be no data loss by performing Startup repair. It will format c: driver and reinstall Windows 10. It will remove all the installed apps and updates.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks very much, Sayan. Should the time come when the problems I'm having begin to affect my everyday use ... or when some issue prevents me from doing something I need to do, I will most definitely follow these instructions and hope for the best. In the
 meantime, though, the prospect of losing all installed software, and having to install it again ... eh, I'd rather eat gorilla poop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I were to go through this process, and if I'm LUCKY enough for it all to work ... that still doesn't give me the slightest clue WHY the problems I'm having now exist, and what I can do in the future to prevent it. Right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm amazed, frankly, that after all these years, there STILL isn't a way to repair the OS without trashing all your installed programs. Maybe in Windows 11............ {sigh}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very grateful for your advice!</p>

    <title>Hard Drive Partition is missing following upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshgarrison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Drive Partition is missing following upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Like many others I am experiencing the issue of my HD partition disappeared or returning to an unallocated state following the upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Seagate 4TB Solid State Hybrid. Before the upgrade I had utilized the Seagate DiscWizard to create a usable partition so that I could utilize space beyond 2TB. Following the upgrade to Windows 10, the partition had returned to an unallocated
 state - I was able to correct this issue using the same software as before, but the recovered partition has again returned to an unallocated state and further attempts to use the Seagate DiscWizard software are producing the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error occurred while working with Extended Capacity disk driver. (0x1800009)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tag = 0x62BCB8011D1B46B6<br />
{1} (0x17F000F)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tag = 0x7ABC87484B91F3EF<br />
A device attached to the system is not functioning (0xFFF0)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; code = 8007001F)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tag = 0xBD28FDBD64EDB8C3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also submitted a support ticket to Seagate as well as here to try and find a solution to this issue.&nbsp;I have attempted to find solutions in similar post but&nbsp;have been unsuccessful. Below are screen shots of exactly what I am looking at.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c53b962b-9580-4d0f-86a1-e0bf8f16d364" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23ab7135-ac59-4f5c-b6c8-d0bc07c86137" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66e45549-082a-43af-945f-fbe4b3bb218a" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efb2fc6b-b166-47cc-9aef-855ebeeffd3b" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2155896a-f3e3-466e-8d96-ac8aa740f9ee" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ede13b1-cb8d-4952-9083-9decf57402f7" /></p>

<h2>            windows update KB3140743 error 0x80073712</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iam having a problem with updating and installing KB3140743, I keep getting error code 0x80073712.&nbsp; It means that some of the files are either missing or corrupt.&nbsp; I have already used the windows update diagnostic tool and it informs me that the service
 registration is missing or corrupt.&nbsp; I then used the SFC tool and "verified"&nbsp; the system files,&nbsp; but the tool could not replace or repair all of the missing or corrupted files.&nbsp; I have the SFC details txt file.&nbsp; Can anyone help me with manually repairing the
 corrupted files?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also include the Microsoft support link that I followed to achieve these results:</p>

            <p>Hi Geronimo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community and being part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in installing the latest update on your device. We will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your effort and time spent to resolve the issue. Try the below steps and check if&nbsp;it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due to corrupted/ missing Windows Updates components/ services.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>I suggest you to refer to the article and check if you are able to fix the corrupted files and try to disable/ uninstall the anti-virus software to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I would like to inform that i<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f you are not able to repair some files after performing SFC scan, I suggest you to refer to the point 3 “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix
 some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log <var><span>%WinDir%</span></var>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log”. Under the section “Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)” to repair the corrupted files after performing SFC scan.</span></p>

 files</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Disable the third-party anti-virus software.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue still persists, I suggest you to uninstall the
</span>third-party <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">anti-virus software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2: </strong>I suggest you to perform DISM from the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>On an OEM installed Compaq/HP laptop the user forgot to activate the Windows 7 Permium Home edition. The start-up is not possible annymore. Only in 'save mode'. Activating seem no longer possible. Can someone help? The normale helppage assume that I'am working
 in the 'normal mode'. In the 'save mode' I some buttons.</p>

<blockquote>I allready try your first option: Safe Mode with internet, but the Activate Window7 - button seem to be not avaible in Safe mode. I will now try your second option, the phone.</blockquote>
<p><br />
The 'slui.exe 4' option seem to be only avaible in 'Normal mode', so it was not a proper option, sorry.</p>
<p>I used a 'Retore point' for starting up and that worked, Windows in 'Normal mode' is back.</p>
<p>In the properties of the computer the activation is visible. Problem seem to be solved.</p>
<p>In the 'Safe mode' the activation is not visible.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Multiple Skypes not updating each other</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 Skypes installed on different machines (work, home and Phone). I have text conversations overseas for work everyday. In the past, whenever I had a conversation on any one, all the others updated the text conversation. I could start a conversation
 at work and then continue it at home after hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, recently the other Skypes are not updating with my conversation. So, I start a convo at work and when I get home, I can't see what was said at work. I can still continue the convo but I can't see what was already discussed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a setting or is something wrong ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>Dave</p>

    <title>Cannot activate windows on refurbished Surface 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scaryanna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot activate windows on refurbished Surface 3</h2>
                    I recently purchase a refurbished Surface 3 on eBay. Was just delivered today,been doing initial set up, downloads, installs, etc... But can not make any changes to the customization options because Windows has not been activated . Tried to manually activate
 it but it displays the message "Windows cannot find a certificate for activation. Your admin needs install a valid certificate to activate Windows." Is there a fix or way around this without having to purchase Windows. I kind of just assumed a Microsoft surface
 would just...have windows.

    <title>Files disappearing from Recycle Bin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alice bb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files disappearing from Recycle Bin</h2>
                    
<p>I have had this computer since Christmas, and I love it.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have Windows 7 and everything has worked perfectly up until &nbsp;I got connected to the Internet in late April and so far it has been one problem after another...and that leads me to my latest frustration...files
 that I have deleted to the recycle bin have disappeared...and I did not permanently delete then!</p>
<p>So far I have not lost anything of major importance, except for some photos, but, that's not even a disaster.&nbsp; However, I'm now afraid to delete anything, for fear that I would not be able to restore the item if I needed it.</p>
<p>After losing a handful of files from the recycle bin, I did an experiment:&nbsp; I purposely deleted some items/folders that were empty or contained stuff that I absolutely didn't need.&nbsp; I checked the recycle bin every day and for a while my deleted files were
 still in the recycle bin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, today...they're gone!&nbsp; The only thing I did out of the ordinary was download an update for Adobe Reader.&nbsp; That shouldn't have any affect on what happens to the contents of the recycle bin - or would it?</p>
<p>So, I really would like to know why this is happening.</p>
<p>alice bb</p>
<p>****&nbsp;As of today, June 22/10, I have tried your suggestion Azeez N. as well as others from related topics and still files disappear from Recycle Bin.&nbsp; Now, here's a detailed account of events leading up to the files disappearing from the bin, all from today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checked my email.</p>
<p>Created 2 unimportant Word files and then deleted them to the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>Bell program did a scheduled&nbsp;anti-virus scan.&nbsp; Completed. All OK.</p>
<p>Opened Action Center..........Recycle Bin&nbsp; empty!</p>
<p>Windows Defender recommended a scan.&nbsp; Normal.</p>
<p>Created 3 more unimportant Word files and deleted them to the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>Went to Favorites clicked on Microsoft Answers...........Recycle Bin empty........again!</p>
<p>Created 2 more unimportant Word files and deleted them to the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>Signed in to Windows Mail;&nbsp; Checked mail;&nbsp; signed out.</p>
<p>Selected Microsoft Answers from Favorites; checked My Threads; checked some related questions; signed out.</p>
<p>Java Update notice popped up on screen.&nbsp; Allowed itto download.</p>
<p>Bell Internet Security notice popped up saying it had found and deleted a virus and recommended an immediate scan to see if there were any further infections.</p>
<p>Did DEEP scan.................at 98% complete.............Recycle Bin empty again!</p>
<p>Scan completed.&nbsp; All OK.&nbsp; All these instances happened in one day....Today.</p>
<p>WHAT IS HAPPENING?????????</p>
<p>alice bb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****&nbsp;As of June 25/10 the problem still exists.&nbsp; I am almost certain than it only occurs<strong>when I am online</strong>.&nbsp; I am trying to monitor this more closely and will post the outcome.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems as if the Recycle Bin is on a timer and just empties on queue.&nbsp; One day it seemed to empty about every hour.&nbsp; One thing is for certain, I cannot use the Recycle Bin in it's present operating condition.</p>
<p>Can I completely delete the Bin and reinstall it?&nbsp; If so, how?&nbsp; I am just a novice so please excuse me if this is a stupid question.</p>

            Hi alice bb,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In that case, as your first step,&nbsp;I'd suggest you to put your machine in a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> state, create a new folder, delete it and check if it still disappears. A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If not <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new user account</a> , create a folder and then delete the folder and check over a period of 24 to 48 hours if it disappears.</div>
