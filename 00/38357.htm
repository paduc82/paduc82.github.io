<h2>            Surface RT thinks cookies aren&#39;t allowed but they are</h2>
                    My Surface RT running Windows 11 insists Cookies aren't allowed (needed to load my Microsoft Account) but they are. I did disable them to block a site but enabled them when I'd finished but&nbsp;IE seems to have remembered the old setting. I've shut down the
 browser, completed a cold start etc. but the Surface RT IE seems stuck at this page - anybody know how I should get it to detect the correct settings again?

    <title>Windows 10 Jerky Mouse Syndrome - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tayswaim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Jerky Mouse Syndrome</h2>
                    <p>I have two separate computers having this issue. &nbsp;No recent updates that I know of. &nbsp;Both my Dell desktop and my Asus laptop are being problematic. &nbsp;When I'm running more than one program at a time, the mouse freezes, jerks and lags. &nbsp;It started with my
 desktop computer and I thought it might have been from a game I played on Facebook. &nbsp;It's a game that I've played for over a year with no issue. &nbsp;I have run every scan I have and have no malware or anything. &nbsp;Then, when I started to use my laptop instead to
 avoid the sheer frustration of trying to force the mouse to behave, the laptop started doing it. &nbsp;Again, only when using more than one program. &nbsp;Of course, the moment the task manager opens, it behaves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, if there is an issue with Windows 10 and mice, FIX it. &nbsp;And don't just say to check compatibility when most programs don't have Windows 10 as a listed option under compatibility. &nbsp;And my drivers are all updated. &nbsp;I've tried the various fixes people
 have suggested in this forum with no luck. &nbsp;Please come up with a fix. &nbsp;Obviously, this isn't just happening to me!</p>
<p>If anyone has any more suggestions (have already disabled realtek stuff, messed with the stuff in the mouse settings as folks suggested, removed extraneous programs, etc.), please let me know. &nbsp;I'm getting quite exasperated.</p>

</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect some similar third party application which installed on your both computer causing some conflicts. I can see that you tried uninstalling some suspicious programs, but the problem still appearing. Suggest you to check this
 issue by performing a Clean Boot. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when
 you install a program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

            <p>Wow. &nbsp;So even though there are numerous threads saying many, many people are having this same issue with Windows 10, you still think that I personally have a third party app causing the issue? &nbsp;A clean boot is a very time consuming issue. &nbsp;And wouldn't allow
 me to run programs I'd normally run anyways, in which case, the mouse wouldn't act up. &nbsp;As it acts up whenever multiple windows or programs are run.</p>
<p>Windows has an issue. &nbsp;An issue that has now been reported by many of it's users. &nbsp;Isn't it time to figure out the root cause and do an update to fix this for everyone?</p>

</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really think that the problem is appearing with Windows 10, I suggest you to post a feedback using Windows Feedback. Your feedback help us look into this issue with future updates. It also help us to improve your experience with future version releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do that, check for the latest keyboard and mouse drivers for your device from device Manufacturer website. Do check by installing legacy drivers (I.e. Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) to see if they make any difference, if problem persist with the latest
 drivers.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Bluetooth on my MSi Laptop keeps disappearing. I have searched ALL over to find a solution.

            Hi Ronalene. This started happening a few months ago. At first I thought it was conflicting with some start up programs, so I changed it so that only the bare minimum started up and that seemed to work. However it has only been the past few days that the
 Bluetooth icon doesn't come up at all. Its not "turned off" in the settings as there is no option to turn it on or off. The computer just doesn't recognise it. I'm just in the process now of reinstalling the driver.&nbsp;

            I finished reinstalling and still nothing. My wifi is now actually not working. I have to plug in an Ethernet cable. Even after installing the drivers again it still doesn't work. Might just do a factory reset and see if that fixes my problems.

            I am having the same problem except if i keep messing with ext.files it eventually kicks back on. thing is any time the screen goes to sleep it drops the bluetooth connection and it takes me around a half an hour to get it back working. this is ridiculous
 you spend a ton of money on a nice MSI computer and you cant even use simple bluetooth.&nbsp; I am far far from an apple supporter but the last time i bought PC of this quality was when microsoft released Vista.&nbsp; I bought ultimate and as you can imagine i was less
 than impressed being that have the current tech didnt have drivers out for it.&nbsp; Can microsoft please just create a windows program that works as stable as XP did hell windows 7 was a start what is wrong with you people FML......I dont want to have to dissect
 every simple operation everytime i turn around i just want a PC that is high speed and does the tasks it is suppose to.....I dont need amazing search or crazy add ons or something&nbsp; that makes it what you think is m

            The keyboard backlight combinations for Toshiba (applicable to most of their latest models but for few models it may vary. Please note for pressing function keys like say F10, you may be required to press Function Key also if Function Key is not already enabled)
<br />Toshiba - Function Key + Z
<br />(If above doesn't work - consult the help manual of your computer)

<br />You cannot adjust the time that a keyboard backlight will come on or off, there is no setting in Windows for that or on a Toshiba for that matter . . .

<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am running Windows 8.1 with Update 1 on a laptop with BIOS.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">ReAgentC was working fine on my laptop until about 4 days ago. I know it was working fine because I used it to prepare the recovery partition of a Hyper-V VHD on this laptop. However, from the next day or so whenever I run ReAgentC
 I get "Operation failed: 3".&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Eth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying! Nope, I didn't try system restore. I read about it but was leaving it as a last resort. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention there's a chance some files were corrupted but Windows didn't detect it. Interesting! I thought SFC and DISM /Cleanup-Image were able to detect such corruptions so that came as a surprise. Got any link I can read about this just for my info?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there any place where I can find out what "Operation failed: 3" stands for? Does it mean there are corruptions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hello Eth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I tried SFC - it reported no errors. Tried cleaning up and repairing via the two commands above - again no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really want to restore/ refresh my PC as that would mean re-installing everything. I double checked WinRE yesterday and that works well, so everything seems to be working well just that I can't use ReAgentC. Weird! :(</p>

            <p>Cool! Thanks Eth for the link to the erro code. (You have links for everything! That's nice). :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes ReAgentC works on other laptops. It used to work on this laptop too till about 5 days ago. I was building some VMs and I used ReAgentC to setup the recovery partition of a VM I was building offline. But from the next day it stopped working. So when I
 did a System Restore I went to a point before I built the VM hoping ReAgentC will work then but it does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try and find what path it's searching for and not finding. Will post here if I have any success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

    <title>Xbox One S is unstable and I also struggle with audio lag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -qtips-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S is unstable and I also struggle with audio lag</h2>
                    <p>I got an xbox one s before Christmas, with 3 games. Brand new console. 1 TB HDD. So far used about 7% of storage.
</p>
<p>The only game I play at the moment is Rocksmith 2014 Remastered. All updates are done.&nbsp; Got a few apps. Netflix, Spotify, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes during Rocksmith game session xbox freezes and hangs. Home button tricks let me restart game, but is is not good to see this several times a week. Same goes for Spotify. Sometimes app freezes. Also here restart of app takes care of problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is I checked with various forums for rocksmith and spotify and their support at there seems to be consensus that the problems are related to the xbox hardware or xbox software rather then the apps themselves.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q 1: Any idea how to get a stable xbox that don't freezes?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I notice there is a little bit of delay in the sound from the guitar in Rocksmith. Btw my guitar is connected with the RS Real Tone cable. Audio from the xbox goes via spdif to hometheater amp. The notes on the screen don't match very well with the
 sound. When I practice songs I already know I play by ear rather then visual input from the screen, to practice to stay in time. And the delay is really making this difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sort of use the screen on songs I don't know very well, but I fear practicing this way will actually teach me to play off beat or an 8th or 16th behind and when playing in a band setting that faulty practice might be hard to shake.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q 2: Think an spdif-to-analog-3.5mm dac/converter can help with the latencies issues?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the xbox one s because I had a 360 years back. And for me that was worry free gaming. Start up and play. Every time. No stress keeping a gaming pc up to date, fault fixing to the wee hours of the night rather then playing games and overall stress.
 So I kind of expected the same for the xbox one s as well. And now it turns out xbox is unstable, games freezes and apps the same. To making things even worse the sync between audio and video is off and that delay kind of make me feel the whole xbox experience
 is not so good like I remembered from Xbox 360. </p>

            Hi,<br />
You may follow the suggestions and check.<br />
Some applications do not support installation over a Remote Desktop connection, which is the type of connection used to connect to a virtual machine session when the Integration Components package is installed.<br />
You need to disable integration features on your Virtual PC.<br />
a. Go to Virtual Windows XP mode.<br />
b. Load the content of the DVD in C:\ of XP (So not in Win7).<br />
c. Reduce the window so that you see "Tools".<br />
d. When you try to disable Integration features you have to give the administrator password.<br />
e. Go to Tools - Setting - Integration Features - Disable drives.<br />
f. This will make the Window 7 drives invisible.<br />
g. Restart XP.<br />
h. Install your program.<br />
i. Enable drives

            <p>Thanks for the comments.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not sure about any error codes because the BSOD is filled with verbiage but it only stays on the screen for a second or two.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is not enough time to read what it says.<span>&nbsp; </span>I will try the reinstall and report back later on the results.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Good idea.<span>&nbsp; </span>It might well be, however, that this is not a MS issue at all, but rather an Apple issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Does anyone out there have a iPod Touch/iPhone that will pair with a Windows 7 PC Bluetooth?</p>

</span>Now I get a message that says that my PC is not supported by the iPod Touch Bluetooth or vice versa.<span>&nbsp; I can pair the PC with my cell phone and other devices just fine.&nbsp;</span>Thanks for the helpful comments, Azeez N, but I think now more
 that ever that it is a Apple-MS incompatibility issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Would still be interested to know if anyone else has been able to pair an Apple product with a Win-7 PC Bluetooth?</p>

            Hi JamesRae1 ... Are you seeing that in the windows update history?
<br />If so, then it is probably your HP laptop does not support it.
<br />You can hide the update so it doesn't keep trying.
<br />See link.

            Some of my devices and applications are not working, what should I do?<br />
<br />
A: If your internet connection is working in Windows 7, I suggest you try obtaining the drivers through Windows Update. Click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Windows Update &gt; Turn on Windows Update. A list of available updates will then be downloaded, you will have
 the option to view them, do so and check off the appropriate drivers or software patches you need and click Install. You can also check the manufacturer’s website for patches, updated drivers or to simply find out about Windows 7 support for the particular
 product.<br />
<br />
Also, please run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to find out how ready your system is for Windows 7<br />

Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Which all the Microsoft fixes have you tried to fix the issue?<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you receive Windows Update error 80072ee2 while checking for updates, the Windows Update servers might be experiencing an unusually high number of requests
 for updates. Close Windows Update, wait 10 to 15 minutes, and then run Windows Update again. You can also wait for Windows Update to run at its next scheduled time.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link and see if that helps.<br />
<br />

Post us the results after you try the above steps.</span>

    <title>The Subject is how to return ALL FILE PERMISSIONS back to their - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericyoung2  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Subject is how to return ALL FILE PERMISSIONS back to their default state. I&#39;m certain a lot of people have somehow inserted themselves into authority.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had recently looked up the answer to this question and none of them were for Windows 10. I am seriously shocked at just HOW MANY ACCOUNTS WITH ALMOST ULTIMATE AUTHORITY have appeared and I can't even access around half of my files now. I have also
 been noticing that they have been "Letting themselves in thru the back doors" primarily in Command Prompt and have been copying, changing, deleting and a whole number of scenarios I have been trying to fight back against but to little avail. Please.......I
 need some kind of answer on how to get rid of all but the accounts with Default authority that my laptop started off with in the beginning! If someone.....anyone could please help......I would be indebted for life!!!! LoL</p>

<p>In your latest reply (see above) you wrote that you want to take away people's authority over your computer. Previously you asked "how to get rid of all but the accounts".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here......this is just one of the MANY files I have found of someone doing things to my computer by entering into Command Prompt. I have like 60 to 70 more......each more confusing than the last. My desire is to stop them from being able to enter
 my computer via Command Prompt and to remove each of the accounts with Permissions equal to an Administrator. I believe right&nbsp;now there are around 26 accounts with almost all the Permissions. Maybe you understand this one I copied cuz there are SO MANY MORE
 I HAVE FOUND BY ACCIDENT :(</p>

<p>Are you referring to User Account Control?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, go to its Setting and move the slider all the way to the bottom to Never Notify.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you still can't launch your Flt Sim, then try launching it as Administrator (i.e. right click on its .exe file and then
 Run as Administrator).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have success in using these methods, and you're unhappy about leaving the slider in its new position, then go back to it and reset the slider.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully, it may recognize FSX as not a harmful program and won't give further problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;As well, if
 you're using an add on, UAC may also be detecting that add on as a problem.</p>

            <p>Whether you have a logo PC or you’ve built your own PC, the recommendations for Windows 8 include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 GHz or faster processor <br />
1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) <br />
16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) <br />
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One new element to Windows 8 is the requirement that Metro style applications have a minimum of 1024x768 screen resolution, and 1366x768 for the snap feature. If you attempt to launch a Metro style app with less than this resolution (e.g. 800x600, 1024x600)
 you will receive an error message.</p>

            Upgrading is not cheap. Wait until the 8.1 version comes out. Maybe MS will run another fire sale to upgrade to windows 8 like the first sale when upgrading was $40 for a limited time. If you have to pay the full price--$140, skip it and wait until you
 can buy a new computer. Add another $200 to the upgrade cost and you can buy a new computer.

<p>Hey Carring</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to keep us updated on this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be something in your network configuration that is currently filtering out your console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to try and use the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Network Connection Error Solution</a>&nbsp;and see if that works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you could try using an additional MAC address from another device in your home that is connected to your network with no problems. This can be done by going into "Advance Settings" in your&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">network
 settings</a> on your console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each device has a unique MAC address [or&nbsp;Wi-Fi address]&nbsp;and to get them it might be a different procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a shot and let us know your results!</p>

    <title>Surfacebook Suddenly asking for Bitlocker Recovery Key - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surfacebook Suddenly asking for Bitlocker Recovery Key</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Surface Book for over a year now with no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took my Laptop out of my satchel and booted up as usual. I was greeted with Bitlocker asking me for the recovery key? I figured that out and now it states that I cannot use Windows Facial unlock without a PIN. My PIN was randomly erased? Now every time
 I boot it up it wants this Recovery Key. I did nothing to turn this on, it just randomly started doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did this get turned on?</li><li>How do I stop this from happening?</li><li>Why would my PIN reset?</li></ul>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
There are several reasons that might make a device go into recovery mode. For example, your organization might have a password security policy that locks you out after a certain number of failed attempts to sign in. Or perhaps your device encountered a hardware
 malfunction, an unexpected configuration change, or another security event. Requiring a recovery key helps ensure that only an authorized person can unlock your PC and restore access to your encrypted data.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to stop the prompt that requires you to put in the recovery key every time you boot your device up, follow these steps on how to turn off BitLocker.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Bitlocker </strong>in the search bar. Click <strong>Manager BitLocker.<br />
</strong></li><li>Click<strong> Suspend Protection</strong> for the operating system drive.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>to continue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;<br />
<br />
When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.<br />
