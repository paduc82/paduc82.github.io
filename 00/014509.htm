            Without even a little more information, there's no way we could do anything but speculate...
<div><br />
<div>First, what do you mean by "it" won't work? Does the file load? Or do you get an error? Or a crash?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the file loads, what is "it" that doesn't work - a particular macro? A control? An event macro?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does the macro (or macros) have Win-only system calls? Does the file use Win-only Active-X controls?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the macro(s) run, do you get a error? An incorrect result? A crash?</div>

    <title>C6-00 Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray_h---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            C6-00 Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Problem 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accuweather seems to have hung on&nbsp;"Adding a Location". I've tried removing the app and re-loading and it always returns to the same screen - blank, apart from the sub title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've attempted to download the app from the Nokia site but I can't seem to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More important than Problem 1!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use PC Suite to synchronise the phone with Outlook using a usb cable. I tend to synchronise once or twice a week. All worked well until I went to synchronise after downloading the latest PC Suite update. Initially the PC couldn't see the phone, then the
 computer reported that the phone was connected but PC Suite couldn't see the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried downloading the most recent version of Ovi Suite. The download process seems to have&nbsp;failed as the installation process went into a loop which wouldn't stop, even when the computer was powered down and restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've since done a system restore to remove the recent updates. That's removed the Ovi problem and PC Suite now knows that the phone is connected but when the Synchronise process is started, that part of the system reports that the phone isn't connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone any suggestions that might resolve either of these issues please?</p>

<p>I had been using PC Suite. When that failed I downloaded Ovi Suite but the process appeared to have failed with a message Unable to Read Track and the install routine going into a continuous loop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a system restore, removing both the Ovi suite abortive download and the latest version of PC Suite. With the old version of PC Suite re-installed I can view the content of both memory and memory card but I can't synchronise mail, calendar or contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge the only other possible cause of any problem could be a switch from AVG to Microsoft Security Essentials a week or so ago. I can't remember whether I have synchronised the phone since that time.</p>

            PC Suite only has limited capabilityon newer phones. get Nokia PC cleaner and run that before trying to reinstall Ovi Suite. If you suspect MSE, try whitelisting Ovi Suite on it.

<p>Many thanks for your suggestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've used PC Suite for synchronising with Outlook for several years and bought the C6-00 specifically because it would synch with Outlook. Until just recently PC Suite has always done what I required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can use other parts of PC Suite to view and transfer files between phone and computer and to connect the&nbsp;PC to the Internet via the phone. I can also trigger a sync of my limited media files from my PC without any obvious problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to Sync using PC Suite always worked automatically before. PC Suite is minimised in the PCs system tray and reports when the phone is connected. Sync Centre (also minimised in the system tray and which used to appear&nbsp;when the phone was connected)
 is now semi resident in the system tray all the time. When I try&nbsp;the Enable at start-up option the Phone Selector window opens with no phones shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I then connect the C6-00 the phone appears in the list greyed out (showing the usb connection symbol, which isn't greyed out). The app then does not let me select the phone; all I can do is to close the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click the Sync button in the PC Suite window - PC Suite recgnises that the C6-00 is connected via the usb cable - the PC Sync screen appears with the words "Not connected" in the title bar. The phone selector, Help and Exit buttons are active, all the
 others are greyed out.</p>

            Its because simply PC Suite doesnt fully recognize it (the phone). Ovi syncs to Outlook with no problem. The new phones like N8 doesnt work with PC Suite. Its that simple. The new updates wont work with the new phones anymore. just use Ovi

<p>Many thanks. I'll try Ovi Suite again and report back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I fail to understand why despite using the clean up routine to remove the new version of PC Suite, the restored old version suddenly no longer did what it previously did, quite satisfactorily, for over six months. I can but assume that the clean
 up routine doesn't do as it says on the tin and leaves a few traces behind.</p>

<p><strong>Latest Update</strong> <em>having spent much of the morning on the problem</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've managed to delete previous incarnations of both Ovi and PC Suite. I then attempted to re-install Ovi. I should be that lucky!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation almost completes and then the message "Can't read Tracks" appears. Despite this the program appears to start, recognises that the phone is&nbsp;there but says it isn't! The installation program then appears to go into an endless loop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current position is that PC Suite stopped synchronising with Outlook (and nothing I could find to do would solve the problem even when I did a system restore). PC Suite has now been removed from my PC - or should I say, I've uninstalled it. However there
 are still numerous traces of it and Ovi in the registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi still won't install successfully even after three attempts and has now been removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, although I can&nbsp;plug the C6-00 into the PC via the usb cable, there's now no software on the PC that will detect its presence, so I am stuffed, unless someone knows how to fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Did you use Nokia PC Cleaner program to uninstall? Otherwise corrupted registry entries from either Suites may have been left behind.

<p>I'm 95% certain that I used that for the uninstall although I may have used the uninstall option that comes with one of the two applications and then run PC Cleaner.</p>

    <title>Phone numbers and contacts name issue - Lumia 520 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hharry---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phone numbers and contacts name issue - Lumia 520</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there,<br />
<br />
There seems to be an issue with contacts, Nokia Lumia 520, and how their phone numbers are stored. When storing a contact number with a local format (ie 099123123) instead of internaltional (ie +59899123123) and receiving a sms message or phone call, the contact
 number fails to find the contact name (the received number is in international format, but the stored number is in local format). This only happens on the lumia 520, because I have a lumia 720 and 920 and it works fine.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if im clear, but is there any way I can fix this? The device already has the lumia black update. And doing a soft reset doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I have googled a bit, and some people say this happens when you have a phone number twice but I have checked and this is not the problem.<br />
<br />
An example:<br />
<br />
Contact name: Alice, number 099123123.<br />
Send sms to alice, name displays fine on the message hub.<br />
Receive response from Alice, number is not recognized and shows as +59899123123 in the message hub.</p>

    <title>Excel formula for age giving incorrect age - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaxndm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel formula for age giving incorrect age</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a spreadsheet with a list of names together with their ages. &nbsp;In column C is a DOB 01/11/2006 and in column D is their age using the formula&nbsp;=(YEAR(NOW())-YEAR(C3))</p>
<p>However, it is returning the age as 11. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For those with a birthday this year that has already passed the correct age is showing, i.e C: 11/05/2007 D: 10 &nbsp;It is just incorrect for the birthday's that are yet to come this current year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get the result to show the age that the person is now and not on their next birthday (which is later this year)?<br />
Thanks :)<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 build 10586.</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded the latest Windows 10 build (10586) via Windows Update; it downloaded fine then did the preparation for the upgrade but then stalled at 40% total and 23% install features and apps. To get anything else I had to force shutdown my PC then restart
 it. The Windows system then reverted to the present build (10576). I tried twice and got the same results. This seems to be the same as an earlier build that did exactly that same thing. No help was forthcoming from Microsoft at that time. Is there anything
 to fix this? I had to wait for a newer build previously to upgrade</p>

            <p>I also had the install "hang" problem, but found a very simple way to get things going.&nbsp; I hesitate to say "fix", because it seems like a bug, and have found a usable work-around.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully downloaded the new build, do not restart right away.&nbsp; If you have any SD card in your computer, take it out, then reboot.&nbsp; Your upgrade should complete without trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if USB drives or other removable media effects the completion of the upgrade or not.&nbsp; I do know I had tried multiple times without success until I removed my SD card.&nbsp; Then everything worked fine.&nbsp; Try this before attempting a clean install.&nbsp;
 It may help you avoid a lot of frustration.</p>

<h2>            The standard way got me in trouble...</h2>
                    <p>I prefer clean installs over updates, I've always done it off-line and disabled as many options as I can across the board. Only a couple of times on my old 32bit laptop and with specific builds ran into a failure or a rare SOD .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, just for the heck of it and for the first time ever on my 64bit laptop, I decided to clean install build 17723 the standard way, meaning that I did it on-line and said yes to everything MS asked for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well..., guess what? the first restart went fine but I run into errors everywhere. During the second restart, not only I got a GSOD but I couldn't recover from it despite trying everything I could, not even safe mode would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Makes you wonder: could installation failures be caused by the standard way most users go about installing or upgrading from previous builds? or perhaps the bugs seen in the last few builds were inherited by 17723?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please, before you answer with a "I don't have any trouble installing or updating", just type 17723 in the search box of the FBH and look at the amount of failures and errors reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your comments.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

            In your "standard"(clean install?) upgrade build do you have any 3rd party programs installed and anything plugged into media /USB slots except for wired KB/Mouse? Just curious as what is an online clean install.

<p>A clean install (either on or off-line) is done on an empty HD with a brand new partition via an ISO file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the main reason I prefer clean installs over updates/upgrades, it takes the unknown factor out of the equation. If the build has any major bugs, they cannot be attribute to the previous one, 3rd party AVs, wireless USB devices or anything else outside
 the OS itself.</p>

</p><p>Yes, you did missunderstand, please read again.</p>
<p>I said the original clean install failed when done the "right" way, the standard way, thus the title of this discussion. It did not fail when done offline and using my own procedure before going online.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's down to drivers and all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes while the installation is being done.<br />

            Ok I do clean installs all of the time but you saying online threw me as any install using an ISO into a clean HD is offline until it reboots and loads the installed operating system at which time it will ask you to go online which I never do until later,
 thanks for your reply

            Well, you posted this in the wrong forum, but I believe once you installed office it&nbsp;is bound to that PC.&nbsp; So, even though you restored it to factory settings, that doesn't change the fact that you used up the license upon installation.

                    <p>So I'm running Microsoft Word, version 16.17 for Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to Mac OS Mojave and now I'm having issues with Microsoft Word, specifically with the Spelling and Grammar Check Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It starts OK, but then after a word or 2, this is what&nbsp;it looks like:</p>

<p><span>Hi WLCheckem,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tested with Word v16.17 on Mac OS Mojave and I encountered the same issue as you mentioned. The spell check window will be greyed out after correcting two or three words. If, I close
</span><span>Spelling and Grammar</span><span>window once it is greyed out and reopen again by going to
</span><span>Review</span><span>tab, then it will correct two or three errors and then it will be greyed out again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I further tested with insider fast version i.e.16.18 and I reviewed two pages of document full of spelling errors, it worked fine and as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, in conclusion we can say, the spell checker works fine in insider fast version 16.18. In this case, you can either choose to stay with v16.17 and wait for<span>&nbsp;
</span>v16.18 to release in production or join</span><strong> </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-Office-Insider-f4208185-b63a-4b68-9c7a-9a32d2411c16#ID0EAACAAA=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">insider

                    A friend who has an E61 told me that its possible to boot a Windows OS on it. Since the E65 is meant to be the same software does it have this capability?<br />
<br />
Also, is there a way to change the order of the front page menu so that conference calling is not the first in the menu list. Also, is there a way to customise what the left and right keys do under the screen like other Nokias? Mine is left, New SMS and Right

            While it is technically possible to port almost any operating system to any hardware with a processor, display, keyboard, etc., Windows (even the smallest Windows Mobile) has not been done for the E61 or any other Nokia phone.<br />
<br />
You can customize the standby screen settings using the "Settings" application (that you should find under the "Tools" submenu in the main menu). If you don't find it, check the User Guide.

            Unfortunately, no. Outlook for Mac doesn't even have the ability to find calendar events with attachments nor any ability to sort by attachment.

When&nbsp; / if you upgrade to Outlook.com from Hotmail, you get the new Outlook.com service, and you keep everything about your account intact.<br />
To the best of my knowledge when you migrate all your data and settings work. <br />

You can revert back to Hotmail if you so desire.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>outlook.com is just a " preview " version, don't make the conversion just yet.
<br />
Do NOT create a new outlook.com address.</p>
<p>Use your current hotmail.com address and password to sign in to outlook.com.</p>
<p>That way, whenever you want to, you can switch back to hotmail with just 2 clicks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Renaming your account as a part of your upgrade to Outlook.com is optional. You can continue to use your existing Hotmail address and still upgrade.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Renaming your you existing Microsoft Account to a new one in the Outlook.com domain causes your sign in name to change from your existing @hotmail.com address to your new @outlook.com address. Your existing address becomes an alias of your new account so
 that mail delivery is uninterrupted. After renaming your account you will sign in with your new account to all services you previously accessed with your old account. You can refer to this article for things to consider when renaming to an @Outlook.com account:</p>

    <title>Excel sum error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mb_980  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel sum error</h2>
                    <p>Hello...</p>
<p>I have a strange issue, which is taxing my admittedly small brain: -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this formula in a cell (Cell1)</p>
<p>=1610.2+SUM(Current!M6:Current!M500000) and the answer should be and shows 502.83, which is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am comparing this cell (Cell 1) result to another cell (Cell 2) which contains the same number, but keyed in as opposed to generated from a formula.</p>
<p>Cell 2 has conditional formatting that shows green when Cell 2 matches Cell 1 and red when it does not.</p>
<p>But I could not get this to work in green when the same number was showing in both cells.</p>
<p>After much playing about I discovered (using EXACT) that Cell 1 formula actually returns 502.830000000001.</p>
<p>I have checked every cell in the sum column M6:M500000 and there is no number greater than 2 decimal places. All then numbers are manually entered and are monetary values, so no requirement to ever go beyond 2DP.</p>
<p>Also cells 3k to 500k are empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is...where has the 0.000000000001 come from?</p>
<p>Or, what stupid mistake am I making.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The short answer is: this is a typical issue with binary computer arithmetic that uses 64-bit binary floating-point to represent numeric values, as Excel and most applications do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work-around is: when you expect a calculation with non-integers (or division of integers) to be accurate to some number of decimal places (e.g. 2 in your case), explicitly round to that number of decimal places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, change your formula to =ROUND(1610.2+SUM(Current!M6:Current!M500000), 2) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: The EXACT function compares strings, not numeric values. You did not need to use it to see the floating-point anomaly. Simply temporarily format the cell to display 15 significant digits, or use a formula of the form =A1&amp;"".)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>
</p><p>The longer answer is....&nbsp;64-bit binary floating-point cannot represent most decimal fractions exactly. Moreover, the approximation of a decimal fraction varies depending on the magnitude of the integer part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consequently, for example, IF(10.12 - 10 = 0.12, TRUE) returns FALSE(!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(In contrast, IF(10.23&nbsp;- 10 = 0.23, TRUE) returns TRUE as expected, but only by coincidence and&nbsp;due to a dubious heuristic in Excel.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is complicated by the fact that Excel displays (formats) only up to 15 significant digits (rounded).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consequently, the constant 0.12 appears to be 0.1200000000000000000, even when formatted with 19 decimal places. But in fact, the exact decimal presentation of the internal binary representation of 0.12 is 0.119999999999999,99555910790149937383830547332763671875
 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>In contrast, 10.12 is exactly 10.1199999999999,992184029906638897955417633056640625 , so 10.12 - 10 is exactly 0.119999999999999,2184029906638897955417633056640625 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I use period for the decimal point and comma to demarcate the first 15 significant digits.)</p>

            <p>I suspect you're exceeding the size of a single expression. But I can suggest a much simpler solution: a two-field Groups table with a field for the Code and the corresponding Group for that code. This would let you do a very simple join of AllTickets to
 Groups joining by price_code to find the group, or to put a criterion on the group; and it would let you easily enter new price codes or groups without having to edit your SQL.</p>

</p><p>You can reinstall Office 2013 onto your laptop with a new hard drive from your Office Account so long as your Office was properly installed using the email address and password for a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; You can sign into your Office Account using the same

    <title>Comments Appear Off-Screen in Excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comments Appear Off-Screen in Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seeing a consistent issue where in medium-sized spreadsheets with comments, if I have "Freeze Panes" turned on, occasionally the comments of certain cells become relocated permanently off-screen. The behavior continues even once Freeze Panes is turned
 off again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hovering over a cell containing such a comment shows only a black arrow. The only way I can read the comment is by right-clicking on the cell, choosing Edit Comment, and hoping the comment appears off to the extreme left or top of the spreadsheet, smushed.
 When I do this I can pull the "smushed" comment out from the edge and resize it to be readable, until at some later time it travels off-screen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else seeing this behavior? It's troublesome for my coworkers because they cannot read my comments without making a time-consuming effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue happens both on Windows 7 SP1 Enterprise 64-bit computers, as well as Windows 8.1 professional machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

            <p>Try a soft reset(vol.down+power for ~10 sec. until phone vibrates and restarts). If that doesn't help verify you have the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing works and you are totally spooked out, do a hard reset(more about it&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">here</a>).

<h2>            Issue with Screen Share for Skype Business Users</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The issue we are having arises when users join a meeting that already has screen share active. When joining some people will be unable to see the share screen and it will eventually fix by either typing in chat or rejoining another way. Is there a reason
 that this is happening or some way to fix it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Mattbruke12,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, the people joined in the meeting will not see the shared screen. Hence, Iâ€™d like to confirm the situation.<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue happen in the users who try to joined the meeting in progress? Further, if it is, how did these users joined in the meeting, via the phone dial-in or using Skype for Business desktop client?<br />
2. Will the people joined later see the blank or black screen in the conference window?<br />
3. While they cannot see the screen, could they hear sounds?<br />
4. Whatâ€™s the Skype for Business client version of the users? Please capture the screenshot in
<strong>Help </strong>&gt; <strong>About Skype for Business</strong>.<br />
<br />
Since it works fine in my lab with the latest version 16.0.4705.1000 of Skype for Business, please check if the users have the latest version via the
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/uclobby/2016/07/29/skype-for-business-2016-update-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update history</a>. And also, when you join a meeting, please select <strong>Use Skype for Business</strong> to enable the video. Besides, if â€˜itâ€™ll eventually fix by typing in chat or rejoining the meetingâ€™ as you mentioned, it might be a good idea to check
 if the network of the users works fine. Itâ€™s possible for the bad network bring about the online meeting delayed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marvin<br />

1. Delete all unused blank Rows and Columns. Sometimes blank cells also occupy space in memory, it they contained data earlier.
</p>
<p>2. Save the file in Excel Binary Format (*.xlsb) to reduce the size. It works exactly same as (*.xlsm) but with smaller size.</p>
