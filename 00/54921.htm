<h2>            Windows 10&#58; HP Solutions Center error message &#34;Please plug in USB cable or re-run the setup program</h2>
                    I have installed an HP c4180 printer. I can print from the computer, but I cannot open the solutions center in order to scan. The HP troubleshooter indicates the software is installed.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How is the printer connected to the computer?&nbsp;USB, Bluetooth&nbsp;or Wireless?</p>
<p>2. Did you try the suggestion given in&nbsp;my earlier post?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;When exactly do you get this error message, while selecting the option to scan inside the program(HP solution center) or while trying to open the program? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to subtopic "<span>Solution Center is missing or fails to open correctly" in the section "</span>What if I can't find or use Solution Center after upgrading Windows?‚Äù and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists and if you&nbsp;have connected the printer through USB cable, you may connect the USB cable to different USB port and restart both printer and computer to check if it helps.</p>
<p>You may also try re-installing the program and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try to run the program in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1. Right click&nbsp;</span><span>on the&nbsp;application and select <span>
Properties.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2<span>.</span> Click the <span>Compatibility</span> tab and then tick the box labelled
<span>Run this program in compatibility mode for.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Select the version of Windows that the app worked in before and Click
<span>OK.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Missing file&#58; MSComm32.ocx - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing file&#58; MSComm32.ocx</h2>
                    Good Morning, I have a Lenovo Yoga 3 with Windows 10. A while ago the computer was extremly slow and I had to do a recovery operation. I used the option where all my personal files was saved. After the recovery I was unable to run one of my programs (Logger32).
 The computer said: File MSComm32.ocx is missing. After many attemps I deleted the program and downloaded a new copy of the program. Download works fine and I can extract the program but when I run the exe. for installing it stops. Now it says "error ". I run
 it as Admin and I have set the UAC to minimum. As I understand the file: MSComm32.ocx is necessary for running my program. Is there any way to restore this file in all places it is needed or what to do?

<p>No, it didn¬¥t worked with just downloading the file. I had to download the Microsoft Repair file for W 10 and that solved my problem.</p>

    <title>DVD Region &#34;Not Selected.&#34; Unable to change. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottiec3  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD Region &#34;Not Selected.&#34; Unable to change.</h2>
                    
<p>My computer is unable to play DVDs at this time. I do not know when it began since I stopped watching DVDs on my computer a while ago but recently I tried and was unable. When the error occurred it suggested I update my video card driver which I did and
 still it did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am normally in Region 1 and after updating the driver I checked my SCSI drive and under DVD Region it said "Not Selected." It says I have 5 changes left and I tried to change it to Region 1 but it would not. An error message arose saying "Unable to update
 region setting. The drive reports that it requires media of the destination region..." I had a DVD and tried several others with no luck. I tried rebooting and uninstalling recently updated materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it started, but am unsure since I only recently found this problem, when I flashed my DVD drive. I have a TSST TS-L632H ATA device. It was recommended I flash it to update the driver to allow me to burn DVDs. It didn't help and I still cannot burn
 DVDs. But I'm wondering if that might have caused the problem. I saw similar issues posted but no answers that were of any help. I updated from D200 to D300.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm looking at buying an external dvdrw for my Rt surface but would it work. As I know android devices will not read or write to a cd / dvd so I'm wondering if this restricted version of windows will</p>

            <p>Hello paulwheelhouse, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all the 200+ CD/DVD players listed in the Microsoft&nbsp;Compatibility webpage, none is listed as compatible with Windows RT. You would need an app, I'm not aware of any for a CD/DVD player in the Windows RT Store.</p>

            <blockquote>None of the Surface devices will have a built-in CD player. You could buy an external&nbsp;CD device though and connect it to the Surface via USB.
</blockquote>
<p><br />
If one were to go with this option it would be highly recommended to first check the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/winrt/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Compatibility Center</a>&nbsp;to ensure that the device is compatible with Windows RT. If it is compatible it should be possible to load a CD in order to view files saved on it or direct the Music app, for example, to play the files that are on the disk
 but it will not be possible to run or install programs from the disk. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit:&nbsp;To answer the second part of the question, the Surface&nbsp;Pro with Windows 8&nbsp;should be able to use external CD/DVD drives as the device itself will not have one built in and has the ability to install Legacy programs on it. As this is the case, paired
 with the&nbsp;fact that you will actually be able to install&nbsp;3rd-party drivers on it, it's safe to assume that&nbsp;an external CD/DVD drive will be a necessity to install&nbsp;the majority of your Legacy programs in order&nbsp;to get the most out of the Surface Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi godaktungmar,
<br />
<br />Boot into BIOS (Usually F2 or Del on the Manufacturers logo screen when your system starts 
<br />
<br />Turn off Secure Boot in BIOS (UEFI) settings 
<br />
<br />Check to see if this resolves this issue, if not turn Secure Boot back on . . .

<h3> sanford90usmc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grey Translucent Bar, Wont Go away unless reboot&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have my xbox one setup for power saving, so it takes a little while to start up every time.</p>
<p>The problem that I have is randomly when I turn on the console there will be a Translucent Grey box in the bottom center of the screen. The box/bar is persisent on any xbox one app or game, but does not effect the tv (Tried switching inputs and its not there.)
 This bar will not go away during netflix, games, live tv or anything. I've tried changing settings and haven't found a fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time that this happens, I can restart the console and then it is gone. This is random occuring, but random enough that it has happened 3 times in the past week. I think this is some sort of software glitch because it did not happen with the original
 dashboard; it has only began since the windows 10 themed update.</p>

<p>I've searched online and can't find anyone else with this issue. Am I the only one? I will take a screenshot the next time it occurs, but i'm not sure if it will matter.</p>

                    I have a computer that runs Windows XP Media Center. It has two Kingston 1G ram cards and 2 empty slots. I want to add more memory and was wondering if I can can add two 4G memory cards in the 2 empty slots at a higher megaHZ rate? Intel motherboard is
 2 core duo @2.13 MHz.

            There is so much wrong with your question.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Your version of Windows (XP Media Center edition) can support a maximum of 4 GB of RAM (it actually won't be able to
<br />
2.&nbsp; Your unidentified motherboard may or may not be capable of supporting 1 G in each of two slots and 4 G in each of another 2 slots.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Your unidentified motherboard may or may not tolerate mismatched memory speeds.&nbsp; If it does, all memory will run at the speed of the slowest module.<br />
<br />
If you decide to upgrade to a 64-bit operating system (that could use 8 -- or 10 -- GB of RAM), either look up your motherboard's specs or use the Crucial Memory Advisor tool&nbsp;

<h2>            Display Driver for GT630</h2>
                    <p>Running Dell Dim 8400, my Nvidia 6800 graphic card died with no VGA or anything.&nbsp; Replaced it with a recommended GT 630.&nbsp; Could not get it loaded per instructions and while loading MSFT download WDDM1.1 &amp; WDDM1.2 + Nvidia 306.97 driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was loading Nvidia
 driver 310.70 at the time and the whole system went into a loop following "to&nbsp;install your new software" restart now?...&nbsp; The disk went into a continue&nbsp;Write or Read state with a Black Screen.&nbsp; I could only power-off (after 10 mim)&nbsp;no screen&nbsp;came up in&nbsp;safe
 mode,&nbsp;which failed.&nbsp; Looping disk Read or Write.&nbsp; Powered off and tried agian and got into "safe Mode".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabled the&nbsp;GT 630&nbsp;video device and was able to exit safe mode and&nbsp;activate windows 7&nbsp;in VGA&nbsp;display&nbsp;mode.&nbsp; I just finished "SFC /scanner" and "CHKDSK /r"</p>
<p>with NO ERRORS found.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed one&nbsp;comment about the Registry for&nbsp;XP where the drivers would not install.&nbsp; This was a&nbsp;XP upgraded to Win-7 in 2010.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone help in pointing out some of the registry keys that might be&nbsp;preventing the GT 630 from&nbsp;working/installing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstall the&nbsp;all Nvidia&nbsp;drivers and files deleted expect one in the pgm catalog&nbsp;"physX= can't fined&nbsp;uninstall mod"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking of restoring my sytem&nbsp;to before&nbsp;install the new&nbsp;graphic card.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have check "chip sets" with Dell and it is the one I&nbsp;have appled releated to win-7 required&nbsp;for Intel to run and load win-7.</p>

            It may be an Intel graphics driver, if you have any Intel products on your system but don‚Äôt trust Microsoft to install the correct driver then download the Intel driver updater:

            Hi Gerrry,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Driver updates are best suited from the computer manufacturer.
<br />When the update is offered, hide this update using the following troubleshooter tool:
<br />
<br />Download Windows 10 Updates Troubleshooter Tool from Microsoft
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F2...</a>
<br />
<br />Click on "Hide updates" option and you'll be able to hide desired update given in the list.

            Hi Gerry
<br />
<br />There is no risk to this update, that update is for IME (Intel Management Engine)
<br />
<br />You can go ahead and install that update . . .
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty getting that update, go to Settings - System - About
<br />
<br />Note down the version No. (1803, 1809 . . etc) of Windows 10 you have installed
<br />
<br />Then, go to this page on that Microsoft Catalog, then download and install the correct version for your PC (only install a version marked 1/21/2019) . . .
<br />

<p>Thanks to the 3 of you who replied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem, ie proposed update, disappeared from the updates to be done. It was the only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree that driver updates should come from the manufacturer, that sounds the most sensible approach to me, I am quite surprised that Dell and Microsoft haven't worked out a protocol to have these updates sent ONLY by Dell..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please don't laff, but since 3 of you proposed solutions, how do I 'close' ie tell this discussion thread&nbsp; the problem is solved ??</p>

Do you *have* to utilize Microsoft Remote Desktop in your situation or could you utilize something like TeamViewer?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
It would be easier to switch to TeamViewer or something else such as that in most cases - especially for personal assistance/assisting purposes.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
However, I will ask if you have been through this:<br />

<h2>            USB root hub code 52, USB ports not working anymore</h2>
                    <p>Ever since Windows updated last week I have been unable to use any of my USB ports, and in the device manager the USB root hub (xHCI) has the message "Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware
 or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code 52)". I have been searching for a fix, tried uninstalling the driver and restarting, tried disabling driver
 signing checking and so far nothing has worked. Anyone else having this problem? Anyone have a fix? I'm on an Asus q501la and windows 8.1</p>

            <p>Yeah I was worried this might be something bigger since none of the fixes seem to work. The strange thing is I was able to use the USB ports last week, and other than the windows update I have not downloaded, updated, or changed anything in a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB root hub (giving the code 52)&nbsp;under just the 'driver' tab lists the driver version as 6.3.9600.17292 with a date of 9/2/2014 and says the digital signer is Microsoft Windows. However under 'driver details'&nbsp; it lists the file as C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\USBHUB3.SYS,
 file version 6.3.9600.16384 (winblue_rtm.130821-1623), Provider: Microsoft corporation, and Digital Signer: Not digitally signed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing it is this 'not digitally signed' part that is messing everything up. I have tried right clicking and updating the driver software or uninstalling the driver and scanning for hardware changes, but it either says the driver is up to date or reinstalls
 still with the code 52.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, looks like they have an Android app too.&nbsp; Who knew?</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is also a Remote Desktop Store app which somehow I just managed to install on Surface RT.&nbsp; I wonder&nbsp;what I can do with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shall we try to figure it out?&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been intending on doing that for myself anyway but the TeamViewer app removed much of the incentive to do that.&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

            Hi Justin
<br />
<br />Hardware issues are normally driver related, which suggest it would really be HP's responsibility.
<br />
<br />That said. 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model? HP makes many models of the x360.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.

            Hello Justin,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please refer following suggestions:
<br />
<br />Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't helps, try to re-register Camera app:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows +X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin).
<br />
<br />2. Type/paste following and press Enter key:
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.WindowsCamera | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. Close Windows PowerShell and see if this resolves the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows + X, select Device Manager. 
<br />
<br />2. Under Imaging devices, right click on your camera device and select Uninstall. Click OK. 
<br />
<br />3. Then click Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Device Manager and reboot.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Switching the xbox to a Sony TV solves issue ... HOWEVER ... sound doesn't cut out if I hook up my PS4 to the same Panasonic TV.</p>
<p>Has anyone narrowed down the TV models that have this compatibility problem?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Beefy BundtCake,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It looks like you've done a good bit of troubleshooting yourself on this issue, and have even sent the Xbox in for repair.As such I would have to agree that it's a compatibility problem with the television. Do you have an audio receiver that you can test
 with? If so please test with that and let us know your replies. There is not a list that I have ever seen with compatible TVs. If it works with other TVs or Amplifiers with the same cabling then it's 100% something with the TV. I would contact your TV manufacturer
 and see if there is any kind of firmware update or software patch that they can provide you. Also if you have an audio receiver I would see about using that for your sound rather than the TV itself.</p>

<p>Add to the troubleshooting steps tried:</p>
<p>- Updated firmware for my Panasonic TH-58PZ700U to latest version</p>
<p>No less than 10 mins of watching TV, sound cut out.</p>
<p>Sound does not cut out for any other device connected to it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>XBOX One QA group likely did not test on this TV.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Beefy BundtCake</span><strong><span>,&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>If the issue is still persisting after you updated the firmware on your television I would contact the TV manufacturer to see if there are any other things you can try. As this is working with other devices in your home with no issues, then as you said it's
 the television and not the Xbox. Alternatively if you have an audio receiver in the house I would suggest going through that for your audio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I agree with you that the common denominator is the TV but disagree &nbsp;that the issue does not reside on XBOX. If my Sony Playstation 4 works on the same, TV one would deduce that Microsoft could configure the Xbox ONE in the same manner.
</p>
<p>If the problem has to do with the sound controller chip on the Xbox, obviously it cannot be fixed but if it is a software configuration issue, Microsoft should at least attempt to fix it.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Beefy BundtCake,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Check the following. Go to your settings, then display and sound. Make sure you have stereo uncompressed for both your audio settings. If the audio is still not working you can<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> contact Xbox Support here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                    I downloaded my pictures from my digital camera and they are saved in a file on my computer. Whenever I try to open any of the photos in this file, a message appears: "Image is too large (too many bytes)". I changed a setting before saving the pictures
 and evidently they all saved with a dimension of 4288 X 3216. Does <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>====================================<br />
I'm guessing you are running Windows XP?</p>
<p>Do you know which app is opening the files?</p>
<p>4288 X 3216 is a typical size for a 14 mega<br />
pixel camera (Kodak for example) and the <br />
photos should open in Windows Picture and <br />
Fax Viewer.</p>
<p>Have you tried opening the photos in Windows <br />
Paint or any other imsge editing software?</p>
<p>You could resize the photos smaller but that <br />
would defeat the purpose of having a high <br />
resolution camera wouldn't it?</p>
<p>If you wish to resize see the following info:</p>
<p>The following free XP PowerToy can resize<br />
the photos and greatly reduce the file size.<br />
<br />
Go to the following link and download and<br />
install:&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageResizer.exe<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx</a><br />
(will not run on Vista)<br />
<br />
Then you can open any folder that contains<br />
images and you will have an option to resize.<br />
Just right click the selected image files and<br />
choose Resize Pictures from the menu. You<br />
can select one image or a whole group.<br />
<br />
The program will place the resized copies in<br />
the folder with your originals.<br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)<br />
<br />
To insure that images in both portrait and<br />
landscape orientation are resized to the<br />
same dimensions...go to...Advanced...<br />
and enter the largest number in both fields.<br />
IOW...for 600x800...enter 800 in both fields.<br />
<br />
(Tip: even if you resize the Photos to the same<br />
(original) dimensions...the file size will be greatly<br />
reduced.)</p>

            <strong>THANK YOU, Volunteer J!!!</strong> Your answer has solved my problem! I was trying to open the photos with Windows XP "Photo Editor" &amp; also my Kodak Easy Share Software program,&nbsp;but they would not open. I tried using "Paint" and it opened the file,
 but only showed a very small portion of the picture. The picture was so large, you could only&nbsp;see a small portion of the entire photograph.<strong>Then I tried Windows Picture &amp; Fax Viewer and there they were! All my pictures,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">none
 of them lost</span>!</strong> I also got them to<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">open</span> and
<strong>THANK YOU, Volunteer J, you are my hero! :0)&nbsp; :0)</strong>

<h2>            Tron Greats Game Ever&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I just want to say that i thought Tron was going to be a waist of money, Since my girlfriends son wanted it anyway I broke down and bought it, I played it to try it out and noticed the game was pretty good after all, When i got on multiplayer I couldnt believe
 how fun it was. I have to say that if you like Tron or your a fan of the movie this game is perfect and worth the money. If you have comments on Tron please post them I would love to see what others think about the game.</p>
