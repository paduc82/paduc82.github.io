</div>
<div>My name is Jose Manuel , I recently got subscribed to one of your credit plans in order to be able to talk with my Venezuelan Family and I was very happy using part of the 300 min you give me for free for the first month, but then you blocked me out cause
 I was using those credits “suspiciously”, What, at least for me make no sense at all, is not that what I got subscribed for??, to use my credit.</div>
<div>Anyway, I don’t know if you are up to date with the Venezuelan situation at this moment, but the country is going thru the 6° day in a row with not electricity/internet and skype has become one of the principal ways of communication for the Venezuelan
 people who’s in the country with the ones that are out the country like me.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I need to get my account back ASAP, I already answered the credit card questions you Ask me in your web site but I haven’t heard anything from you.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please unblock my account as soon as you can so I can communicate with my family again please.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Mouse&#47;Input Delay in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redknave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse&#47;Input Delay in Windows 7</h2>
                    After extensive testing with benchmarking, and using the exact same hardware with the exact same drivers I have reached the following conclusion.<br />
<br />
Any input within the system in Windows 7, takes 30-32 ms more to be processed.<br />
<br />
My system is an i7 975, with 12gb 1600 mhz DDR3 RAM, A raid 0 configuration of 2 velociraptor 10,000 rpms and an HD 5970 graphics card. Which is basically an apex of performance as of december 2009.<br />
<br />
Why does windows 7 have this slightly noticeable lag? Would reinstalling help?<br />
<br />
Could it be due to any of the above hardwares?<br />
<br />
Any answers would be appreciated.

<p><span><span>Hi</span><span>
<span>Redknave,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As per your description the computer hardware is not at all an issue for the lag. This might be happening due to some of the background application.
 You may check that by putting the computer in clean boot and figure out if any of the background application is causing the lag.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is
 unavailable.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services,
 you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop check if the issue persists, follow the steps given in the article and figure out which of the program is causing the
 issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A clean install is always a good option if you have any doubts about the Operating System. Check if there is any lag in the input before you install
 any third party application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

    <title>Copy &#38; Paste not working- Windows 8.1 Surface Pro3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherriemiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy &#38; Paste not working- Windows 8.1 Surface Pro3</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Surface Pro 3 for work. &nbsp;It has Windows 8.1 and all of the updates were run 3 days ago. &nbsp;I have been using this less than a week at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2010 installed. &nbsp;My copy function is not working within Outlook (it may not be working other places too, but given the hiccups I've had this week with this machine I've had very little time to operate within all my programs to see if the problem
 is replicating itself elsewhere). &nbsp;The only way to copy anything from an email is for me to forward the email and then I am able to copy as usual. &nbsp;When I have any email I have received open and I mouse over the original text the sender wrote, one of two things
 happens: 1) The mouse disappears entirely. &nbsp;It doesn't reappear until I mouse up to above the subject line or 2) I get a hand icon and it grabs the screen to scroll up or down (this has only happened today, never before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get regular functionality of the copy feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other notes that may be helpful- my SP3 is in a docking station running dual monitors. &nbsp;The above happens when the machine is docked and when the machine is running on its own, undocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why is KB2825635 Being Offered For Office 2007&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2007 installed, and yesterday, Windows Update alerted me to several security updates for Windows 7 - including updates for Office 2007, and one for Office 2010 (KB2825635). I don't have Office 2010 installed, nor do I recall installing a compatibility
 pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB2825635 was also offered for Office 2007 on XP as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know the answer for this?</p>

<h2>            Standard TCP&#47;IP option was cleaned off during printer spooler fix. Now it does not give me that as an option when adding new printer.</h2>
                    I was attempting to get a problem with my print spooler working and used the tool from Microsoft to fix. It correct the spooler issue but now the Standard TCP/IP option does not appear under the create new port when trying to add a printer. Any ideas?&nbsp;

            Since the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Navigate to the c:\windows\system32 folder and make sure these files exist:<br />
<br />
tcpmib.dll<br />
tcpmon.dll<br />
tcpmon.ini<br />
tcpmonui.dll<br />
<br />
If any of those files are missing from the system32 folder, we need to know which one(s) are missing to help you replace them.<br />
<br />
Next, fix the registry that the unspecified Microsoft Fixit probably wiped out.<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry, back up the registry with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Open notepad to create a new text file:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
notepad<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a new notepad file.<br />
<br />
Copy and paste the following lines of bold text into the new notepad file (watch out for line wraps):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Save the new text file with a .reg extension to your desktop or someplace you can remember with a name you can remember, something like:
<br />
<br />
<br />
After saving the file, close notepad.<br />
<br />
Locate the <span style="font-weight: bold">tcpfix.reg</span> file on your desktop and double click it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can right click the <span style="font-weight: bold">tcpfix.reg</span> file, choose Open With... and select the Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative to the question... Are you sure you want to add the information to the registry?<br />
<br />
You should then see a message that the information was successfully entered into the registry.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and test.<br />
<br />
You can remove the <span style="font-weight: bold">tcpfix.reg</span> file when you are done.<br />
<br />
If the Registry Editor has also been disabled, we will have to fix that first (not a problem).<br />

            It generally takes 15 minutes to reflect the credit. If this time limit is passed - 
<br />
<br />You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to get the credit reflected in your account
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options in chat support allow you to chat with a live agent. When you click on above link, choose following to reach out to a live agent as per your problem category.
<br />
<br />Choose a help topic - Payment &amp; Orders
<br />Choose a related problem - Any option is OK
<br />
<br />Next

<h2>            Can&#39;t find SD Card Reader in Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>I think the system updated recently, a pretty big update since it took some time and had to restart one or two times. Anyway, I haven't used the build-in SD card reader for maybe one month. I tried today and it had no reaction, so I looked up some forums.
 It seems that in my Device Manager there's not even a SC card reader device available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: Solved the problem.</p>
<p>I went into the system Services and manually started the Smart Card and Smart Card Device Enumeration services. Voila~</p>

            <p><span>Hi Charan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are unable to make your laptop sleep completely also unable to access NVidia display settings. We will help
 you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know with the model of NVIDIA graphic card you are using.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would have you boot the computer in safe mode and then try shutting down the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Check if the NVIDIA graphics card is detected in
 device manager. If it is detected, update it's drivers and check if that helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the Start button from the desktop and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the list of <strong>
Hardware</strong> categories, double-click the category your device is in and then double-tap the device you want. For example, to see your video card, click Display adapters, and then double-click the video card name.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click the <strong>
Driver</strong> tab, click <strong>Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions. You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If that does not fix the issue, please reinstall
 the display adapter drivers.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the Start button from the desktop and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Locate and expand
<strong>Display adapter</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right-click on the
<strong>Display adapter</strong> that is listed and click “<strong>Uninstall</strong>”.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and download, install the latest drivers from the NVIDIA website.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nvidia.com/D<span>ownload/index.aspx</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with updated status of the issue to assist you further.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer/scanner<br />
and their supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation <br />
and&nbsp; drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Try the HP Print and Scan Doctor for Windows (10, 8/8.1, 7, Vista, and XP)<br />

<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

It made no differences. Is there a way to reinstall MRT.exe tool? <br />
<br />
As for W8.1 upgrade, yes.&nbsp; See my latest post in that forum thread. ;)<br />

I downloaded and ran it, but it gave me the same error after its extraction. mrt.log showed:<br />

I used Norton 360 to block it since I didn't want it to send reports home. Here's what is weirder. It still shows me the failed submitted MAPS reports even with firewall off.<br />

1a. About a year ago.<br />

2. v6 with all LiveUpdates. Don't know the exact version.<br />
3. No since I installed N360 myself.<br />
4. It did have Symantec EndPoint, but I dumped it for N360.<br />
5. I will have to check later since I am not at work.<br />
6. No Java since I uninstalled it months ago and never have the use for it.<br />
7. I did upgrade to the latest Flash (ActiveX and plugin) on Tuesday morning. No problems that I saw.<br />
8a. IE8.<br />
8b. Yes, Mozilla's SeaMonkey v2.23.<br />
9. Only the latest CCleaner version, but I did not use it recently (think last month I used it whenever it came out with the latest version).<br />
<br />
Just remember that MRT.exe problem started on Tuesday. I did not have this problem last month's release (December 10th, 2013). I only run MRT.exe manually when there are updated versions.
<br />
<br />
I also forgot to mention I did uninstall Adobe's annoying Reader v10 on Tuesday as well. I don't see how that can affect MRT.exe though. Maybe I should reboot even though I never got prompted.<br />

IT doesn't care about mrt.exe. :( Oh well. I will ignore this issue then since I rarely use it.<br />

    <title>100&#37; disk usage. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>    say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; disk usage.</h2>
                    <p>On all my PCs with Windows10 installed (mostly home PC, two home notebooks, a work PC and a work notebook) there's a problem with 100% disk usage on start. High disk usage lasts for quite some time (for example, this screenshot was taken almost 2 hours after
 the notebook was started) and makes the use of the PC almost impossible. All PCs have several common points:<br />
</p>
<p>1. All of them had Windows 7 preinstalled by the manufacturer and have gone through W7-&gt;W8-&gt;W8.1-&gt;W10 upgrade path.</p>
<p>2. All of them also have some Linux distros installed on, as my main job is cross-platform app development with Qt.</p>
<p>3. The 100% disk usage problem isn't reproduced under Linux, so the hardware is Ok.</p>
<p>4. All these PCs have Windows installed on HDDs or SHDDs. Moving the OS onto an SSD solves the problem. Unfortunately, SSDs are too expensive to be used as a single drive in notebooks for me, so I managed to fix only my desktop PC and my mother's PC this
 way.</p>
<p>5. As it can be seen on the screenshot, actual read and write speed is quite low, so "find and disable the app that's using the disk" is not a valid solution. It looks much more like the Windows95 bug, when the disk controller was abandoning DMA mode and
 switching into PIO mode.</p>
<p>6. I've tried every method recommended on forums (this forum, windowstenforums etc.) with no success. I've even tried some methods not mentioned on forums (for example, I have swap completely disabled on my 16Gb RAM i7 laptop and similar work desktop. I
 also have an 32Gb fast USB3.0 flash drive assigned as a ReadyBoost drive.) No success.<br />
</p>
<p>I think I made a request to the Microsoft support team about this issue once and was told that this may be an issue with the hardware manufacturer (Lenovo). But now I know that this is not a Lenovo issue because 1) it's reproduced on other PCs, and 2) It's
 not reproduced on same PCs under Linux. So I tried to open a support ticket again recently, only to find that no free support is provided for Windows10, and the only way to find a solution is to ask on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For quite a long time I was booting Windows only to install updates, check if these updates solve the problem and return back to Linux, so the issue didn't bother me much. But now I have an app to develop expicitly for Windows (customer's requirement). And
 it breaks my heart to turn on the laptop at 21:00 and finally be able to do something useful on it at 23:00.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />The reason for the issue could related to malware, 3rd apps, profile corruption etc.
<br />
<br />Follow the steps below to check all scenarios:
<br />
<br />1) Check system drive using this guide -&gt; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Be sure that OS and all drivers up to date
<br />
<br />3) Check the issue in Clean boot mode -&gt; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />Follow the steps from the articles:

<br />P.S. in 1803 build some issues with CPU usage were reported and if all step didn't help we should wait for a new updates and see how this will work.

<div>Alas, it doesn't. My notebook's ATAPI controller is not a Standard SATA AHCI Controller (storahci.sys), but Intel(R) 8 Series Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller (iaStorA.sys). There is a "MSISupported" DWORD in the corresponding registry branch set to
 0, though I don't remember if it was there from the start or was it created by me during one of previous attempts to fix the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Disabling Superfetch doesn't help either. In fact it was most probably the first measure I thought of.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />How I mentioned before, this was reported before that CPU issue is a current bug.
<br />
<br />For this use the Feedback Hub - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402156...</a> and report about the issue.
<br />
<br />I hope developer will fix this

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The info found at the link below shows how to use the MS Process Monitor utility to identify the culprit(s) that are causing the problem (disk thrashing).</p>

<p>Thanks, I've installed Process Monitor and conducted the test. The results are not very interesting, though. All the apps from the top of the list were installed much later than the problem did occur originally, so they can not be the cause of the problem.
 Besides, some of them (the browser, for example) are being loaded by Windows for some reason unknown to me. I've disabled them in the autostart but noticed no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, as can be seen on the screensot, the actual load is quite small, modern HDDs (and I have a Seagate SHDD) are capable of loads two orders of magnitude higher. Companies do not design software for CGA monitors anymore, why do they have to limit the
 use of hard drive to magnitudes reasonable in Windows95 ages?</p>

            I've achieved some improvement by installing a RAM Drive software and dedicating this RAM drive to ReadyBoost also. The 100% disk load persists for less than a hour now (perhaps even half an hour) and mean reply time is usually lower than a second. But
 the problem is still very far from being solved.

 modified Contributing Artists column changed in File Explorer...however, now I have one track that keeps the VARIOUS ARTISTS original tag name and can't seem to change that last remaining track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, renaming in Media Player from VA to Artists' name, creates a folder for that newly added Contributing Artist in the Files Explorer &gt; Music folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has been nothing but headaches...any way to simplify the renaming of music files?</p>

<p>I just noticed that if the file is in currently playing (or in "Now playing" list) updating the meta data for the file is not possible. Close WMP and re-open it directly (wmplayer.exe)
 and see if you change the tag in the Library view. Alternately, you may try a 3rd party utility like MP3Tag.</p>

<p>Hi Asher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to games not being compatible with Windows 10. I would suggest you to install these games in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</a></strong> (information holds good for
 Windows 10 as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
        </p>

            <p>None of this was helpful. You sent me to Windows 8.1 help not Windows 10. I had Microsoft Windows 7 chess game that came with windows 7. Now after update Windows 10 doesn't see any files in the folders labeled chess or in saved games.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you give another stock answer that is wrong and sends me down a dead end I will start to feel unappreciated and suckered by Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my third try to get back the Microsoft games I have had for years. Did you see I said Microsoft?</p>

<p>Your answer did not address the question which I had also.&nbsp; Windows 7 comes with several games (solitaire, chess, hearts, etc) There are not added programs;&nbsp; they came with Windows 7.&nbsp; After upgrading to Windows 10, these games seem to have disappeared.&nbsp;
 What happened to them?&nbsp; </p>

            <p>this answer is totally wrong and does not work at all with windows 10, even the games I purchased like jewel disappeared and will not reload,</p>
<p>AS DID, many other programs I bought as such as National Geographic TOPO maps </p>
<p>and that will not reload as my StudioHD from Pinnacle and will not reload</p>
<p>And my Realtek preamp program, and gives error message this program will not function
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have been told that these programs will be deleted and would not function after windows download.</p>

<p>Thank you for explaining what happened to the games and media center &nbsp;in Windows 7.&nbsp; One would have hoped Microsoft would have warned customers before the installation.</p>
<p>According to something I saw from Microsoft, &nbsp;it is possible to remove Windows 10 and revert back to Windows 7.&nbsp; Do you know if the games and media center will come&nbsp; back if I do this?</p>

            <p>The machines I have upgraded and installed on (including business systems) have all gone fairly smoothly; even with a hiccup on getting it through the more 'automated process' in one case, the more manual process via the downloaded tool worked fine (less
 than an hour upgrade time on an older Lenovo laptop.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As for the upgrade - I have said long before the release date that MOST people should wait a while - let things improve and let the people who can/want to jump in head first and see what all needs closer looks.&nbsp; Expecting a roll-out to a billion+ different
 possible configurations to go smoothly would be foolish.</p>

            I downloaded Win 10 and lost my games as well.&nbsp; Microsoft offers a rollback to Win 7 for 30 days after installation of Win 10.&nbsp; I rolled back and all my files and games are there.&nbsp; The rollback feature for Win 10 is located in the settings tile.

<p>Thanks. &nbsp;I still find it outrageous that it costs so much to upgrade from Professional to Ultimate, especially compared to the cost to upgrade from Home Premium. &nbsp;I do not understand the logic for that, and I am unhappy that it will cost me $170.00, especially
 since all I want is the ability to mount an NFS server. &nbsp;I shouldn't have to pay for all that other stuff. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so unhappy that I have registered complaints with both the Better Business Bureau and the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services.</p>

<h2>            Unable to create restore point. Shadow copy times out after 9 minutes.</h2>
                    I am unable to create a restore point. After @ 9 minutes i receive the error message: Unable to create restore point, shadow copy has timed out. I have tried these fixes so far with no luck. I ran sfc and it found no corrupt or missing files. I have turned
 system restore on and off to purge old restore points. I have enabled shadow copy to run automatically. I have turned off all security software, malware software and firewalls. I tried to run system restore in safe mode and it was not an option. I am unable
 to install windows updates that require a restore point. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi <strong>Rjax360</strong>,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp; Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp; Did you make any changes to the computer before this issue started?<br />
3. Do you have any other backup programs like norton ghost or any other thirdparty&nbsp;backup programs?</p>
<p>If yes then uninstall those third&nbsp;party backup program and check for the issue.<br />
<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Scenario 1:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Verify if these two services are running:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volume Shadow Copy service <br />
&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows backup<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Also ensure that their dependency services are running. You can check this information from services.msc. Follow the steps below to check the services.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;a. Go to start and type services.msc in the search field.<br />
&nbsp;b. Locate the two services. <br />
&nbsp;c. Right-Click on the service one at a time. <br />
&nbsp;d. Select properties. <br />
&nbsp;e. Go to Dependencies Tab. <br />
&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note the dependency services. <br />
&nbsp;g. Make sure they’re also running. <br />
&nbsp;h. To start a service, right click on it and select start.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can also use the Event Viewer to look for information about the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here's an article on how to do that:<br />
