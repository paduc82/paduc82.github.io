<h2>            Can Windows XP still be used&#63; I know it does not upgrade anymore. But I have a Lexmark inkjet printer that just runs on Windows XP that I installed on an older laptop&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have an older printer Lexmark All in One X75, inkjet, which seems that works only on Windows XP. I have Windows XP on an older laptop with licence, but it is not upgraded anymore. But I need to use this printer, which has not anymore a driver. The old
 driver on CD doesn,t work!</p>
<p>Only the scanner works, but not the printer. It is possible to adapte the Universal driver for Lexmark printers for Windows XP? This is my question!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for those which will answer to me! Speranta Maria</p>

<p>You might find a driver by simply searching the web (Google, Bing, etc,)&nbsp;for </p>
<p>driver for HP 2575 (as an example) Actually driver for Lexmark (model)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a driver for a 10 year old printer in this way. There is some degree of risk in downloading a driver like this from a site other than the manufacturers. It's hard to say how much risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find the driver and this combination of XP and printer/scanner works, use it. You should not connect a computer running XP to the Internet. It's been too long since there was a security update.</p>

<p>Thank you for this answer.There is a driver named Universal driver for Lexmark printers but doesn't work for my printer which is an inkjet Lexmark All in One X75, with scanner. Also I have an other problem on my laptop with Windows XP. I have a wireless
 connection on it for internet , the PC tolds me that the connection is good, how many mb has, but the windows doesn' t let it to open the i ternet! Nobody hdre in our country could explain me which is the cause and how could be solved. If I try to install
 the driver I should to have the internet opened also but something doesn't let me make it! Whaw!!</p>

<h2>            Connect to a network projector aka netproj.exe &#58;&#58; Need help to connect a projector</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I'm going to need your help on this one.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of buying a projector for a meeting room.</p>
<p>The aim is to use the Windows 7 "connect to a network projector" application, so we don't need to install the projector software and give the admin credentials to everyone who wants to use the projector. (Due to security policies)</p>
<p>Currently we have a SONY projector, model VPL-EX275 with a wireless module and we use the SONY software.</p>
<p>Our company's security policies are tight, and it's not practical to insert the admin credentials every time users want to use the projector.</p>
<p>I've already tried to connect the projector via RJ45 to our network, and succeeded, but I can only access the basic config for the projector (eg. input type, power on/off, volume...)</p>
<p>However, when I try to connect via netproj.exe the dialog box tells me that the projector cannot interpret. I guess that this is a polite way to say that the projector is not compatible with "connect to a network projector" built in application in Windows
 7.</p>
<p>If that's the case, can someone share the experiences <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">with compatible models with this application</span></strong>, or give me some
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">projector models compatible with this app</span></strong>.</p>
<p>If not, tell me please what <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">procedures did you make</span></strong>, to make the projector work with netproj.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ivo.</p>

<h2>            Surface book 2 doesn&#39;t have clipboard, not even in system settings.</h2>
                    Just bought the new surface book 2 and was using the snipping tool and it said it saved it to the clipboard but i can't find any clipboard at all. It's not in settings, it's nowhere. Why is this when according to other people using windows 10, they all
 have clipboard but the surface book 2 doesn't. Where is it or can't i ever have it. Please help. This is frustrating.

<p>The clipboard is essentially a one-item "holding area" used to transfer data between programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF something is saved or copied to the Clipboard, it's available to be pasted (Ctrl+V) into another application. So with an image captured by Snipping Tool, you could open Paint or any other image editing program, and paste the image there to save or edit.
 You can also save to a file from Snipping Tool.</p>

<h3> dansw  say:</h3>
<h2>            After update for Windows 7 the keyboard and mouse no longer work. Can anyone provide a solution because my computer is completely unusable</h2>
                    Windows 7 64bit SP1 was already installed previously and working fine.&nbsp; The mouse and keyboard stopped working after a windows update and I cannot log in to the OS.<br />
This computer was built by me over a year ago with a fresh install of Win 7, not an upgrade from a previous version.<br />
<br />
Keyboard works for BIOS but not in windows.&nbsp; Tried 2 different keyboards and 3 different mice, none of them worked.&nbsp; Booted into safe mode and keyboard and mouse did not work either.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the windows update was that caused the problem and I have no way of checking without being able to log in.&nbsp; It was not the SP1 update as it was working fine with that applied.<br />
<br />
Please help, this is extremely frustrating.<br />

<p>[/quote]If it is Reign of Thunder that i saw that's ok,because Microsoft worked with them on Mechassault,and the Mechassault series payed off for Day 1 Studios,so it wouldn't be hard to believe that Reign of Thunder would come to the 360 or 720.My case for
 getting the new game is weak,but cross your fingers,it could easily happen.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and X1</h2>
                    
<p>So it looks like July 29 /15 is release time for Windows 10. They talked about streaming from the X1 to your PC for gaming, my question is will we be able to stream from a PC to the X1, more for TV / movies? Will this be the release of the wireless device
 app currently in the preview program?</p>

<p>The Xbox app in Windows 10 doesn't have that functionality yet. (As of build 10130)</p>
<p>And it was never confirmed that reverse streaming (PC to Xbox) would be doable.</p>
<p>Only that "They were looking into it".</p>

<p>Yeah lets get rid of the OS that took 2 yrs from release to get working and replace it with one that isn't working.</p>
<p>Clock starts on July 29 for the free upgrade year and if you wait for it to get out of beta you'll have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Many people won't care because they want their desktops/laptops to look and function like giant phones but you will care when a version of Win 10 shows up on your console and your games don't work or the performance decreases. Think that can't/won't happen....ask
 a PC gamer about Win 8 and the current state of 10.</p>

            Hi KERVEL FAMILY,
<br />
<br />gpedit.msc is only available in the Pro and Enterprise Editions of Windows 10
<br />
<br />if you are running Windows 10 Home, you will not have access to gpedit.msc and it cannot be installed into Windows 10 Home
<br />
<br />Anything you need to do with gpedit.msc can normally also be achieved with an edit to your registry

<h2>            PLEASE HELP&#33; Game not working</h2>
                    Just bought A DVD/CD Rom and Marvel Ultimate Alliance for PC. I own an AlienWare PC laptop and am trying to play the game. i started by opening the drive for the game and the clicked setup. it seemed to be working fine and installing (took a while) and
 then i got to the menu screen. i pressed play and it crashed on me and sent me to my desktop. the first attempt i made, it gave me an administrator error (which i fixed i think) and then i click on the game and it says do you want to allow the publisher to
 make changes on your PC (get that msg every time i install a game) but this time nothing happens when i press yes. PLEASE HELP ME THE BEST YOU CAN. (i am very bad with technology and i am a little agitated as i spent almost a hundred bucks on all this...)

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I suggest you to update the display drivers on your computer and check if it helps. Refer the below steps to update the driver.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press ‚ÄúWindows + X‚Äù and select Device manager.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Display Adapter and expand the driver icon.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right click on the driver icon and click on Update.<br />
4.&nbsp;Follow the onscreen instructions to update the driver.<br />
5.&nbsp;Restart the computer and check if the issue is resolved. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install the latest drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>I would also suggest you to install the Game in Compatibility mode and check if it helps.<br />
Install the Game in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Find the Game installer file location.<br />
2.&nbsp;Right-click on the setup.exe file and click on ‚Äòproperties‚Äô.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on the ‚Äòcompatibility‚Äô tab and check the box ‚ÄòRun this program in compatibility mode for‚Äô and select operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.<br />
4.&nbsp;Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference: Below are the list of games which are compatible with the Windows 10.<br />

            <p>Hey, thank you for taking your time to help me, Under the display adapter, it expanded to Intel(R) HD Graphics 530 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M. I right clicked both and clicked update driver softwares and restarted. Did I miss a step or anything on that?
 And what would I do and click after I restart the pc? And for the second</p>

<h2>            Visual Studio 2015 Community on Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    I have installed Windows 10 Pro (build 10240) and thereafter installed Visual Studio 2015 Community. After the installation of VS 2015 the system has become very slow and occasionally even fails to boot and display the log on screen. In case it boots,
 VS2015 does not start and continues to show the message "We're getting things ready. Thanks for your patience."

    <title>Changing language on Windows RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilona50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing language on Windows RT</h2>
                    i bought a XPS 10 with Windows RT and I'm trying to change it to German. I went to 'add language', added german, clicked on options, downloaded the language pack, moved german to be the first language and restarted. The Start Screen is all german, but
 the 'older screens' like the desktop and file explorer, administrative tools and so on are still in english. I had played around with this language stuff before and had it ALL in german, but after completely reinstalling Windows RT, i now can only get the
 start screen in german. what setting am i missing?

            Hi Gadi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to another PC to create bootable installation media to Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You cannot install drivers unless you can get into Windows or Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />So your best bet to save time is to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you want to try to repair Windows I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn‚Äôt fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn‚Äôt work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.

<h2>            programdata&#47;microsoft&#47;ehome, folder is corrupted</h2>
                    Hi, I hope you can help me with my problem.<br />
I have Windows 7 64 bit and I use Windows Media Center to watch TV. All has been fine for a couple of years, but recently when starting Windows Media Center and selecting Live TV the picture and audio was broken up as if I had signal problems. I checked the
 aerial with a TV set and had no problem with aerial. So as my TV tuner card was pretty old I decided to replace it, but the problem persisted. Next I cleared the c:/programdata/microsoft/ehome folder deleting windows media center data and performed a channel
 scan media center found all channels and all was fine, until the next time I booted my PC and started live TV and the picture and audio were broken up again, so I performed the above again, but this time I saved a copy of the ehome folder when everything was
 working properly, Now every time I boot and start Media Center/Live TV the picture and audio are broken up, but after a reboot and copying and pasting my backup ehome folder all is fine again.<br />
<br />
What cold be causing the folder or files in it to get corrupted each time I shut down or boot my PC.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
Ron laming<br />

            <span>Hi Ron,</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message/code?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue can occur due to bad drivers and system file corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to update the TV tuner card drivers from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Run sfc /scannow to repair broken media center and check.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or
 on Windows 7<br />

    <title>Please help&#58; my printer has gone crazy. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joyfulop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please help&#58; my printer has gone crazy.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 and a Dell 1110 printer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly a few weeks ago my printer stopped printing, with an error: Spooler has stopped working.&nbsp; I was in the middle of printing a few documents when it just stopped taking jobs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I restarted the spooler but no success.&nbsp; After trying a few things, I finally did a system restore, which worked! However,&nbsp;it stopped again after about a week.&nbsp; I tried rolling back again but this did not work.&nbsp; Now, I get a different message when I try
 to print: You must install a printer.&nbsp; I found my Dell drivers and utilities disk and installed my printer but no success; I still get the same message box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.&nbsp; Also I'm not very tech saavy; so if you're going to help, please give me step-by-step instructions.&nbsp; Tyvm.</p>

            <p>Hey joyfulOP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, this might help, I hope:) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your printer is really, really&nbsp;old, you won't find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is a network printer, make sure to choose the right one. And then it is not necesarry to do the following, as long as the computer recognises it. if it doesn't, you can't do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First go to control panel &gt; hardware and sound &gt; add a printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a there will come a pop up. Choose the kind of printer you have. Folloe the steps. Usually you just have to click next. Then choose your manufacturer. Choose the series. Now you can click next. It will now search for your driver on the internet and
 install. When it's finished, restart the computer, to be sure that ALL programmes that can use&nbsp;printers is restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your printer is really old, you wont find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helped. If not I will try to write a new post :)</p>

 tasks such as page setup or printing a document, you need to install a printer.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already tried reinstalling from the my drivers &amp; utilities CD.&nbsp; Also when I open Devices and Printers, there is the yellow "!" indicating a problem.&nbsp; When I right click and troubleshoot, it can't identify the problem.&nbsp;

    <title>Sharing system sounds stops after around 30 seconds. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> z o r l i g  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing system sounds stops after around 30 seconds.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
When sharing system sounds, it causes problems for the other person on the line.<br />
It works fine at first but after around 30 seconds the other person can hear their own voice (Sounds like talking into a fan).<br />
Then the system sound sharing is still on but the other person can't hear it anymore (Still can hear my voice).<br />
We've tried restarting, recalling, reinstalling, changing Skype and system settings, and of course Googling for answers.<br />
There's nothing wrong with our system sounds in general either.</p>
<p>It started happening around two weeks ago. It doesn't happen every time when sharing sounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank You.<br />
<br />

<p>That means there's significant corruption of your system files - perhaps even the files that are used to run SFC.</p>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let
 it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If
 that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning System File Checker (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer ‚Äì or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Look in the&nbsp;System section.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Lets
 do a diagnostic test ot two on your hard drive to check for problems: <span>
To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available ‚Äì it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If
 none of the above work or identify the problem, <span>
we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:

<p><span><span><span><span><span>I
 hope this helps.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good
 luck!</span></span></span></span></span></p>
