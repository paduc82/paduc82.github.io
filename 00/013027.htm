<p>Just make a simple email system.&nbsp; This would take a Purdue engineer to follow all of this stuff. I am going to G Mail.&nbsp; What a mess my hotmail has become this past year, and I have used it for over 20 years! Duplicate drafts, duplicate sends, etc. etc.&nbsp;
 Hire some people who are not in the computer ivory tower maybe. Good luck and thanks.</p>

<p>I was having this same problem except I only use the same online Hotmail website that I have use for the past 20 years. The problem first appeared Saturday 9/9/17. I found this thread only by quoting word for word the error message I was getting. I have
 not been able to send emails from Hotmail for the past several days without these multiple sends, anywhere from 8 to 13 duplicate sends each time I clicked Send.</p>
<p>This eight step solution seems to have cleared the problem. Thank you. In all my years using Hotmail I have not seen anything this annoying, both for me and for the recipients of my emails.</p>

<p>Oops, looks like I spoke too soon. The problem has returned, this time with 8 duplicates of a test email I sent to myself. I won't feel comfortable using Hotmail until I get this problem resolved.</p>
<p>I sent that test message from Microsoft Edge through the standard Hotmail website.</p>
<p>After that I closed Edge and opened Firefox and sent a test message with no problem, no duplicates.</p>
<p>Then I returned to Edge and sent myself two more test messages with no error messages and no duplicates.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any advice anyone can give me.</p>

<p>Thank you Desiree for your reply.</p>
<p>I think I need to answer your second question first. I do not use what has for years been called Outlook to access my Hotmail. I never have. However, ever since Microsoft renamed Hotmail "Outlook" that leads to some confusion with regards to your question.
 Hopefully I can answer your question this way. You gave me a link for me to use to determine which version of Outlook I use. Although I do use a PC and not a Mac and not an iPhone and not an Android app, I do use a "Web browser", which was one of the choices
 given me by the link that you supplied, so according to the information provided me when I selected "Web browser" in that link, "Outlook.com / Hotmail.com is the free, web-based email service from Microsoft. Because Outlook.com is a service that you access
 over the Internet, it is not installed on your computer, So, there's no version or 32-bit or 64-bit information for it."</p>
<p>That is how I access my Hotmail.</p>
<p>The Web browser that I use when I have this problem is Microsoft Edge. I find this information when I click on "Settings and more" in Edge and select "Settings" from the drop-down menu:</p>
<p>Microsoft Edge 40.15063.0.0</p>
<p>Microsoft EdgeHTML 15.15063</p>
<p>When I am at my Inbox in Hotmail using Edge, the web address is:</p>
<p>https://outlook.live.com/owa/</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your first question, recently Microsoft offered an upgrade to the Web version of Hotmail/Outlook or "Outlook.com / Hotmail.com" to use the lingo used in that link you sent me to. I opted to try the new version but was not pleased with it so
 I opted to return to the more familiar version. I can't say how long ago this happened but it was perhaps a few weeks ago. I tried the new version basically as soon as it was offered to me by Microsoft. I switched back to the original version immediately so
 it was perhaps weeks between the time I sampled the new version and reverted back to the original and the time I first noticed this problem with duplicates.</p>
<p>That change, as far as I know, is the only recent change I have made to my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>Again, I am using the original Web browser version of Outlook.com / Hotmail.com now and not the new and improved version which I did not like. Also to repeat myself, I have this problem on my PC which runs on Windows 10 Home version 1703 OS Build 15063.608
 (although the version and build may have been different before this week's Microsoft Update). I had this duplicates problem several days prior to this week's Microsoft Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One further piece of information:</p>
<p>Normally my Drafts folder is empty or within a few neglected drafts of being empty. At this moment, there are 2,721 items in my Drafts folder all but five of which are dated from 9/8/17 to today, 9/13/17.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one other piece of seemingly unrelated information that may or may not pertain to this issue. For the past perhaps year, maybe two, maybe more, whenever I compose an email in my Hotmail on this computer there is a significant delay between the time
 I make a keystroke and the time it appears on my screen. Right now, composing this reply here in this answers.microsoft.com window, I seem to be having the same phenomenon. It comes and goes but it is extremely annoying. Occasionally the time delay can be
 as much as a second or even longer. I never see this effect when I type anywhere else on the Web, only in my Hotmail (and right now here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today it dawned on me that I haven't yet tested whether I have this problem when I have only one tab open in my Microsoft Edge browser. Edge opens by default on my computer with two tabs so sometimes I have only one tab open and sometimes I have multiple
 tabs open when I am using Hotmail. I have seen some chatter about tabs during my Google searches for help regarding this problem so that's why I bring up this topic here. To be clear, though, I have never had my Hotmail open in more than one tab or in more
 than one browser window when I experience this duplicate emails problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am not experiencing dropouts with my Internet connection although the error message I receive from Hotmail whenever these duplicates are generated suggests otherwise. The error message, appearing shortly after I click Send, reads:</p>
<p><em>"Error: The message can't be sent because your device isn't connected to the Internet. Try again when you regain connectivity."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can give me.</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            Hello. It is not clear if you can activate anything through the touchscreen. There is an alignment feature Start&gt;Settings&gt;Screen&gt;Align Screen. If you can't get there you can try to remote control your device using MyMobiler:<br />
<a href="http://www.mymobiler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mymobiler.com/</a><br />
<br />
If you can't do any of these you will have to do a hard reset of your device back to factory conditions. You will lose any data/programs/contacts/calendar that you have not backed up.

<p>Can I make these templates available on-screen every time someone goes to open a new document in Word Online?</p>
<p>I do not want the templates associated with only one library. I want them available to anyone who is logged into my organization's 365 platform and who wants to open a new Word document.&nbsp;</p>

<div>2. Ditto for &nbsp;the question "Postcode".. is it " the postcode when the account was set up" or "where my current IP address is located"&nbsp;</div>

<div>I keep answering this "correctly" but use upper case and type in both words &nbsp;with a space..&nbsp;</div>
<div>I answered this about 10 years ago and cant remember the EXACT FORMAT of the answer I gave .. is there anyway I can reset the answer ?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No I would not say this is specific to router website, as other devices on my home network, such as tablets and phones, can connect via the 192.168.0.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I haven't made any recent changes to my laptop other than upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Google Chrome, which when I tried to connect, just ended up with blank screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried in 'inprivate' mode and got same message - HTTP/1.1 200 OK </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were removed from someone else's contact list what you'll see is that the contact has not shared they information. Also, you will not be able to see their current status if you are not part of their contacts.</p>

    <title>Deleted Notes in Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluffton bob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted Notes in Office 2010</h2>
                    <p>I read through the section on deleted Notes and looked to see if any of that info helped me.&nbsp; It did not.&nbsp; I had two identical notes, one categorized as medical and the other personal.&nbsp; I deleted the one categorized personal and both notes disappeared.&nbsp;
 I could not find them anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a "test" note and deleted it and was able to quickly and easily find it and if I wanted to, I could have moved it back to my notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to where I might be able to find and hopefully recover either one of the notes since they were duplicates in every way except for the different categories?</p>
<p>

I have an 8925 (Tilt, Kaiser, TyTNII) and have installed some other programs, however it seems that the menu (under programs) has been set with two sections. The first being the programs that came with the unit and then after it the folders and programs installed
 after.&nbsp; How do I get the menu to sort completely without regard to who installed what or when. Just want everything under there to be sorted similar to windows with folders first, then programs?&nbsp; Thank you.

<h2>            Change the defaut sounds in Skype</h2>
                    In the new Skype version 8.x, I cannot find anywhere to change the default sounds. I use Skype chat, video chat, and as my office telephone at work. I want the classic phone sounds. I detest the cutesy sounds Skype makes! In fact, there is very little
 I like about this version! In the old one (Skype 7), I could choose to see only my contacts, and they were sorted by name. Now, the only option is for everything to be sorted by "time", an utterly useless "feature" when I'm trying to find a specific person
 in my contact list! Even when I change that setting, it reverts back every time I go to another view, like the dialer for instance. Who at Microsoft actually thought an interface could be made "better" by removing features longtime users have become accustomed
 to? That's certainly not been the philosophy of Microsoft going back as long as I can remember (30+ years)!

<p>Ah well...I didn't wait for a reply.</p>
<p>Just got myself a 16GB SanDisk microSDHC Class 2. I know it'll be a bit slow, but I'll need the space.</p>
<p>I had been using a 2GB microSD (not SDHC) up till now, and had no major complaints. I think a minimum 2MB/s transfer rate will be sufficient, especially since the phone is not equipped to handle HD video recording or playback.</p>
<p>But I am interested in finding out if a 32GB card will work on the phone, because it falls under the same specifications as 16GB (in terms of SDHC standards), and if the phone is able to handle a FAT32 filesystem on a SDHC with 16GB of memory, I think there
 shouldn't be much trouble handling a 32GB card either.</p>

<p>32GB cards may work with 5230/5235/5800. those phones supports Micro SDHC cards. 32GB card also a SDHC card. so it may work. I have 5800 and 6303. specs said 6303 supports up to 4GB MicroSDHC cards. but now I'm using 8GB card with 6303, and 16GB card with
 my 5800XM</p>

<p>Considering that SanDisk released the first 32GB microSDHC card in March, 2010, a few months after the release of the 5230 or any of its parents (read 5800XM) or variants (read 5233/5235), I think its safe to say that the phone supports the capacity. It
 just wasn't available to include on the phone's marketing blurb at the time.</p>

<p>This is a reply to Nokia!! As well as this user. If Nokia were transparent, they would give a full technical spec on the phone box/package, or a readily available read yourself display, alongside the phone at the retailers. Instead,(Please don't ask the
 retailer muppets)&nbsp;you have to download or read a PDF online, and usually after you have foolishly purchased the phone. Now, of course Nokia cannot anticipate every eventuality, but hey, what good is a 32gig SDHC card to me,
<u>after&nbsp;I have purchased</u> the phone and not been made aware at the time of purchase, that the phone will only handle 16gig SDHC cards? Yes! That's right, no good at all. how do you find out? Well try copying normal MPEG files, then wma, then wav, then....
 Waste 2 days looking for info, on and off forum, need I go on?&nbsp; All the phone will tell you is there is a "Write error" little silly red sign icon, or unable to play.Corrupted etc, back to site, find "Buried info" how to access formatting in "File manager"
 etc. When really all said and done, none of this matters if only the sales description had said "Uses upto a maximum of 16 gig SDHC CARDS.&nbsp; Ta nokia.</p>

<p>I have a 5230-c with V20.2.098 software, running a <strong>16GB</strong> micro SD card (type 2).&nbsp; It's working fine - a bit slow but I went cheep.&nbsp; Would like to upgrade to a 32GB card.&nbsp; Maybe I'll just get one and try.:smileyhappy:</p>

            Hi&nbsp;LabibBasta,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I mentioned in my previous post If you are using Microsoft account to sign in to the computer and when you access any Microsoft websites such as outlook.com, msn.com even the Bing.com (search engine) it automatically uses the same credentials of signing
 in to the computer to any Microsoft website you visit. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This feature is by design which can not be disabled as Microsoft has made it integrated with Microsoft’s services&nbsp; such as login to Windows&nbsp;store&nbsp;automatically by one click and so as to the other live application on windows 8 and Windows 8.1.&nbsp;
<div>Although, logging in with Microsoft Account is not mandatory in Windows 8, but it does provides various features and&nbsp;beauty of Windows 8 for users.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can always use a local account to sign-in to your Windows 8 computer system – as you did in Windows 7 and the earlier versions of Windows. But, if you sign-in with your Microsoft account you can actually enjoy the impressive features of Windows 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Create a user account </strong></div>
<div>Refer to: Create a Local account.</div>

    <title>Google Calendar Events disappear when created approximately 6 months - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindseymlearns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Calendar Events disappear when created approximately 6 months in the future</h2>
                    <p>Repro Steps: </p>
<p>1. Connect a gmail account with manual calendar sync</p>
<p>2. Let it sync</p>
<p>3. Try to create a new calendar event more than 6 months in the future.</p>
<p>4. See as it shows in the list of events for that day (momentarily)</p>
<p>5. Wait up to 5 minutes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expected: The event should still be listed for that day</p>
<p>Actual: The event is no longer listed for that day</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As of Sept 1st 2014, the cutoff day is Monday February 16th. Events prior to this day appear and stick around just fine. Events entered after this day disappear after a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, it may be the case that the events will reappear once they are less than 6 months away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to reproduce the issue on both my phone and my husband's phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is a better place to post bug reports like this.</p>

            I do not work for Microsoft, but I can tell you that the Calendar app has always only synced a very short period of time. Only recurring events seem to show up outside of these limits, but one off events will always be removed from the calendar until it's
 closer to the current date. Microsoft has not changed this behaviour.<br />

<p>For now, ignore any third party headsets unless they are sold as Nokia compatible.&nbsp; Either the original Nokia headset is faulty or the 3.5" headset jack is faulty.&nbsp; How many times have you inserted and removed the Nokia headset?&nbsp; I have occasionally seen
 problems where a film of some kind gets onto metal connectors during manufacturing, and causes a bad connection.&nbsp; Perhaps insert and remove the headset 20 or 30 times to rub off any film?&nbsp; Or put a little alcohol on the headset jack to aid the connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you take the Nokia headset to a mobile phone shop and test it in similar Symbian phones?&nbsp; If it will not work in any Nokia phones, then I think Nokia gave you a bad headset.&nbsp; Talk to Nokia support (or wherever you bought the phone) about a replacement,
 or just buy another Nokia-compatible headset yourself.&nbsp; There are compatibility issues with third party headsets, so the best approach may be to buy another Nokia-branded headset, maybe a WH-205?&nbsp; But if your headset works normally in other Nokia phones, the
 headset jack is faulty, and you should immediately exchange the E6 for a replacement, assuming the warranty is still good.&nbsp; Don't wait!</p>

<p>I didn't completely understand what you meant here, but when you fix the first part, hopefully these issues will disappear.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

            Hello, i tried using another headphone with my nokia E6(note:- not the headphone that comes with the phone). When i removed the headphone, the headphone sign was still displaying on my phone screen. So whenever i try listening to music or trying to call
 without the headphone the loudspeaker wont work.. I hope there's a solution?? Tanx

<p>With regards to receiving a call, is there an option on the phone to switch to handset? This is to hear the other caller on phone's speaker and not on the accessory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried rebooting your phone? Turn off the phone. Remove the battery, then after a few minutes, return the battery and switch it on. Check if the same thing will occur.</p>

<h2>            Got blue screen with CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED</h2>
                    <p>Following the almost every hints in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_perf/getting-critical-error-error-occurred-in-the-shell/5429f158-fec1-438a-8700-1883f0af06f8">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Link &lt;&lt;&lt;</a> . I always get the critical error. Updating today doesn't fix it, but after 1-2 hours idling I ended with a blue screen with the hint to look online for the error description of "CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED". Can't find this error. This blue screen
 appears for the first time.</p>

            <p>Since this is both build 10130 &amp; a Mac there are not symbols for all the files which means we cannot always analyze these DMPS.&nbsp; IN your case it appears on the surface to be a RAM issue but I suspect it is just the way the Mac handles ram.</p>
