    <title>Inconsistent Column Widths in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inconsistent Column Widths in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I'm working in two different excel workbooks that were created by two different people.&nbsp; Both excel workbooks have the Font set at Times New Roman 12, and the column width to 14.&nbsp; However, when I have both columns set with an Accounting format, zero decimal
 places, and with a $ sign one of them only displays 7 characters before it turns to #####, while the other will display 11 characters before it turns to #####.&nbsp; Does anyone know what setting is causing the two different workbooks to present the same settings
 in different ways?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm specifically looking for what I need to change in one of the files so that it will also display the 11 characters in a consistent format as the other workbook, without just increasing the column width.&nbsp; I'm using the excel files to present financial
 information in report, so I'd like them to exhibit the exact same characteristics so I don't need to eyeball them for consistency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Initially the differences could be related to the resolution of the originator's video display.&nbsp; But that's not the problem at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible solution is to get one or both of them, or do this at your end, to select the column and then on the [Home] tab use the pull-down in the lower left corner of the Alignment group to display the Format Cells dialog and on the [Alignment] tab in
 it, check the <strong>Shrink to fit</strong> option.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The question then is whether or not the contents will still be large enough for you to actually make out the entry because this setting will try to shrink very long entries down to the available width which can make the effective font size virtually zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit] Just as a note, I pulled up my Excel 2010 and set a column to Times New Roman, 12 pitch with currency formatting and entered 1234567.89 into a cell, result is ########.&nbsp; I did auto-width and it changed it to width of 15.&nbsp; Back to 14 width and "Shrink
 to fit" and the $ 1,234,567.89 is clearly readable.</p>

            <p>As you suggested I checked both workbooks, and neither of them has the shrink to fix setting turned on.&nbsp; I also tried changing one to shrink to fit as you did and I had a similar result where it fit with the column width of 14.&nbsp; However, I did notice that
 when the shrink to fit feature is used, it makes the font appear to be smaller than the rest of the text within the sheet.&nbsp; Below I've included a snip from each of the workbooks.&nbsp; The first one is from the file that fits more characters, while the second is
 from the other file with the shrink to fit turned on.&nbsp; As you can see, the shrink to fit seems to make the numbers the same size, but the size of the text associated with each item is not consistent because the numbers were shrunk.&nbsp; Is there another setting
 that may do the same thing but for an entire workbook?</p>

            <p>"&nbsp;Is there another setting that may do the same thing but for an entire workbook?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that I'm aware of - the Shrink to Fit is a cell formating option, so it can be applied at the cell or worksheet level only.&nbsp; You could do it for all cells on any given sheet, but you'd have to do that sheet by sheet for each sheet in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is to be expected that when shrink to fit is turned on and when it's utilized by the cell, that the font is going to look smaller than the font in cells that didn't have to be shrunk.&nbsp; So $ 100.00 would appear at 12 point, while $ 11,222,333.44 would
 appear in smaller font because it was shrunk to fit.</p>

            <p>Not with any certainty, sorry.&nbsp; I could guess that it's somehow possible that the default printer setup on the two originating computers is different.&nbsp; The setup on-screen and for printout is often based in part on the default printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example: I often have to try to closely emulate the look of a PDF or Word document in Excel.&nbsp; The test for accuracy is to simply align a printout of the original document and a printout from Excel and hold it up to a light to see if things align closely
 enough.&nbsp; But I have to do it on just one computer, and use the printer that the final product will be printed on: if I do all the setup on another system with a different default printer and get everything 'perfect', it will NOT be perfect when printed on
 the final production system with the production printer.&nbsp; And this means changing row heights/column widths on screen to get the proper output for the final work.</p>

<h2>            Possible to use bluetooth headset and FM transmitter together&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia 5800 and Nokia BH-212 bluetooth headset.&nbsp; Is it possible to play music when driving using an FM transmitter plugged in to the headphone socket on the phone, to play through the car stereo speakers, and to use the headset to kick in in case
 someone calls whilst I'm driving and listening to music?&nbsp; I'm getting the music through the bluetooth thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts, anyone, please...?</p>

<p>I think you can only connect one audio enhancement at a time. So like on my N78 and the N97 I am using at the moment, if I am transmitting music through the FM transmitter, I cannot plug in my headphones at the same time. So you would be in much the same
 position. The FM transmitter in your phone is using the headphone jack, and is hence an audio enhancement. It cannot stream or provide audio channels to two devices at the same time, which is what are you wanting through the Bluetooth headset. You can try
 it, but I doubt it would work. And there are no applications available to modify this behaviour unfortunately.</p>

<p>The N78 <strong>is</strong> able to transmit via the FM transmitter and send sound to the headphones at the same time. Not by design, as the message you get when attempting to activate the FM transmitter when headphones are connected would attest. If you
 connect the headphones to the the N78 when the FM transmitter is active, you are informed that the FM transmitter is on standby&nbsp; until the headphones are disconnected. It never actually re-activates the FM transmitter when the headphones are disconnected though
 (non-nokia headphones).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it seems that Nokia don't want the FM transmitter transmitting when headphones are connected. However, if you activate the FM transmitter and let it auto disable itself by not playing any music for 2 minutes, not only wll the keypad tones remain disabled
 (bug), but connecting the headphones works as expected and upon resuming music playback the FM transmitter is auto re-enabled too. This seems to contradict the designed behaviour described above and is a typical example of the sort of bug that frequently gets
 through Nokia's quailty control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it does prove that the hardware can output audio to the headphones and FM transmitter simultaneously. Maybe the bluetooth and FM transmitter can work together? Who knows. Nokia probably don't know either. Or care, I suspect,</p>

<p>Well, if it is a bug it isn't really a feature that Sushidushi is asking for. Because it may damage the phone, or not work on all occasions. I know that sometimes when I have the FM transmitter activated, and connect the headphones, the phone freezes. So
 although technically it may be possible, we would want Sushidushi to have proper support for this function, and not a hacked phone / relying on a bug to get them through which may lead to damage to his phone.</p>

<p>Adrian, this bug obviously does not provide the feature that is being requested. The OP would have to be quite insane to try to exploit this bug to acheive their requirement. Why would you even suggest that?</p>
<blockquote><strong>So although technically it may be possible, we would want Sushidushi to have proper support for this function, and not a hacked phone / relying on a bug to get them through which may lead to damage to his phone.</strong></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if you spend as much energy lobbying Nokia to improve its products as you do denouncing other forum members?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This forum is the only way I know of making my feelings known in a way that is visible to both Nokia and consumers. I was attempting to voice my feelings and findings about this bug whilst addressing the OP's question regarding the hardware's ability to
 send audio to multiple outputs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had my way, this bug would not have made it into a released product. It certainly wouldn't still be there after 2 years. But Nokia doesn't have a good attitude towards bugs. It seems they've brainwashed the majority of their customers to accept this
 - to the point where forum members take every opportunity to transfer the blame to their peers rather than put pressure on Nokia to provide better quality firmware :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it quite disappointing that I am being accused of encouraging others to damage their phones. Especially when it's flaws that Nokia have made in their own products that enable this to happen in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record Adrian, I would much prefer it if there were no such bugs as these in my "smart" phone. But there are. The fact that Nokia do not give good support for their disgruntled customers regarding firmware, and that certain members of this forum
 appear to support them are reasons why I won't buy Nokia again.</p>

 was capable of doing such a thing, I still wouldn't have told Sushidushi about it. So you claim that it is insane to exploit the bug to achieve this requirement, yet you went right ahead and explained how to replicate it. What does a bug have anything to do
 in the first place with his query? He asked it if were possible, and I am in the position to suggest proper ways to do it, not ones that may damage his phone. You assumed that I was denouncing you by merely explaining that it may be a dangerous practice for
 anyone to do with their phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to voice your concerns, file that in the bug report threads that I and others have started, or email Nokia about it. By assisting other users such as Sushidushi on these forums, we aim to provide the best possible care for them, and to suggest
 capabilities of their phones within the appropriate safety limits and proper supported functions of their phone. It is not up for me to suggest that it's possible to use it by detailing a bug that the phone has, since what does this achieve? You chose not
 to be that relevant to the question, and instead stamp your mark by trying to be complete and try to put me down by saying it "is" possible to perform the function he wanted on his phone. You obviously realise that anything written on these forums is going
 to be viewed by the user, and advice taken in hand. So he may have replicated your detailed explanation of the bug, and damaged his phone. Then what impression would he have of the forums here, in which we aim to help other users?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to transferring the blame to other users, that is not the case, and I've explained this a million times to other users regarding the firmware processes. I don't have to repeat myself again, as with enough searching you will find it / or have heard it
 before.</p>

<p>OK adrian. I see your point. This forum is for helping other users, not griping about bugs. My bad. In my frustration with the poor support from Nokia, my post turned into a rant rather than be a constructive helpful suggestion to the OP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My original post should have read: I don't know. What does the manual say? Have you tried asking Nokia?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that wouldn't have been very helpful. So I might as well not have bothered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I was trying to point out, quite uselessly, that even though the firmware wants to disable the FM transmitter when headphones are connected, it is still possible - the hardware actually does do it. I don't know whether this means that you can acheive
 the same thing for bluetooth and FM transmitter, and I really didn't mean to suggest that it would, but I guess I must take some responsibility for not specifically stating this (I rather left it up to the reader to work it out). My post was not helpful to
 anyone skimming for a solution to the OPs question. But hey, I'm just fed up with this (and other bugs) still being present in my N78. Not that that helps anyone.</p>

<p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you've looked into the DocumentChange event and check if that would trigger during the attachment process? If that event doesn't trigger then the only other idea I have would be attempting to trap and repurpose the launching of the Templates and
 Add-ins dialog when the Document Template button is clicked from the Developer Tab. The control for this would have to be in a global add-in running independently of the source document</p>

            OK, in that case, put the poem in a two-column table with an outer border. You will lose the text flow from one column to the next, of course, but you can fake that by copying and pasting content.

<p>Hi Tamara Johnston, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to use the second tool (OutlookResetPreferences tool) in this
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office_for_mac_support_team_blog/2017/08/10/mac-outlook-support-utilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>, please kindly note the tool will reset all Outlook Preferences back to defaults. Update Outlook desktop client to make sure you have installed the latest version. If it is Office 365 for Business account, login Outlook Web App to check if issue occurs
 on web version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is suggested to contact our dedicated team via Outlook-&gt;Help-&gt;<strong>Contact Support</strong> to seek further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

    <title>Color Coding Folders in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stiltskid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Color Coding Folders in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I find filing email to be cumbersome with multiple page downs to the requested folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, using a filing process, i.e. moving email by subject or sender to project and admin folders is a way to make sure I have read the mail, addressed any concerns, and gives me a way to go back and find it by folder name.&nbsp; I don't use automatic folder
 filing, except for journals and other regular publications by associations, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft looking at some color code scheme for the folder pane?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest highlighting, or colored text as a possible solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    I cannot turn on real time protection as Defender thinks that another AV is present. I don't have any third party anti-malware installed. Defender worked fine under Vista and Windows 7 on this PC. I have run ESET to detect any AV and uninstall any residual
 components and it came back completely clean failing to find any other anti-malware software. How can I find out what Windows Defender is thinking it has found which is stopping real time protection from being enabled?

 properly (completely). Since Windows 8/10 Defender includes anti-virus protection, it is&nbsp;<strong>disabled during the installation of another anti-virus program</strong>. If a trial anti-virus (i.e. McAfee, Norton, etc) came&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">preinstalled</span></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;on
 your computer or you installed one,&nbsp;<strong>Windows Defender will be turned off</strong>&nbsp;(disabled). Windows Defender recognizes the install and automatically disables itself when other anti-virus products are used&nbsp;<strong>to avoid conflicts</strong>. Windows
 Defender will&nbsp;<strong>remain disabled until that anti-virus software has been completely uninstalled</strong>. In some cases, you may need to download and run the anti-virus vendor's clean up tool to remove any remaining remnants.<br />

After removal of the third party anti-virus, Windows 8/10 Defender needs to be&nbsp;<strong>activated</strong>&nbsp;if you choose to use it. When uninstalling the third-party anti-virus Defender should automatically turn itself on but sometimes you may receive a message
 indicating&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">your system has no protection...click here to turn on Windows Defender</span></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.

<p>Here is another way on how you can disable Skype from starting up automatically:<br />
1. Open <strong>Task Manager </strong>(<strong>Ctrl </strong>+<strong> Shift </strong>
+<strong> Esc</strong>).<br />
2. Click <strong>More details.</strong><br />
3. Select the <strong>Startup</strong> tab and if Skype appears on the list, right-click the entry and select
<strong>Disable</strong>.</p>

<h2>            using C7 as USB-modem under Windows 8.1 - connection drops after 2 minutes</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my girl-friend used her C7-00 as a wifi-tethering device until recently when she got her new computer that came with&nbsp; Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Because 8.1 does not support WEP-Hotspot, I decided to hook up the phone using USB-cable and Nokia Suite.&nbsp; The connection goes alright, and she can surf through her C7 for a while, but then after 2 minutes approximately Nokia Suite says the connection has
 been dropped. This happens every time.&nbsp; Internet works perfectly on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried solutions: restarting phone, updating software, switching USB-modem mode, checking access-point configuration in Nokia Suite</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone offer a suggestion on how to make this work ?&nbsp; Otherwise we will have to buy a new smartphone :-(.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, sennerin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions Forum! :Cool:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your concern, Nokia Suite is not compatible with PC which runs Windows 8.1 OS. You can check the compatible Operating System of PC for Nokia Suite here:
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/nokia-suite-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a>. That is the reason why the connection is not that stable when using the phone as an internet modem.</p>

    <title>WDRT not detecting Lumia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mzuvukil  say:</h3>
<h2>            WDRT not detecting Lumia</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lumia 535 RM1089 is stuck in a boot loop. Downloaded WDRT, even after I've selected it from the list of devices, I get an error that "the recovery package isn't available on the server "
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my device out of this boot loop, it starts and ends with the Microsoft banner, even attempting the "Volume Down" after restart won't work, it gets as far as the Exclamation Mark but doesn't respond to the button sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I did was change sim cards. I haven't installed any apps from outside the store. If I could at least get a working&nbsp;link for the Windows mobile recovery package that would be good. My device is more than 2 years old, so I can't go back to the retailer
 without being charged ridiculous money. Please help.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Mzuvukil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this scenario, follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the phone.</li><li>Once the phone is off, <strong>Hold the Volume </strong>down key then plug the charger (charger should be connected to the power source).</li><li>Once you see the exclamation point, remove your finger from the button.</li><li>Then press the following keys in, <strong>Volume Up</strong>, <strong>Volume Down</strong>,<strong> Power Key and Volume down</strong>. The phone will turn on automatically, this may take several minutes and it will show two gears that are spinning just
 wait for it to finish.</li><li>One more thing all the files on the phone will be deleted but if you have a Microsoft account on the phone, check
<a href="http://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">people.live.com</a> to check the contact lists that you have and Onedrive for the pictures, that's if you have a Microsoft account on the phone.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let&nbsp; us know how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thanks, but like I already stated, Ive already tried the Volume Down approach but it didn't get farther than the Exclamation Mark.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest I got was with WDRT, I plugged it into a computer but removed the battery. The PC detects the device, but the download doesn't start, it says "Not available on the server."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't update that week when there was a problem with an Insider Build, so it's surprising to get this problem now.</p>

<p>Most probably the server is down for the moment that's why Windows Device Recovery Tool isn't working. We suggest that you give it try again some other time.</p>

    <title>Skype Online and Exchange On-prem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;m-o&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Online and Exchange On-prem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We currently have Exchange 2010 and we are aiming for deploying Skype for Business Online within Office 365.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If we only assign the Skype for Business "license" and Exchange is disabled no mailbox will be created right? If this is needed so we don't let skype for business store the skype meeting information in the calendar in the exchange online mailbox (since
 we don't run hybrid)</p>
<p>2) If we run this environment can we use unfied contact store?</p>
<p>3) If we create a Skype meeting in the client will that meeting show up in the on-prem mailbox calendar? And in the lync client?</p>
<p>4) We can only use Azure AD Connect with passwordsync for this and we dont need any hybrid configuration?</p>
<p>5) if a user sign in using fqdn one can store the password in the client right since there will be no full blown single-sign-on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 subscription provides an access to Office applications and other productivity services that are available in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the answers to your questions:<br />
<br />
1. Macros are not yet supported in Excel for Android. We suggest sending us a feedback through
<a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel UserVoice</a>.</p>
<p>2. If you are pertaining to a shortcut that opens a document or page saved on the Internet when you click on an Excel cell, refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/HYPERLINK-function-333c7ce6-c5ae-4164-9c47-7de9b76f577f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HYPERLINK function</a>. </p>
<p>3. You can't open another workbook without closing the others. We also recommend that you give us a feedback through

<p>Thank you Arjay for the answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On question #2 i had a slightly different question in mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not mean internet hyperlinks, but rather mean formulas that reference cells in other workbooks, i think they are formally called "external links". Here is an example of such a formula.</p>
<p>=[D4_post.xlsm]dashb!$E$2</p>
<p>Is that type of formula availble in Android Excel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much!</p>
<p>

<h2>            How can I determine who deleted a O365 account</h2>
                    Is there any way to determine who deleted a O365 account, I have recovered it and see when it was deleted, but not by who.

            Hi Tim,<br />
<br />
As C#S suggested, we can <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Search-the-audit-log-in-the-Office-365-Security-Compliance-Center-0d4d0f35-390b-4518-800e-0c7ec95e946c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
search the audit log in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center</a>.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/652bf9d1-7c6e-4d84-8cf4-ba2f6cdfc10b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/652bf9d1-7c6e-4d84-8cf4-ba2f6cdfc10b" /></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: To search the Audit log, we need to be assigned the <strong>
View-Only Audit Logs</strong> or <strong>Audit Logs</strong> role in Exchange Online (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff459262(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article for your reference</a>), and turn it on by clicking
<strong>Start recording user and admin activity</strong> on the <strong>Audit log search</strong> page.<br />
<br />
It takes up to 12 hours for the changes in <strong>User administration activities</strong> to take effect.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Scanpst is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Officenn in x64 or C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Officenn in x86.

<p>
I'm having issues with Word 7 on my Windows 8.1 laptop.&nbsp; While typing a word doc, I finish a sentence and hit enter to start a new paragraph and it changes the font, changes to italics from non italics, and centered text from align left (default).&nbsp; I then change
 it back to the way I had it-Times Roman 12 pt., non-italics, and left align and continue typing.&nbsp; Later on, it will do the same thing.&nbsp; This is very frustrating.&nbsp; Anyone have an answer to this problem?&nbsp; Do I need to upgrade to Office 2013?&nbsp; Will that solve
 the issue.&nbsp; <br /></p>

            <p>Every style in Word has a "Style for following paragraph" defined. For most styles, this is the same style, but for some styles (notably heading styles), the following style is different (for headings, it's Normal). If you get different formatting when you
 press Enter, it may be that you are getting a different style.</p>
