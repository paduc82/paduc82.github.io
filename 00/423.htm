<h2>            Filter a form with checkboxes, the data is coming from SQL</h2>
                    I have a form of checkboxes and I want the user to be able to select the checkboxes they want and that record(s) that meets that criteria appears. &nbsp;The data is coming from SQL so a basic filter will not work. &nbsp;What can I write in VBA?

            <p>VBA would probably not be appropriate, but a Query (or for that matter a filter) should be fine. Why do you say that "a basic filter will not work"? All Access data comes from SQL - even local tables use (Access' own dialect) of SQL to construct queries.</p>
<p>Please explain. </p>

            Showing us your data structure will help us help you. But John is correct, the source of your data, has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether you can use a Filter or not.&nbsp;

            Here is a look at the way the data is created in SQL&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Office_Assistant (bit, null)</div>
<div><br />
<div>But when I create a form in Access and I filter by form... it doesn't pull the records... &nbsp;I read that it has to do with SQL collect the data as 0 or -1, and the filter is looking for true or false...</div>

            <p>I suspect that it's the opposite: SQL/Server uses +1 and 0 in Bit datatype fields, and Access expects -1 for True and 0 for False in Yes/No fields.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that YOU can see your database. We cannot. You have not said anything about the Recordsource of the form, what the filter is intended to do, the names of the controls on your form... give us a little help here please?</p>

            I will do my best to explain... &nbsp; I created a table in SQL (job_Categories), and I am importing it into an Access DB (ODBC)... &nbsp; I created a form of checkboxes, the record source is the Job_Categories table, so each field has a checkbox. &nbsp;What I want the
 filter to do is give the user an option of checking the boxes to determine the criteria ... &nbsp;so they only see the records that meet the checkboxes that are marked... &nbsp;I hope that makes more since... &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I tried to take screen shots but I was unable to paste them in....</div>
<div><br />
<div>my initial thought was to create a form with the checkboxes and a button so when they selected the checkboxes and clicked the button it ran an event the produce a query of the records that meet that criteria... &nbsp;I was able to write the sql statement in
 VBA, but I was struggling with determining the criteria but the checkboxes they marked.. &nbsp;</div>

            <p>More clarification (sorry):</p>
<p>Are you <em>IMPORTING</em> the table into a local, Access table?<br />
or are you <em>LINKING</em> to the SQL/Server table using ODBC?</p>
<p>Either is possible, and the answer depends on which you're doing.</p>
<p>And please open the Form in design view and view its Properties. What is in the Recordsource property on the Data tab? If it's a query or a SQL statement please post the SQL text here.</p>
<p>Finally what (if anything) do you have in the Control Source properties of the checkboxes on your form?</p>

            <blockquote>I created a table in SQL (job_Categories), and I am importing it into an Access DB (ODBC)... &nbsp; I created a form of checkboxes, the record source is the Job_Categories table, so each field has a checkbox.
<div><br />
</blockquote>
<br />
Having a separate column in the table for each job category is a bad design as it is 'encoding data as column headings'.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle.&nbsp; This requires that all data be stored as values
 at column positions in rows in tables, and in no other way.<br />
<br />
A correct design would be firstly to have a table with one row per job category.&nbsp; Then you'd have a table which models the many-to-many relationship type between this table and your current table (sometimes called a junction table) by having two foreign key
 columns, one referencing the primary key of your current table, the other referencing the primary key of the new table of job categories.&nbsp; So for each job category relevant to a row in your current table there would be a row in the junction table.<br />
<br />
To return rows from your current table (now without the multiple job category columns) which have related rows in the junction table which include all of a set of selected categories you could use a multi-select list box to select as few or as many categories
 as desired.&nbsp; Code in the form's module could then loop through the list box's ItemsSelected collection and build the SQL for a query to return the relevant rows. The type of query for this can be illustrated using the sample Northwind database:<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM Orders<br />
WHERE EXISTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT [Order ID]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM [Order Details]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE [Order Details].[Order ID] = Orders.[Order ID]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND [Product ID] IN(7,51)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GROUP BY [Order ID]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAVING COUNT(*) = 2);<br />
<br />
This query returns all orders which include products 7 and 51 (Dried apples and dried pears) as rows in the related Order Details table.&nbsp; It does this by the seeing if the subquery returns rows which have either of the two products, and the number of rows returned
 by the subquery is the same as the number of specified products, two in this case. With the version of Northwind shipped with Access 2007 this returns two orders, one of which includes only the two products, the other of which has three products, two of which
 are those specified.&nbsp; Building the SQL for such a query in code on the basis of items selected in a multi-select list box is quite straightforward.&nbsp; The RecordSource property of the form could then be set to the SQL statement, and the form requeried to show
 only the relevant rows.<br />

            As Ken said, your structure is all wrong. Also its not doing what you want it to do.
<div><br />
<div>What I think you want is be able to filter a query to show you the selected Job categories.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The SQL Statement you show above makes no sense. In your Resume_DB you should have a field for Job Category. This field should be an Identity datatype. And you should have a table like so:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Job_Categories</div>
<div>JobCategoryID&nbsp;</div>
<div>JobCategory</div>
<div><br />
<div>So when you add a resume you select the JobCategory from a combobox.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, if you want to produce a list for a&nbsp;specific&nbsp;job category, the best way is to use a Combobox where you select a category and then filter based on the selection.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want the user to select mutliple categories, you can use the checkboxes, but they would be UNBOUND and then you would have to construct a WHERE clause based on the checked values. I would not recommend this. Instead you can use a listbox to select
 multiples.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, there is a wrinkle here when a resume may fall into&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;job categories, a likely scenario. So you really need a junction table with 2 fields like:</div>
<div><br />
<div>ResumeID</div>
<div>JobCategoryID</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />

            So I am not sure why I would need the junction table... &nbsp; I have one table for Resume Applicants (Resume_ID) and One table for Job_Categories.. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Each Resume applicant can have several Job Catergories (One-to-many)... &nbsp;up to 10 -15 ..</div>
<div><br />
<div>My Resume Applicant database has the following</div>
<div>Resume_ID (primary key)</div>
<div><br />
<div>My Job Categories table has the following</div>
<div><br />
<div>ID_Job_Class</div>
<div>Resume_ID (Primary key)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are you saying that I should have one field in the Resume Applicant db to hold all of the Job_categories for that applicant.. &nbsp;Which is populated by creating a combo box (based on the Job_Categores table) &nbsp;that will allow mulitple values to be added to
 field in the Resume applicant DB.?</div>

<p>Hi Alden Rey</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to jump on the thread but I have had similar/ same issue today from my account. Do you mind if I ask you as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking back through the draft folder. the problem has probably been there longer but I have not noticed it until today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Hotmail account. Problem is with draft emails.&nbsp; When an email is save as draft I can then view it in draft folder, but no button to allow me to edit/ continue writing/ send the draft email.&nbsp; There is a reply or reply all button which then creates
 another draft which I can edit and send.&nbsp; If I then save this draft same thing happens again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When sending an email - if it takes too long to compose the email it will not send.&nbsp; Then I'm forced to save it as a draft and have the problem above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same issue when logged in using different browsers (Edge, chrome), same when I used Windows Mail app and also a third party app on my phone.&nbsp; Have also logged in using outlook.com or windows live (seems to link to same address now anyway)
 as suggested by previous threads on this topic.&nbsp; Also tried clearing cache, cookies and browser history, none of these things made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening?? It's making my Hotmail account very difficult to use, am going to have to consider signing up for different email if it's not possible to fix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Alden Rey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inhabe exactly the same problem as TF852. It's not about new devices or platform used. The same problems happen on my PC, Mac and iPhone, it happens on all browsers, and on all different apps (mail, outlook, Alto). The most annoying thing might not be not
 able to continue editing the mail, but already happened several times that I thought the mail has already sent while it's turned out it stays at the draft folder without notice (especially when sent with a phone). I almost missed a job due to that. According
 to the searching results it seems the problems persists for quite long time. Wish you find the root cause.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am using Office 365 for Mac. OS: High Sierra 10.13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlook 16.15, modified 7/13 Have multiple email accounts. A university one works, one personal works, the other three do not. Updated MS recently in Croatia (live in US but still in Croatia)
 Get message from Google “We need to launch a browser so you can sign in to (my account name) ” I click on the blue hot link “Sign in to Google” then “Choose an account” which appears, I click on that account and then ”MS apps and services wants to access your
 Google account” When I click “Allow” a smaller box appears asking “Do you want this page to open Microsoft Outlook?” When I click allow it says “Your browser has been opened. Sign in and come back when done” but then takes me back to “Choose your account”.
 Also Outlook isn’t responding when want to close Outlook so I have to&nbsp;face quit. Don’t know where I would sign in or what else to do? Thanks much in advance!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>P.S. The one account that works was warning me that someone tried to log into my account. I got into Google security section in that account, noted that it was me on the option given, and then it worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>I can’t do that on any of the
 other accounts., or at least can’t find that same process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am thinking I am not the only one with this issue and I would greatly appreciate help.</span></p>

<h2>            Bug&#58; Attachments with exclamation mark in the filename cannot be accessed anymore</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have installed today's updates for Windows and Office including Outlook 2007. Since then, Outlook blocks access to all files that contain an exclamation mark, e.g. "test!.txt", even if it is a simple text file.<br />
<br />
Error message is "Outlook blocked access to the following potentially unsafe attachments".<br />
<br />
This was not a problem the day before! I could open an attachment, and today I can't.<br />
Windows 10, Outlook 2007<br />
<br />
Another user has confirmed this bug in another forum in Outlook 2010 on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;The culprit is KB3203467 for Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>Uninstalling the update solves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the same problem in Outlook 2013 though it has started to warn me about opening attachments that contain exclamation marks in the file names. I suspect that it's KB3191938 that is involved for Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>Outlook 2016 doesn't seem to have this problem either.<br />
</p>
<p>What's even worse is that it's no longer possible to open attachments in Outlook Tasks in Outlook 2010 after you install&nbsp;KB3203467.</p>
<p>Attach a file called test.txt in a Task, save and close the task.<br />
Now open the task and try to open the attachment (test.txt).</p>
<p>I get the error message:&nbsp;<em>The program used to create this object is Outlook. That program is either not installed on your computer or it is not responding. To edit this object, install Outlook or ensure that any dialog boxes in Outlook are closed.</em></p>
<p>Again, uninstalling KB3203467 solves the problem.</p>
<p>Personally I don't understand how this particular issue could make it through internal QA. Bad Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see the task attachment problem in Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a known issue with attaching messages to other messages if the subject line ends with an unsafe file name extension like .exe according to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3203467/descriptionofthesecurityupdateforoutlook2010june13,2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3203467/descriptionofthesecurityupdateforoutlook2010june13,2017</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That's three issues in total so far and I bet we will se more issues over the next days. My bet is that they will pull back this update once enough people shell out the $499 it takes to file a bug report with Microsoft.</p>
<p>I'm sure as hell not going to do it. I'll just remove the update from our internal software update deployments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>Maybe it's four issues. The task attachment problem isn't limited to tasks. It occurs with calendar events too.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;am seeing similar behavior with Outlook 2007 and 2010, both within our own company, and at a number of our clients.&nbsp;BTW, this is not just with an exclamation mark, but also with&nbsp;two or more dots, so e.g. 1..10.txt or "Martinic V.O.F..txt" is now also considered
 unsafe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that a&nbsp;workaround would be to ask the sender to rename the attachment and resend it, but this might not always be possible, e.g. if the sender is an automated system, or if the e-mail is from a while ago and the sender may no longer have the attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, hopefully Microsoft will fix this issue ASAP, because my clients are not excatly happy with this, to say the least...</p>

</p><p>Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 indeed fully block the attachment. There is currently no Outlook-level workaround for this other than removing the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A non-Outlook based workaround would be to use web mail (OWA, Outlook.com, Gmail, etc...) to access these attachments. When using a POP3 account and you've set Outlook to remove the emails from the server, you may be out of luck for this workaround.</p>

                    Hi, i have a problem with my N95 connekted to a bluetooth stereo headset...<br />
<br />

<br />
it make the stanby time less than 4 hours NOT talking or listening to music... just plain stanby...<br />
<br />

<br />

            <p>A simpler alternative is to click the Options button in the Envelopes dialog, scroll to the bottom of the size list, and click Custom Size. That opens a smaller dialog where you can set the desired width and height.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advantage is that you don't have to choose a custom page size in the printer driver (as long as the size is not larger than the printer's maximum). Also, if your printer feeds envelopes from a different tray than regular paper, that setup will automatically
 be included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disadvantage is that Word doesn't save custom size settings. To avoid having to enter the custom size each time, use the Add to Document button in the Envelopes dialog to make a blank envelope, and save it as a document or template file that you can
 reuse.</p>

    <title>English Outlook changes to local language when performing a search - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aub10  say:</h3>
<h2>            English Outlook changes to local language when performing a search</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have Outlook 2016 through my Office 365 business account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, my Outlook is in english:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6dab3b94-fa89-4eca-a913-6915c8cfc82d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6dab3b94-fa89-4eca-a913-6915c8cfc82d?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press the "from" button to perform a search, my local language (Norwegian) is added to the search box and not english:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce134035-baac-446f-bb39-df00de89ecef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce134035-baac-446f-bb39-df00de89ecef?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When that happens, no results is shown. However, when I manually change the word "fra" (from in Norwegian) to "from", the expected search results is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change so that when I press the "from" button, the following is added to the search field:</p>
<p><em>from:"sender name"&nbsp; (</em>instead of <em>fra:"sender name"?)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the results when searching:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/303cf075-1838-4c6a-b038-f26d1c866459?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/303cf075-1838-4c6a-b038-f26d1c866459?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the results when I manually change "fra" to "from".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70be99da-1f32-4387-9424-4d6d36eb2141?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70be99da-1f32-4387-9424-4d6d36eb2141?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have search around for a while, and I have tried to disable add-in's and to reset indexing etc.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />     Sometimes these can change. Microsoft released a guide on it located at the link below:

            Closing your Skype account, also requires closing your Microsoft Account because they are linked. 
<br />
<br />Skype is one of a range of consumer services that is accessed through a Microsoft account. It is not possible to separate your Skype profile from your Microsoft account.
<br />If you close your Microsoft account, in addition to not being able to sign in to or access Skype, you'll no longer be able to sign in to other Microsoft consumer products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows.
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br />
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you don’t continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>
<br />
<br />You can close your Microsoft account by following these steps:
<br />
<br />    Go to our Microsoft account closure page (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>). You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the Microsoft account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />    Your Microsoft account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in to cancel the closure. <a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>

                    Whenever I try to open the search bar or the start menu it takes from 30 seconds to 3 minutes to open. This is something that should be fixed. I am 100% sure it is not my computer because I have 8GB of ram and a 2.8GHz quadcore processor. My hard drive
 is not fragmented and is also in mint condition.&nbsp;

    <title>Need EMS enabled on WM 6.1 device from Verizon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lacklustre484  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need EMS enabled on WM 6.1 device from Verizon</h2>
                    Apparently, this is an issue exclusive to Verizon, and&nbsp;every time I call Verizon tech support to get it cleared up, I end up teaching more than&nbsp;learning.&nbsp; On Verizon handsets (non-windows smartphone and non-smartphone), a user&nbsp;can send and receive &nbsp;sms
 messages over 160 characters (known as EMS messaging because the device will receive it in packets of 160 and either put it together or display as multiple messages).&nbsp; If you have a Verizon device with WM6.1 however, you get the first 160 characters and then
 a second message saying that the rest could not be sent.&nbsp; However, yet another twist is that if the sender is also using a Verizon WM6.1 device you will receive it as 2 or 3 or 4......etc separate messages, however all of the text will come in.&nbsp; I confirmed
 with HTC that this was not a limitation of their device (I am using the HTC/XV/PPC 6800/Mogul) and it is not a limitation of the Verizon network because other devices on the network can do it.&nbsp; Every tech support person at Verizon I have spoken with has given
 me his personal cell number and asked me to call him when I find a solution (hence, they know its a load of BS too).&nbsp; I found a workaround using the registry editor (which I am told works on the Moto Q9), but when I tried it on my device it did not work (Link
 here:<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa919404.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa919404.aspx</a>).&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions or solutions?&nbsp; I was thinking if we could get ahold of the registry of a device that can do this
 (like the same phone and software on a different network) and compare registries we could find the missing keys and fix this issue.&nbsp; Any input is welcome.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

<p>lacklustre484 - I got the official word from Verizon this afternoon and am quoting them here&nbsp;(which means your best option is to follow Chris's final piece of advice). "<span><span><span>Verizon’s
 Windows Mobile devices do not support EMS, thus text messages greater than 160 characters will not work. The experience may vary a bit from device to device (depending on what type of device is sending the message) but there is no support for EMS on these
 devices."</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Using ask statements in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I'm setting up a mail merge form in Word 2010 and am trying to include text from another file based on the user's response.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to include the list?"&nbsp;&nbsp; If they say "Y", it will include text from another file.&nbsp; If the response is "N"
 then do nothing.&nbsp; I've tried using the "REF" after the Ask field but my document comes up empty.&nbsp; This is how I'm doing it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{ASK list "Insert List? (Y or N)" \d "N"}{REF List}{IF REF List} = "Y" "{INCLUDETEXT \\\\kk1\\share\\tw\\forms\\list.doc}</p>

            It might just be a transcription error, but the expression you showed is missing a couple of field markers. There should be a left brace (marker) between the IF and the REF, and another right brace (marker) at the end of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
You can omit the {REF List} field between the ASK field and the IF field, unless you really want the user's answer to appear in the document.<br />
<br />
Also, you should remove the unmatched double quote before the {INCLUDETEXT and add a pair of double quotes (with nothing between them) between the two closing braces at the end -- that's the 'else' part of the IF field.<br />
<br />
Here's the final result:<br />
<br />
{ASK List "Insert List? (Y or N)" \d "N"}{IF { REF List } = "Y" { INCLUDETEXT <span>
\\\\kk1\\share\\tw\\forms\\list.doc</span> } ""}<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We have released an article that has resolutions for emails that are not being sent in Outlook.com. We suggest that you visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-com-won-t-let-me-send-an-email-62de1f9b-6552-4239-8578-078d292bb31a?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#increaselimits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and perform the resolutions provided.<br />
<br />
It is also possible that your message contains a large attachment. You may try to delete the attachment or attach a smaller file to see if your message can be successfully sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. None of Microsoft's support is helpful in the slightest. &nbsp;Or the copy-pasted Microsoft advice given on the numerous other topics around the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this is an issue out of our hands, which we just have to pray to the Microsoft gods to resolve, or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Also, from the&nbsp;</span>initial post you mentioned, you mean Outlook keep asking for password. About the error you mentioned
 in latest reply, may I know if it is another issue? Or please send us a complete screenshot for it.</p>
<p>

            Hi Bhavin
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />Since your Skype account is already a Microsoft account, it is not possible to merge or unlink your Skype and Microsoft account.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12060/can-i-merge-or-unlink-my-skype-and-microsoft-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12060/can-i-...</a>
<br />
<br />It seems you now have 2 accounts. Do you remember your old Skype id? If so, you should be able yo login to Skype with it.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Maggie

            My father computer has these aid for computer support pop up.&nbsp;This actually protects your computer&nbsp;and your data but prevent a lot functionality since most is driven by the company server.&nbsp; It is also off site backup.&nbsp; Some countries and small community
 do this automately without consent&nbsp;&nbsp;to safe guard technical data because you are using there network to access the internet.&nbsp; Beside doing a clean install which include wiping out everything, a secondary machine is best as per the agreement with Microsoft
 for no Liability for loss of data.&nbsp; Sorry about the possibility of bring some bad news.

<p>I am using the disc which came with this gateway computer which is " Microsoft Works Suite 2003.&nbsp; I assume that my word is on this disc since the disc came with the computer.</p>

<p>I do not seem to be able to uninstall Word from the computer nor can I install.&nbsp; I have never heard the expression "flat" is that the same as disc?&nbsp; Sorry to be so computer illiterate.&nbsp; LOL</p>

<p><br />
NO.&nbsp; The suggestion was the you create a new folder on your hard drive and into that folder you copy the entire contents of the Microsoft Works CD.&nbsp; Then you access that folder using WIndows Explorer and locate the Setup.exe file and double click on that to
 run it.</p>
<p>Note, you have never posted the exact text of the error message that you are receiving, which is something that Anoop had asked you to do and which may give those that are trying to help you additional clues.</p>
<p>Even though it refers to Office, rather than Works, you might try the second method under the Resolution section of the article at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/327854/en-us?spid=2533&amp;sid=485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/327854/en-us?spid=2533&amp;sid=485</a></p>
<p>using your Works CD where in that method it refers to the Office CD.&nbsp; Note that the article says that you must hold down the Shift key when inserting the CD and the purpose of that is to prevent the installation from running automatically and rather have
 it run from the Control Panel by following the next steps in that article.</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 Crashing when changing font</h2>
                    Every time I try to change font in Microsoft Office 2010, the application crashes completely. It worked fine in the Beta, but now that I have updated to the release version it is constantly crashing. I have the 64-bit version, and the problem is exclusive
 to Word; it doesn't crash in Outlook or Excel.

            I have been having this issue for months. It makes no sense to me but Lexmark just released new drivers for win 7 64 bit. I read somewhere that the printer could be the problem but I really don't know why.&nbsp;I installed them and it seems to have fixed my
 problem.

            <p>I had this problem and following the various suggestions achieved nothing. Eventually, in my case, I tracked it down to one (or more) of the templates that I was using. I moved all the templates to a temporary folder and restarted Word. It created its default
 template and since then I've not had any issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<span><span>I also noticed</span> <span>that sometimes</span> <span>when I</span>

Is it possible some kind of virus causes that?<br />

<br />
For those of you with the same issue <br />
Run =&gt; %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\ I moved all the contents to a folder I created there, and all worked again.<br />
<br />
Repair mode did nothing more than waste time, also Outlook addin settings didn't change anything as well.<br />

            <div>Under Windows 7 Professional x64 (on VWware Virtual Platform on MacBook Pro), with both 32 and 64 bit installations of MS Office Standard 2013, I have had the same problem:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Word crashes when trying to change the font on the ribbon drop down list.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Following the tips here, and similar, I have tried the following (chronologically):</div>
<div>
<p>- reset the font cache both through cold reboot and by deleting the FNTCACHE.DAT file;</p>
<p>- changed/deleted the default and other printers;</p>
<p>- removed all the content of %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates\ and made sure %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\ contains nothing but an empty 'STARTUP' folder;</p>
<p>- ran Word in safe mode - WORKED;</p>
<p>- disabled all Word and Outlook Add-ins;</p>
<p>- changed the font through the&nbsp;the 'Fonts' dialog (invoked with the ^D shortcut) -&nbsp;WORKED;</p>
<p>- repaired Office;</p>
<p>- reinstalled Office;</p>
<p>- deleted all but the protected fonts&nbsp;- WORKED;</p>
<p>- reinstalled Windows and Office without any other software (but Virtual Clone Drive tool needed to mount the Office installer);</p>
<p>- installed AVG Antivirus 2013, and scanned for viruses, detecting no threats;</p>
<p>- installed all available updates for Windows and Office.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have found no solution apart from the mentioned workarounds.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After posting the above, I have repeatedly experienced the same crash upon trying to insert a table from the respective ribbon bar drop-down. It therefore appears that the crash is not necessarily related with fonts but with more general ribbon bar functionality.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I recently realised that the same crash would occur after using any of the line spacing options on the ribbon bar.</p>

<h2>            VBA Refer to another sheet on same Workbook</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want&nbsp;to get some data on Sheet 1 from Sheet2 in the same workbook. </p>
<p>Catch is the Sheet 2 may or may not have the same name everytime the VBA is run to fetch data (its a monthly sheet and tab might show diff names).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That sheet will always remain as second tab in the workbook.</p>
<p>Is there a way we can refer the to Sheet 2 by number rather than its name so VBA wont get confused when the&nbsp;Sheet2 do not have the same name.
</p>

            Given the nature of the formula, you could write the formula into&nbsp;Sheets(1).Range("C3:C7") then convert the formulas into their returned values in the next line.
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub test1()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets(1).Range("C3:C7").Formula = "=COUNTIF(" &amp; Sheets(2).Name &amp; "!G:G, ROW(1:1)-1)"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets(1).Range("C3:C7") = Sheets(1).Range("C3:C7").Value</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>This writes the formula into the C3:C7 range and then performs an operation that mimics the
<i>Copy, Paste Special, Values</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Alternately, you can use worksheet functions to return a value directly into the target cell within VBA code like this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sub test2()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim r As Long</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; For r = 0 To 4</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets(1).Cells(3 + r, 3) = Application.CountIfs(Sheets(2).Columns(7), r)</div>

            An integer can be used to refer to the <i>ordinal</i>&nbsp;position of the worksheets. This allows you to bypass worksheet names as the identifier.
<div><br />
