<h2>            Outlook categories not syncing</h2>
                    <p>We have multiple users using Office 2013 on windows 8.1 machines</p>
<p>
</p><p>These users each have access to a shared mailbox (set up as another user on the exchange, then each given full access rights to the mailbox) however recently, following a move to a new machine, one of the users of the mailbox no longer see's the categories
 we set up for managing the inbox, and instead just gets the default categories. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that it can be set up to pull the categories, but everything we have tried is thus far to no avail. Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Why is my Outlook 2010 Sending 2 identical e-mails when send is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> four eyes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my Outlook 2010 Sending 2 identical e-mails when send is pressed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes when I start Outlook is comes up with "Unable to Find folder... etc. Normally correct it just by clicking on my account which includes my e-mail address. A couplr of days ago it became more difficult to clear this. On pressing send it has been
 sending my message to my Outlook datafile sent outbox and NOT my e-mail outbox. When it tries to send from this Outbox the send fails saying there is no internet connection, strange when e-mails arrive without a problem and Internet Explorer is open and working.
 Having to try and work around this has meant moving the sent message for the e-mail to the correct outbox and then sending which works but this then shows 2 identical sent e-mails in the correct sent box with the same time.</p>
<p>Also I cannot seem to get into Account settings on the file menu. Clicking on any of the 3 buttons there does nothing. It is as if it is ignoring the clicks. This is the first time I have ever tried to access these setings.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 64 bit addition Ultimate and Office 2010 professional edition.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your reply. Sorry about not replying sooner, not as much computer time as usual at the moment,</p>
<p>The error message has not occured since I asked the query so I can't give you the exact details. It was not a usual Windows boxed error code with unintelligable reason and a red cross in the corner. It was something to do with a connection to the server
 and all sends failed. They are not failing now. As I can't get iinto the account sttings I can't tell the mail account type etc. It is not a hotmail account just an ordinary e-mail account with Virgin Media.</p>
<p>However, it is still sending 2 identical e-mails for every one sent.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't give you any more info.</p>

<p>List every account you see and its type. </p>
<p>State how you are creating and sending the message. </p>
<p>State where you are seeing "2 indentical e-mails." In your Sent Items folder or does the recipient actually get 2 messages?

<h2>            Cannot recover account</h2>
                    My Skype had been working fine until about two days ago. Then, when I was signing in, it was claimed someone else seemed to be using my account. I tried to recover it, but it had my brothers email (and perhaps his phone number) linked it it! I indicated
 that I did not have those any more. However, no matter what I do to recover my Skype account, the email from Microsoft that I receive claims I was trying to recover my brothers email and won't let me back in! I have used my account for years and never had
 any trouble like this before.

<h2>            I have 2 Microsoft 365 accounts I would like to merge</h2>
                    I have had both a personal and a business Microsoft Office 365 exchange account and would now like to merge the two due to no longer needing the business account. In fact, the email under which it was registered will be eliminated at some point. I have
 found no resolution that is clear to me. I admit I'm not a tech person, but I can usually troubleshoot my own computer issues. A second issue (should I ask under a separate query?) is that I cannot get my icloud email account added to Office 365. The error
 message is that my icloud settings are out of date. I have tried updating with no luck. Hoping somebody can help!<br />

            Dear VvBb-55,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately there is no option to merge 2 accounts. You can only add a connected account to your personal Microsoft account. Sorry.
<br />
<br />If you want to connect another account to your Outlook.com then please follow steps in this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-your-other-email-accounts-to-outlook-com-c5224df4-5885-4e79-91ba-523aa743f0ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-yo...</a>

            Hi VvBB*55
<br />You can obtain a PST from the business account and import it into the personal account.
<br />One option is:
<br />*To configure the two counts in local Outlook
<br />*Obtain the PST from the business account: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-Outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export...</a> 
<br />*Import the PST obtained in the personal account: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-email-contacts-and-calendar-from-an-Outlook-pst-file-431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import...</a>
<br />
<br />To migrate your mail to Office 365 you can go to the administration portal of Office 365&gt; Setup&gt; Data Migration

<p>MS treats "Business" and "Consumer" as 2 totally separate product families. While there are some shared elements, like most of the Office applications, there are fundamental differences in some seemingly similar products.&nbsp; Email, Outlook vs Exchange, is
 one, Cloud file storage, OneDrive (consumer) and SkyDrive (Business), is another to name just 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately MS still has not been convinced that people would ever want to move from Business to Consumer, or visa versa. So they have not bothered to create an automated process to migrate a user from one to the other. That forces us to do it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have been given suggestions for moving email.&nbsp; The other remaining major category is files store in the cloud, OneDrive vs SkyDrive.&nbsp; You have 2 options there. You can open each in a separate tab or browser session, then drag files from one to the other.&nbsp;
 Or if you can't get that to work, you could copy from one cloud account to your local hard drive (or USB Drive), then copy from HD to the other cloud account.&nbsp; Sorry, it's slow, but those are your options.

<p><font>There are too many things which I didn't liked in this mobile but the main thing which is annoying me now a days is "LOW DEVICE MEMORY".</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Apps: <u>5 Mb</u> [Can't move or delete]</font></p>
<p><font>Gallery: <u>2.3 Mb</u></font></p>
<p><font>Messaging: <u>541 Kb</u></font></p>
<p><font>Free Memory: <u>186 Kb only</u></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I have tried all possible ways to free up memory but I was only able to delete four wallpapers from phone memory. All my data is obviosly in memory card.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Then I have talked with Customer Care Executive and he told me all the things that I knew already like restoring and all. If the phone memory is very less you must have an option to move default apps from device memory
 to memory card.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I just wish to slap the developer of this mobile.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I am also an nokia user and I am totally disappointed with the worst facilities of my Newly bought C2-03.<br />
1) It doesn't support streaming, only you tube videos can be played via Bolt browser(
<a href="http://www.boltbrowser.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.boltbrowser.com</a> ).<br />
<br />
2) It has a superb low phone memory.<br />
<br />
3) Maps preloaded but not accessable.<br />
<br />
4) A low speed network connectivity. Connect to only 9kb/s when a Samsung SGH M-200 Phone connects to 46 kb/s!<br />
<br />
5) Nothing solved and no software updates released in 3 months even when the discussion website is having to carry thousands of complains with its software!<br />
Please report that will it be solved?

<h2>            Excel 2016 - Decimal Place Automatically Added - Not Formatted as Number</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to enter ID numbers in Excel which are 8 digits (in format 12345678). When I enter the number, Excel has started adding a decimal place after the 4th digit, so I get 1234.5678. I have never experienced this in the past. When I enter a
 whole number, it has always remained a whole number (regardless of whether or not it is formatted as General, Text, Number etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens whenever I enter the number in a cell, regardless of how the cell is formatted. It also happens regardless of the number of digits that I enter. If I enter 1234, Excel 2016 changes this to 0.1234. This means that I can not enter numbers in Excel
 at all - I even tried to add $50 into a cell and it returns as being $0.01 (the number is 0.005, converted to 2 decimal places).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem makes things quite difficult. I initially noticed it in a spreadsheet that I was working on this morning (btw - it did not do this last week). I have opened a new workbook and am experiencing the problem in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, with ID numbers, this problem makes things like vlookup impossible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using version 15.13.1 running on the latest Mac OS 10.10.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p />

    <title>Why does IE9 split images in two when printing instead of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jreality  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does IE9 split images in two when printing instead of intelligently placing the image onto the next page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I print using IE8 (older version of IE) , on an older&nbsp;Vista Machine, images always get intelligently placed onto the next page if there isn't enough room to display the image on the current page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Images never got cut in half (except maybe if the image
 was actually bigger than a page)</p>
<p>When printing with IE9, on a newer&nbsp;Win 7 machine,&nbsp;images will now get cut in half, with half the image on the current page, and half on the next page.&nbsp;&nbsp; My settings look the same in both versions.&nbsp; For example, shrink to fit is checked on both versions.</p>
<p>Is this a BUG that IE9 is cutting images in half that would not be cut in half with IE8, and if, so when will it be fixed?</p>

            <p>EDIT: The driver has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Here's the proof:&nbsp; It happens with both PDF995 and Microsoft&nbsp;XPS Document Writer when using IE9.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using IE8,&nbsp; with these same 2 drivers, an image is&nbsp;intelligently placed on the next page if there isn't room on the rest of&nbsp;the current page to display the image.&nbsp; IE9 just divides the image.&nbsp;

<p>I sure hope MSFT fixes this BUG in IE9.&nbsp; Either that or this is a removal of a damned good feature&nbsp;that exsted in IE8 which was to prevent images from being divided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you work for MSFT, please report the bug and ask the programmers to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The driver I use is&nbsp;PDF995, and I'm using it on the Vista machine as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use it to print to a .PDF and it is very frustrating that IE9 now divides images.&nbsp; I doubt the driver has anything to do with it, since FireFox on Vista divides images but IE8 doesn't with the same driver.&nbsp; I think it's an IE9 bug, and I'd like to see
 MSFT fix it. </p>

            Further proof it is a BUG.&nbsp; If I go into developer tools (Tools&nbsp;- F12 Developer Tools) and set the Browser Mode to IE8, the problem goes away, and printed images are intellgently placed onto the next page if there isn't any room left on the current page.&nbsp;

<h3> shawn87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Forward Tasks &#38; Current Ownership</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was wondering if anyone has come across the problem of current ownership of a task in Outlook 2013. In my organization we assign a task to a supervisor of a department, and that person usually re-assigns that task to someone under them to complete
 the task. I have tested it with three different users and have come up with multiple conclusions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question. What is the proper procedure of forwarding a task and allowing the original assigner to see who currently owns the task and if it has been completed or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to find a solution and cannot find the exact issue I am having which is, the original owner only sees who they assigned a task to. Not the status of who owns it down the line. It can be done, but since I am new to tasks myself, I would like
 a proper procedure to test and forward to those who are having difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Make sure you are subscribed to all your folders. Sometimes people have folders that they made and forgot about, or they have a rule that saves items into a folder that they are no longer subscribed to. I've seen some people with thousands of messages
 in a folder they didn't even know they had.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you select peak/off-peak, you can also select the times for when they take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ie-if you select peak to be normal business hours, then you would have it set for m-f, 8am-6pm and you can make the settings for that "peak" time to automatically check for different time frames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>off-peak would be all other times, and usually is for after business hours, where you can make the settings pertaining to that period, ie-manually sync, or diferent time intervals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you want it to stay connected, it will be using not just data, but battery power, for this just make sure you select it to always be connected, otherwise, if you choose 5-15 minutes, in order to reduce data and battery usage, the longer of the intervals
 would be better choice.</p>

<h2>            outlook.com POP3 server&#47;service outages &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed regular issues lately with the POP3 outlook.com server/service. Specifically with the incoming eMail server "pop-mail.outlook.com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason I am not able to get emails from my outlook.com account to outlook 2013 desktop client.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a time out error message 0x8004210A which I am unable to overcome ( tried increasing the time out threshold, disable antivirus/firewall...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is internittent ( one day it works, the other it doesn't ). It resolves by itself , pointing to an unreliable service...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there known issues with the POP server/service ? Are there alternate incoming mail servers ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect to outlook.com and check eMails from a web browser but I need to get it to the outlook desktop client...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>A third-party program can sometimes cause this error message on your Outlook.com account with POP3 email server configured. Just to verify, are you using a router for your Internet connection? If yes, we suggest that you turn off and back on the router to
 further isolate the concern if the problem caused by the interference of the Internet connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that it doesn’t work, we recommend that you check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/813514/error-occurs-when-you-send-or-receive-an-email-message-in-outlook-or-o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. It discusses most of the common errors and known troubleshooting steps in Outlook send and receive concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of your troubleshooting. </p>

<p>Hi Genevieve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tx for your feedback. I'm using other POP email accounts and they work just fine when outlook.com seems down so I don't think the issue has to do with my local configuration. I knew about the article you refer to and had already tried those suggestions without
 success. I'll keep searching for resolution alternatives...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My configuration is set properly. Today for example the POP3 communication between my outlook desktop client and outlook.com works well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is why is it not working well every day while nothing is changing in my local config and POP3 emails from other providers work well even when the outlook POP3 environment seems down ? Clearly the issue is not on my side...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is there a web site reporting on outlook.com POP3 service outages like there is for outlook 365 ?</p>
<p>- Is there an alternate POP3 incoming server option or 'pop-mail.outlook.com' is the only one ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p>

    <title>How to find cause of SPAM filtering&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to find cause of SPAM filtering&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Are there any admin tools that allow me to determine exactly why a message was caught by the SPAM filter and sent to junk mail? I can see that some legit e-mails from one external sender are being caught in SPAM, but the mail trace tool does not seem to
 tell me why the message was filtered, and I'm just left guessing. Advanced SPAM filtering options are all turned off, and the filter settings are set at lowest priority.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any input.</p>

<p>Hi Myles,<br />
<br />
Firstly, whether a message is determined as spam could be related to multiple factors including spam filtering, transport rules or some other settings. So there are no exact tools for an Office 365 admin to achieve your requirement.
<br />
<br />
Then about whether a message is determined as a spam in Office 365 Exchange Online, there is a SCL (Spam Confidence Level) rating assigned to each message when it goes through spam filtering. This SCL rating helps determine whether a message is spam. If the
 SCL value is 5 or 6, this message is considered as suspect spam. If the SCL value is 7, 8, or 9, this message is considered as high confidence spam. Users can view the SCL rating of a message by
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-za/article/View-the-Internet-header-information-for-an-email-message-5665156b-9192-471c-9ae1-47c668e60199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
checking Internet header information for an email message</a> in Outlook client. And here is an article about detailed SCL value for your reference.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200686%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200686%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx</a><br />
<br />
If you want these legit emails from the specific sender not to be marked as spam, you can use
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn798345%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
transport rules</a> in EAC to bypass spam filtering or add this sender to the allow list of the spam filtering. &nbsp;<br />

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, this is due to new Windows Defender options. To eliminate the problem, please follow the below (of course disable instead of enable):

            Its a new feature in Windows 10 1709. For users who might be getting that error, here is how you remove.
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />Also in Windows Defender Security Center
<br />
<br />Open App &amp; browser control
<br />Set 'Check apps &amp; files' to off

            <p>I believe it's some server or FEP/SCEP/server update or configuration/communication issue.&nbsp; We are not seeing this problem with consumer PCs using XP (and no other server-based updating reports except yours)&nbsp;- which is why I feel certain it's a server-side
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the date changed, we'd be overwhelmed with posts/questions/complaints from EVERYWHERE&nbsp;- so I don't think it's an end of life issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend posting your problem in the appropriate TN/MSDN Forums (based on what exactly you have and&nbsp;how you do things)&nbsp;for assistance from experts with those products.</p>

    <title>Lumia 735 - issue with 4G - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ji&#237; svoboda79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 735 - issue with 4G</h2>
                    I bought my Lumia 735 to have LTE/4G connection. I have new nano-sim from my operator (T-Mobile CZ) that suppose to support LTE (at least guys in operator's store confirmed that). Now, the problem is that telephone at most connect via H+, I never seen
 4G icon. We have LTE coverage here and operator support it. Maybe issue is in Settings, however......All Setting --&gt; &nbsp;cellular+SIM --&gt;SIM settings --&gt; Highest connection speed - here I can select ONLY from 2G or 3G. My operator don't know what to do, and I
 am lost. Please, could you help? Thank you.

            <p>Hi. I had this issue too. I went in All settings➡cellular+SIM➡SIM settings➡Highest connection speed. It was on 3G. I changed it to 2G, then again 3G, then again 2G and after this appeared the 4G. Try it. And I hope it will works for you too 😊

            <p>No worries 😊 I am not native speaker as well and by my opinion your English is more then average.</p>
<p>Btw, icon L is now visible so LTE suppose to work.Only strange is that when I tried to find icon's description in Lumia manual an tips the LTE should be represented by icon 4G and not L.I didn't find description/meaning of L icon.

            <p>Hello Jiří Svoboda,</p>
<p>Good to hear that you are now able to use 4G connection.</p>

<p>
</p><p>For an LTE connection, you might see an <strong>L</strong> icon instead of an <strong>
LTE</strong> or <strong>4G</strong> icon.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t sign in to Skype for Business, maximum number of computers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in to Skype for Business, maximum number of computers or devices allowed problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting the message: Can't sign in to Skype for Business, please sign out at another location and try again.&nbsp; You have reached the maximum number of computers or devices allowed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I was having problems with Skype for Mac crashing and trying to sort the problem logged in multiple times, so I'm guessing this has caused the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only device I'm signed into office 365 and skype is my office Windows 10 computer now, but I'm still getting the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of finding out what devices you are still logged into?&nbsp; I've tried changing my office 365 password (via my work network as the 365 account is linked) but this message is still coming up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Justin.</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, some users can still log on Skype for Business after clicking the "OK" button in the error message, please double check it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, please double check if the time settings on your PC is correct, to check it:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Go to a website that shows Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).</p>
<p>2.Go to Setting &gt; PC Settings &gt; Time and Language.</p>
<p>3.Note your UTC offset, and compare your device’s time to that shown on the website.</p>
<p>4.If you need to update your device’s time:</p>
<p>Turn off <span style="font-weight: bold">
Set time automatically</span> and tap <span style="font-weight: bold">Change.</span></p>
<p>Update the time and tap
<p>Try signing in again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, please check if manually enter the server address can work: click options on the sign in page&gt;Personal&gt;Advanced&gt;under Manual configuration enter
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I need gather more information to narrow down the possible cause of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Please provide Skype for Business version. Open another Office app like Word&gt;File&gt;Account, it's like Version XXXX (Build XXXX.XXXX).</p>
<p>2.May I ask where your Skype for Business is deployed? On-premises or online?
</p>
<p>3.Do others in your organization also have the same issue?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo&nbsp;</p>
