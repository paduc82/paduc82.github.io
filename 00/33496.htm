    <title>Remote Desktop connects then Stops after a few seconds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1969michael1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop connects then Stops after a few seconds</h2>
                    <p>I have two Windows 7 laptops.&nbsp; One is running OpenVPN I'll call the VPN server.&nbsp; The other is the Client&nbsp;and&nbsp;goes with me on travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Open VPN is configured on both the Client and VPN Server and I can connect from inside and outside the network with no issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 also have an Open VPN Client with a different port configured on a QNAS server.&nbsp; I can also connect to it with no issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to run the OpenVPN Server on a separate VLAN to prevent users from seeing my internal network and only see another NAS.&nbsp; I also use the VPN to provide our small amount of users (3) the ability to connect and utilize my static IP.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a TP-Link ER-6120&nbsp;router.&nbsp; I can configure the three ports to run in 3 separate VLANS.&nbsp; When I configure the VPN Server to run on VLAN2 and my regular network to operate on VLAN1, I can still connect to OpenVPN and everything I want it to do works
 (NAS and Internet access with my static IP).&nbsp; However, when I try to establish a Remote Desktop Session to the VPN Server laptop, I get the login and&nbsp;enter my username and password.&nbsp; I see the Remote Desktop Window open and usually see the remote desktop wallpaper
 and desktop icons load.&nbsp; Then it hangs.&nbsp; If it makes it to the point I can see the desktop, it will automatically attempt to reconnect.&nbsp; If it doesn't make it that far, it stops with a window that says the Remote Desktop Connection has been disconnected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go back into the router configuration and change the VLAN configuration so the VPN Server is back on the same virtual network, I can connect and the Remote Desktop Connection is successful as long as the Client is on my network.&nbsp; If I connect the Client
 to VPN Server from outside my network in this configuration, the remote desktop still fails in the same manner described above.&nbsp; I also have a QNAS on my network that has OpenVPN configured and operational.&nbsp; If I connect the Client computer to the QNAS, I
 can connect to the VPN Server until the VPN Server is placed back into its own VLAN.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, remote desktop connections from local computers work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, remote desktop connections from remote computer off network start to work, but are stopped during login.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; - I have pinged the VPN Server throughout connection attempts and never lose connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; - I have used telnet to go to the VPN Server port 3389 and it connects.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; - I have disabled firewalls on both sides and have gone so far as to remove Symantec on the VPN Server Side and BitDefender on the Client side to use Windows Firewall on both.&nbsp; Then Disabled Windows Firewall as well and still no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting in Windows I am missing that would allow remote desktop connection on the local network but not allow it when connection from remote locations even though I can ping, telnet and generally access the rest of the network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there maybe a configuration issue on the router side?&nbsp; Router side setup&nbsp;is a pretty simple&nbsp;GUI.&nbsp; I have configured routes for the VPN service and they remain in place (one for the QNAS and the other for the OpenVPN Server).&nbsp; I have configured a static
 route (virtual server) for port 3389 to go directly to the VPN Server IP but that did nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm probably missing something simple but it has now kicked my butt for weeks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

Let's try to power cycle your console. Please hold down the power button on the front of the console for approximately 15 seconds until the power light shuts off. Wait about 60 seconds, then power it back on. Be sure you see the green "XBOX ONE" animation loading
 screen when you power it back up.&nbsp;&nbsp; if this don't help try going to the store and change the unit for a new one.

<p>What's worse, the alarm app can't go off when the&nbsp;speaker is muted or it can go off but the screen doesn't wake up. It should not behave like this as Microsoft says alarm will work when your computer supports InstantGo.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the following information related to the issue:</p>
<p>When do you receive the error message? Is it while opening an app from the Start screen or during the startup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive this message when you start a specific app, it could be an issue with the app. We can use the events that causes such an error message on the computer. We will open Event Viewer and find out if there are events showing up. These events might
 act as clue to the cause of the issue. </p>
<p>Follow the steps to collect the logs under Event Viewer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Start Screen, type in <strong>Event Viewer</strong>. This will bring up the
<strong>Event Viewer</strong> tile, Click to open the event viewer. </li><li>In the left pane, expand out <strong>Windows Logs</strong>. Click on <strong>
Application log</strong> and highlight the first event in the log and use your arrow keys to scroll down.
</li><li>Most of your event will be Information. You may see Yellow Warnings or Red Errors. If you see any red error, you can double click on it to bring it up and copy the contents to a document. You can post events in the next reply.
</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, you may place the computer in a clean boot state and check if the error message occurs again. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that
 occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista.
</p>
<p>Refer to the link to place the computer in a clean boot state and find the application:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Windows 8</strong>”:</p>
<p>You can refer to the section “<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section<strong>: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the alarm app that doesn’t turn on when the computer is in sleep mode or is not awake (unless it supports
<strong>InstantGo),</strong> this is how the app is designed. But, yes the app will turn on when the speaker is in a mute state. You will need to set permission for the app to make it work. Open the app. Press
<strong>Windows+C</strong> keys to open <strong>Charms</strong> bar&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;

    <title>Windows 10 Insider Preview can&#39;t install MSI file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacktinwny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview can&#39;t install MSI file</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Build 10565. I am not joined to a domain.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a program called Tune Sweeper that was installed before the upgrade to Preview Build 10565. There is an update in an MSI file, but when I try to install it, I get an error that says:</p>
<p>The system administrator has set policies to prevent this installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This wasn't an issue before this version of the Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error log says:</p>
<p>The installation of C:\Users\jackt_000\Dropbox\Software\TuneSweeper4.msi is not permitted due to an error in software restriction policy processing. The object cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've researched on the Web and tried a few things. For example, one site suggested to run this command in PowerShell, so I did. The result is listed below:</p>
<div>PS C:\Users\jackt_000&gt; Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | Test-AppLockerPolicy -Path 'C:\Users\jackt_000\Dropbox\Software\<br />
TuneSweeper4.msi' | fl</div>

<div><br />
FilePath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : C:\Users\jackt_000\Dropbox\Software\TuneSweeper4.msi<br />
PolicyDecision : Allowed<br />
MatchingRule&nbsp;&nbsp; : %OSDRIVE%\Users\jackt_000\Dropbox\Software\TuneSweeper4.msi</div>
<p>
</p><p>That indicates that the installation is allowed from that aspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also looked at registry settings, Group Policy, and Local Security Policy, but I don't see anything that seems a likely cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I really have no idea what is going on. I'd like to install this update since I have problems with the current version of the software and have been working with the company for a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

            I also have an HP Envy and had the same problem after installing Windows 10.&nbsp;After installing Windows 10 HP Simplepass (finger print login) stopped working and I had to setup windows Hello with my finger print to use it. This worked for a while but suddenly
 I was unable to login with my finger print.&nbsp; So I uninstalled the HP Simplepass driver then reinstalled it from the HP site (with an updated driver) and this fixed the blinking cursor problem. I assume that there was a conflict btn simplepass and windows hello.
 All is good now though.

 in that club show up either. Xbox support said engineers were working on the problem yet all the other sexy female image clubs are just fine, what’s going on here? Feeling singled out as the new club on the block with 650+ members meanwhile clubs like&nbsp;Beautiful
 Girls, Xbox Hotties, Laser Babes, Sexy Females and others are just fine and still posting. As for content our club reposts images from several of these other clubs as well as post new content, so why would our content be blocked? Customer service confirmed
 no bans or anything on the owner and admin account&nbsp;then the connectivity section said our system was fine but the engineers were working on some social media issues that included some of the clubs. Its been over 7 days now and we’re left feeling hung out to
 dry. I have a&nbsp;service request number.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I have no problem turning off auto renewal. Just go to your profile and turn it off. I know it's kind of annoying to have to do that if you get one months at a time, but it's done because they want to keep you.
</p>
<p>Also, try clearing your browser history/cache as it can help clear up some problems like this.

    <title>My Long Used Acct Suspended due to &#38;quot&#59;payment - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Long Used Acct Suspended due to &#38;quot&#59;payment issues&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>My Three year old XBL account has been suspended(GT: oooh eem gee) due to payment issues. Reading stuff from the Web I've seen since I used a creditcard to buy a XBL subscription if it were to be canceled or max out and I have no good credit card linked
 to my account then it gets suspended even after the fact I was billed for a year subscription 2 months prior. Now my XBL account is suspended for and unnamed amount of time with 10 months of XBL going and I updated it with a new credit card last night which
 hasn't done anything. Would someone please help me!</p>

<p>I had a situation similar to yours before. &nbsp;I had my debit card linked to my account, and it was set to auto-renew. &nbsp;I did not want it to auto-renew, and the only way to cancel the auto-renew was to go through the painful process of calling Microsoft. &nbsp;No
 option on the website or console to disable it.</p>
<p>I had no money on my debit card and didn't want it to get charged, so I took a pre-paid credit card I had and put that on my account, thinking that the charge wouldn't go through, and they'd forget about my auto-renewal and everything would be dandy. &nbsp;Instead,
 even though the charge wouldn't go through, they still gave me the LIVE and kept sending me e-mails that my credit card wasn't working, which I just ignored.</p>
<p>After about a month of that, they sent me an e-mail saying that if I don't put a valid payment option on my account they would suspend it. &nbsp;i paid attention to that. &nbsp;So I went out and bought a 12 month card. &nbsp;I tried to redeem it but couldn't until I put
 a valid payment option on the account, so I put my debit card back on. &nbsp;They told me that they wouldn't charge the card, but as soon as I did they put a 12 month live subscription on it, which pissed me off as I had just bought a 12 month pre-paid card. &nbsp;I
 then had 2 years of LIVE.</p>
<p>Not sure if that helps with your problem, probably not. &nbsp;I would suggest putting a new payment option on the account which you say you've already done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our situations appear to be different as your account was actually suspended, and mine just threatened. &nbsp;Good luck, wish I could help more. Maybe try calling Microsoft.</p>

<p>Go to billing.microsoft.com and see if you've got an outstanding balance. If you do you need to pay that off before you can do anything else. Note that using a pre paid code does not clear the balance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Windows 7 pro, I frequently receive the error message&nbsp; "Failed platform function SetWindowExtEx". When it occurs while attempting to print, printing usually proceeds anyway, but on occasions does not.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have an answer?<br />

    <title>surface pro system aggregator firmware won&#39;t install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve_772  say:</h3>
<h2>            surface pro system aggregator firmware won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>Surface Pro - 64GB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded and installed all Windows updates to include the new firmware. When I restarted the computer to finish installing the updates, the screen showing the Surface logo and "Please wait while we install system updates" was shown. It stayed on that
 screen for over an hour so I shut the tablet down and restarted it. Now, in device manager I see the Surface Pro System Aggregator Firmware has a yellow triangle on it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message says, "This device cannot work properly until you restart your computer (Code 14). Click Restart Computer to restart your computer." I have restarted the computer several times from this prompt and each time it hangs on the "Installing
 system updates" page until I shut the computer off after an hour. I have also tried to restart via the charms bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have verified I have no outstanding system updates to be installed and the driver version and date is 2.3.250.0 on 9/18/2013. I have tried rolling back the driver and then trying to reinstall the firmware update, but it produces the same result. I have
 also tried to uninstall and remove the driver but, again, it leads to the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get rid of this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should also mention that my Touch keyboard no longer works, but it didn't work for a few weeks before this issue came up. I followed the online troubleshooting for the keyboard and eventually got a new one from Microsoft but it still is not working at
 all (no keys, Win button, or trackpad).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Greetings Steve_722,
<div><br />
<div>Sorry to hear about your experience. When your Surface is updating, please do not turn it off, as this can lead to problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can try the following to see if it will correct the System Aggregator Firmware:<br />
<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Power off the Surface Pro<br />
2. Hold Volume Up and the Power button for 10 seconds<br />
3. Release buttons<br />
4. Wait 5-10 seconds<br />
5. Power on the Surface</span></p>

<h2>            Disc Burning Wizard disappears before completion</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. This is a repost from <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/280d3185-d562-49ba-aa2d-cf045a323d75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/280d3185-d562-49ba-aa2d-cf045a323d75</a>, I have a similar problem.</p>
<p>When I tried to burn DVD or CD using Windows Explorer (Disc Writing Wizard), few seconds after start burning, the wizard vanishes without any warning. This is followed by other symptoms:</p>
<ol>
<li>The DVD±RW drive on my laptop keeps spinning indefinitely. (draining my battery)</li><li>The hardware eject button does not work. </li><li>Opening My Computer, right-clicking the DVD±RW drive and selecting "eject" will bring a message box "An error occured while ejecting DVD RW drive (I:)".</li><li>The drive eventually will stop if I shut down or restart&nbsp;the computer, or insert a paper clip to the emergency eject hole.</li><li>If the disc was ejected using paper clip, Windows Explorer cannot burn any more discs unless I restart the computer.</li><li>The disc now useless. </li></ol>
<p>The problem just happens at instant. Last week I was able to burn a CD-R completely,&nbsp;but&nbsp;next&nbsp;CD-R fails. Yes, the second disc was the point where this problem starts and remain unsolved until now.</p>
<p>Here is additional data:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No events at all</strong>, relating to disc burning, were recorded at Windows Events Log. Any error recorded was just about DHCP client, DNS client, or SQLServerAgent.</li><li>No other burning software installed on my computer. </li><li>I do remember when the second disc was being burned at last week story described above, I was closing Windows Live Messenger (clicked the menu "sign out from messenger"). I am using Windows Live Messenger 2011. Also in<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/280d3185-d562-49ba-aa2d-cf045a323d75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">that
 post</a>, he said the problem was solved after uninstalling Windows Live products. Wonder if Windows Live interferes with disc burning because there were no any problems about disc burning even while Windows Live Messenger running in background before last
 week. </li></ol>
<p>I already experienced the same problem in the past several times, and what I usually do was to delete my user account and then recreate it with the same name. This would give me a fresh new registry settings and so on, and disc burning became normal again.
 But it takes nearly one day to restore all my settings and files, including re-setting up outlook, recreating partnership in WMDC, restoring my virtual machines, rebuilding firewall rules, Windows Media Player codec settings, Visual Studio user preferences,
 etc. Too much troublesome, and I hope there are better solutions.</p>

    <title>Workgroup Master Browser Problem and Question - Empty Net Neighborhood - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Workgroup Master Browser Problem and Question - Empty Net Neighborhood Windows 7 64bits workgroup after upgrading last computer yet with Vista 32bit</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>Guys, I need help... I have a client with 6 computers, 5 of them running Windows 7 64bit&nbsp; and 1 that was still on Vista 32bit.</p>
<p>Everything was working fine and all computers could see each other in the Net Neighborhood. Last Friday I remove the Windows Vista computer and upgraded it (clean installation) to Windows 7 and connected it back to the network. When I began to reconnect
 network drives and shares, all net neighborhood of all computers (the new and the other 5)&nbsp; are just showing empty. I still can connect to the shares using the \\server_name\share way but no matter what I do I can't make the computers show up on the net neighborhood
 and this is kind of irritating the client.</p>
<p>It seems that the Vista computer was the master browser and somehow there are no backup browsers available... I've checked browser service in all computers and all of them are started.</p>
<p>How can I make the workgroup computers show again in the net neighborhood? How to force a new master browser and how to check that the backup browsers are fine to avoid the same problem in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you all for any help.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thanks Jack, I will try next Friday evening as I'm quite scared that it can not come back again... :-)&nbsp; I've switched all computers off and on again, the router but not the server and not at the same time. It is really weird. I have the old Vista machine
 with me (what I did was to replace the old vista computer with another one where I installed 7/64&nbsp; - I normally do this as a safety procedure to avoid the famous "I had this in my old system" or "this file was there and it was lost when it was upgraded"...)
 and before rebooting it all I will try to connect it to the network and check if net neighborhood shows up populated again which will point to a master browser problem for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will post the results back but if in the meantime someone else has some other ideas I would be glad to try them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers all</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Master Browser is usually not an issue past XP. I switch computers in out of the Network every day.</p>
<p>Often it is an issue with the Router and how it maintains and refresh its memory. If the Router has a DHCP reservation it is a good idea to use it and assign each computer with it own "Static" DHCP IP (read the Router's extended manual).</p>

<p>Thanks Jack... Something else come to my mind....</p>
<p>I'm using fixed IP&nbsp;addresses for the desktop and server computers since they use a Linksys that sometimes hangs and, although continues to work, stops to assign ip's ( a well known Linksys problem). This way I'm sure that they will always be able to connect
 and work. Using fixed ip's I have to rely in a external DNS (in this case Bellsouth)...can this be an issue to resolve internal network names? The desktops are in a subnet 192.168.2.1~100 (router 192.168.2.1) and the Vista desktop had DHCP on and assigned
 in the range 101~255. What do you think of setting my DNS's to the router address?</p>
<p><br />
Cheers</p>

    <title>Programs Freeze when trying to print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rnielse1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs Freeze when trying to print</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 upgrade from Vista installed when it first came out.&nbsp; Wireless network using D-Link router, one laptop computer on the net.&nbsp; One wireless "All-in-One" printer on the net.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to print from AOL.com messages, trying to print from Adobe (.pdf) files, trying to print excel spreadsheet documents, word documents, emails, and email attachments.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>control p brings up the printer page....default printer is the wireless.&nbsp; Pressing the print button results usually in the MS circle appearing and rotating with no results to the printer.&nbsp; Reclicking on the program next results in the program going white
 and freezing with the annotation it is not responding.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have spent hours on the phone with HP support on the printer, they set a tunnel in the firewall so the programs would go direct to the printer.&nbsp; No appreciable difference in print capabililty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday night they suggested there is a problem with the operating
 system and that it should be reinstalled.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Would that be a correct action to take?&nbsp; </p>
<p>If so, how would I do that without disks?</p>
<p>I did install PC Tools Performance Toolkit and went through the array of scans/items that resulted in saved disk space and speeded up response time.&nbsp; However the print problem persists.&nbsp; Any other thoughts on what might be happening?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to&nbsp;provide clarity on the below:</p>
<p>1. When you state that you are unable to play CD's do you mean that your CD/DVD drive is not working?</p>
<p>2. Can you elaborate if you are facing an issue with the drive or the fact that you cannot play CD's via an app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per your query, &nbsp;I would like to inform that in Windows 10, DVD app has been implemented in order for user to be able to play their CD/DVD's. The DVD app comes free along with the installation of Windows 10 OS provided you fit the criterion below</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Home Premium</li><li>Windows 7 Professional</li><li>Windows 7 Ultimate</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center</li><li>Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center</li></ul>
<p>Soon after you upgrade to Windows 10, the Windows DVD Player app will be automatically downloaded through Windows Update.</p>

    <title>Computer can&#39;t install USB drives. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> accountdied  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer can&#39;t install USB drives.</h2>
                    <p>My operating system is Windows 7 x6. A little more than a month ago there were many updates to windows, many of which failed; which then lead to my computer not detecting the usb drive for my Samsung phone. It worked before all these failed updates and I
 noticed other USB I tried to connect to my</p>
<p>computer failed.</p>
<p>.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b0a015b-c187-42d0-a777-f5999e40857d" height="303" width="541" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/272b506d-5f21-4ec3-9076-5e4e7deaae39" height="299" width="671" /><br />
When I try to update drivers this happens<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eaf7f77a-2b46-4818-9023-149bf20128a0" height="350" width="783" /><br />
For the past month or more, my computer has been updating every single night when I close my computer. Some of the updates are successful but most of them fail.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/155a431e-8d48-4672-b101-da0c621e4a26" /><br />
Which goes all the way down to I believe April 10th when everything started<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e8d7b77-f379-45be-abd0-ac0adc68d164" /><br />
I'm positive that it has something to do with my computer and not the devices because for example when I connect my phone to my sister's computer, it works. I'm not good with explaining so this is the best I could do. It's been really frustrating, I've tried
 everything from uninstalling drives to deleting files from system32..<br />

Usually when I start windows normally I only see SAMSUNG Mobile USB Composite Device.

I'm still pretty sure it has something to do with the windows 7 updates that failed.<br />

<p>
</p><p>The issue may be due to compatibility of the&nbsp;graphics card to the updated system. Can you confirm if you are using Windows 10 version 1703 or 1709? To check it, go to
<strong>settings</strong>, click <strong>System</strong> and choose <strong>About</strong>. This will help us identify the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, w<span>e suggest that you roll back to an older version of your display/graphics driver. Kindly follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the Start menu.</li><li>Choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate and right-click the name of your graphics card, and then select <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, and then select <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After successfully rolling back to the old version of your driver, we recommend that you temporarily hide/prevent a driver update from reinstalling. This is to avoid reinstalling the driver that may be
 causing the issue. To do it, kindly download and run the troubleshooter on this <a href="https://aka.ms/hideupdates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>I can see the standard $60 Game and $50 Season Pass on the Xbox 360 but if I go on the Xbox One I can download both in one package for $100.......</p>

<p>Will this be an option later in the day ? Or do we get a $10 screw job if we download on the X360 ? If so it really isn't a "free" upgrade then. &nbsp;Getting tired of the way Microsoft is handling customers.&nbsp;</p>
