<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93;Can&#39;t seem to unlink Microsoft account from local account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have two user accounts in my Windows 10 PC. I was using only one at first (which was my main). That one then got some problems and errors like (Settings and everything related to it not opening) so I created a second account (which is the current main
 one) and I would like to link my Microsoft account to that one but it tells that the MS account is already in use on this device, and I can't remove it because I cannot open the settings in the first account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been so frustrating looking for some answers here and there but not finding any solution so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would appreciate an urgent help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks..</p>

            Hi Abdulrahman,<br />
<br />
Microsoft accounts can only be tied up to one user profile at a time. One option we have is to use a new Microsoft account on your new user profile. Another option that you may consider is to remove the account from the&nbsp; non-working profile using the credential
 manager program. This is where Windows stores log-in credentials. To access it, type
<strong>credential manager</strong> on <strong>Cortana's search field</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. You should see your Microsoft account under Generic Credentials and delete it from there.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you will need further assistance.

<p>Thank you for your responding..</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the non-working profile, Cortana's search field does not work as well (beside the settings too), so I tried&nbsp;<strong>accessing it through File Explorer -&gt; PC -&gt; Right-Click=&gt;Properties, Control Panel, User Accounts, then Manage Credentials.</strong> But
 there was another problem that every time I click on that, it just crashes and restarts the windows explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried restarting in safe mode, and went with same steps as mentioned above in
<strong>BOLD </strong>font, but when I open the Credentials Manager, it returns this
<strong>Error Code: 0x80070425.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the ERROR CODE above and pasted in Google, and found this:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/0x80070425-error-message-credential-manager-cannot/685040b0-a712-4f8c-a135-cb30a63fa90a</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I could not follow the steps inside the above link because it needed admin permissions and the user account I was trying to resolve the issue at is not an admin. So I logged in from another user account with administrator privileges trying to make
 the non-working user account admin, so I can may follow the steps in the link above so that the Credentials Manager would open there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Google again for quick help on making another user an admin, and I found this method:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Using the shortcut Windows key + R, then type netplwiz</strong></p>
<p>It opened a window and there I found the Microsoft account I wanted to remove in the first place. So I removed it, and then tried to sign in (in the other working account as I did this process in it) and it worked!!</p>

                    I had upgraded to Windows 10 pro from my Windows 8.1 pro way back using the 'get windows 10 app' !! But due to some reasons, I did a full format of my PC and reinstalled my windows 8.1 OEM disc. From then on, I wanted to upgrade to Windows 10 again. And
 recently I did the upgrade process once again through the 'get windows 10' app !! I also heard doing a clean install after the upgrade would be perfect so I did the clean install using the media creation tool (using the USB Flash drive option in it). I did
 a full format of my PC while installing, so it was a thorough clean install !! Now Windows 10 is perfectly working.... !!!! But when I go to 'This PC' , then right click and select 'Properties', under 'Windows Activation', the product ID's last three digits

This is usually due to your Internet Explorer NOT having all its defaults.<br />

</p><p>Will,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the best ways you can improve your PC's performance is by optimizing the hard drive. Windows includes f<span>ə</span>atures to help optimize the different types of drives that PCs use today. No matter
 which type of drive your PC uses, Windows automatically chooses the optimization that's right for your drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be default, Optimize Drives, previously called Disk Defragmenter, runs automatically on a weekly schedule. But you can also optimize drives on your PC manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><strong><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">To optimize drives manually</span></span></span></span></span></strong></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. - Open Optimize Drives by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
<strong><span><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Səarch</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong><br />
(or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
<strong><span><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Səarch</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong>), entering
<strong><span><em><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Defragment&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></em></span></strong> in the s<span>ə</span>arch box, tapping or clicking
<strong><span><em><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Settings</span></span></span></span></em></span></strong>, and then tapping or clicking
<strong><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)"><span>Defragment
</span></span></span></span></span></span><strong><span><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">and optimize your drives</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. - Under <strong><span><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Status</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong>, tap or click the drive you
 want to optimize. (The <strong><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)"><span>Media type</span><em>
</em></span></span></span></span></span></strong>column<br />
tells you what type of drive you're optimizing.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. - To determine if the drive needs to be optimized, tap or click
<strong><span><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Analyze</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong>.<br />
You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows is finished analyzing the drive, check the
<strong><span><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Current status</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong> column to see whether you need to optimize the drive. If
 the drive is more than 10% fragmented, you should optimize the drive now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. - Tap or click <strong><span><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 101, 238, 1)">Optimize.</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong><br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
1st solution by Tim De Baets :<br />
<br />
"You will probably have to reset the media library to get rid of the files in the library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:</p>
<p>- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt."<br />
<br />
by Tim De Baets</p>
<p>============================================================<br />
<br />
Other troubleshooting methods :<br />
<br />
If you reset the library as indicated then try uninstalling WMP 12 and re-installing it.</p>

<h2>            fix problem with Texas Instruments 3.0 exstensible host controller-0.96 &#40;microsoft&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Envy 23 desktop with a 64 bit processing system x64 -based processor. it has 8.00GB of RAM. After I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Home, my CD drive, my USB ports, My printer, even Microsoft games such as their solitaire collection
 are unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the device manager and the Texas Instruments 3.0 exstensible host controller-0.96 (microsoft) &nbsp;has a little yellow triangle next to it. &nbsp;If I click on it an click disable and then enable it will come on for a moment or so and everything is recognized
 by the desktop but it will constantly make these musical tones and then disable itself again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on properties the message that is there is: &nbsp;"Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)". &nbsp;If I check on driver tab I get USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller. Under event it says "device has migrated. If I try
 to update the driver I get "Windows has determined the driver for your device is up to date".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of this If I go to Microsoft Support for Windows 10 it tells me that this page is for Windows 10 and this computer is running Windows 8.1.</p>

<h2>            Cleaning a second-hand laptop and replacing &#34;Windows 10 корпоративная&#34; with Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I bought a second-hand laptop from a dealer in a small shop in Central Asia. It had Windows 10 pre-installed with many other programs including
 MS Office. The main system language was Russian and I wanted to change it to English. Despite following many example instructions online, I failed to change the language to English. Some MS updates failed to install.<br />
<br />
I have even RESET Windows 10 after removing Russian as a listed language... and it still displays in Russian despite Russian no longer being listed as an installed language and choosing English as the main language during reset. The reset caused all the additional
 software and data to be lost with a message that translates as "Your computer was returned to its original state, but you could not delete all your personal files. If you plan to give or dispose of this computer, try to reset again". After the reset, it also
 warned that an update was required to continue working with OneDrive client.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Activation screen for Windows shows that it is activated but is "Windows 10&nbsp;</span><span><span>корпоративная"
 (or Corporate in English - Windows 10 Enterprise?)</span></span><span>. The translation of a message is "The Windows System is activated using your organizations activation service" Hmm.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It has completed a full scan using Windows Defender after installing the latest updates (1.281.943.0). It was clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since the scan, it successfully installed all available updates including KB4054535, KB4132216, KB4103723.<br />
</span><span>Following that it has completed
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">another successful full scan using Windows Defender. Clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, I simply don't trust that this has a genuine version of Windows... and even if it is, I guess it's not a legal version. Is that a
 fair assumption?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What steps should I take to thoroughly clean this laptop and install a trusted version of Windows 10 Home?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Can I just buy Windows 10 Home online and install? Is Windows Defender thorough enough for me to be confident the laptop is clean?</span></p>

            Hey krumike,
<br />
<br />You can install a trusted version of Windows 10 by using the Media Creation Tool.
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows by using the Media Creation Tool, here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You will need a flash drive of 8 GB or larger in capacity.
<br />
<br />From there, perform a clean install and format the drive even, if you wish. As a result of a clean install coupled with formatting the drive, you can be sure it's a fresh install, completely free of any potential threats. Let me know if you run into any issues, and good luck.       
        </p>

<div>If I acquired a used computer, no matter how I got it or who previously owned it --even if it was&nbsp; a relative or close friend--the first thing I would do with it would be to reinstall the operating</div>
<div>system cleanly. That would be especially true if I bought it in a foreign country. You have no idea how the computer has been maintained, what has been installed incorrectly, what is missing, what viruses and spyware there may be, etc. I wouldn't want
 to live with somebody else's mistakes and problems, possibility of kiddy p00rn, etc., and Iwouldn't recommend that anyone else do so either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your choice of course, but in my view, you're playing with fire if you don't reinstall Windows cleanly.</div>

            My instinct is that I no longer trust this laptop. No matter what I do to replace the software (incl. OS) I will never know what hardware has been replaced or added. Lesson learned.

<div>&nbsp;Just set up a new windows 7 64 bit system.&nbsp; When I try to run "set up backup" I get a window that says "starting windows backup - please wait while windows backup starts," but nothing ever happens.&nbsp; Just hangs on that.&nbsp; If I x out, it changes to "canceling"
 and hangs on that.&nbsp; When I ultimately go to task manager to end it, it says not responding.</div>

<p>I do have another backup program installed - Iomega Automatic Backup Pro.&nbsp; I had that on my old xp system, and it transferred when I transferred to the new windows 7 system.&nbsp; The problem is that it doesn't work with windows 7 (which is why I am trying to
 use windows backup.)&nbsp; I tried to uninstall it, but a window opens that says "preparing to uninstall," and it just hangs at that - also not responding.&nbsp; I guess since the program doesn't work with windows 7, neither does the uninstall - or maybe it can't find
 the uninstall log.&nbsp; Is there a way to locate the actual executable that will uninstall Iomega Automatic Backup Pro?&nbsp; Or some other way to uninstall it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I tried Clean Boot and had the same problem even with ALL startup items AND services disabled (other than microsoft services and anti virus - I could not disable antivirus).</p>
<p>Also tried the system check and found no problems.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Info:&nbsp; I booted in diagnostic mode and tried to uninstall.&nbsp; After activating Windows Installer, I tried to uninstall Automatic Backup Pro.&nbsp; Instead of hanging, I got "The InstallScript engine on this machine is older than the version required to run
 this setup.&nbsp; If available, please install the latest versio of ISScript.msi."</p>
<p>So I think the ISScript.msi file is probably newer than that required, not older, but either way&nbsp;the installer doesn't recognize it.&nbsp; Is there a way to uninstall with xp scripts?</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi Warmen92,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may use the Windows CleanUp Utility to remove the third party software for backup. Download the utility from
 the link given below, install and run it and then select from the list of items that application you want to uninstall.</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now check if you are able to use the Windows BackUp Utility. If not then proceed with the next
 step.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may try to run a ‘chkdsk’ for all the drives on your computer and then re-run backup and
 check what happens.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>1.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click
 on Start, type ‘cmd’ in the start search bar.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>2.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Select
 Command Prompt from the list given.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>3.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>At
 the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>4.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Chkdsk
 /R X:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> In this command, X: is a placeholder that represents the drive letter
 of the volume that you want to check.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>5.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Press
 Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>6.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Close
 all applications, and then restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors, and then
 Windows starts.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>7.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>After
 the computer restarts, repeat steps 1 through 4 for the other volume, and then rerun the backup operation.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For more information follow the link given below.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>Check a drive for errors</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi warmen92,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You did mention 'system checks', are you referring to SFC scan by any chance?</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not tried it just yet, you may consider doing so.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>SFC</span></a></span><span>scan
 determines which file is causing the issue, and then will replace the file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You also mentioned that you could not disable your anti-virus software. Could you tell what ant-virus software
 you have installed?</span></p>
<p><span>You may consider following the below steps to disable your anti-virus software and then try back up.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>:

For 1. I did that several times and the driver only appears in one place. When i unplug my phone the driver&nbsp;disappears. For the wizard I am not seeing a USB hardware type. so what do i select for the hardware?

            <p>Your answer confuses me.&nbsp; You have to delete the entry in device manager whilst the phone is still connected.&nbsp; What does the phone manual say about installation procedures?&nbsp; Does it say run their installation software first and only then connect the phone
 to the PC?&nbsp; All my phones have done so.</p>
<p>Is the phone, its operating software &amp; its driver <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Win7-compatible</a> according to the phone maker's support site?</p>
<p><em>For the hardware wizard, call it a Modem or Portable device [the driver installation&nbsp;should actually take care of the details as it installs].&nbsp; Your phone is not a "USB device", it's a phone that is merely connected by USB.&nbsp; But do check those installation
 instructions first.</em></p>

            The phone manual says download HTC Sync and install then connect the phone. I have done this already and it does not work which is why i am here in the first place. I looked it up and on microsofts website my phone is compatible with windows 7 64 and 32
 bit.<br />
<br />
I installed the drivers for the modem and portable device and im still getting an Unknown Device.

            <p>Then the installation of HTC Sync was the stage at which this all went wrong.&nbsp; Uninstall it &amp; start completely from scratch or restore your system to the state it was in before you started [using System Restore or by restoring to a System Image].</p>
<p>There might be better guidance for you on the HTC support site as well.</p>

            <p>I wish that I could, but I too am have the same or very similar problems with updating/installing drivers for my HTC One that would allow it to pair with my win7 pc via Bluetooth. If anyone knows of how I might be able to fix or sidestep this it would be
 greatly appreciated if shared. I even just today got an update from MS which was for a Bluetooth driver (thought to myself, YAY, finally someone who has the power has acknowledged my plight..." but alas no, this driver won't install at all (interesting that
 it came to be via windows update). I read somewhere that, of course, you have to be sure that the phone is connected as a peripheral to your PC when any of this updating&nbsp; or installing takes place. And that is all but intuitive, but that is not the issue here.
 Thanks in advance to those of you out there who help we who are technologically inept (speaking for myself only here) to find our way through this miracle of simplification that life has become since the ubiquitous onslaught of information technology. :)</p>

    <title>Repairing the Operating System from an external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyzc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repairing the Operating System from an external hard drive</h2>
                    <p>My laptop which runs XP was having trouble booting. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time it would start loading the operating system, it would fail, reboot, and try loading it again. This is on an EeePC, and lacks a CD drive, so it would not be possible to access the recovery console via a recovery CD. I tried loading the ISO provided
 by Microsoft on a bootable flash drive, but this did not provide me with the option to repair, only to re-install (an option I did not avail myself of, as of yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the hard drive out, and hooked it up, so I could recover vital information from the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have it hooked up, I am wondering if it is possible to repair the system files, to fix the boot procedure. The config file appears to be intact, but I don't know how to check the veracity of the other relevant boot files, nor how to repair the ones
 that are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to repair the files while connected as an external hard drive, and if so, what steps should I take?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>What kind of trouble? </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your XP version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put everything back together and then before XP starts to load start tapping the F8 key to get to the Advanced Boot Options menu and choose:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable automatic restart on system failure</p>
<p>
</p><p>See below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62e22bbd-9cce-4fbf-a0d4-9003b9c9e3f6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>While you are waiting, make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD (on a USB thumb drive) so you can at least boot on something and get some maneuvering room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what&nbsp; your replies to your previous effort reveal you may be able to fix your system from the Hiren's (you can at least run a chkdsk with error correction).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB flash/thumb stick/drive).<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
You can also easily copy your personal data (documents, images, music) to an external drive.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download the latest version on Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page).<br />
<br />
Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has instructions to make a bootable USB that you can use, but it requires you to first burn the .iso to a CD and some other steps, so I suggest another way and here's how:<br />
<br />
Download RUFUS 1.4.x or whatever the latest version is from here (read some stuff on the page so you can know more about it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a><br />
<br />
I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is!&nbsp; This part always makes me a little nervous, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Launch RUFUS and all the defaults should be okay, for the Device, choose your USB drive letter, Quick format, FAT32, label it if you want to and in the Format options box, click the little icon that looks like a CD and a window will open.&nbsp; Navigate that dialogue
 to point to the folder that contains the Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso that you unzipped earlier and the box should change to say ISO image (RUFUS understands the Hiren's ISO file).<br />
<br />
Double check you have the right Device selected in the top (NOT you HDD) Click Start, acknowledge the warning and let it finish (it will take a little while) as it copies the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hiren's ISO is also good size.<br />
<br />
When RUFUS is done, it will say 'DONE' in the bottom.<br />
<br />
Put the USB stick in the afflicted machine and reset/reboot and press whatever key you need to press to get to a boot menu where you can select the USB as the first boot device (that is F11 for me).&nbsp; If you don't see a boot menu choice, you will have to adjust
 your BIOS to boot from the USB first instead of the HDD.<br />
<br />
When the Hiren's menu comes up, choose the Mini XP Mode and it will start loading (slowly from a USB drive) and eventually you should see a Windowsy looking desktop.&nbsp; You should recognize that part and feel comfortable, but it is not your desktop - it is the
 Hiren's desktop!<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>cmd</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</strong><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</p><p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be
 patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.
</p><p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. The Mastered format works best when you plan to play CD or DVD's you burn on regular<br />
CD or DVD players.</p>
<p>2. RW disks often are problematic even when using the Mastered format when attempting to<br />
play on regular CD or DVD players. Try the RW using the Mastered format if you do not have<br />
and R type disk.<br />
<br />
Which CD or DVD format should I use?<br />

<p>I changed the original administrator user account.&nbsp; However, there are still references on a command line, some folders and in Remote Desktop of the former user name.&nbsp; I already modified the registered owner

<p>&gt; If I create a new admin account and then delete the old one, what is the best</p>
<p>&gt; way to save all the settings and then back them up to the new user? &nbsp;If I</p>
<p>&gt; copy all my favorites and desktop to the new user prior to deleting and then</p>
<p>&gt; restore the files from the deleted account, will the new user have the same</p>
<p>&gt; look as the old one?</p>
<p>&gt; </p>
<p>Eric,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you delete the old user account, you will have an option to "Keep Files". This will save the contents of the old user account user folder to a folder on the desktop of the new user account. You can then
 just copy them over to the new user account folders. This tutorial will help show you how to if needed.</p>

<p>Hello Eric,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are seeing is the reference to the "C:\Users\user name" folder. While you can change the name of the user account and the Registered Owner, you cannot change the "C:\Users\user name" folder name. The
 only way to do this is to create a new administrator account and delete the old one from within the new one.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>It sounds like either a virus has invaded your computer or some sore of Bot that is using your PC as a transmitter to broadcast its messages or itself to other computers. Let me recommend three freeware applications to you that specifically scan for malware
 and bots:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes':&nbsp;<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html</a> .</p>
<p>SuperAntiSpyware:&nbsp;<a href="http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html</a> .</p>
<p>Avast Browser Cleaner:&nbsp; <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Browser-Cleanup/3000-2144_4-75872295.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Browser-Cleanup/3000-2144_4-75872295.html</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI, though you don't download anything like an application or program, the very fact that your online to places like Facebook and Scottrade means that your computer is 'open for business', with information between yourself and dozens of sites being exchanged
 - downloaded -&nbsp;constantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps you out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Elkman,</p>
<p>Sounds like a full blown virus. If you have an antivirus program do a full in-depth scan. If you don't have one I use and recommend Avast Free Edition, download from here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides installed, resident antivirus apps, here are two online scanners that may help:</p>
<p>ESET:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a> .</p>
<p>TrendMicro:&nbsp;<a href="http://housecall.trendmicro.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://housecall.trendmicro.com/us/</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep me posted and let me know how you fare.</p>

    <title>How do I stop my NVIDIA driver from automatically updating without - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nadiaiy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop my NVIDIA driver from automatically updating without turning off windows updates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just as the title states.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem:</p>
<p>The latest NVIDIA driver is not working well. &nbsp;Everything looks blurry so that there is eye-strain while reading on-screen text. &nbsp;I'd like to continue using the older driver which worked wonderfully. &nbsp;Whenever I roll back the driver, however, Windows 10
 automatically updates it to the latest blurry driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm asking for help with:</p>
<p>I'd like to stop this one particular driver from updating. &nbsp;I'd like to have all other updates occur automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Pro.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community. I understand the inconvenience caused and will certainly assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><div>In Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Updates and drivers are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily
 cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>You cannot stop Automatic Windows updates on Windows 10 but you can block certain updates for any particular driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the steps provided by <strong>Rohit Chettri </strong>on the below thread link to block update of a driver software.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player is not installed correctly</h2>
                    <p>whenever i click on a video, i get the message "the file wmploc.dll has a version number 12.0.7601.18840 where 12.0.7601.17514 was inspected.
</p>
<p>Windows Media Player is not installed properly and must be reinstalled.</p>
<p>Do you want to install the player from the Microsoft website." </p>
<p>when i do click on yes. it takes me to Microsoft website but it does not show me where to get the Windows Media Player program. I have down loaded both of the files that are recommended but neither of them are for my machine. any help would be awesome. thank
 you</p>

            <p>Unless you have one of the special Windows 7 N/K/KN versions then those downloads are, as you say, not for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all normal Editions of Windows 7, WMP is a core component and there is no download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging from your description of the problem, I think you need to "unload" then "reload" WMP.&nbsp; This is virtually the equivalent of uninstalling then reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Unload WMP - Control Panel, Programs and Features, [left-hand side] Turn Windows features on or off, Media Features, clear Windows Media Player checkbox, Yes, OK, Restart
