<h2>            Cannot get Word 2007 to print all lines on the document</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: Printing issues with 2007 Word</strong></p>
<p>I have Office 2007 running with the Windows 7 32bit system. Cannot get Word 2007 to print all lines on the document. Have downloaded the new drivers for my HP Photosmart C4580 printer. Downloaded the Office 2007 service pack 3, but still the same issues.
 Excel spreadsheets print ok as do PDF files. I have tried different fonts in Word 2007 but still cannot get it to print correctly. Help</p>

            Tried this. It gets me closer ie more lines print, but still some only half print (half height that is). Also every other line prints bolded but bold is not selected.

    <title>Disappearing photos taken with Nokia Lumia 820 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disappearing photos taken with Nokia Lumia 820</h2>
                    All of the photos that I have taken since I got my phone a couple of years ago have disappeared. The photos were on my phone Sunday night and then on Monday they were gone. I did not delete or move anything. Was there an update that could have gone haywire?
 My Windows phone is a Nokia Lumia 820 from At&amp;T with Windows Phone 8.1 software &amp; OS version 8.10.12393.890. I didn't turn on One Drive or Cloud backup until after this issue occurred. I did have the option set to store new photos on my SD card. This option
 has been selected for over a year since I was running out of memory on my phone and also, lately, the space remaining on my card was getting low. Could the card be too full to show any photos? . I have connected phone to computer to try to locate photos but
 &nbsp;no luck. I have also taken the SD card out of phone and inserted it to computer to try to access the photos but no luck. What has gone haywire with my phone and where are my photos? Please help...

</p><p>There are <span><strong>picture recovery software&nbsp; </strong>
available which you should download</span></p>
<p><span>Essentially you only kept <strong>ONE </strong>copy of each photo, they were?
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unique</span></strong>&nbsp; as such you are&nbsp;susceptible to TOTAL LOSS, &nbsp;whatever the&nbsp;root cause for the loss.
</span></p>
<p><span>In addtion I note&nbsp;they were not saved to the computer either!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should the </span><span><strong>picture recovery software
</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">be successful you do need to take ACTIVE steps to have MULTIPLE copies of these items.</span></span></p>
<p>

    <title>Message Status has Red Cross X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon mactech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Message Status has Red Cross X</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a customer which uses Microsoft Outlook 2011, latest version.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They check there email via an IMAP account on three devices. iMac and Macbook Air and iPhone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything is working well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the iMac when we view the Deleted items some messages (it seems to be random messages) have a red cross X in the message status column. When you check the same Deleted items (mailbox) on the MacbookAir there is no Red Cross. The messages would have
 been moved to the deleted items folder from the iMac as this is the main computer used.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The messages appear to be fine and are showing OK.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question is what is/does the Red Cross mean why is it there?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked the forum and elsewhere but cannot find an answer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My customer uses the Deleted Items as a storage folder and refers to it from time to time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Simon</div>

            Thanks for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>How do you 'undo' a message that has been marked for deletion? (to make it just a message in the deleted items folder?)</div>
<div><br />
<div>How do you make a message change from just being in the deleted items folder to being in there with a red cross and 'marked for deletion'? As my customer has no idea what he did differently.?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If on an IMAP account where the account is 'synced' with the server how come the exact same message on his laptop is not 'marked for deletion'?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Changing logo in Powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sallotape  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing logo in Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have about 200 powerpoint presentations, each with one slide in. We are using these as information data sheets rather than presentations. (Don't ask me why)</p>
<p>They all have the same layout but each with a different picture and description. The problem is, at the bottom of all the slides is the same logo, which I need to delete.</p>
<p>Other than opening each powerpoint file (over 200) and deleting the logo on the master slide, is there a quicker way of doing this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hi there,</p>
<p>The presentations are each in their own folder (one single&nbsp;file in each folder) which are all in one bigger folder, if that makes sense. So 'BIG FOLDER' &gt; 200+ 'SMALLER FOLDERS' &gt; Powerpoint folders (some have 1 in, some have 3 etc)&nbsp;&gt; Single slide.</p>
<p>The logo&nbsp;is exactly the same place on each and the same size. There is also&nbsp;the same&nbsp;logo to the right of the page which is floating off the actual page for some reason!

<h3> francesco nl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 doesn&#39;t show the content of some folders.</h2>
                    <p>I have imported many folders and emails from our previous mail server (exchange 2003) to office 365 for business.</p>
<p>In OWA (office 365) all the folders show correctly with their content. </p>
<p>But we have a problem using outlook 2016. Here, all the folders show correctly, but not the content.</p>
<p>On just few folders, the emails are not visible.</p>
<p>I tried to removed the account and creating it again, downloading all the email again, but the same few folders give me the same problem. Emails are not visible and these folders looks empty while you can see these are not from OWA.</p>
<p>Most of the folders show correctly their content.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I setted to keep offline all the emails and the cached mode is turn on.</p>

            <p>Hi Francesco NL,<br />
<br />
Since OWA can show all content in the folders, Office 365 for Business online services work fine.<br />
<br />
To check if the emails are downloaded, please check the size of the folder.<br />
Here are the steps:<br />
1.<span> </span>Right click the folder.<br />
2.<span> </span>Click Properties.<br />
3.<span> </span>Click Folder Size.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8235930a-7abe-4d8b-84a3-d045484c5d1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8235930a-7abe-4d8b-84a3-d045484c5d1b" /></a></p>
<p>If the size is not correct, the folder is not update to date, please wait more time to check again.<br />
If the size is correct, it’s a display issue.<br />
Please mark an item as unread in OWA and check if it will sync to Outlook, you can click Unread in Outlook client to see the unread emails only.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68d703ec-bedc-44d0-8ac0-670b93465b4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68d703ec-bedc-44d0-8ac0-670b93465b4e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since you have removed and re-added the account in Outlook, you can add the account in another fresh workstation to check if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the answer Franky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the size of the problematic folders. Everything looks fine, same size on outlook 2016 and the server. So, as you said, looks like the emails are there but not showing. I marked some emails as unread in OWA and I got the correct number in outlook
 2016 close to the name of the folder in the left tree, but still no emails showing on the list, even changing from all to unread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try on a different workstation, but I have this problem on two different accounts/pc of our organization, so it's an issue not confined to one machine only.</p>

            Hi Francesco NL,<br />
<br />
Since the size of the problematic folders is fine, I suggest you run <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant tool</a> to check how it works, and provide the logs if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Also, let me know the result on a fresh workstation (ideally use non-domain joined workstation) when you have time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Franky

            <p>Hello Franky, thank you for the support.</p>
<p>I installed outlook 2016 on a fresh workstation and I got the same result, exactly the same folders didn't show their content. But I realized that on the status bar, those folder was giving me a filtered status. I then find out that going on the menu&nbsp; View
 -&gt; Change Views, the same problematic folders was marked as "Hide..". I switched to "Compact" and I can finally see every emails in every folders.</p>
<p>No idea how those folders got the "Hide" status during the import procedure.</p>
<p>Anyway, the problem is solved now.</p>
<p>Thank you again, your suggestions drive me to the right way.</p>

<h3> martenm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint deletes metadata in images on upload</h2>
                    <p>In my organisation we have a lot of images stored in our SPO intranet. Until recently, it has worked perfectly.
</p>
<p>But lately I've noticed that the image metadata is deleted when images are uploaded. This applies to all metadata - title, keywords, copyright and so on, all is lost on upload.</p>
<p>In the images, we create metadata in Photoshop or in Windows explorer (right click - properties - information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue, and is there a fix?</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Yes, I still see the image metadata for older images.</p>
<p>I have double checked this against other image/document libraries, and the issue occurs in all libraries in all sites/subsites.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BUT </strong>since my post, I have double checked the newly uploaded images, and the issue actually seems to be another one:
<em>the image metadata is still there, but Sharepoint does not show it.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the older image, nyckelbandbrfarosa.jpg</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d87610b-15a5-44ce-b1b9-8a2b712f94d4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d87610b-15a5-44ce-b1b9-8a2b712f94d4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the image, renamed it to nyckelbandbrfarosa2.jpg, checked that the metadata was there ...</p>
<p>If I double check this file against for example&nbsp;http://metapicz.com all the metadata is there.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/379f3839-4495-4c64-ae0b-85f18a2b5dc8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/379f3839-4495-4c64-ae0b-85f18a2b5dc8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>... and uploaded it again. This is the result, as you can see, even "date taken" seems deleted:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/699979d6-5dc3-4fb5-a218-e6fe6923d85b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/699979d6-5dc3-4fb5-a218-e6fe6923d85b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>But then I downloaded this image image nyckelbandbrfarosa2.jpg ... and the image metadata is still there.</em></p>
<p>If I double check this file against for example&nbsp;http://metapicz.com all the metadata is there.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da43afb1-c5d1-4869-b1d3-a1e14ac3e5e5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da43afb1-c5d1-4869-b1d3-a1e14ac3e5e5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most often, I add metadata in Photoshop, but this is what we do when we add image metadata in Windows explorer.</p>
<p>The issue occurs no matter what way I add metadata.</p>
<p>Right click image - Properties</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a59caa66-15ff-4c82-9aba-6f17211bd22e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a59caa66-15ff-4c82-9aba-6f17211bd22e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Information tab, we write the data, then Ok for saving.</p>

 sick of ghost notifications. says I have a notification but when I look, NOTHING. There's alot of loose ends here that need to be tied up. Not ready for general distrubution. Bugs and "anomalies" make the latest build look cheap and half baked. pretty wallpaper
 isn't gonna sell it.</p>

<h2>            Italics doesn&#39;t show up in Films &#38; TV subtitles</h2>
                    Whenever I used closed captions in the Films &amp; TV app, during the italics part of the subtitles it just shows up like html codes and not in actual italics. But it shows up correctly in other apps like VLC etc. I have tested this with numerous subtitle
 files, but nothing has solved this problem for me.

<p>Hello Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I am using version 1809 (OS build 17763.55), but I have had this issue ever since I started using W10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also did the next steps that you recommended. Resetting the app uninstalled the Films &amp; TV and I was able to reinstall it through the store. I ran some movie files and still the problem persisted. Then I made a Feedback Hub feedback along with a screenshot.
 Here is the short link to it:&nbsp;https://aka.ms/AA2yzaw&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to help me with this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<h2>            scheduling assistant adding attendees tab not working</h2>
                    Has anyone else noticed that when you are creating&nbsp;a meeting notice and adding attendees that the tab does not work any more?&nbsp; It used to take you to the next line to add a name but now it jumps up to the Send button.&nbsp; This is a real pain if you have to
 add more names to the meeting since you now have to click on the Add a Name Here line before typing in an email address.&nbsp; Hope Microsoft fixes it back to the tab moving down to the next line.

            Hi Sheryl,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
I have reviewed the whole thread and done some tests from my side. Based on my tests, when using Scheduling Assistant to add users to a meeting, it’s true that the cursor will jump to the Send button when pressing<strong> Tab</strong> on the keyboard. However,
 I can press <strong>Enter </strong>when finishing inputting an email address to continue to type other email addresses. Please try it from your side and feel free to post back if anything is unclear.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

            <p>This is a hard one, because it's affecting all Office applications. Possible causes I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bad Office preferences
<ul>
<li>Quit all Office applications (I know, I know, but it's part of the recipe)</li><li>Go to the Finder</li><li>Press the Option key and select&nbsp;<em>Go &gt; Library</em></li><li>Locate the Preferences folder</li><li>Move all files named "com.Microsoft … " to another folder (yes, let's be radical). You can create a new folder in the Desktop.</li><li>Test the Office applications
<ul>
<li>If they work and you don't want to loose any good preference files, place them back judiciously. For instance, don't put back&nbsp;<em>com.microsoft.office.plist</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Bad permissions.
<ul>
<li>Fire up Disk Utility in&nbsp;<em>Applications &gt; Utilities</em>&nbsp;and repair permissions in your hard drive.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li><span>Duplicate fonts</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Office is duplicate-intolerant. Open Font Book in Applications and make it look for duplicates. Alto tell it to validate fonts, just in case.</span></li><li><span>If any are problems are found, disable those fonts. That may not be enough to coerce Office into proper behavior and duplicate deletion may be required<br />
</span></li></ul>
</li><li>When you last updated, did the update complete as planned? If not…
<ul>
<li>Try to reapply the update. For this, you'll need the .dmg file. If you no longer have it, download it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">here</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;(find a
 list at the end of the page).</span></li><li>If that fails to fix Office,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/mac/office-2011-digital-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">download Office</span></strong></a>&nbsp;and run the installer.</li><li>If this fails as well, you'll need to uninstall (there are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2011-from-a-Mac-ba8d8d13-0015-4eea-b60b-7719c2cedd17?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">official
 MS instructions</a></strong></span>&nbsp;for this) and install again.<br />
</li></ul>
</li><li><span>Have you recently installed any software that could be considered system-wide (i.e., usable from more than one application)? If so, it may be affecting Office.</span>
<ul>
<li>To check this, restart your Mac while pressing the Shift key. Release it when you see the gray thermometer. (This is called Safe mode and will load a reduced set of fonts, add-ins, etc.)</li><li>Test the Office applications.
<ul>
<li>If they work, you'll have to locate a newer version of the problem-causing software (and I don't mean Office).</li></ul>
</li><li>Another way to test for this possibility is to create a new user account and test Office there. If it works, then something is affecting only your regular account. However, if there is any system-wide problem software installed, it will also affect the
 new user.</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>            15.22 outlook for mac font issues</h2>
                    
<p>One of my colleagues is having an issue with Font size since updating to Outlook version 15.22 for Mac.</p>

<p>When font style is set to Times New Roman and font size is 14 sending an email to a recipient the font size appears a lot larger then intended. I can confirm this has only started happening since the 15.22 update. Will there be a resolution for this???</p>

<p>As a work around i have had to set her email font size to 12 and that appears to show on the recipients email as normal. We are a company and like to have everyone set to the same font style and size so a resolution to this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>hi marcus,</p>
<p>based on the description, i understand that after setting the font style to times new roman and font size is 14, the font size&nbsp;appears to be larger.</p>
<p>i ran a test with my outlook for mac 15.22 and couldn’t reproduce the issue. so, to narrow down the root cause of the issue, i’d like to collect some information:<br />
1.&nbsp;a screenshot about “<em><strong>the font size appears a lot larger then intended</strong></em>”. to send a screenshot, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> &gt; <strong>insert</strong>/<strong>edit media</strong>.</p>

2.&nbsp;did this issue happen only to one user inside your organization?<br />
3.&nbsp;to determine if this issue is related to her office 365 account, please ask her to set up the office 365 account into another outlook for mac 15.22 to see if the same issue persists.<br />
4.&nbsp;what if you set up another office 365 account onto the outlook for mac 15.22 of the problematic user? did the same issue happen?</p>
<p>i do appreciate your time and efforts.<br />

<p>Hi Marcus &amp; Robin,</p>
<p>Most of these behavior changes are due to changing the editor to be based on Word vs. WebKit. This switch was made to accommodate highly requested functionality such as inserting tables, resizing images, etc. &nbsp;Due to differences between Word and WebKit,
 changing the editor did have some impact on previous behavior.</p>
<p>The article here gave some hints on formatting using the new editor.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Format-email-messages-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-cb35806b-4174-41d2-9cba-b6b624d988b3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Format-email-messages-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-cb35806b-4174-41d2-9cba-b6b624d988b3</a></p>

<p>I've same problem with Office 365 15.22 and OS 10.11.5. MacBook Pro retina. </p>
<p>I can read an incoming mail fine - &nbsp;the fonts are appropriate size on screen. But doing a Reply, or a Forward with comments, the displayed screen fonts are super tiny in the pane. Not readable. Even though the text is to be formatted at say 14pt, and it
 shows that in the ribbon, the screen rendering is maybe 6pt. </p>
<p>If you do a command + to be able to see the text, it increases the font size in the outgoing message to be comically huge (even though they're just barely large enough on screen to read).
</p>
<p>So command+ to be able to construct a Reply and then again command - to shrink it down before sending isn't a realistically a work around.
</p>
<p>I ran a utility, Onyx, to clear Microsoft's font cache, but that didn't help. </p>
<p>Is there a way to downgrade to an earlier version - until Microsoft fixes this?</p>
<p>Yes, I did read the article. No, that didn't help. Yes, I did try differing Fonts in Preferences. No, this didn't help. Yes, I did try differing font Pts in Preferences. No, this didn't help.</p>

<p>Found this forum *user* suggestion to roll back to 15.19.1. &nbsp;Not from any of the Microsoft moderators.
</p>
<p>I trashed the Outlook application, then launched this "updater" and 15.19.1 was installed. This seems to be the temporary fix: &nbsp;support.microsoft.com/.../3134241</p>

    <title>Excel Monthly averages for projects with staggered start&#47;end dates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Monthly averages for projects with staggered start&#47;end dates</h2>
                    <p>I have no idea is this is the place to ask, I've rephrased my question to google in a multitude of ways, and I haven't found an answer, I may be asking incorrectly. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>At the moment I'm manually selecting the average value for all applicable months, but I would like to know if there is a way to use the below data with a formula that will automatically update my monthly averages between when new projects start and end.</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Start Date</td>
<td>Duration</td>
<td>Project Duration</td>
<td>Value</td>
<td>Average value per active month</td>
<td>Number of Months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>January 12, 2015</td>
<td>913</td>
<td>July 13, 2017</td>
<td>&nbsp;$10,000.00&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;$333.33&nbsp;</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>April 4, 2016</td>
<td>470</td>
<td>July 18, 2017</td>
<td>&nbsp;$1,000.00&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;$66.67&nbsp;</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>May 1, 2016</td>
<td>426</td>
<td>July 1, 2017</td>
<td>&nbsp;$200,000.00&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;$14,285.71&nbsp;</td>
<td>14</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So it ends up looking something like this, but automatically updating when I enter a new project into the above, instead of manually adding cells to the 15 or so months that the project runs.:</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>December 1, 2015</td>
<td>&nbsp;$333.33&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>January 1, 2016</td>
<td>&nbsp;$333.33&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>February 1, 2016</td>
<td>&nbsp;$333.33&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>March 1, 2016</td>
<td>&nbsp;$333.33&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>April 1, 2016</td>
<td>&nbsp;$400.00&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>May 1, 2016</td>
<td>&nbsp;$14,685.71&nbsp;</td>

<h2>            Windows update - WTP Build 9860..</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Dell laptop via laptop. I am having a problem with updating and accessing the store anything that uses [Windows update service] Windows says it is activated, but I am getting an error code: 80072F8F similarly trying to access Store I received
 a similar code:&nbsp; (0x80072efd).&nbsp; Again I checked all services such as bit services, Windows update made sure all running automatically. It seems that the Windows serial number for Windows Preview aren't genuine serial numbers, I just don't know how to resolve
 this issue. Please let me if there is a patch link for WTP and this build or a work around for this solution besides a roll back to previous OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Brian </p>

            <p><span>Hi Brian,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows Technical Preview. I appreciate your efforts trying to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Apart from the issue that you are facing, is the internet working fine?</span></strong></p>

<span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: The article in the above link are meant for windows 8, however, you can use the same for Windows Technical Preview as well.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods below to fix this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can try using the <strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong> to automatically fix some common problems with Windows Update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run the Windows update Troubleshooter:</span></strong></p>

</strong>Fix problems with <strong>Windows Updates.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Manually reset the Windows Updates Components</span></strong><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net stop wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>c) Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>
Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>

<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net start wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net start bits </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>e) Type <strong>Exit </strong>in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now you may try running the Windows Updates again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For issue with windows store and updating the apps, reset Windows Store. Follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to the Start Screen or the Windows Modern UI screen</p>

    <title>N8 SMS &#38;quot&#59;signature&#38;quot&#59; needed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_myers_n8  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 SMS &#38;quot&#59;signature&#38;quot&#59; needed.</h2>
                    
<p>After seeing my N8, a friend purchased a C7 (similar phone, less featuers he doesn't need, lower price).&nbsp; In most ways he is pleased with it, having switched from an iphone, and before that, a Windows 6.1 phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He would like the phone to automatically add something at the end of every SMS he sends.&nbsp; I've been searching for it, and the closest I can come is that "signatures" don't work on the N8, but templates do....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which doesn't solve his problem.&nbsp; He would
 like this to be automated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to do this, or on third-party software that provides this function?</p>

<h2>            Macros in this project are disabled</h2>
                    <p>Created templates and assigned macros to new ribbon commands in Outlook 2010. This all worked perfectly on my old computer (same OL version and Windows OS) but only worked once on my brand new PC (that's when they were created). Having logged out of OL and
 back in, none of them work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried copying the VBA code into a text document, renamed the VBAProject.otm, reopened VB Macro editor and pasted code in from text file - didn't work. I don't want to lower my Macro settings.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We didn't have support for adding tables. We just released 15.22 with new editor and it lays the foundation for us to add support for additional capabilities like tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, the workaround you described is what's available i.e. create table in Word / Excel and paste into Outlook editor. The capability you noticed (copy table and use it to add rows / columns) is enabled because of the new editor.</p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 creates a duplicate copy of deleted emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billmontgomery_70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 creates a duplicate copy of deleted emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded from Outlook 2010 to 2013. Everything went smoothly, except this annoying issue with duplicating deleted emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is when I delete an email it sends it to the trash folder and then, a few moments later, another copy of the same deleted email appears in the trash folder. Essentially, I end up with a bunch of duplicated copies in the trash folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone posted a similar issue on this forum, and a "temporally" solution was provided for the Gmail account.
</p>
<p>I am not using the Gmail, so it &nbsp;won't work in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> dwight godwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sway will not install</h2>
                    <p>I started a download of Sway on my windows 10 Lenovo Edge 15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It down loaded and started the install. &nbsp;About 3/4 of the way through the install it just stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else on my PC runs fine, but I can not figure out how to delete this install from the MS Store and start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(PS - I picked "Signing in to Sway because it forced me to choose an option)</p>

<p>Hi Harsha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran both the Windows store Trouble shooter app and the Background Intelligent Transfer Service app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither detected a problem that could be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is a problem to be sure because now, besides Sway still hanging as stuck, I have two additional updates that appear in the store and are only partially downloaded and stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what other information you would need to be able to help with this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Dwight,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just have a few questions to understand the problem a little bit better:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Can you launch Sway by using the search box? </p>
<p>2 - Does it show up as an installed app when you press the Windows Key + "All apps" ?</p>
<p>3 - If the download is stuck in the Store, can you please include a screenshot of what you see?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi Dwight,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are still having problems. Can you try uninstalling Sway by either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Right click on the Sway entry that appears under "ALL APPS" and click "Uninstall"</p>
<p>2 - Go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Apps and features -&gt; Sway -&gt; Uninstall</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also need to reboot your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a reboot, please try to re-install Sway from the Store and let us know if it goes through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Laura.</p>

            <p>Laura,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too cannot get Sway to launch (running Windows 10 Pro).&nbsp; As you suggested, I uninstalled and reinstalled from the MS Store.&nbsp; Now, Sway launches for one user on the PC, but not the other one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's&nbsp;my PC&nbsp;configuration:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Both user's visible User Folders located on drive D:\ .&nbsp; AppData and other hidden user files remain in their default locations in Drive C:\Users.</li><li>I gave both users Adminsitrator privileges, and it didn't make a difference.&nbsp; One can run Sway from the Windows 10 desktop, the other cannot.</li><li>Both users logged in successfully via the Sway website with 2-factor authenticated Microsoft Accounts, and it didn't make a difference.</li><li>I tried to uninstall in the PC's built-in (hidden) top level Administrator, and it didn't make a difference.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There are two things I noticed:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The account that works is still on the "old" Outlook.com "live" site.&nbsp; The one that doesn't work is on the "new" Outlook.com Office 365 Exchange Server site.</li><li>I might have inadvertently changed user permissions in the C:\User\NAME\ folder that included enabling inheritance, which might have changed a critical permission in the hidden AppData folder.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any advice you can offer.&nbsp; I'd hate to uninstall the and reinstall the user...there are many programs and user folders to configure for sharing and security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your (or anyone's) help!</p>
<p>Laz</p>
