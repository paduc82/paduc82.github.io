<h2>            Surface Pro 4 keyboard problem not recognized, stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I encounter problems with my clear type keyboard.</p>
<p>When the battery of Surface Pro is drained and 0%, after I plug the charger, it starts and the keyboard is working.</p>
<p>After the battery is charged, I shut down the tablet, then I restart and the keyboard is not working.</p>
<p>Be advised, I contacted Microsoft and I was asked to restore and I did so.</p>

            <p>You really don't need to post your issue in 10 separate threads. <br />There are unfortunately many people with this issue (including a neighbor and a<br />friend). For most, the problem occurs after some random Windows Update. My<br />theory is that it isn't a particular update, but something in the update PROCESS<br />that corrupts the firmware somehow. Microsoft has not commented on this, nor<br />have they come up with a fix. <br />If it does not work in the UEFI, no amount of reimaging will fix it. Cleaning<br />the contacts has not fixed this for anyone. <br />The UEFI settings can be adjusted only during system startup. To load the UEFI<br />firmware settings menu:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Shut down your Surface and wait 10 seconds.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Press and hold the volume-up button on your Surface and at the same<br />time, press and release the power button.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The Microsoft or Surface logo appears on your screen. Continue to<br />hold the volume-up button. Rele

<p>I have mine updated as of today, and my windows 10 version is now windows 10 pro 1809, OS build 17763.615</p>
<p>
</p><p>after the last update i did this morning, after not using the surface pro 3 with my type-cover for sp4 for a while, it now works well and all is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did a reboot, shutdown and start-up, and sleep, and hibernate. i also let it sleep for a while, and turned on, and the keyboard is now working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did remove and reconnected the keyboard and it still works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i hope this stays the same. i don't know what caused it, but i sure hope its really all fixed and well now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the go-to uefi method explained by Barb did help me in the past, but after the sp3 goes to sleep-then-wake up, the keyboard goes missing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really think its to do with the detection of the keyboard within the bios or firmware etc. i don't know enough about the internal systems, and i really think that if the drivers for surface touch cover filter device does not load, the keyboard will not
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my current driver is 1.1.504.0, dated 23-mar-2017.</p>
<p>the driver somehow got installed on 29-mar-2019, but i think there is something else in the system that calls for this driver to load when the magnetic buttons establishes its connection from keyboard to the surface pro.</p>

    <title>My Windows 8 download hangs at 96&#37;. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chriscacciatore  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows 8 download hangs at 96&#37;.</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased Windows 8, but have had a difficult time getting the .ISO file from the downloader. Every time I try to download the file the downloader hangs at 96%. Instead of an estimated time until finish, it says "please wait..." under the download
 status. I have tried to reboot my computer and closing all other programs besides the installer, but it has yet to yield any results. I know the easiest way to resolve the issue would be to purchase the Windows 8 DVD, but the additional $14.99 is outside my
 current economic means... I would really appreciate any help in solving the issue, the loss of $40 is not something that I can deal with at the moment. I am currently running Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 and have an Intel i7 CPU @1.73GHz with 6GB of RAM and
 a 64 bit Architecture.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<h2>            activation after hardware change</h2>
                    I got a new motherboard and power supply for Christmas, and threw them in yesterday. I didn't change or reset the ssd's, windows did its little driver update thing for 2 minutes, and loaded in. all was well, but now I get this annoying note telling me
 to activate windows. I went through the activation troubleshooter, it shows my laptop as an active device, but I have to click "see other devices..." and under "unsupported version" is where I see my desktop a couple days ago. I didn't change from windows
 10 home, why is the 2 day ago version unsupported and unable to load in now? I use this computer to game on nightly, and never had an issue until today.&nbsp;

            Hi Kyle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you changed motherboard it made it new hardware which involves a procedure to move the activation:  
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license you upgraded or that came with WIndows 10 is retail and not factory preinstalled or builder's OEM, then it can transfer since Upgrade inherits the rights and restrictions.  
<br />
<br />But did you buy the key from Microsoft or a major retailer who backs their sales so you know it's genuine?  Any discount key is most likely bogus.  See here How to Tell:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/defau...</a>
<br />
<br />The procedure is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />Another thing that sometimes works for free Upgrade is to input at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key   the Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key that was upgraded from.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span><span>I purchased my key, and it has worked since December 13, 2016. It worked 2 days ago on the old motherboard. But now when I plug it all in, and go through the “activation troubleshooter”, I do not
 see this computer listed. So I click more, and find it under “unsupported version”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A bogus copy of windows would not be running for 2 years and would not pop up as linked to my account, I wouldn’t think. Maybe I’ve exceeded the amount of times I can reload this product key on this
 computer, but still. To change a motherboard as a Christmas present and be forced to buy a windows product key again, really sucks.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I tried those options, and support wanted to send me to sales to buy a new product key. It just really sucks to see “unsupported version” as the last version on this computer, and have to eat $139

            There is no limit on how many times you can reload Windows. 
<br />
<br />You said you bought a retail key.  But where did you buy it?  If it was a discount key these are never legit because there are no discounts in retail Windows 10.  As long as you bought it from Microsoft or a major retailer then it should be good.  
<br />
<br />So what I'd do is contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are not given the help you need there then Customer Service is tasked to validate any key, and if it shows as good they will open a case to get it activated by any means necessary.  If it's not good then you can participate in reporting piracy which sometimes earns a free copy for cooperating.

</p><blockquote>I got a new motherboard and power supply for Christmas, and threw them in yesterday. I didn't change or reset the ssd's, windows did its little driver update thing for 2 minutes, and loaded in. all was well, but now I get this annoying note telling
 me to activate windows. I went through the activation troubleshooter, it shows my laptop as an active device, but I have to click "see other devices..." and under "unsupported version" is where I see my desktop a couple days ago. I didn't change from windows
 10 home, why is the 2 day ago version unsupported and unable to load in now? I use this computer to game on nightly, and never had an issue until today.&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>I was able to fix it by just reinstalling windows from this link</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>just download the windows 10 installation media file and if you select the option for keep personal files and apps when you're installing windows it pretty much activated windows for me. I lost nothing and all of my settings were the same. It's absolutely
 stupid that I needed to reinstall windows to prove my windows version was authentic. Hope it works for ya&nbsp; mate.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw and Solitaire not working on Windows 10 computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Microsoft games not working</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just done a System Repair install, because of the problems with KB3172985. &nbsp;All seems to be OK, EXCEPT for Microsoft Solitaire Collection and Microsoft Jigsaw. Neither of these now work. I have tried uninstalling and then re-installing them, to no
 avail. Actually, reinstalling Jigsaw seemed to work, but I've lost all my previous status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running W10 Home, version 1511, OS Build 10586.494 on an Asus Desktop with 8GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>Hi Likhitha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers to your questions:-</p>
<ol>
<li>KB3172985 kept failing to install and rolling back - every day since it was released. I found an article on the community website that suggested several possible fixes, including a repair install, which I carried out.</li><li>MS Solitaire Collection merely gives a quick flash of the splash screen - nothing more.</li><li>No error messages or codes.</li></ol>
<p>As I said, Jigsaw now appears to work OK, but of course I have no scores now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Store App troubleshooter finds no issues.</p>

<p><span>The app might fail to launch if the same is blocked by antivirus security software or

            <p><span>Hi Laurie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the app is not blocked by
<strong>Windows Firewall</strong> or the antivirus security software installed on the computer, run
<strong>SFC scan</strong> and <strong>DISM scan</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is caused due to any of the missing or corrupted system files and folders.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Open an
<strong>Administrator command prompt </strong>window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says
<strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>

<h2>            I understand Solitude is a nice town for imperial scum but what about a stormcloak&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Riften is probably the most supportive of the stormcloaks but is there a stormcloak town that has a house for sale with an enchanter table in it? I read that most of the towns in easter Skyrim are stormcloak.</p>

<p>You can buy a big house Windhelm (Stormcloak capital) called Hjerim, but you first need to complete a few quests, including: Blood on the Ice (solve a murder case) and liberating Fort Neugrad from the Imperials. &nbsp;After that, Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak will allow
 you to purchase the home. &nbsp;Just talk to his assistant. &nbsp;Hjerim is huge and has several upgrades, including: alchemy table, enchanting table, 3 mannequins to display armor sets, multiple weapon display cases, and even a large rack to hang approximately 5 or
 6 additional weapons.</p>

<p>Yep, I was reading about the house in Windhelm. The armory upgrade is cool. You can get for less than 12000 if thats all you have. I'm going to try to stash gold in whiterun and get Hjerim for cheap.

<h2>            Xbox Enforcement Team is abusing their power</h2>
                    <p>Ok I want to bring to the attention that this gamertag<strong>&nbsp;[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>is some kind of official that's clearly abusing their xbox live&nbsp;power. This guy/lady had the nerve&nbsp;to accuse me of cheating in a Halo Reach game&nbsp;and then&nbsp;message me first&nbsp;about it. First off, I certainly do not know how to cheat in online games, and it should have been evident that I was not cheating seeing that I died a few times in that game. My internet gets slow at times, which I can imagine&nbsp;is a pretty common problem, but instead this guy messages me first,&nbsp;accusing me of cheating and "lagg switching" whatever that is.&nbsp;Now&nbsp;I'm not going to take accusations like that lightly so ofcourse any gamer would react by telling the guy to **** off (of any variation of the eff word)&nbsp;.... instead I got suspended&nbsp;for a day for "communication." Fair enough that I get banned for a day, but something has to be done with officials abuse of powers. It

<h3> stevel2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install MS15-115 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After a ton of research and troubleshooting, I'm convinced there is a bug or a false positive (or, hopefully there is a solution, but I just can't find it).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nessus and GFI Languard both said that my Windows 10 computer is vulnerable due to MS15-115.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nessus said the vulnerability was related to a file not patching in .NET v2.&nbsp; I tried installing every update linked on the MS15-115 page, but my computer said it was not applicable, so I just turned off .NET 3.0 in Windows (which included 2.0).&nbsp; That removed
 the file that wasn't patching and for now, it seems like I don't need v2, so I should be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GFI still says I'm vulnerable, but due to a win32k.sys file that isn't patched.&nbsp; I've found a ton of articles for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 2008, 2008r2, 2012 and 2012r2, but nothing for Windows 10.&nbsp; GIF says the version must be higher than 10.0.10586.3 and mine
 is 10.0.10586.20, so there must be a patch, but it just points to MS15-115, which doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to install KB3105211 and KB3116278, but it says they are already installed.&nbsp; It says KB3105213 is not applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me if there is anything else out there for Windows 10 in relation to MS15-115?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I too am having the same issue at least with GFI reporting MS15-115 issues on windows 10 (Build 1511, x64)&nbsp;computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see I have&nbsp;the most recent&nbsp;KB&nbsp;installed (3156421)&nbsp;that supersedes the original KB3105211&nbsp;that is supposed to&nbsp;resolve&nbsp;ms15-115, but for some reason GFI still thinks the vulnerability exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my win32k.sys file is also at 10.0.10586.20 while the win32kbase and win32kfull.sys files are at 10.0.10586.312.&nbsp; this is a fresh install.&nbsp; nothing is broken and windows 10 is stable and running as it should.&nbsp; Its just the vulnerability scan keeps hitting
 on ms15-115 when windows 10 is patched to the most recent KB listed for KB3105211&nbsp;in the update catalog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>not sure that a 'repair' will resolve this either....</p>

<h2>            Win 10 64-bit - Installing Skype failed, code 1603</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade to the latest version of Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have received 2 error messages:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Skype 7.8 cannot be removed.&nbsp; Contact your technical support group</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Installing Skype failed; code 1603.&nbsp; A fatal error occurred during installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have visited the Skype support community, and was instructed to download the "Fix it" tool from Microsoft, but it is not supporting Windows 10 at this time.&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/mats/program_install_and_uninstall
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to manually uninstall Skype completely from control panel, but receive an error message:</p>
<p>3. The installed product does not match the installation source(s).&nbsp; Until a matching source is provided or the installed product and source are synchronized, this action cannot be performed [....] Browse to locate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps of interest:&nbsp; while error message #1 refers to Skype 7.8, the program name in Control Panel references Skype 7.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 within the last 3 weeks; Skype was already operating in my Windows 8.1 environment.&nbsp; How can I either remove Skype entirely from my laptop and start over, or otherwise upgrade successfully?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; I re-booted in safe mode, and tried to uninstall Skype in order to facilitate a clean download.&nbsp; Received the error message:</p>
<p>4. "Windows Installer is not properly installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, perhaps my problem runs deeper?</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>

            Haven't got my Laptop with me, but Skype is a built-in app in Windows 10 and, from memory, is upgraded through Microsoft Store/Windows Update, so if you've tried to install/upgrade it manually, that's probably why you now have the version conflict.

            <p>Thanks for your reply, ER.&nbsp; My current version of Skype IS working properly, but every time it launches, it announces that an upgrade is available and ready to install, and the cycle of error messages and code 1603s starts all over again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are back to your laptop, would you kindly verify this?&nbsp; It seems like more of a bug than a feature to keep offering updates and upgrades if Win 10 is going to take care of them automatically.....however, if I need to ignore system update announcements
 for Skype, then that is annoying, but ok.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Answered:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I never was able to figure out WHY this problem occurred, or how to prevent it from re-occurring, I did find this helpful post in the Skype community forum:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">The removal tool below should help you remove previous traces of the Skype software that IOBit has no clue how to remove properly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I downloaded and ran the .exe file, and restarted the laptop.&nbsp; While Skype no longer appeared in my list of programs in Control Panel, the shortcuts on my desktop and task bar remained.&nbsp; Easy solution:&nbsp; delete them.&nbsp; I was then able to download and install
 the latest version of Skype for desktop, and it has been running just fine.&nbsp; Good luck, everyone!</p>

<h2>            Purchased app unable to install.</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few moments ago I made a slight mistake, and would appreciate assistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two different Microsoft accounts within the same user (main local account) on my PC. One Microsoft account links to my Windows account (primary account) and the other is a secondary account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to make a purchase of Forza Horizon 3, only realizing afterwards that the purchase was made on my secondary account rather than my main primary account linked to Windows. As a result, I basically paid for a game which I cannot install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to install from the Secondary account, however I am not provided with a download option. I have also done much research about the troubleshooter, etc and cannot find any solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I have latest versions of all Windows and Microsoft updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to revert or transfer the purchase from my secondary account to my primary one? Or just a way to install it to my PC from my secondary account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see below for screenshot when trying to download/ install from secondary account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da3f2095-88ad-4db6-bb16-bfd35ed3e72d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da3f2095-88ad-4db6-bb16-bfd35ed3e72d?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            Sharing sound</h2>
                    So apparently Skype doesn't have an actual support. That sucks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Many wireless headphone users (Including myself) Cannot share sound because there is no 3.5mm Audiojack which apparently matters to Skype when sharing sound. I'd love it if the developers at Skype could resolve this issue as it is annoying the **** out of me.<br />

Sincerely pissed off user. (Who's about to switch to some other software)

            <p>Hello Davespc01,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In modern devices there's a kind of "barrier, limit" to hard drive storages larger than 2TB.
</p>
<p>Your WD Red 3TB needs to be initialized by using the GUID partition table (GPT). This scheme supports addressing of the full storage capacity. As I can see, your motherboard supports UEFI BIOS (which is a necessity). If it didn't,
 you wouldn't be able to initialize your disk in GPT and format the whole 3TB capacity of the drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link that could really help you. There're definitions and explanation to your issue, then "Overall requirements for a non-bootable data volume" and "Overall requirements for a bootable system volume", which you should read
 depending if you want your HDD to be bootable or not. </p>
<p>You can find out how to initialize your disk under the title "How to initialize a data disk by using GPT". Afterwards you can freely partition and format your WD Red and it should have allocated all the capacity of 3TB.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X 4K Issue</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;got the Xbox One X Project Scorpio Edition today and I&nbsp;have had a problem with it.</p><p>When looking at the console on the home screen I&nbsp;can see that images are not as clear as they once were on my Xbox One S and HD&nbsp;TV. I've moved to a 4K TV (LG 43UJ635V) and messed with the settings, surely it should be clearer if not as clear as the Xbox One S display yet the images are distorted, blurry and look pixelated.</p><p>I've spoken to Xbox One support and they told me the console might need replacing. I'm not sure whether its the TV or Xbox.</p><p><br />My concern is that if I&nbsp;need to take the console back and get it replaced then I&nbsp;will not get another scorpio edition...</p><p><br /></p><p>Is anyone else having these issues?</p><p>If so please let me know however if not can you let me know what TV&nbsp;you are using if its a 4K one.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope you can help!</p>

            <p>Amazon had Scorpio’s this morning, you have to click the Xbox one X and then change the “size”. So they are still out there. &nbsp;My 1-X will not display 4k on my Visio&nbsp; TV even though it detects the TV having 4k with HDR 10.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have windows 8. I have a touro mobile. I had a problem with it on my x box. I tried getting it to my computer to make sure it is formatted right. I searched for it all the ways people say but it is not showing. I ONLY see it on Devices and printers. On
 device manager it is under disk drives. but i can do NOTHING to it. It does not show up under disk management. I have tried looking it up but ALL post say do the same thing but i can not do those because all i can do it find in in devices and printers. all
 it gives me to do it go to properties trouble shoot or remove disk.&nbsp; I do not care if i have to clear it out and re put things on there. I just need it fixed so i can use it again.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Brandon,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue can be caused due to driver corruption or due to system file corruption. Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. What are the model of the computer &amp; of the external hard drive?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Are you able to use other USB devices?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Did this problem recently begin? If so, do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Run hardware and devices troubleshooter and check.</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>d) Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e) Click on <strong>Next </strong>button to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above troubleshooter didn’t help, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller
</strong>and restart the computer. Let the </span></span><span><span>Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps to uninstall &amp; reinstall the USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller from device manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. <strong>Device Manager</strong> Window will be open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>

    <title>Some of my games won&#39;t install from disc on the Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bevanhogben  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some of my games won&#39;t install from disc on the Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I tried installing some of my old Xbox One games on my Xbox One X Scorpio Edition. The install didn't even start nor did it give the usual popup saying that an update it needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I've tried it on Destiny and Assassin's Creed Ezio Collection. Both discs are in perfect condition and work fine on other consoles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The console started an update when I put in the disc for Trials Rising, and it autoloaded Overwatch which was already installed. This tells me that the hardware is running fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the Omega preview dashboard but it's not showing any signs of games crashing or freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset the console, power cycled, cleared the offline saves and persistent blu ray data etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all looking to be a software issue as the drive works and the console still loads games from disc that are already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called support and they want to charge me over £200 for a repair that isn't even hardware related and is quite possibly caused from one of their updates. Even the support rep said it sounds like the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this issue or know of a workaround because it's driving me crazy?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update: 3rd chat rep was more helpful. He agreed that it doesn't look like the hardware or the disc are at fault. He will be looking into it with other staff while I wait for an update that will be due out tomorrow. It's the same version as
 the preview version I'm running but I'm getting a more polished one. Hopefully that will fix it but we will see.</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like your in Xbox Insiders program&gt;&gt;did you provide them with feedback regarding this issue.&nbsp; You might want to try factory resetting your Xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 0; color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>f you’re ready to reset your console to the factory default settings, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;&nbsp;to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Console info</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console</strong>.</li></ol>
<div style="margin-left: 0; color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<ol>
<li>On the&nbsp;<strong>Reset your console?</strong>&nbsp;screen, you'll see three options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Reset and remove everything</strong>. This option resets the console to factory settings. All user data, including accounts, saved games, settings, home Xbox associations, and all games and apps will be deleted. You should use this option when selling
 or gifting the console to someone else. You should only use this option as a last resort in some troubleshooting cases.</li><li><strong>Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</strong>. You should use this option as your primary choice when troubleshooting. It will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your games or apps. This will save you from downloading
 or reinstalling the large game files. In some cases, if a corrupt game file is causing the issue you're troubleshooting, you may have to choose&nbsp;<strong>Reset and remove everything</strong>, but you should always start with&nbsp;<strong>Reset and keep my games &amp;
 apps</strong>&nbsp;and save&nbsp;<strong>Reset and remove everything</strong>&nbsp;as a last resort.</li><li><strong>Cancel</strong>. To back out of this screen, simply select the&nbsp;<strong>Cancel</strong>&nbsp;button. No action has been taken at this point. This is a safe exit from this screen.</li></ul>
</li></ol>

    <title>backup error code 0x810002f - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            backup error code 0x810002f</h2>
                    I have attempted to backup using the Windows 7 backup program. I have allowed the system to choose default files to backup. I am backing up on an external drive that has more than enough free space. The backup runs incompletely, providing the error code
 0x810002f. The only information I have been able to find is that the backup did not backup all files. I was not running any other programs and even shut down my screen saver. I have created a restore CD. My question is - how do I find out what the missing
 files are and if their absence will create a problem should I need to restore?

<p><span>Hi kenteicher,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message you’re getting?</span></p>
<p><span>Did the backup completed after skipping those files?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>You can check for files that are not backed up under Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Action Center and under Maintenance
 -&gt; Backup, check for the files that are not backed up or any error log.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to skip the libraries from the backup and try to perform backup again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

    <title>Help&#33; Blue Screen of Death and no Minidump&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radfordhound  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33; Blue Screen of Death and no Minidump&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello. About a year ago, I purchased an Easycap off of eBay. Everytime I would plug it in, nothing would happen and my system would work fine. But when I tried to record with it my system would Blue Screen at random! Most of the time I'd plug it in, press
 record and get an instant blue screen. But every so often, as in maybe 20% of the time, it wouldn't blue screen.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This was some time ago, and I fixed it by simply recording under Ubuntu. So I forgot the errors it gave me. :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, a couple years later, I finally decided it was time to get a new capture card. I went with the Roxio Game Capture HD Pro, because it was cheap, full hd, and I heard some nice things.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I attempted to record through it on Ubuntu, however, Ubuntu didn't detect it. This means I'm forced to capture with Windows 7, which can be laggy on my old PC at times, and has some issues like, well, the blue screens I was getting with the Easycap.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well, I installed the software and made some recordings with the roxio. Surprisingly, it captured in full hd perfectly fine with no lag whatsoever! I closed the capture program and did some other stuff. A couple hours later, I opened the capture program
 and, BOOM. I got a blue screen! D:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well, it seems to be the same 'at random' thing like with the Easycap, but luckily it seems to blue screen a little less then the easycap did.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's some stupid "BAD_POOL_HEADER" thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, here's the problem. I'm trying to fix this dreaded blue screen of death, but when I look in my C:\Windows\Minidump folder, there's nothing there! I went onto the advanced system settings menu and checked. It says the blue screens are being saved as
 "kernel memory dumps" in %SystemRoot%\MENORY.DMP. Well, I checked, and there's no "Memory.dmp" file anywhere in the Windows folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have CCleaner, and I used it to fix some registry problems after the first blue screen to see if maybe that would help. But, since the last screen I haven't ran it. So I couldn't of deleted the log file.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I changed my settings to instead dump a " complete memory dump" into "%SystemRoot%\Minidump". So, maybe the dumps will magically appear after that.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Honestly, this blue screen thing is driving me crazy. I updated the drivers on my computer, fixed 2000 detected registry problems with. CCleaner (I know! A lot, right?!?), uninstalled "Daemon tools lite", and removed the stupid virtual drive I made with
 it. I disabled my antivirus and that did nothing. Please help me solve this terrible blue screen or at least find the dump file so I can narrow it down. Thanks in advance. :)</div>

<p>Please note that your responses have NOTHING to do with the question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>question</strong> has to do with the LIBRARY, which exists for each Microsoft account, independent of what has been installed on each computer under that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your <strong>answer</strong> has to do with uninstalling an app from a specific computer.&nbsp; Once uninstalled, the app is no longer on the computer, but any computer on that account can see that app in the library, whether or not it has ever been installed
 on that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user can mark the app as "hidden", but cannot remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are important privacy (<strong>&amp; legal</strong>) issues with Microsoft retaining an unwanted app in a user's history.&nbsp; You should probably forward this issue (which has been raised in multiple Microsoft forums) to someone in Microsoft's legal department,
 for resolution, before it is raised in a government inquiry (eg, the European Union's privacy history requirements).</p>

<h2>            Clock Watchdog timeout BSOD error after clean Windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently built a new PC and transplanted my old SSD with a Windows 10 install into it temporarily (same chipset, seemed to work ok). However, my intention was to install a fresh copy when I got time, which I did yesterday a week later, using a new Windows
 10 code as the last install failed to activate which is fair enough</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had issues installing the latest service pack on the last install so it was not completely up to date with that and drivers etc BUT it was completely stable on my new PC and worked without a hitch for over a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the day after installing Windows&nbsp;10 I am now getting system freezes followed immediately by a blue screen and the error code: Clock Watchdog timeout BSOD error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is not overclocked, the hardware is identical to before and the only things that have changed are software-based, namely the latest version of Windows 10 and the latest drivers so in my mind that's where the issue is. I've seen elsewhere that this
 can be driver based but everything is up to date according to Windows update and I've manually installed the latest Nvidia driver as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            Hi Antony
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Antony, 
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Antony
<br />
<br />The only thing indicated in your mini-dump file is GenuineIntel - which is your processor, there is no actual device driver indicated . . 
<br />
<br />I doubt there is anything wrong with your processor, can you check to see if there is a BIOS update available for your motherboard, which may resolve this crashing for you . . .

<p>Damn ok.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I'm already using the latest BIOS- ASRock X299E-ITX/AC with Core i9-9980XE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read&nbsp;that some people have fixed this by increasing the CPU voltage a little, but given it was stable for 8 days and since reinstalling Windows last I've had 4 crashes so far today I suspect it's not a hardware issue. Temperatures are below 50'C for
 CPU and motherboard too. Hmmmm!</p>

                    <p>Unable to read task sequence configuration disk. for more information appears when using SCCM to deploy service after booting to PE with U disk, but it can go on normally after replacing U disk, but some U disk can not be used. I found that the DISK ID of
 U disk which can be used normally is different from that of U disk which can not be used normally.</p>
