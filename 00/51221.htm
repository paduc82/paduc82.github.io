<h2>            Windows 10 Tearing Issue</h2>
                    <p>I just completed a clean install of Windows 10 Pro with Nvidia's Latest drivers (361.91). I was watching Youtube video and had another window open with an article on it. As i was scrolling the page the text was tearing in a vertical way. This has been hit
 or miss&nbsp;whether I have been able to reproduce this. I have however been able to do it consistently get this to happen by watching a video in any video program and letting something play in the background while I scroll up and down in a drop down window that
 is over top of the edge of the video window. I have also successfully tested this with my Intel Integrated and numerous other computers including one that was still running Windows 8.1. I have recorded and uploaded a video showing this vertical screen tearing
 and am interested if there is any kind of fix for this.</p>

<h2>            ICS - Internet Connection Sharing not working</h2>
                    
<p>I am building two computers with Win7 Ultimate and need to share a dialup connection over a wired network. I have gotten file sharing to work between the two machines, and followed all the instructions concerning ICS, but still can't get the non-host machine
 to connect to the Internet. I selected the option on the host machine to allow machines on the network to control the connection, and sure enough, when I plug in the crossover cord connecting the two, the host dials up. However no program on the non-host machine
 can actually communicate.</p>

<p>You're in the right place.&nbsp; The host's wired network connection IPv4 address isn't what it should be, indicating that ICS isn't set up properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While still in "Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections", right-click the dial-up connection and click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong> &gt; &nbsp;<strong>Sharing</strong> .&nbsp; If the&nbsp;<em>Internet Connection Sharing</em>&nbsp;box is checked, un-check it and click
 OK.&nbsp; Then go back and put a check mark in that box to re-enable Internet Connection Sharing.&nbsp; If a box appears asking you to select a private network connection, select the wired network connection from the menu.</p>

<h2>            Xbox live connected to xfinity hotspot but no multiplayer </h2>
                    
<p>Good afternoon everyone's,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently just moved and the place I'm at doesn't have the internet set up here yet. However, there is an xfinity hotspot that is nearby and after using an alternative MAC to set it up, I successfully was able to connect to Xbox Live. Now here is where
 the issues come in. All of the services are working fine, I was even able to download FIFA 15 from ea acesss but when I try to play multiplayer it says that I'm not connected to Xbox live. It doesn't matter which of the games I try they all either say that
 I'm not connected to Xbox live when I know I am or that it can not connect to the servers. Can anyone assist me?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Mike15pad!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the connection issues.</p>
<p>Could you try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Go to <strong>Xbox Home</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Hit the start button on your controller, a menu should pop up.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Select <strong>Settings &gt; Network &gt; Test multiplayer connection</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know what the result of that test is. We will be waiting for your answer :)</p>

<p>I am having the same problem, all the internet connection tests say i am connected and everything is working properly (including the Multiplayer test). I'm on xfinity hotspot and I cannot connect to the network when trying to play any EA games (FIFA and
 NHL)</p>

<p>These consoles have a hard enough time with a regular setup , no way a "hotspot" could be good for gaming ...has to be all kinds of nat issues I would think...lag to I bet....just &nbsp;no...you can most likely do some stuff but I cant imagine the multiplayer
 experience would be possible , or enjoyable if possible...</p>

<p>Hotspots arent really designed for gaming </p>
<p>Lte connections are too inconsistent.</p>
<p>Even if you were able to connect you would experience an enormous amount of lag</p>
<p>It is actually recommended that you use a broadband connection rather then a mobile hotspot</p>
<p>If you insist on the hotspot your only option really is your isp to help adjust your settings but it wont help with the extreme lag</p>

<h2>            SBS 2011 &#39;Connect to internet&#39; wizard fials</h2>
                    I have a relatively new SBS 2011 server on which the connect to internet fails with the following message<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Cannot find a connected network adapter. Ensure that the network adapter on the server is connected to a switch or router and that it is powered on....</span><br />
<br />
However I can connect to the internet with no problem, e.g. receive windows updates, browse the web etc. and the connectivity tab on the network page of the SBS console shows that the internet connection has a status of 'Connected'.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<h2>            Serious help need - Permissions - Won&#39;t Let Me Delete File - Sky App</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm completely computer illiterate so forgive me if this does not make sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I am having major issues in trying to delete a file on my laptop, this states that I do not have permissions when I do (I think).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has all started when I wanted to watch Sky Sports on my laptop, this is done through a Video Player App. Sky then notified me that I needed to update this and there is a new download available, so then I clicked on update. This is where the problem
 started...It came up with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>c:\users\davyw\appdata\roaming\sky\skysports\skysports.exe</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>An error has occurred while trying ti rename a file in the destination directory:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>MoveFile failed; code 183</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cannot create a file when that file already exists</em></strong></p>
<p>So this tells me that I need to follow the above file path and delete the folder so that this can download from fresh on to my laptop with out anything having to be re named. I tried to follow the above but file path but couldn't
 even locate the folder as there where no 'appdata' so I had to do a search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file that I'm having issues with was a folder called 'redist' and in that was a file called 'CiscoVideoGuard'. I tried to delete this and then it said I do not have permissions to delete this this folder. I then right clicked-selected security- in groups
 or user names there is SECURITY, My name (Email) and Administrators all of which are marked 'allow'. This still will not let me delete this. I have also uninstalled&nbsp;CiscoVideoGuard from my Add/remove programmes. This still wont allow me to install the app
 and the above message is still coming up which is prompting me that this needs to be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the above error message (While downloading) I also get this message with a red cross next to it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unable to execute file:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>c:\users\davyw\appdata\roaming\sky\skysports\redist\CiscoVideoGuard.exe</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Create Process Failed; code 2</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The system cannot find the filed specified</strong></em></p>
<p>If there is any help out there that would be great, I could be doing something completely wrong but I'm lost as to how to take this forward. This is completely preventing me from watching sky on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated guys thank you!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 file system, taking ownership will let you gain full control over files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To properly take ownership of the files and folders, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Browse and find the files you want to have full access.</li><li>Right-click on the file and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the<strong> Security</strong> tab, select <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>On the<strong> Advanced Security Settings</strong> window, click <strong>Change</strong> beside the
<strong>Owne</strong><strong>r's</strong> field.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Select User or Group</strong> window, click<strong> Find Now</strong>.</li><li>Select your user account and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click<strong> OK </strong>again to complete the task.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, make sure that you'll grant full control or access to your account. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the file or folder and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Security</strong> tab, click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Under<strong> Permissions</strong> tab, click <strong>Add</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Select a principal</strong> to add your user account.</li><li>On the <strong>Select User or Group </strong>window, click <strong>Find Now</strong>.</li><li>Select your user account from the results.</li><li>Click<strong> OK</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Select User or Group</strong> window, click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>On <strong>Permission Entry </strong>window, make sure to check<strong> Full control</strong> option.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> again to complete the task.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also check or enable the <strong>Replace all existing inheritable permissions on all descendants with inheritable permissions for this object</strong> option in the Advanced Security Settings to also gain full control over
 sub-folders permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you gain full access, try deleting the file and see if the issue will persist. If the issue still persists, create a new local user account and try deleting the file again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</span></span><br />

<p>I have just had the same problem and solved it by starting windows in safe mode, this allowed my to go into the appdata/roaming folder and delete the previous skysport.exe. file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will then allow you to run the installer and install the latest version.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            server not found and requires repeated refreshing to get firefox to load using wildblue satellite internet</h2>
                    I am using windows xp home edition and mozilla firefox. I connect to the internet using Wildblue satellite. For the past 2 weeks, I am experiencing a constant need to refresh the page when I either try to launch firefox or click to open another tab. I
 get the "server not found" error page where I have to click retry several times. I have done the internet connection troubleshooter which has turned up nothing. I have unplugged my router for up to an hour and all seems Ok for a very short time then the whole
 process repeats itself. At this point I am at a loss. I don't know if this is computer related or Wildblue related because everything was doing fine up until this past 2 weeks or so. I am paying an awful lot a month for this dish internet and I would so love
 to get this resolved.

<h2>            Windows 7 will not restart without turning off the computer</h2>
                    I've been waiting for over a week with missed days of work, because the MS Assure system has no integrity and people never all back within the time frame or even within the actual day they commit to call back, to have MS technical support (Level 1 and
 2) try to resolve an issue with Windows 7 Home Premium. Windows will not restart after any upgrade of MS or non-MS software that requires a restart. The system shuts down and then during the reboot looks like it will restart but hangs up with what looks like
 a command prompt screen with a blinking cursor which is frozen, i.e. won't move or take characters from the keyboard like a command prompt does. I have to do a hard restart by turning the system off and back on. We did an in place upgrade of Windows 7 which
 did nothing. I am waiting for a call back to address an improperly installed Outlook 2013 which a Level 1 tech did remotely a couple of days ago and blew past the script error of a library not registered that pops up every time upon start up of Outlook. I
 will need to export my Outlook files to my external drive before I do a complete reinstall of Windows 7, which is what a pretty decent Level 2 tech guy suggested, after he ran a bunch of checks and messed with the registry and tried a few other things but
 I am hoping someone knows MS products better than the Level 1 or 2 techs I have dealt with who might help me solve this.<br />

            <p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience and efforts which you have put to try to resolve the issue. If you face the issue related to restart only after installation&nbsp;on Windows Updates then it is possible that the updates are not getting installed properly. In case if
 you are unable to do a normal restart then you could face this issue due to outdated chipset drivers or firmware. Please provide us the following details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>2) Are you able to restart your computer normally (prior to installation of updates)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to post the issue related to Office 2013 on the link given below. The link given below is support forum of Office 2013.<br />

            <p>Thank you for your reply. The computer will not complete a soft restart.&nbsp; I always have to turn it off and on again to get it to reboot. It's a Dell 32 bit OS Inspiron with Intel 2 Duo CPU E8400 with 4 GB of RAM of which 2.97 GB are usable. Intel 4 Series
 Chipset Processor to I/O Controller-2E30. Driver Provider Microsoft, Driver Date 6/21/2006, Driver Version 6.1.7601.17514&nbsp; A check for updates returns "The best driver software for your device is already installed."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS updates get installed properly. If they're updates that need configuring during shut down and again after restart, a hard restart lets them continue configuring. Adobe Acrobat Reader XI and other Adobe updates won't even load.&nbsp; I resolved the registry
 problem that caused the script error with Outlook 2013 and the level 1 tech finally called me back and moved all my MS Office and other files to my external drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A level 2 MS tech did everything he could think of and said I needed to reinstall Windows 7. Any other suggestions or things I can check before I do that?&nbsp; I have my doubts reinstalling Windows 7 will even resolve the problem. Thanks.</p>

            <p>In fact a complete reload after backing up your data is very likely to resolve the problems and would be more reliable in the long term. Patching and tweaking the registry does not deal with the underlying problem as to why it is corrupt in the 1st place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to make sure you have all of the software to reinstall as backups don't work for programs. If the computer is preloaded with Windows 7 Home editions Dell provide a recovery image which would reinstate the computer as it was originally supplied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reinstalling run Windows Update manually at least twice. The 1st may only apply a couple of updates but the second would be 100+. The install your software and let automatic updates take over.</p>

<h2>            Computer bare of all apps and defaultuser0</h2>
                    <p>So when I received my new laptop (HP Notebook), there was an issue with the browser so I decided to reset the system. So I did so, it redid an installation of Windows 10 and after that a profile named Defaultuser0 came up. Could not get inside the profile
 (generated an unknown password) and after a few searches on my other devices I was able to find a method to get around it, but am still unable to delete it, even when I used command prompt (admin). Now I have a profile but the computer is still bare. The windows
 icon doesnt work and I cant search anything up on the taskbar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, how do I regain all of the apps from before? And how do I effectively remove the defaultuser0 profile?</p>

<p><span>I looked online. From the startup menu, I did SHIFT+Restart, then went to troubleshoot, start up services and opened command prompt in safe mode. From then, I put "net user &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; /add" to create a new account, the did "net
 user defaultuser0 /del". It said that the action was successful, but mind you, there were two accounts with the same name (defaultuser0), so I went to do the same process and it said that the account did not exist. But a single one (there were two and now
 there is one) appears on the startup menu and still has a profile which I cannot delete.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I cannot open an elevated command prompt. I right click the windows icon (when I said it wasnt working, I meant the menu would not show up when you left click), and go to command prompt (admin) but it refuses to show, but regular command
 prompt comes up fine. Should I just try command prompt from safe mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And plus, what exactly happens when I put in the code? Am I only using what is in the brackets or in the whole line?</p>

<p>I tried the method. I was able to make a command prompt shortcut, but whenever I try to run it as an administrator, there is a wait and then I see a box pop up that says&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The endpoint mapper database entry could not be created.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>But if it means anything, when I load it up regular, I see that it says</p>
<p><em>C:\Windows\System32&gt;</em></p>
<p>Does this mean that I'm running it as an administrator? If not, then what else do I do to run it as an administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I loaded up powershell (just in case I was in as an administrator) and put in the code. Nothing happens, or should I do something afterwards?</p>

            Hi, Deepak_Krishnan R.<br />
Thanks you for your response.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. There is no any message while accessing to this app, and I didn't make any changed to the PC.<br />
2. So, I try to uninstall and reinstall the app. A wrong something &nbsp;is that installing size is 1.2G while resinstalling the app. But the Store shows that "Approximate size 613.3 MB". And, I retry to start the "Sniper Fury", but also there is no message, and
 do not start.<br />
3. Also I try "Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps", but it shows that there is nothing error.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
Best Regards.

                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and I was having trouble opening attachments in Mail. Double clicking resulted in a request to "Open with what program?". I opted for Adobe (in error) and the "Always Use" was checked. Now, all attachments obviously want to

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One possible reason why you are experiencing high disk usage in Windows 10 is because of the unnecessary applications running on the background. To troubleshoot the issue, we suggest performing a clean boot to ensure that your computer only runs with its
 basic functions and programs. To do this, simply follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From Start, search for<span>&nbsp;</span><span>msconfig.</span></li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><span>System Configuration</span><span>&nbsp;</span>from the search results.<br />

            Hello gisseln,
<br />
<br />Try to turn off your device using power off button.
<br />
<br />After this try to turn it on again.
<br />
<br />If an issue persist better create an installation media <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>, boot from this and use recovery options: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12415/...</a>

<br />Let me know how this goes

            It is safer to use power off button.
<br />
<br />Try one more time: 
<br />
<br />- Press the power button on the laptop and hold it down for a count of 30. 
<br />- If it does not, then try again for a count of 60. 
<br />
<br />If still no any reaction that remove the power cord from the back of the laptop. Remove the battery. Wait for a minute so the computer fully dumps its temporary memory. Put the battery back. Hook the power cord back up and restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Let me know how this works

    <title>Can I copy Xbox One updates&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chief firebird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I copy Xbox One updates&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have two Xbox One consoles in my home, and every time the console or a game gets an update, I have have to download them to both consoles which takes twice the time. Is there a way to download the updates/DLC to one console, then copy it over to the other
 console by USB sticks or something? Downloading the same things twice is getting old.</p>
<p><br />
Note: The Xbox 360 allowed us to copy these items to USB.</p>

<p>It think it would take LONGER and may even cost you a bit of money to do it that way.</p>
<p>Here is what I mean.</p>
<p>1. You will have to download the update or whatever onto on XBOX ONE. Which take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour.</p>
<p>2. Then you will have to find the location of that update on the internal hard drive.</p>
<p>3. Most updates are rather big. Meaning you'd have to have a large enough thumb drive or even extremal hard drive to copy it. And that could get costly... Again copying can take several minutes as well.
</p>
<p>4. Then you go over to your second XBOX ONE, and copy the update to the correct location there. Which is will still have to "download" off the thumb drive.. which take time as well.</p>
<p>5. And if something gets corrupted during copying or you move it to wrong location, then your pretty much
<em>well you know</em>.</p>

<p>"Microsoft implements a number of different security measures on its Xbox Live service. One of these takes the form of a proactive security check that assures that only unmodified machines may access their service. On May 17, 2007, Microsoft banned consoles
 with modified firmware from Xbox Live. According to Microsoft, consoles with firmware of unknown origin, quality or intent were banned permanently from Xbox Live. A Microsoft representative indicated that the action was taken to assure "the integrity of the
 service and protect our partners and users."</p>
<p>Wikipedia under Xbox Live (scroll to Security section). </p>
<p>It's more straight forward to download it rather than go through all that hassle. Heard that if you sign into a modded console you account gets banned. This is also why it's best to only buy consoles new from authorized Xbox retailers which are in all countries
 Xbox Live is in (US/UK/NZ/AUS). </p>

<p>Not going to post links because that would be stupidity of the highest order but do a bit of google searching about the subject. Very few 'mods' on the 360 require a modded console. They are done by modding the profile or saves that people put on a USB.</p>
<p>Microsoft have opened the door on the One now that they are allowing external storage to be used.</p>
<p>I just hope they have better security on those files for the One because it was exceedingly poor on the 360.</p>

<p>Well to my knowledge, there has never been a severe breach of security within the Xbox Live service itself, even on the Xbox 360, and that certainly says something about MS. Still, there's no reason to start now.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by a "severe breach of security". I'll agree external drives aren't opening the door for someone to access other gamers info, CC, etc.</p>
<p>But.....it opens the door for everything else all of which were very common on the 360. Anything from avatar mods, game hacks, achievement hacks,,,the list goes on. Firmware issues are much easier to catch the software mods. Software you need to know where
 to look and a general idea of what your looking for. </p>

<p>My point was not about the security of the Live service itself. Rather it was as Randver pointed out, allowing external storage opens the door for all manner of mods that the 360 suffered from.</p>
<p>You're not going to be losing your credit card information but you are going to be seeing your Live experience altered by people who don't need to tamper with their console to do the modding.</p>
<p>This is actually why I thought Microsoft didn't release the option for external storage on the One until very recently. Pretty much made sure they'd have a mod free launch window.<br />
<br />
Edit: Problem is that until they start banning consoles for people using mods then those people will just create a new account and keep doing what they want,</p>

<p>I got this email as well this morning. &nbsp;I was immediately suspicious not only of the email address, but because it didn't mention what the gift was and there was no mention of any way to download the gift from your Xbox rather than your computer. &nbsp;I also
 would suggest not even clicking on the link in that email as it could be a keylogger, and it would allow whoever sent the email to access not only your Live account but any other usernames and passwords you enter on that computer. &nbsp;Even if this email does
 happen to be legit (which I highly highly doubt) I'm sure whatever the gift is probably isn't great enough to worth risking your Live account or possibly even other accounts.</p>

    <title>Remote desktop connection and wallpaper removal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogersc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote desktop connection and wallpaper removal</h2>
                    
<p>I have an odd problem...I connect to my work Windows 7 Pro desktop via a VPN from my home. &nbsp;At home, I have a Windows 7 desktop that's running VMware Workstation, and use a Virtual Machine (VM) running Windows 7 Pro in VMware Workstation to connect to work
 via the VPN. &nbsp;The effect of this is that just the VM I'm using is on the work VPN.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to accomplish is to prevent the remote desktop client that I'm using at home from having to repaint wallpaper over the VPN all the time. &nbsp;So I've used gpedit.msc to enable "Enforce suppression of remote desktop wallpaper" on my desktop system
 at work, and desktop background is also turned off in my remote desktop client at home. &nbsp;This works when I first remotely log into work, I get a black background, which I'm hoping is the absence of wallpaper *smile*.</p>
<p>However, I use a virtual desktop manager on my work desktop named "Virtual Dimension". &nbsp;This allows me to have several logically separate desktop spaces, and to switch between them. &nbsp;As soon as I switch to another desktop from the initial desktop that I
 got on remote login, the wallpaper is back. &nbsp;And, in fact, when I switch back to the original desktop that I logged into that had no wallpaper, the wallpaper is back there, too. So, as long as I use Virtual Dimension, apparently there is no obvious way to
 get away from waiting for wallpaper to get repainted over the VPN.</p>
<p>Are there any ideas about what I could do about this, fixes, workarounds, etc.? &nbsp;I don't know why I get wallpaper in the other virtual desktops, they're still being used via the remote desktop client connection, so my Window 7 desktop system at work that
 is hosting the remote session should know that and not send wallpaper. &nbsp;Somehow my work Windows desktop system seems to be losing track that it is talking to a remote session?</p>
<p>Anyways, any ideas or workarounds would be very welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>-Roger</p>

<p>Okay, think that I have this figured out. &nbsp;I removed the value of the string registry key "HKEY_CURRENT_USER/ControlPanel/Desktop key DesktopWallpaper. &nbsp;This leaves me with no wallpaper for remote desktop sessions even when I switch virtual desktops. &nbsp;That
 way speeds up switching virtual desktops, not having to repaint the full background all the time.</p>
<p>I think that I'll be okay with no wallpaper at work, too. &nbsp;There's plenty of color other than my wallpaper on my desktop, and anyways, basic black is slimming for a computer *smile*.</p>
<p>So as long as I don't forget and set new wallpaper, I should be fine. &nbsp;If I do, all I have to do is find this forum article on line again, and it'll remind me how to fix this *smile*.</p>
<p>Odd that "Enforce suppression of remote desktop wallpaper" in the remote host and turning off "desktop background" in the remote desktop client doesn't accomplish this as well without having to turn off local wallpaper...There's a bug somewhere *smile*.</p>

<p>Currently running Windows 7 64-bit, i have gotten around 10-15 different types of blue screen errors that randomly happen while i am using my pc. It is a new build, the only part that isnt new is my hard drive, but ive ran disk check, memtests, and everything
 comes out good. I finally have time to figure this problem out and think this site will give me the best information. I will post other errors as they happen.</p>
<p>All browsers crash very often too. Ive tested IE and Firefox, both crash probably 15-20 times per hour of use.</p>
<p>Let me know if i should post any additional information.</p>

<p>That could be drivers&nbsp;although antivirus/antispyware/security programs and other hardware<br />
are also probable causes. Updating the major drivers and BIOS&nbsp;would be the best plan of<br />
attack. If needed also try uninstalling your antivirus/security as a test.<br />

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (BIOS and major drivers)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is<br />
preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Though not as likely as drivers there is a chance that memory has a role in the issues.<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Bluetooth Completely Missing.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just yesterday (1/12/16), my bluetooth icon has disappeared completely from the action center and the icon tray towards the bottom right of the screen (don't know the official term). I tried going into settings and re-enabling bluetooth, but I found that
 it was gone from there as well. I have browsed the internet for solutions and none have worked so far. I really don't want to have to take my computer to the Best Buy tech support again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System: Surface Pro 4, Windows 10.</p>

<p>That depends on what you observed in Device Manager.&nbsp; Did u open the Bluetooth in Device Manager(double click)?&nbsp; Was The Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter there?&nbsp; Was it enabled?&nbsp; What was it's Device status when you double clicked it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that a disabled Bluetooth adapter in Device Manager will result in Bluetooth disappearing exactly as u described.</p>

            <p>If you are absolutely sure&nbsp;that there is no Bluetooth category in Device Manager go to the top of Device Manager and click the Action tab and select "Scan for hardware changes".&nbsp; If Bluetooth is still missing then a "Reset this PC" in settings under "Recovery"
 is probably indicated.&nbsp; However, before doing a reset I recommend contacting Microsoft support to see if they have any other ideas.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; There is one other thing to try before a Reset.&nbsp; Go into Troubleshooting in Control Panel and select Network and Internet an select Network Adapter and follow the prompts.</p>
