<h2>            Conversation View Incorrectly Groups Unrelated Emails</h2>
                    <p>Conversation View is nice (if you like that kind of thing), but it's very stupid about what constitutes a "conversation."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, it groups together all emails with the same subject line, regardless of the sender, receiver, date, or email account. In my case, I receive a lot of email with the same subject line, and Windows 10 Mail incorrectly groups them all together
 into one massive email chain, even though they're entirely unrelated discussions. Outlook and other mail clients don't do this; just Win 10 Mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a known fix for this bug, or do I just have to turn off Conversation View?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off <strong>Show messages arranged by conversation </strong>will ungroup your messages with the same subject. To do this, you can check this

            <p>(sigh). I already know how to turn the feature on/off. That wasn't my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it's on, why does it treat every single email with the same subject line as part of the same huge conversation? No other mail client does this, even Outlook. Seems like a pretty obvious bug to me. Unless I'm doing something wrong, in which case please
 let me know. Otherwise, I'll just have to turn the feature off because it doesn't work as-is.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Messages with the same subject that are grouped in one conversation is currently not considered as a bug, but rather a default setting in Windows 10 Mail. The app is designed to group your messages by conversation, which would mean that messages with the
 same subject are grouped together. To know more about this, you can check this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-do-I-turn-off-arrange-by-conversation-in-Mail-for-Windows-10-1b816093-51af-45b4-8f2f-32c2fb673b58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Maybe I wasn't clear. Let's try this again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Person A sends me an email with the subject line "foobar." I reply to the message, she replies back, I reply again, and so on. Those emails are all grouped together in a conversation. That's all good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A year later, a different person -- Person B -- sends me a completely unrelated email that just happens to use subject line "foobar." Mail 10 for Windows now groups this new message with all of the old ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any decent mail client is smart enough to know that those two email chains are not related. They have no senders in common, for example. Person B was never included in the first email, so how could he/she have replied? Person A was never part of the second
 email, so how could he/she have replied? They're obviously not part of the same conversation. They just happen to share a subject line. When the subject is something simple like "Re:" or "FYI" or "Hello" this is pretty common.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook does this correctly; Thunderbird does this correctly; emClient does this correctly; iOS maill app does this correctly. Only Mail 10 for Windows confuses the two unrelated conversations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is: (a) when will this bug get fixed, or (b) how do I configure Mail to group conversations correctly (without turning off conversation View entirely)?&nbsp;</p>

<p>same thing here, I use outlook on my home pc, on my travel laptop I use the windows 10 mail app, and outlook handles the conversations correctly as mail does not, very annoying
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>is there a fix for this bug yet,&nbsp; as an added note, I install yahoo mail (hate it) just to test it and added my email to it and it works great handles the conversation correctly, so I would say that this is indeed a bug.</p>

<span>ntoskrnl.exe</span> was crashing each time I was Signing in or Signing out from any user account. After the crash, it was creating two .dmp files into C:\Windows\LiveKernelReports\win32k.sys and C:\Windows\LiveKernelReports.

 I reset my PC and just updated Windows. After I restarted my PC, same issue. Looks like one of the updates showing in the attached snapshot is causing this issue.</p>

</p><p>I was having this issue since I installed this update last month. I reset my machine to find the cause of that issue. After I reset the PC, I didn't install any third party software or driver. I just updated Windows and right after that, I started having
 the same issue. When I uninstalled the update, the issue was gone. By the way, I reinstalled the update to check it and the issue came back again.<br />
<br />
Here are my findings.<br />
<br />
This issue was creating two dump files. One small, which is usually less than 290 KB and the second one which is up to 900 MB.</p>

</p><p>It is an issue with the cumulative update, accept it or not. There was an issue with Regedit.exe in one of the previous builds of Windows 10 and some people here were not ready to accept it. In this case, when I remove that cumulative update, the issue is
 gone and when I install it back, the issue is back.</p>

            <p>I am in IT. You're just repeating some of these questions. I don't know what you are trying to gain from these repeated questions. To me, most of the questions you asked me are unrelated to this issue. Look at the Crash Report snapshots I have attached in
 this thread and try to figure out the cause. I am also working on this issue and hopefully, I will be able to figure it out pretty soon. Here are the answers to the questions you asked me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I DID NOT upgrade from any Window. It was a clean install. I wiped the hard disk and re-installed Windows 10 from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. I wiped the hard disk and installed Windows 10 from scratch. I used Windows 8.1 activation key to activate Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When I open the link you provided with Edge or Internet Explorer it says: You have version 24,0,0,194 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. KB3211320 is installed and after I ran Windows Update, it did offer me to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. <span>ntoskrnl.exe</span>&nbsp;still crashing when I Sign in to a User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <span>ntoskrnl.exe</span>&nbsp;still crashing when I Sign out of a User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, KB3213986 is already installed.</p>

            <p>About the best you could do is to add the movie to your storyboard, then from the preview, take a snapshot which saves an image of the first frame as a .png file. Press the 'L' key to go forward one frame and then repeat. It will be pretty tedious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, look for third-party tools that are designed to break a video into a series of images. I can't think of any off the top of my head, but I'm sure you can search on your own for such a tool.</p>

<h2>            Skype number not accepting calls &#47;&#47; Standard fix doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I've had a Skype number for quite some time now and it was working great. For exactly how long I'm not sure but it no longer is accepting calls. I can call people just fine but if anyone tries to call me they say they get some strange message sometimes in
 another language and I don't get any sort of notification. It's very difficult when trying to communicate with clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a mac and I've checked out that link everyone links (https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10615/why-am-i-not-receiving-calls-to-my-skype-number) to about how you should check your privacy settings to make sure "<span style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)">"Under&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)">Receive

 seems to allow me to accept calls.</span></p>

    <title>This copy of Windows is not genuine &#40;Vista&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ross flecknoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            This copy of  Windows is not genuine &#40;Vista&#41;</h2>
                    OS: Windows Vista Home Premium (x32)<br />
<br />
There is small type at the bottom right hand corner of the screen, right above the task bar that reads:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista (TM)<br />
Build 6002<br />
This copy of Windows is not genuine<br />
<br />
Also, when ever i start up the computer, it gives me a message equivalent to running "slui.exe 4" in the Run program. It reads:<br />
<br />
The Windows Vista Home Premium product key you typed is invalid for activation<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To activate Windows you will need to use the automated phone system. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (then there are three links)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the automated phone system<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy a new product key online<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type a different product key<br />
<br />
I haven't entered a product key since i first got the computer. This started to happen after the computer was in the shop for retrieving photos from the dead computer after failing to install the Service Pack 2 successfully. The people in the shop got the photos
 and magically restored windows vista. However, i lost<br />
all the pre-installed programs (Word, Powerpoint, etc)<br />
<br />
However, before the restoration of Windows in the shop, it was a x64 bit computer. Now it reads x32.
<br />
I want to upgrade the computer to a Windows 7 x64, and after some research I came up with two options:<br />
<br />
1. Buy Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium (full version)<br />
Using a custom install, i will get x64 Windows 7. <br />
<br />
2. Buy Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade (need vista)<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">****THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART****</span><br />
Because my vista is not genuine, does that mean i cant use this upgrade version to get windows 7? This upgrade version is considerably cheaper.
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for reading this wall of text. <br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The people in the shop never used the Recovery partition to do the reinstall,&nbsp;if it was still there and if the Hard Drive was not damaged.</p>
<p>If they had, you would have the same 64bit&nbsp;Operating System and preinstalled&nbsp;Programs&nbsp;as it was when you bought it.</p>
<p>They have used a different disk to reinstall Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;I was you, I'd take it back to them and tell them to fix it correctly and make sure it is Activated before accepting it back..</p>
<p>Your other option is to contact your Computer manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks and reinstall it yourself.</p>
<p>They normally do that for a small cost; but the trouble is these days is that some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery disks available to send you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key&nbsp;determines which Edition is installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Which takes you back to what I think the shop did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>In order to use upgrade media to install Windows 7 on a blank hard drive, users must abide by the operating system's EULA, or end-user licensing agreement (
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/Documents/UseTerms/Windows%207_Home%20Premium_English_a0cdb148-2381-47cd-bfc9-9b9102e0cb28.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download PDF</a> ). "<strong>To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the</strong>
<strong>upgrade</strong>. After you upgrade, you may no longer use the software you upgraded from," the EULA states.</p>
<p>That, said Ligman, means users must either have a "full" retail license of Windows XP or Vista, or assuming the Windows 7 upgrade is applied to an existing PC, that the upgrade is done on that same machine, which has a so-called "OEM" license attached to
 it.</p>
<p>"There are many, many, many, many of you out there that already own Windows licenses that qualify for the Windows 7 Upgrade, so this is a non-issue for you," said Ligman. "For you, since you have the previous version FULL Windows license and qualify for
 the Windows 7 Upgrade, you have the rights to do a 'clean' install."</p>

<h2>            Media Center Automatic Startup</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully installed WMC on Windows 8 Pro 32. What I'm missing is the option to configure WMC to automatically start when the PC starts up. In Windows 7 WMC the Options sections included a setting to automatically start Media Center when Windows
 starts. This option no longer exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I make Media Center startup automatically?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Kind of hard to upgrade my HTPC to Windows 8 because of it.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>Although there is a work around to create a new schedule task when the user logs on and start the WMC, the task execute with success after log on but, the start screen is displayed on top and WMC is playing at the background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone knows a workaround for this...</p>

<h2>            New version forced on us sucks</h2>
                    So we are being stuck with new version, and it has less settings takes up more room.&nbsp; Cant do as much with it.&nbsp; You say its better, but better for who?&nbsp; I want the classic back.&nbsp; It was nicer looking took up less room on my desktop and could do alot more
 with it.&nbsp; I hate the fact I cannot remove the contact list from the big ugly box for chat.&nbsp; I like to talk to more than one person at a time or groups and now its a pain in the butt, having all the convos in one box instead of having them seperate. This might
 be alright for some1 that only uses their computer for talking instead of doing other things as well and to me its only good if you want to talk/type to one person at a time..but it sucks for people who actually can do more than one thing at a time.&nbsp; Skype
 has been going down hill and fast ever since microsoft took over, and if things dont actually change for the better and soon I am guessing I will have to go else where.

<h2>            Win 7 StartupRepairOffline fails with OsVersionMismatch</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Lenovo ThinkPad SL510 and it can't boot because of missing or currupt data.</div>
<div><u><b><br />
</b></u></div>
<div><b><u>The</u></b><b> problem:</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Boot Manager: Windows failed to start -</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>File: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\Windows\system32\winload.exe</div>
<div>Status: &nbsp;0xc000000f</div>
<div>Info: &nbsp; &nbsp; The selected entry could not be loaded because the application is missing or currupt.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u><b>What I did:</b></u></div>
<div>Because there was no chance of getting Windows running I saved everything on the harddrive to an external Storage using the KNOPPIX live DVD.</div>
<div>(So the data should be save)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To solve the startup problem I downloaded and burned a Win 7 Home Premium DVD.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(Win 7 was already installed on the notebook but no DVD included)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I try to "Startup repair" the system by booting from the DVD I get the following problemsignature: (no USB-devices connected)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>eventname: StartupRepairOffline</div>
<div>probsig01: 0.0.0.0</div>
<div>probsig02: 6.1.7600.16385</div>
<div>probsig03: unknown</div>

<div>osversion:&nbsp;6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1</div>
<div>id:&nbsp;1031</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"System Restore" didn't work.</div>
<div>I haven't got a system image to recover from.</div>
<div>I already checked the memory with the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool and the system passed the test. (No problems detected)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system ran stable before this error occured and I didn't change anything in the hardware setting since then.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried to fix the MBR by using the Command prompt and the following commands:</div>
<div>"Bootrec.exe /FixMbr" and "Bootrec.exe /FixBoot"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I tried what Dena B described in: (instead of using C: I used X:)</div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/cant-boot-os-version-mismatch/0d221a27-a569-4998-b64d-f1c01a54cfd3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/cant-boot-os-version-mismatch/0d221a27-a569-4998-b64d-f1c01a54cfd3</a></div>
<div>Renaming of the Software-folder is not possible because another process is using it.</div>
<div>Therefore I didn't complete these steps.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would be nice if anybody could help me with this problem.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You have tried some of these however run through them again. Try EasyBCD if needed.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>This is&nbsp;a serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support<br />
from&nbsp;a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores)
<br />
or your&nbsp;System maker's Support.</strong> <br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup.
<br />
Set the boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows 7 disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Windows 7 or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these
<br />
though the titles are named differently.)<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)<br />

own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
<strong>If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />
</strong>Often a these&nbsp;disks will help when the OEM Recovery Disk does not.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7 disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />

    <title>Want to Enable Built-In Mic With Headset Connected &#40;Combo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> palaven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want to Enable Built-In Mic With Headset Connected &#40;Combo Jack&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I have a sort of funny situation.&nbsp; I have a two-prong headset but the microphone element on it is broken (I think it has a loose wire because it makes a terrible sound to anyone listening).&nbsp; So on my old laptop I would only plug-in in the headphone portion,
 leave the microphone unplugged, and talk through my built-in mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that I just bought a new laptop that uses Windows 10 and has a combo jack.&nbsp; When I plug in just the headphone portion, I can hear sound through my headphones (like I should) but it also disables the built-in mic.&nbsp; I looked for appropriate sound
 settings but couldn't find any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I enable my built-in mic to function as normal when I have my headset plugged in?&nbsp; Apparently I have the Realtek audio installed, as it came on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

    <title>Hololens and Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr nadroj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hololens and Xbox</h2>
                    A couple years ago I came across an article &nbsp;discussing a new invention that Microsoft came out with. The title was called the Hololens. After reading about it, I then decided to follow the lens throughout the process. At this point in time there has only
 been two versions of the device. First one being the mechanical engineering follow by i guess the beta. So I’m curious, will there be a hololens game addition. For the most part hololens focus more on job related matters, but not so much for gaming. Other
 than Minecraft that is. Most of the other competitors have &nbsp;introduce a vr style game for their platform, but not Xbox. Do you think this could be groundbreaking for Xbox if the hololens contributes with the console? Also if you haven’t heard about the Hololens
 or read about it yet, then please do. Very cool invention!

            I don't think HoloLens has any real place as a peripheral to Xbox, short of using HoloLens to project the game to the headset. There have been some HoloLens things related to gaming, mainly Minecraft but I don't think there's been much of a gaming focus
 at the moment. Hopefully when they bring out the third generation of the technology, we might see some more focus on gaming.

            There has been speculation as to the introduction of mixed reality but untill there is an official announcement, that is all it will be. Would I like to see mixed reality, yep a very big yep. We will just have to wait and see what comes along at E3.

<p>So yes as you stated HoloLens is mainly used in business matters. The majority of gaming wouldn't benefit from HoloLens, I don't see a place where it comes in to play in games like Halo, Ori, or Gears. Wouldn't make much sense. At that point it would be
 a glorified VR headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know Microsoft has been tinkering with the idea of Mixed Reality. At my local Microsoft store they actually have a Mixed Reality demo presentation with a short VR Halo game(exciting stuff). If they plan to take it anywhere? I'm not sure. Places like
 GDC, E3, and Gamescom are primarily where we'll get updates!</p>

            It’s still in the early stages so it will be hard to tell. Far as pricing goes the &nbsp;mechanical engineering version was priced at 3k but the H2 was priced in at 3.5k. They are putting the money into it however the price wouldn’t be worth it as a gaming
 device. Like CyberSpero said, it would be a glorified vr set. Unless they make a game version of it that is cheaper than the other two then I don’t see it happening. This does make a great &nbsp;discussion though!&nbsp;

            The thing with VR is that it still in development all the VR out there in the very earlyvstages none of them are fully fledged and the evolutikn of the product will depend on what components are made in the future to make it better

<p>I try to delete old pdf files and get the message 'The action can't be completed because the file is open in another program'. I've checked and double checked and can't find them open in any program at all.

<h3> richardjohnson_78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows has detected a hard disk problem</h2>
                    System Specifications:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>AMD Athlon x64 X2 Dual Core CPU 5600</div>
<div>3.25 GB memory&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows Vista Home Premium x32</div>
<div>Service Pack 1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As soon as the desktop fully loads, a "Microsoft Windows" message box appears indicating that "Windows has detected a hard disk problem." It offers two solutions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A. Back up files.</div>
<div>B. Ask me again later.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cleared temp files. Checked for possible threats.</div>
<div>Combofix reports no adversely affected files.</div>
<div>Malwarebytes and Spybot report no infections.</div>
<div>TDSSKiller found no files to be infected.</div>
<div>Pulling the HDD and scanning for possible instances of TDL4 that kill TDSSKiller on the local machine found nothing.</div>
<div>Microsoft Security Essentials failed to locate any possible infection.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ran HDD Regenerator and MHDD 1.4</div>
<div>Both programs report no failed/bad sectors.</div>
<div>RAM Tests indicate all memory modules to be in good operational condition and free of any errors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My biggest concern is that if this is a legitimate Windows error message, why is the Event Viewer failing to show any instance of disk error or filesystem failure?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The other issue is that Windows Vista is running smoothly and responsively, under basic operations as well as stress tests, which is inconsistent with a possible HDD failure.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suggestions?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check for Smart or other drive checking settings in the BIOS - often F2 as you boot so watch the screen.<br />
Check with your system maker (motherboard maker for custom systems) and ask in their forums (if any).<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure to keep<br />
redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These are much more efficient methods to check the disk.<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do
<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same 32 or 64 bit and they are not copy
<br />
protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already
<br />
own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />

This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
