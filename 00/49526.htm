<h2>            Buying points for a child</h2>
                    
<p><span><span><span>hello all,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The time has come to purchase some points for my daughter, but there are some things I don't understand:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I looked at the family Gold package and I can't see any indication of how many points you get for
 your 12 month subscription. So it's just a set of privileges and no actual points?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There's nothing else that really grabs me in the advertised menu for 'Gold membership', so it seems
 like a lot of trouble to go to just to get points that all the family can use.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Then, when you click on the 'subscribe to Family Gold' button, the thing that I'm actually interested
 in (distributing points to family members) is not ticked!<span>&nbsp; </span>
Is this a glitch in Microsoft's sales system?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;(was hoping to post a screenshot here, but I can't see it as I write this so looks like the chat box didn't
 accept it)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>So it seems my options are:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Buy the points in my name and then let my daughter use them by letting her sign in as me.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>As her parental controller I can temporarily give her permission to buy, so the credit card is then used under her xbox ID, then go back
 and block the permission again – is that what most people do? Still seems a bit of a runaround..</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Many thanks, Mr Anderson</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">MS Points are bought seperately from a Gold Subscription. If you use the Family Gold Plan you can allocate and distribute points to the other members under that plan. If you do not
 have the FGP then you can not do that. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">If you buy the points on your account then whatever is downloaded will be associated with your account. If you want it associated with your daughters account she will need to download
 it with hers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">If you are not a FGP member then what you should do is just buy a points card from a retail shop and redeem it on her account. Do not just give the card to her and let her redeem
 it at a later date. Too many children have fallen victim to phishing scams where another player offers to do something for them in a game in exchange for ms points.

<p>Another thought though.. &nbsp; How do the scammers get kids to transfer points if they're not part of an FGP? &nbsp;- &nbsp;isn't there an opening there for the parent to transfer to the child in the same way?</p>

<p>Once you use the card points can not be transferred. &nbsp;If you enter the code the most your child can really do is spend it fast. Just make sure they don't have access to the code. A good thing to do is make sure the child does not know the account password.
 That way they cant give it out. Take a look at this post <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/general_discussion/f/20/p/13445/85143.aspx#85143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Buying points for child, part II</p>
<p>Ok, I bought the card, and worked out how to upload the points to my child's account (couldn't do it via the TV/console, so tried via PC - &nbsp; MUCH EASIER!)</p>
<p>But.... &nbsp; &nbsp;she still can't redeem the points!!!</p>
<p>Can someone tell me where I went wrong in this sequence?</p>
<p>1. Via TV screen, connect to xbox live under child's ID, confirm that the points appear in her account.</p>
<p>2. Go to Bazar. Choose game. select 'purchase'. &nbsp;Message appears "Please go to parental control section and authorize purchases for this user" (or something like that)</p>
<p>3. I discover that parental control is not even activated on my system. so I activate it.</p>
<p>4. Bazar now appears absolutely empty of content !!!</p>
<p>5. go to My Xbox, check configuration. Aha! &nbsp;The third pane (Security online) says she's set to 'Child' security setting, which includes 'purchases not permitted' among all the other restrictions.</p>
<p>6. Select 'change configuration', Choose "Personalize". Reset to allow purchases.</p>
<p>7. Still no content in the Bazar !!!</p>
<p>8. resort to forum &nbsp;(and strongly consider trading in the Xbox for something more user friendly)</p>

<p>Thanks Fyerball</p>
<p>We finally managed it! &nbsp; In the end, I had to switch my daughter's account to Adult, then made the purchase, and then switched her back to Child. &nbsp; &nbsp;So it seems the Personalization option doesn't work.</p>

<p>When you set up a Child account. There is no way to know if they are in the next room or another town. In order for your child to use points you must verify that you are giving permission. This can be done on xbox.com. I think there are several methods of
 verification. I do not believe it can be done via the Xbox, but I am unsure.</p>

    <title>Mouse Operations &#38; Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse Operations &#38; Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple question for a Engineer. Microsoft <strong>IS</strong> aware that there's a problem with the mouse operation? It worked fine 2 weeks ago, I'm guessing maybe it came from a Windows Update that is now forced down our throats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Highlighting text takes several tries- if it does 'take', and not disappear when you release the button, it only highlights part of the text.</p>
<p>Clicking once on a file to select it to delete it will act like a double click and open it.</p>
<p>Clicking on a file's text to rename it, will act like a double click and open it.</p>
<p>Dragging the window to move the file on the screen, acts like a double click, and maximize it...etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've been in Devices/Mouse Settings.</p>
<p>Yes, I have double click speed almost all the way to the left.</p>
<p>Yes, I've tried making the right button the primary to eliminate hardware failure (no difference).</p>
<p>No, I haven't tried another mouse; Googling this showed me that 7/8 of the planet are asking the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thank you Rekesh! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Troubleshooter reported that it found something, and the problem is better, not altogether gone, but I think we're on the right track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try step 2 at a later time.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Sorry Rakesh, I unmarked your answer as the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had the same problems all day long. There was a Windows Update installed the night before. Before that update everything worked fine. :( &nbsp;Anyway, later this evening, another WinUpdate was installed...and voila! No more wonky mouse problems. :)</p>

            Hi Shaun
<br />
<br />I am sorry, that is correct, the newer Skype Apps will not run on Windows Vista, minimum Windows 7 is required for Skype
<br />
<br />If you have the Chrome browser, you may be able to run the Web App - log into <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />If not, you may need to upgrade your system to Windows 7 - your Vista licence key may cover that upgrade . . .

<p><span><span>By default, the Handwriting recognition personalization tool opens for your default input language. If you have more than one input language installed,

            <p><span>I finally managed to get the normal OneDrive icon back. How I did it? I'm not sure what helped as I was tweaking around.</span></p>
<p><span>I did a batch file with following code in it:</span></p>
cls<br />
<br />
set x86="%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe"<br />
set x64="%SYSTEMROOT%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe"<br />
<br />
echo Closing OneDrive process.<br />
echo.<br />
taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
ping 127.0.0.1 -n 5 &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
<br />
echo Uninstalling OneDrive.<br />
echo.<br />
if exist %x64% (<br />
%x64% /uninstall<br />
) else (<br />
%x86% /uninstall<br />
)<br />
ping 127.0.0.1 -n 5 &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
<br />
echo Removing OneDrive leftovers.<br />
echo.<br />
rd "%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive" /Q /S &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1<br />

<br />
echo Removing OneDrive from the Explorer Side Panel.<br />
echo.<br />
REG DELETE "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{018D5C66-4533-4307-9B53-224DE2ED1FE6}" /f &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
REG DELETE "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{018D5C66-4533-4307-9B53-224DE2ED1FE6}" /f &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
<br />
pause</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>and run it. That uninstalled my OneDrive.</span></p>
<p><span>After that I navigated to "C:\Windows\WinSxS\wow64_microsoft-windows-onedrive-setup_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.10240.16384_none_37955d2cf51e580f"</span></p>
<p><span>and run OneDriveSetup.exe (maybe this is default location for OneDrive setup on Windows 10).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After that I noticed that in my case the icon changes from normal to plain when I add my account to OneDrive. That gave me thinking there is a possibility that the problem is also in online OneDrive folder.</span></p>
<p><span>I uninstalled OneDrive once again (with batch above), went to my online OneDrive and unlink all computers that were linked.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After unlinking all the computers I installed OneDrive again (with OneDriveSetup.exe) this time I have selected to synchronise
<strong>only </strong>Documents folder. I have also unchecked "Let me use OneDrive to fetch any of my files on this PC".</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now my folder is a normal one.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think that Navneet's procedure to
<strong><span>reset OneDrive following</span></strong> this steps will also do the trick, as long as you unlink all computers from OneDrive online.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You&nbsp;can reset OneDrive by doing the following:</span></p>

    <title>Connecting Microsoft Bluetooth Designer Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cody thiery  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting Microsoft Bluetooth Designer Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>After replacing the batteries in my Microsoft Designer Keyboard I am unable to connect to my computer. I have tried connecting to my wife's HP Pavilion and I am using a Surface Pro 3. I press and held the pair button until the esc key blinks white and tried
 going through the bluetooth pairing steps. My surface finds the keyboard and attempts to pair and asks for a passkey to be entered on the keyboard followed by the enter key. Each attempt I get the message "Try connecting your device again." I called support
 four times and each time my call was dropped when they said they would transfer me to the correct person. Two reps asked for my number and one asked for my email but neither called me back after disconnecting the call. I have reset the keyboard, restarted
 my computer, and installed all updates. The driver is no where to be found on Microsoft's page but the mouse is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why will the keyboard not pair to my computer?</p>

<p>Cody the problem is well know to Microsoft and forums are full of complains.. both Designer Bluetooth keyboard and mouse either don't pair or disconnect repeatedly as in my case. i have an acer aspire 5 with Intel bluetooth driver regularly updated but it's
 virtually impossible for me to type any text with designer keyboard, the connection is so unstable that it results in continuous mistyping errors, and this goes on already for 1 year pushing me to buy a traditional cable connected keyboard to be able to work.
 Same was for mouse... practically impossible to use , is was making me losing so much time and nerves that after a month it flew against the wall of my office leaving the space for a traditional cheaper and perfectly working old style cabled mouse...</p>
<p>in two words a big loss of money, time , nerves </p>

<h2>            How to access a denied folder</h2>
                    <p>In folder c:\users\Number_6, I know there's a folder called Start Menu.&nbsp; But that folder does not show up when I use File Explorer.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>when I use Agent Ransack to show all folders named Start Menu, it brings up that folder; but when I double-click on that entry when Agent Ransack brings it up, I get a message saying c:\users\Number_6 is not accesable&nbsp; access is denied."&nbsp; (Number_6 is the
 name of the user of this computer, along with Administrator). <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
How can I set up File Explorer to show all files in a folder?&nbsp; And then how can I access that folder?

            Hi Howard
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, temporarily tick 'Hidden Items'
<br />
<br />If you are logged into that Number_6 account, paste this into the Address bar of File Explorer and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu
<br />
<br />If you are logged into the other Administrator account, navigate to this folder:
<br />
<br />C:\Users\\Number_6\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu

<p>The <strong>Start Menu</strong> "folder" in your user profile folder is actually a junction point created for backwards compatibility:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49689d06-7817-4755-ac6b-3709c33bb602?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49689d06-7817-4755-ac6b-3709c33bb602?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As others have already noted, the actual <strong>Start Menu</strong> folder is under
<strong>Appdata</strong>. The quickest way to navigate to this folder is to type <strong>
shell:start menu</strong> in the <strong>Explorer </strong>Address bar or a <strong>
Run</strong> dialog.</p>

            I've been having this problem for days now, ms support can't fix it after hours with remote access. My windows is authenticated and activated and double checked. ALL the ms fixes don't work so far. It is going level 2 call tomorrow. I even tried to install
 free win 10. But guess what, it got stuck on&nbsp;updates and woulden't in stall. No viruses checked that too. Tech checked as well. My Apple friends are laughing at me right now and it makes me feel crappy. I used to be able to reformat and all was well. Now even
 that doesn't work. I am close to change now. Good luck to you. So much time wasted sitting in front of this system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Found the following information hidden in a forum on superuser.com, modified it to make the process easier to follow:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Navigate to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3138612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3138612</a></p>
<p>2. Scroll down the page, find and download the appropriate version for your computer</p>
<p>3. Stop the Windows Update service. To do this, run the command prompt as administrator, as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">a. Click Start</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">b. Type 'cmd' (without the quotes)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">c. Right-click the cmd icon that appears in the search results</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">d. Click 'Run as administrator'</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1889118b-b3d3-4612-9001-3b37941aa87a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1889118b-b3d3-4612-9001-3b37941aa87a" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">e. If you are prompted to confirm this action, click 'Yes' and continue</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">f. In the black window that opens, type 'net stop wuauserv'&nbsp;(without the quotes) and hit the 'Enter' key</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">g. A confirmation message will appear in the black box indicating the service was successfully stopped.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">h. Close the black box</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Install the update you downloaded in step 1 above</p>
<p>5. When prompted, restart your computer</p>
<p>6. Now try to run Windows Update normally</p>
<p />

<p>What you described happened on another PC I worked on. After I let it sit overnight, it found and installed the updates. I do not know why some computers respond this way, but the process seems to work eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did your updates end up installing?</p>

<h2>            How do I reset my Windows 7 Laptop to factory settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I have a HP Probook 4530s that is running windows 7.</p>
<p>I want to reset it to factory settings but ran into a problem.</p>
<p>I have the correct iso to reboot it but my CD's are only 700mb and the file is 3.1gb.</p>
<p>I tried using imgburn and gearISO burn but they wont let me just split it.</p>
<p>I also tried putting in a USB drive but the laptop says it wants a cd.</p>
<p>I tried putting in a different copy of windows 7 I own in but it says it doesnt match or something</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me find a way to split the ISO onto several CD's or reset my laptop using the usb!</p>

<h2>            Is it ok to keep my Sculpt Keyboard USB plugged in and can I buy the mouse separate&#63;</h2>
                    I am using my new sculpt ergonomic keyboard business on my macbook air.&nbsp; My question is - is it ok to leave the usb plugged in or does that drain the battery on my keyboard?&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to know so I can preserve some battery life.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Second question is if I buy the mouse separately - can it use the same USB dongle that came with my keyboard? I don't want to have to use two usb slots for these two products.&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
The mouse I want to buy is the microsoft ergonomic one that sometimes comes with this particular keyboard.&nbsp; I just couldn't afford to buy it all at once and I still have a working mouse so didn't.&nbsp; They sometimes come together but they also sell them separately
 so that's why I'm asking about the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse - can it use the same dongle as the corresponding keyboard?&nbsp;

<p>Demo e uma parte do jogo, normalmente uma parte boa do jogo ou o começo do jogo, mas vc não tem o jogo completo, mesmo tendo baixado ele, no caso dos arcades se vc não comprar só joga uma parte, comprando libera o jogo completo q já ta baixado (no caso dos

<p>My wifi is working (full bars). I can go the web with all of my browsers, so I am surely online. However, Skype says I am offline. How can I fix this? I am working on a MacBook Pro. Network Preferences shows that I am connected. Please help.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>And of the off chance you're using a Mac (given that you've posted in the Mac section...), it's most likely that Skype is telling you that SKYPE is offline, not that your computer is. &nbsp;Solution: while Skype is running, &nbsp;right-click (or click/hold) the Skype
 icon in the Dock. &nbsp;Choose Status, then select Online. &nbsp;There are other ways to accomplish the same thing, but this is easiest. &nbsp;That should do it...</p>

<h2>            Mouse and keyboard Centre not recognising built in Surface Book keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have Microsoft Surface Book with built in keyboard. Need to build a macro to replay keystrokes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So installed Mouse and Keyboard Centre but it just says "No supported device detected".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers are up to date. All troubleshooting I've read suggest resolutions for various specific external wireless keyboards/mice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would expect the built in&nbsp;keyboard of a Microsoft Surface Book to be recognisesd,&nbsp; surely?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That was strange. To ensure that everything will be working fine, you need to check for and install the latest
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">update</a></strong>, then re-install the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/downloads/mouse-keyboard-center#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center</a></strong>. If the issue persists, you can run the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong> to check for possible software issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>You may need to find a third-party keyboard macro utility.&nbsp; It looks like MMKC does not support Surface keyboards.&nbsp; An alternative would be getting a real keyboard which the MMKC did support.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you have just made me realize that I have never tried to find out what MMKC would do if it had keyboard focus and I used an assignable key on my Surface screen cover.&nbsp; I suppose a simpler test to start with would be to see if mskey sees that too.</p>

    <title>Wrongly Suspended - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeewhizzie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrongly Suspended</h2>
                    My account was suspended,&nbsp;June 30, 2018, 7:23:23 AM to&nbsp;July 1, 2018, 11:23:23 AM for an inappropriate custom gamer picture. I claim I was wrongly suspended because my custom gamer picture did not break any code&nbsp;of conduct.
<div>All you see in this Photo is a male figure in the possession&nbsp;of three handguns. In light of this, I do see how this could be conveyed as a controversial subject with gun control, but as we are still given the right to bare arms I see no harm, also while
 no bias&nbsp;opinion is shown, there really is no saying on the matter. And in case it is thought of as violent, guns are not the instruments of violence, people are.&nbsp;Secondly, if you wanted to make the argument that this had sexual content because the male figure
 is missing the top half of his&nbsp;apparel. We see it everyday at&nbsp;the beach, or on the sidewalk! Please&nbsp;I just want to be able to use this photo again after my suspension is&nbsp;lifted. Thank you</div>

            <blockquote><p>JeeWhizzie I'm astound that you kept&nbsp;showing your ignorance in here and its now using a&nbsp;senior citizen&nbsp;brandishing gun to bring up your&nbsp;hideous American rights,&nbsp;&nbsp;Why you don't understand that Microsoft's has a Code of conduct we both posted in here and the reason why your image is a&nbsp;that is why the&nbsp;Enforcement team banned your&nbsp;Gansta wannabe&nbsp;gun&nbsp;touting&nbsp;image, if you think nothing is wrong with it then try to do that in real life with a couple of "BLACK" officers and see if they won't cuff you or worst.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Keep on showing your stubbornness and lack of respect for the XBL community rules then see if you won't get suspended again, just so you know there is a permanent banned for people who never learn with their mistakes. <br /></p> 
 </blockquote> <p>First of all, how dare you use the word “Black” in this day in age, don’t you know how controversial that is? Secondly, I’m pretty sure guns are a big deal in this community, aren’t they? I mean we’ve all played call of duty am I right? Or even halo, doesn’t halo have guns? Aren’t there default profile pictures you can choose that ‘brandish’ guns? Fake guns or not,&nbsp;it really doesn’t matter. If I posted a picture with a replica gun or something that looks like a gun it’s still gonna get the same attention as if it were real, in this day and age you can’t deny that. So with that in mind,&nbsp;why should there be default profile pictures with guns. Maybe we should censor video games too, because apparently this community as you put it,&nbsp;doesn’t like guns.</p>
