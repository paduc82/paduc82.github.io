<p>Hi</p>
<p><span><span>How did you install Microsoft Money 2000 on your older computer? Did you lose the installation media?</span></span></p>

<h2>            Media has stopped playing in Windows 10</h2>
                    Since a recent update, my PC has stopped playing media files. Groove music and WMP don't play files, no error message, they just don't play the files. iTunes has also stopped playing files, either those on my hard drive or from the iTunes Store. When I
 try to play a track it just sits there at 0.00 again with no error message. The videos in the Sky News app also have stopped playing, just telling me an unknown error has occurred. Given this problem is across 3 different app from 3 different companies and
 that both files on my HD and those that are streamed are affected, I have to think this is a Windows problem. I saw in the error reporting thing others have this problem too. It started after the big update a couple of weeks ago that caused Edge to show all
 the "Get started with Edge" screens again and iTunes to think it was on a new PC until I restarted it. A subsequent update has not solved the problem. Interestingly, music files will play with Irfanview. Groove I couldn't care about

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the format of the files?</p>
<p>Have you updated the drivers for the iTunes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an option "Go back to previous build" in Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Recovery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then clicking the button would initiate the rollback. Try to rollback to previous build and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>Not displaying video in the main Skype window - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not displaying video in the main Skype window</h2>
                    Just updated to the latest Skype version and I cannot see the incoming video for the party I am speaking to in the MAIN Skype window. If I click outside the window and the smaller pop-up call window opens I can see the incoming video for the&nbsp;other party
 there, but in the main window I see the blue Skype background and their profile picture. The previous version I was using just a few minutes ago worked fine, I am obviously receiving the video feed as I can see it in the pop-up window. What is the solution?
 Thanks

            Hi  AJ, this does seem to be one of the reported bugs in the new Skype App
<br />
<br />The new Skype app requires some work, for the moment, you should install Skype Classic until this new App is updated . . .
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

<h2>            System Error&#58;E100 00000703 80910002 and the tale of a greedy Microsoft policy</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I purchased an Xbox One S for my baby sister on Black Friday of 2017. A day before her birthday(3/8/2019) it automatically updated and bricked her console, Happy Bday from Xbox. Went to the support page and contacted a representative, walked through all
 the troubleshooting that I had already attempted on my own to be told that for 160$ I could ship them my little sisters 14 month old, just out of warranty, Xbox for repair. I paid 189$ for it brand new....($189+$160=$349 for a working One S????) Needless to
 say Im not happy. I have purchased 5 xbox Ones this generation. 2 OG, 2 One S and my One X, do the math. In a climate where xbox is leagues behind the competition, they negate true customer service for greed. And then wonder why people are flocking to Sony
 and Nintendo. Not to say that the situation would be any different on the other consoles, but my PS4 has never had an issue but then neither has My xbox. And to be fair out of the 5 Xbox consoles I have purchased only 1 has&nbsp;<strong>[Mod&nbsp;Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>&nbsp;out.
 But that leaves a sad girl on her bday, an upset big brother and the potential of several fans lost. Xbox doesn't seem to care. Well, I do. So, enough about my situation, for I am eager that I will fix this problem and I wish to share my thoughts and findings
 on this matter to hopefully further help another capable Xbox fan where MS has turned their backs. Ill start with what I have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I do not know the details that led to the initial failure as we found the Xbox in this state. It is set to auto update and upon my Little sisters finishing of homework she retired to her room to play a few rounds of fortnite as kids these days do. Thats
 when I got the phone call from my mother. She informed me that the xbox was frozen on an update screen that just wouldn't progress. I chalked it up to my mother maybe being a little out of the technical loop and figured that super hero big brother would swoop
 in and save the xbox in no time. Boy was I wrong, kinda. So I go to my mothers and find the Xbox exactly as she claimed. Frozen on step 3 of 3 At around 58% with the error found in the title. So I attempted several factory resets. several attempts saving apps
 and games, several attempts erasing everything. With Wifi and with network hardwired. I attempted a few offline updates with a formatted flash drive that cut off at 100% of step 2 of 3 (58% total) and booted to the same frozen progress page. Nothing seems
 to work. It all boots back to the same update screen, with the same progress bar and same step. Which leads me to believe that a mere 14 months into this Xbox life cycle its poor little HDD has bit the big one. I have found replacement HDD for around 50$-75$,
 less than half the price of Xbox repair service, so this is the step I will be taking. Because if I shell out 160$ for another console, Its not going to be another xbox. You can find various videos through google and/or youtube that show step by step tear
 downs, replacements, tools, etc... Some even have links to tried and true replacement parts. Just do your research and know, your console is already bricked so whats the harm. Of course if its still under warranty start there first. I have been successful
 in the past with Xbox 360 repairs of bricked consoles. Its fairly cut and dry and relatively easy so Im pretty certain i can indeed repair this console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I may be one person, but I purchased 5 consoles. Thats 5 consoles MS will lose next generation. Thats 5 missing xbox live subscriptions. 5 missing game pass subs. Seeing as Im not alone thats more people who will not buy another MS console replacement
 wise or next gen upgrade. This is the kind of situation that builds a strong loyal following. Why on earth would any body keep giving money to a company that neither acknowledges its faults or does anything to fix them that isn't monetarily fueled? This is
 why you lose fans Xbox. I was a fan until this point. And I really do hope MS wakes up and takes care of their customers instead of casting us to the wayside. And if not oh well, their loss. Not mine. My only hope is that this article will help someone else
 abandoned by MS. As Im sure that the forum police will more than likely removed this post I will post to another couple independent xbox forums as well.&nbsp; Dont pay them a cent more than whats needed.&nbsp;</p>

            You would be upset with whatever console you purchased under the same circumstances and to not think it happens with other devices is just a little shortsighted.&nbsp; Hopefully, you will get it resolved and your sister can go back to playing her favorite games.&nbsp;
 Good Luck.

<p>That's pretty common for any product that is out of warranty, if the company will even do anything with it after warranty anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, even though the console is out of warranty, self-repair does violate the terms of service so if you do successfully repair it, you would be putting the console at risk for being banned.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes i understand that. My point was that a mere 14 months have passed and the xbox is bricked by simply updating it. Warranty or not thats&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[Mod&nbsp;Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>&nbsp; and it is not a common occurence that lends its self to positive
 consumer feedback. Yes modding will get your console banned. But people upgrade their internal HD all the time with no recourse. Repairing an xbox has never been an issue, modding has. The fact that a 14 month old console even needs repair without a direct
 cause is in and of itself a bit perplexing. If my post is out of line than by all means remove, report or do whatever it is an ambassador does.&nbsp;

                    <p>I bought $75 worth of gift cards for Xbox Live and come to find out I can't use those gift cards to purchase original Xbox or Xbox 360 games from the marketplace. Is there a reason for this? Why can I only use that credit to buy Xbox One games?</p>

<h2>            How can I create Internet Print Provider credentials programmatically in Registry</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I want to install an Internet Printer [CUPS] programmatically. This has username &amp; password. Using command prompt I am able to install the printer using
<strong>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry. </strong>But I cannot print (Access denied). Doing a lot of research and manually registering using 'Add Printer' I see the registry details as below. I exported this registry details. Later I try using rundll32 and
 found no entry in the registry.This time I enter registry manually &amp; it worked. But my issue is I cannot use this same registry&nbsp;in another pc. Any workaround available?</p>

    <title>How do I file a complaint with Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> utanebe  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I file a complaint with Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>I originally called Microsoft support to get help with the blurry screen. The first agent logged into my computer using remove access control, and managed to change the "input timing value", which caused the screen to go black. This agent "Christopher M."
 disappeared and I haven't been able to see anything on my monitor ever since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called 3 times since but none of the other support agents have been able to fix this. In fact, the last agent tried to do portable media reboot by remote access control, and ended up corrupting the USB stick on my other laptop. Now I have to go buy a new
 USB stick tomorrow and go through the same process all over again. And each call takes about 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems every time I call support, they create more issues than to resolve them. I still need to get the first computer working again. Any suggestions on how to file a complaint and get this issue resolved?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I originally called Microsoft support to get help with the blurry screen. The first agent logged into my computer using remove access control, and managed to change the "input timing value", which caused the screen to go black. This agent "Christopher M."
 disappeared and I haven't been able to see anything on my monitor ever since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called 3 times since but none of the other support agents have been able to fix this. In fact, the last agent tried to do portable media reboot by remote access control, and ended up corrupting the USB stick on my other laptop. Now I have to go buy a new
 USB stick tomorrow and go through the same process all over again. And each call takes about 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems every time I call support, they create more issues than to resolve them. I still need to get the first computer working again. Any suggestions on how to file a complaint and get this issue resolved?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 UEFI setting not showing in advance setting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 UEFI setting not showing in advance setting</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to get UEFI enabled on my Lenovo M91P so I can install a larger than 2TB hard drive.&nbsp; I downloaded the latest BIOS and flashed it successfully.&nbsp; I can see the auto / legacy / UEFI boot option in the firmware setup screen, so it looks to be fully
 updated and that BIOS was written with UEFI in mind as it is stated so in the discription.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do the MSINFO the bios mode still reads Legacy, and I cannot find the UEFI box in the setup screen under settings - updated - recovery - restart now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is I used EaseUS partition master software tried to clone my old 2TB to the new 8TB and it works fine installed on its own up to the point I reset it from MBR to GTP.&nbsp; After that it will not boot, the image is ruined and I have to start
 to clone all over even though I select the boot as UEFI in the firmware screen after the MBR to GTP conversion and before it boots during the restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is will Win10 automatically see UEFI and adjust for it or is that only made active during the initial installation?&nbsp; This Win10 image was installed without UEFI as an option on this Lenovo at that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to not have to reload Win10 from scratch for this hard drive upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help</p>

<p>If you have the install media for your Current Win 10 version, you can run the install from within Windows.&nbsp; It will reinstall the current version and not overwrite your programs or data.</p>

<p>An OS has to be installed as UEFI for it to work that way.&nbsp; To install as UEFI you need to select the UEFI version of the&nbsp;install media, which must be available prior to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the install, a UEFI install will add four partitions and a Legacy install will only install two.&nbsp; The correct install media will set a drive up as necessary if it has been cleaned and contains no partitions.&nbsp; Configuring a drive as GPT prior to that
 time might put the MSR partition in the wrong location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways to convert back and forth and even Microsoft has the utility MBR2GPT.exe for that purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A UEFI install has a EFI System partition, which is easy to spot in Disk Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you do not know, if you are installing, your can use Shift+F10 on the second Install window to open a command prompt and run Diskpart to clean the drive, which of course wipes out any prior data.&nbsp; If you have a test drive you can play if you want,
 just be careful with any commands if another drive is attached.</p>

    <title>Multiple microphones stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ignacykup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple microphones stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
<br />
Recently when i turned on my pc i realised that my microphone stopped working from no particular reason , but it worked just fine on onther PC, so I reinstalled all the drivers, chceched every possible option in the recording devices, spend few hours on the
 multiple forums looking for answer or a similar case, but i couldn't find any.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then I plugged in my old microphone, and it was working again for like a week or so, and today again I have the same problem. Now the both microphones are not working on my PC, so i used third microphone build in the apple's headphones, and it barely works.<br />
<br />
By not working i mean that it barely detects any sound. I literaly have to scream and shout with the boost set to +30dB for mic to detect anything.
<br />
<br />
Looking forward for any help, and appologies for my spelling, english is not my native language, but I hope you can understand me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards, Ignacy</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, I bought an Xbox Microsoft points card from my local supermarket. It looked real and it had the 25 character code. When I tested this code its said, "This code is invalid. Please try again". I then tried it two more times and it still
 didn't work. On the reciept, it said "Card will be activated within 48 hours". 2 days later I try again and it still doesn't work. Can someone please give me advice on what to do?</p>

<p>Steps to try:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; Have someone else read the card to you. &nbsp; I often have problems with B and 8, for example.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Contact the store you bought it from and make sure they activated it.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; Wait a day and try again.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;If that doesn't fix it, call Xbox at 1-800-4-my-xbox and let them know.</p>

<p>I would suggest trying to Redeem the point through your Xbox and it will better help you, it could be that Your Xbox Live Billing account is locked and that it needs to be further helped by Xbox Support.</p>

<p>You should try to contact xbox support through 1-800-4-MY-XBOX or by requesting a call through the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a></p>
<p>Support can look up the code for you to see if it is activate or not and make sure nothing on your account is preventing it being redeemed.

<p>I agree with PhloydBarnum on this one, you should try more than just contacting Xbox Support for this issue, there may be little they can do if the code is already in use. After trying the steps above, you should take it back to your supermarket with the
 receipt to prove you have purchased it. </p>

<p>What might of happen when you purchased the card from the supermarket, he/she swiped it but did not activate it. I suggest going back with your receipt and asking for a refund. Explain that the card might not have been activated correctly. I hope this helps
 you get what you paid for. </p>

<p>I am having this same issue as well the xbox will boot up fine but if it is able to attempt to connect to live auto freeze even if I disconnect and then try to connect after the dashboard loads up. I had this happen one other time be for when I took a break
 from Skyrim and went back to turn on my 360 and the same thing. I believe it was a issue to do with the live servers well I hope they fix this as soon as possible because I know 100% for sure that its not my console since I am not the only one this is happening
 to hope service is restored soon missing BO2 already :(.</p>

    <title>UHD disk not playing. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            UHD disk not playing.</h2>
                    <p>I've seen quite a few topic of similar problems to mine on here, but mostly relating to movies released before a certain date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avengers Infinity War UHD doesn't work on my One S. It will freeze the loading circle and that's it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have no means to test the disc on another 4k player, the standard blu Ray version works fine, as does every other 4k title I've tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I've been through the troubleshooting. The problem isn't with UHD in general, but with a specific UHD disc. (Three other UHD discs work fine, that I've tried)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading up on it I noticed that there was an issue with some discs which were released before 2016 but this is a recent release (Avengers Infinity War)</p>
