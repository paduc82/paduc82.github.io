<h2>            Who produces Security Shield&#63;</h2>
                    Recently received pop-ups that prevented me from even connecting to internet. Went to "Windows Security Alerts" and a geen security shield popped up. Purchased acces to this and was charged $59.95. Was I scammed by this or is this a legitimate MSN product
 and protection?

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 805ab406</h2>
                    I'm having a problem downloading apps to my phone. Everytime I try to download something I keep getting error code 805ab406. Is there anyway I can fix this? And if you know how this happened will you please let me know. Because this is the second Windows
 Phone 7 I have had and both phones won't let me download anything. Ever since I've gotten the Windows Phone 7 I've had nothing but trouble. I would love the phone if it allowed me to download apps, but it won't let me. So any suggestions on how to fix this
 problem?

<h2>            Onenote 2010 won&#39;t sync notebooks with section groups to skydrive</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason my pc won't sync any of my notebooks with section groups to skydrive. &nbsp;All of my other notebooks are working fine. &nbsp;If I move the section groups out of the notebook that won't sync it works.</p>
<p>The message I am getting is:</p>
<p><strong>Onenote cannot create http://address... &nbsp;You may not have sufficient permissions or hard disk space.</strong></p>
<p>I have plenty of space and I am the owner of the skydrive with myself being the only person that has access.</p>
<p>Does skydrive not support section groups? &nbsp;I would think they would have a better error message if that was the case.</p>

<p>FIXED! Guess I spoke to soon about it just not working. &nbsp;I fixed it on my end. &nbsp;Unfortunately I followed a few steps and can't pinpoint which may have fixed it. &nbsp;Here is what I did though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Created a new section in the black section group on my PC and then deleted it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Opened the web skydrive version of the notebook, navitgated to the a note in the problem section group wrote a character then deleted it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In the web interface, I clicked "Open in OneNote"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OneNote started opening the notebook (and thankfully did not duplicate it), and nothing happened at first. &nbsp;Maybe 10 seconds later I saw the sync icon appear on the notebook, and saw that the section group was now populated. &nbsp;Any of the 3 steps could have
 likely individually triggered the sync. &nbsp;I wasn't getting an error like you before though.... it just ignored the section mysteriosly wi/o any error windows popping up. &nbsp;FWIW the section had been unsynced for 3 weeks until I did the steps above.</p>

<h2>            Cutover migration of multiple Exchange Org to same Office 365 Tenant</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to do a Cutover migration for 2 different Exchange Organization, to the same Office 365 Tenant.</p>
<p>I haven't see any limitation to do multiple Cutover migration for one Tenant, but i don't think we can do it simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Can we do multiple Cutover migration for the same Tenant, and do it simultaneously, or we need to finish and delete first the previous Cutover batch to create a new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There's limitations or problems to do multiple Cutover migration for the same Tenant?</p>
<p>(I think we need to have the Attributs PrimarySMTPAddress and DisplayName unique across the different Exchange Organization)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>H TylerD13,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to do one cut over at a time, test the migration and start the other cut over as this will help you to administer the whole process efficiently and make sure everything will go smooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Office 365 uses migration-service throttling which is controlling the
 number of mailboxes that are migrated simultaneously during simple Exchange migrations and IMAP migrations. The default value is 10. This means that a maximum of 10 mailboxes from all migration batches are migrated at any particular time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer the performance and best practices for different migration options:</p>

            <p>In addition to Rohn's most excellent information, I would suggest that you do a
<strong>custom install</strong> and avoid letting the trial version to overwrite your Office 2000. Except for Outlook you can run multiple versions of Office on the same computer, and until you decide whether you want to move to Office 2010 or 2013, I would
 suggest you not burn that bridge.</p>
<p><br />

<div>Personally I have installed the many versions of Pubilsher in individual custom folders rather than default location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By the way, why do you need an upgrade? I know of a number of people that prefer Publisher 2000 to all the newer versions...</div>

            Yes, you will have to buy a whole new copy of Office, to get the current version.<br />
<br />
Starting with Office 2010 MS no longer felt they had to offer loyal customers a discount to keep them coming back, or as recognition of loyaty. MS no longer offers a discounted "upgrade" version. All Office 2010 versions are "full" licenses.<br />
<br />
Have you seen what Office 2010 looks like. It has a totally DIFFERENT user interfact. The menus are gone, replace by a phat "Ribbon".<br />
<br />
Right now Office is on a cusp. You can buy Office 2010 right now, or if you wait a little longer you can get a copy of the "future", Office 2013.&nbsp; If you have no experience with 2010, I suggest you download and install a trial to see what it is about.&nbsp; AND,
 you should download a 2013 beta trial copy, to see the new look. <br />
<br />
NOTE: Office 2010 introduced a new marketing "scheme" (very much like 3-card monty) called the "Product Key Card". It is trivially cheaper to buy than a "full retail" license. That is because the average buyer is not aware of the severe limits of the new license
 type. PKC is good to install only on one computer, retail licenses allow you to install on 2 (3 for Home and Student only).&nbsp; As well, the PKC is disposable. It it permanently tied to the first machine it is installed on. When the hardware dies or is sold,
 Office goes with it. The retail license allows you to transfer installations to new machines as required.<br />
<br />
If you go with the trials right now, the 2010 trial will last&nbsp; 60 days (plus you can use the other 2 trials). The 2013 trial will last at least into April or later.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the key thing to be aware of when using 2013 is that it is NOT yet ready for production,
 it is intended for testing only. It could crash or do other rude things.<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><span>2013 Technical Upgrade Offer</span></b>
<p>
The advantage of holding off your purchase briefly is that rumor has it that MS will be announcing the final release date of 2013 in the next month or so. At that time they have "historically" also announced a "technical upgrade" program that gives new purchases
 of the current version (2010) a cheap or free upgrade to the new version.&nbsp; For example people who buy a Win7 PC now, will be able to buy Win8 for $15 when it comes out at the end of October.&nbsp; So if you wait to buy 2010, you effectively get a "2 for 1" deal.</p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Pricing for 2013 has been announced and it is substantially MORE expensive for “retail licenses” than the 2013 equivalent because they are really pushing people to go with the “rental” scheme, that will cost you
 more money in the long term.</p>

<h2>            Release preview 10.0.14393.67-problem with calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Yezz Billy 4.7 with&nbsp;Release preview 10.0.14393.67. Since this release I found the following problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I answer a phone call (call ongoing) and then connect the headphone, I lose the sound either on headphone or on the phone itself. After that if I disconnect the &nbsp;headphone I still have no sound on the phone. I have to disconnect the call, connect the
 headphone and then call the person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody facing this problem with other phones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            <p>Luis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing the same problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied update 10.0.14393.67 two days ago and this problem started immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I receive and answer a phone call.&nbsp; When I plug in my headphones I can not hear anything and neither can the other person.&nbsp; When I unplug the headphones the problem remains the same on the phone itself.&nbsp; No sound from phone speaker or the ability speak through
 microphone on the phone.&nbsp; The phone call does not disconnect, just no way to communicate with the other caller.&nbsp; From that point I can not talk or hear on the phone until I power cycle the phone off and on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some experimenting: </p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seem to only to happen if I plug in the headphone after I receive a call.&nbsp; If I am listening to music with my headphones and receive a call, everything works.&nbsp; If my headphone are already plugged in and I receive a call, everything works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was surprised I received the update since my phone ( Lumia 635 512mb ) was not authorized for the final version of Windows 10.&nbsp; Up to this point I have been extremely happy with my Windows 10 Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a Hard Reboot this morning hoping to cure the problem.&nbsp; That did not help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Bluetooth headphones are not effected by this problem, only my plugin headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, my navigation bar is now partially blocking my text and music controls.&nbsp; But that is a different issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I couldn't be more helpful</p>

    <title>Dollar sign formula help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l_squared  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dollar sign formula help</h2>
                    Dear Mac Excel Community: I'm trying to figure out a formula for adding dollar signs in front of a price. I'm trying to sell my wine cellar and a potential purchaser want an Excel sheet of my wines for sale. I have in column B the number of bottles I have
 for sale. Collumn I I have the price I'm asking for that particular bottle and column J I have the total price (number of bottles * price). I want to put dollar signs in front of my prices in Column I and J. I know the formula goes something like this: =(B7:B38)
 * DOLLAR(I7,x)+DOLLAR(I38,x)+DOLLAR(J7,x)+DOLLAR(J38,x). Also, all my prices are in whole number (no ¢). So would I put for example: DOLLAR(I7,0) or DOLLAR(I7,1)? I can't seem to get the formula to work. For example I have 3 bottles at $15 each and Excel tells
 me it equals $60! What gives? What am I doing wrong? Thank you!

            You are over complicating the situation. Simply format columns I and J as currency. Select the columns (or cells) you want to format. go to the format menu, select cells, and then click number in the upper left, then choose currency from the left column,
 and then change the number of decimal places to 0.<br />

                    <p>When I upgraded from Outlook 10 to Outlook 365, I imported all my Outlook data with no problems save one: &nbsp;Somehow a mysterious second calendar named, "Calendar (This computer only)" appeared. That in itself is not particularly a problem but I have these
 issues with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is completely empty </li><li>When I try to add a calendar to the To-do bar, it shows no appointments. &nbsp;I assume it is showing the contents of "Calendar (This computer only)" since my other calendar is stuffed full.</li><li>I assumed I could copy the events from my good calendar to that one, but no: When I try to add events to "Calendar (This computer only)", I get the message&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"You don't have permission to create and entry
 in this folder . . ." message even though I am the sole user (administrator) on this computer.</span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>The message tells me to check the properties with right click and when I do that I see nothing about permissions there. &nbsp;The Calendar&nbsp;properties&nbsp;does tell me the location is "\\Sal
 Cambareri" but I can't seem to access that location.</span></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Curiously when I right click on my good Calendar. the properties list the location of it as "\\Sal Cambareri\Calendar (This computer only)".</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My question is: How can I access/change or worst case delete "Calendar (This computer only)". &nbsp;As it is it has negative value to me since I do want to see a calendar in the To-do bar.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(I don't know it is relevant but I see in both Calendar Properties pop-up "Wjme posting to this folder use: IMP Appointment.")</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Calendar (This computer only) folder appears if you have configured your email account type as IMAP account. This means these folders are kept locally. It doesn't synchronize to the mail server.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>A question, how did you export data files from Outlook 2010 and how is it configured after upgrading? Is it POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync or Exchange Server?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>To add the old calendar to the current data file, you may need to import the calendar .pst file saved previously and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Keep us posted on the status of the information to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            If you installed 365 on the same PC that Office 2010 was installed on you dont import anything, you would however need to uninstall Office 2010 as the 'upgrade' doesn't overwrite or remove 2010 version<br />

            <p>Thank you for replying: To answer your questions, as I recall (it has been a couple of months), this is how I upgraded.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>My Outlook 10 and Outlook 365 were never on the same computer so I did not experience an automatic conversion.
</li><li>I set up my email accounts using the Outlook 365 wizard. The &nbsp;accounts are IMAP.&nbsp;I don't recall being given the option to use Exchange, and as far&nbsp;as I know I have never have an Exchange account. Is that an option that I could take advantage of?</li><li>After setting up the accounts in Outlook 365 (on my new Windows 10 computer), I used Outlook 10 on my old Windows 7 computer and exported everything to .PST.</li><li>I copied the .PST to the new computer and used Outlook 365 to import it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So I think I did in fact populate my old calendar in Outlook 365 using a .PST file.</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Wrong on every count;</p>
<p>If Outlook is functioning on the old PC, <strong>with outlook closed</strong> copy the pst files to media, and thence to a Documents location on the new PC, eg \My Documents\Outlook Files\ -dont overwrite any existing ones-</p>
<p>Then Control panel&gt;Mail Applet (View by large icons) Add a new Profile, set prompt for Profile, add your mail account manually as pop, in the data tab, add your primary outlook.pst file that you copied, and set this as the default msg store. Finish, then
 start OL under the new Profile.</p>
<p>All data will be as it was before on the old PC</p>

<p>I do appreciate your reply, but I find your comment "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Wrong on every count</span>" puzzling. &nbsp;What are you saying is wrong? I described the steps I took in the order I took them to arrive
 at the useless "Calendar (This computer only)". I don't understand what is wrong about that description.</p>
<p>I will keep your reply on file, but it seems like a lot of time consuming steps to solve what is at root a very small problem: I cannot view my populated calendar in my To-do bar in my Outlook 365. Over the years I have upgraded 4 versions of Outlook and
 this is the first version where I cannot do that.</p>
<p>I am hoping for a simpler less time consuming solution which hypothetically might be</p>
<p>1. Change the permissions of "Calendar (This computer only)" so that I can create entries and copy by good calendar into it or</p>
<p>2. Change the Outlook To-do bar view so that I can select the calendar that I want to see there.</p>
<p>3. Something else.</p>
<p>I admit that as a layperson I don't know the intricacies of Outlook, so your's might be the only solution. &nbsp;As I said I will keep it on file in case no other solution appears.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just for the sake of accuracy - you don't "copy" things into Outlook - you copy them into an email account so in the above scenario - the simplest solution would have been (is) simply to configure the same email account using the same protocol on your system
 with OL'2010 and copy whatever was required to the appropriate folders. That also assumes that the email account wasn't configured an as IMAP account in '2010 in which case the only things you need to worry about in terms of copying anything over is your contact/calendar

<p>
</p><p>Just means that the .ost data file associated with the IMAP account has been set as the "default data file" for the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "default data file" contains the default contact/calendar folders for the profile. Go to OL menu --" File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; highlight the PST file that has the contact/calendar folders you want to use and set it as the default"</p>
<p>
</p><p>To copy all the contact/calendar items from within the folders labeled with "This Computer Only"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- open the applicable folder (in the case of Calendar items - set the folder to a "List View"</p>
<p>- press CTRL+A to highlight all the items</p>
<p>- right-click the highlighted items --&gt; Move --&gt; Copy to folder -- select the destination folder</p>
<p>rinse and repeat for each folder involved</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have confirmed that everything has been copied over completely and properly, then the easiest way to remove the "This Computer Only" folders from the IMAP folder tree is to remove the account the profile and re-add the account back at which point
 all the email folders will sync again and the "This Computer Only" folders will not exist in the folder tree.</p>

            Hello MuhammadFaheem1. Have you already paid for and downloaded DataPoint? It is not a free product. 
<br />
<br />If you have paid for and downloaded it, it will be an Add-In.
<br />Select File &gt; Options, and then click Add-Ins.
<br />In the Manage list, click PowerPoint Add-ins, and then click Go.
<br />In the Add-Ins dialog box, click Add New.
<br />In the Add New PowerPoint Add-In dialog box, browse for the DataPoint, and then click OK.
<br />
<br />You may need to change your security settings also. If you know DataPoint is secure go to Enable Macros and then click Close. Let me know if this helps.

<br />wo things you need to remember when defining a Where Clause for a Navigation Control
<br />
<br />1) The Parent and Child Controls CANNOT be of the same name.
<br />
<br />2) The Child Control MUST be an actual Field in the Recordset and be a bound Control.
<br />
<br />If both Controls have the same name, then add a new control bound to the same field but with a different name. For instance, if [ProductID] is on both the parent and child, add a new control on the parent form and name it [txtProductID]. Then add [txtProductID]=[ProductID] to your WHERE Clause.
<br />
<br />One last bit of advise, do NOT precede the Clause with an '=' equal sign, enter it simply as this:
<br />
<br />[txtProductID]=[ProductID]
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />

            A subform is linked to a main form by using the Parent /Child link dialog. Normally, one uses the Subform wizard to embed a subform in a main form. If you do, the wizard prompts you to select the link, even suggesting what the links should be. 
<br />
<br />If you don't use the wizard, then have to select the subform control in design mode. Make sure just the control is selected. When you do that, the Data tab will show the Parent child links where you can set the links to ProductID on both sides.

    <title>How to make Appendices appear in the Navigation pane - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make Appendices appear in the Navigation pane</h2>
                    I had the same problem: The appendices did not appear in the Navigation pane, but they did in the ToC. The answer is: When you create the Appendix style, don't base it on Normal, base it on Heading 1; and when defining the Multilevel list, set "Level to
 show in the gallery" at Level 1. Once I made these changes, the appendices appeared in the Nav pane and in the proper position.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm an independent advisor that Microsoft asked to assist customers. I'm an experienced user of Office but do not speak for Microsoft. I've been assisting my fellow users for more than 20 years. 
<br />
<br />Thank you for your post. I assume that it is in response to a previous question.
<br />To give a bit more detail, unless a style is one of the built-in heading styles or based on a built-in heading style, it will not show up in the Navigation Pane.
<br />
<br />Other styles can show up in the Table of Contents.
<br />
<br />Your solution of basing on Heading 1 works so long as the headings and related figures in an Appendix do not need special numbering. If they do, then the workaround is found at <a href="http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numberingappendixes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering...</a>. That would still be available in the Navigation Pane but would show up as the lower levels. 
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem. 
<br />
<br />Regards

    <title>IMAP folders synchronization, new email pop-up alert - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> libor pt&#225;ek  say:</h3>
<h2>            IMAP folders synchronization, new email pop-up alert</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have subscribed IMAP folder in Outlook 2016 and set to recieve all emails from subscribed folders, despite that new emails in IMAP folders are showned only after I clicked on the folder but not after send/recieve with F9.(settings for outlook send/recieve
 groups is in the end). If I choose "custom behaviour defined below" option and select all folders, IMAP folders are synchronized, but in send/recieve dialog I see items for syncing for all folders (20 items instead of 2) . Even with "custom behaviour option"
 enabled Outlook 2016 does not show desktop pop-up alert for IMAP folders. For Inbox folder everything is working without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous Outlook 2010 does not have these issues. Folders were synced and pop-us has been shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know any solution even with 3rd party SW to return previous behaviour as Outlook 2010?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi Libor,<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, it seems your IMAP folder can’t receive new emails except you click Send/Receive button I’d like to collect the following information to better understand your situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>How did you “subscribed IMAP” folder in Outlook 2016?</li><li>The detailed version of your Outlook 2016 client.</li><li>The detailed steps about how to choose “custom behavior defined below” and select all folders in Outlook 2016.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>It does not matter if I click on the Send/Recieve button.</p>
<p>1) subscription made right click on account, IMAP Folders, Select all IMAP Folders and Subcribe</p>
<p>2) outlook version: Office 365 Business - CZ Language, version 1702 (build 7870.2031), Installation made as an update of Office Professional 2010 (also tried completely new installation on different PC with same results)</p>
<p>3) red square with 2 options - described below picture</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I select option 1: I have to click on the folder to get sync for new emails</p>
<p>If I select option 2: Outlook sync IMAP folders&nbsp; for new emails, but I see in the status dialog windows of send/recieve all selected folders as sync items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless none of these option does not make pop-up alert active for new emails in IMAP Folders. Only for Inbox.</p>

            <p>Hi Libor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. According to your description, I’d like to confirm whether you subscribed IMAP folder in Outlook 2010 as I can’t see “IMAP Folders “ in Outlook 2016.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is recommended you configure your IMAP account to the Outlook 2016 client, not via subscribing “IMAP folders”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>For IMAP Folders you have to select Inbox of IMAP account. After that right click on top of IMAP account ... (&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-which-IMAP-account-folders-appear-in-Outlook-32103602-a568-4499-9d25-54fe236aee6a?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-which-IMAP-account-folders-appear-in-Outlook-32103602-a568-4499-9d25-54fe236aee6a?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>
 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not select Inbox or other folder of IMAP account, you do not have this IMAP folder option after right click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution is working for both Outlook 2010 and 2016 (I am not sure if it selecting Inbox folder is necessary in Outlook 2010 but it does not matter).</p>

            <p>Hi Libor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have totally understand your situation now. This issue seems to be occurring because your IMAP account is not able to sync properly with Outlook 2016. After testing from my side, you can fix the issue by raising the rate of send/receive in “Send/Receive
 Groups” to 1 minutes, like the screenshot shows:</p>

            <p>Hi Garrym</p>
<p>nope. This does not help. I have to select folder and after that Outlook starts to synchronize this folder. (I have several IMAP accounts and all have the same problems (even google) so I do not expect problems on the server side).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only selecting "Use custom behaviour defined below" option with all IMAP foldersc checked leads to checking of email through time schedule/F9 key in the IMAP folders (not only INBOX).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem with desktop alert (envelope icon in the task bar) still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some tool/setting which enables me to see that one of all IMAP folder have new email without selecting folder/maximazing outlook window. The best solution will be through windows action center and envelope icon which is normal for INBOX folder (it
 is called desktop alert).</p>

            <p>Hi Libor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick response. Do you mean the newly emails can’t be synced to the subscribed folder after raising the rate of send/receive in “Send/Receive Groups” to
<strong>1 minutes</strong>? Please send tests emails to the subscribed folders of your IMAP account and check if the emails appear in the folder after few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you don’t need to select “<strong>Use custom behavior defined below</strong>” to sync the newly emails</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>emails are normally shown in the folders (I check it using web interface), but to see new email in the outlook. I have to select “<strong>Use custom behavior defined below</strong>”. If it is not selected I have to click on each IMAP folder to show content
 of it (sync this folder) and after that new email is recieved and showed in the Outlook. If I select “<strong>Use custom behavior defined below</strong>” folders are synced using F9/time schedule and I normally see that I have a new email in the folder without
 clicking on the folder (bold number after folder name). </p>

            <p>Hi Libor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your perseverance on this post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know if you have any special reason about "subscribing the IMAP account folders"? We may have another method aiming at your requirement. For my understanding, you choose which folder to receive the emails is for reducing the space of IMAP account's
 Inbox. If so, you can just set up the rule in Outlook client to move the emails coming into your "Inbox" to your target folder of your IMAP accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

            <p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>it is to spare the space but for sorting of email. I am using rules for sort email on the server side (I use also web access for email account, not only outlook). These rules are putting email to desired IMAP folders but on the client Outlook side I want
 to know about new email in every folders without necessity of checking each folder by clicking on it. The first problem that I have to select “<strong>Use custom behavior defined below</strong>” option is programming mistake. If I read selected option in Send/Recieve
 group - I set outlook to get unread email for subscribed folders (this means all subscribed folders) and second option is to download complete email for subscribed folders (also for all subscribed folders).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem is more important. I want to be informed if I have received new email in every subscribed IMAP folder in each account on one place without opening outlook and checking accounts. This is normally working for INBOX and I want to use this
 functionality for every IMAP folder. I have tried this tutorial ( <a href="https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/newmailalert.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/newmailalert.htm</a> ) without success. In addition to this desktop alert will be if will be signalised new email also on the account and not only by the number on the folders. For example bold account name text, number of
 new emails in folders next to account name etc.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We're happy to look on this issue. We suggest try the following troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Make sure that you're using your Office 365 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Check if there's any Windows Update available for your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Check if your Date and Time settings are properly set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Try to remove your account and add again. If you're unable to remove your account, you can try performing a hard reset.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>How to reset</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In the App list, tap<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkbdevstorage1.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f12619_en-us_2" height="23" width="23" />.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>About</strong>, and then tap<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Reset your phone</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You'll receive two warnings. If you're absolutely sure you want to restore your phone to its factory settings, tap<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong>, and then tap<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong> again.</p>
<p>It might take a little while for the process to complete.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Please note that by performing a hard reset will delete all your Personal data and settings. Make sure to

<p>Hi Jennifer,<br />
<br />
When emailing with an Office 365 Business account, we can’t choose the files in OneDrive (personal) directly from the cloud, and vice versa. This is because they are 2 different products.<br />
<br />
About the crash issue, may I know which OneDrive you’re trying to access?<br />
<br />
For OneDrive (personal), we suggest you post in the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=threads&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=all&amp;tm=1449175341317">
OneDrive forum</a> for professional help.<br />
<br />
For OneDrive for Business, please confirm the following information to make the scenario clearer:<br />
1. How did you try to access OneDrive for Business? From a browser or the sync client?<br />
2. Try with another browser.<br />
3. Try with another user account.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing Bian<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7830675/how-can-i-preload-a-page-using-html5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Standard compliance by browser version can also be found at caniuse.com (bookmark this site)</p>
<p>
</p><p>apparently your web page has something else causing unformatted textcontent to flicker. Probably latency of an external stylesheet. Place all of your stylesheet links at the top of the head block in your site landing page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the networking tab of the IE dev tool to monitor server requests and latency issues. Use the Emulation tab of the dev tool to confirm that your development/test site is using the expected emulation mode... Use the File&gt;Properties menu to determine the
 intranet zone that your test/development web site maps to.... on domain networks the emulation mode used by IE is managed by Enterprise Site Mode lists or there is a global setting to "Display intranet sites in compatibility view"</p>
<p>
</p><p>To capture markup, security and blocked content warnings and messages, first go tools&gt;internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, check "Always record developer console messages". Save changes.... when you now open the dev tool, it will now list markup, security, blocked
 content and XSS errors and warnings that are otherwise suppressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other web browser are different to IE because of the IE security model (IE uses zones, not security by site), and because of different Addons model... IE uses COM and ActiveX, other browsers use Plugins and extensions.(Netscape model).. security considerations
 for Addons and extensions are also different... For this reason the first step in troubleshooting browser issues is to test in noAddons mode.... Chrome also has browser settings to use google's predictive caching that other browsers don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Post website developer questions to a MSDN forum or an open access forum like stackoverflow above.</strong>
<strong>If possible include with your web site developer questions a link to your website or a jsfiddle.net mashup that shows the issue.</strong></p>
<p>If you are developing using html files (using the file: protocol) abandon it and publish to a real web server like IIS on local host.... web sites use web server software, not the local file system of the OS.</p>
<p>

<p>Although, if you do, curb your expectations. I'm still trying to explain to them what I thought was a dead-simple thing: that you can't fully edit existing POP/IMAP accounts because of a flaw in the new UI. Not that difficult to grasp!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the method of contacting them now is pretty weird: a pop-up chat within Outlook. A pop-up chat that doesn't always pop-up, so you have to check it manually to see if anything new is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's ironic that email isn't used.</p>

            I managed to find a workaround: when opening the profile settings from the old Control Panel, it will still start the old add-account interface!

<p>Hilarious. I should have thought of that too, since it's an old favorite. I love it: a deprecated icon within a deprecated settings area is better than the new thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I've lost track of how many weeks it is now, but support is still struggling with the idea that the new thing isn't all that it's cracked up to be, even when like 80% or 90% of the traditional account settings are flat-out not there.</p>

<h2>            Clean install of IE for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm having major issues with IE. After many attempts to fix the problems I have given up and want a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the directions to uninstall and reinstall IE and both worked, except the issues remain. I'd like to try a completely clean install of IE, but that does not seem to be an option anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone point me in the right direction to a clean install?</p>

            I was looking for a clean install, and since it's obvious by your answer one isn't available (because you would have just posted a link) I reinstalled Windows to fix the issue.

<h2>            Can I sync Outlook email&#47;calendar&#47;contacts on Office 365 Home Premium with Windowsphone 7.</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 Home Premium on a Surface Pro.&nbsp; I want my email/calendar/contacts/tasks from Outlook to sync with my Windowsphone 7.&nbsp; When I try adding the account to the phone it reports that it doesn't support Exchange ActiveSync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Office365 Home Premium and Windowsphone don't sync with each other then what is the point of having them?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully I am getting something wrong in the setup?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice welcome - Thanks</p>

<h2>            Mail Merge - Send Email as Text &#38; Attachment NOT WORKING</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Word version 16.19, Excel 16.19, macOS Mojave version 10.14.1, and Outlook version 16.19 - and I'm unable to complete a mail merge to my outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only e-mail merge that works is HTML. When I attempt to Merge to Email as Text or Attachment, I get the following errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6af44fb9-bb42-4912-9c9b-a5b04e7bec79?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6af44fb9-bb42-4912-9c9b-a5b04e7bec79?upload=true" height="120" width="331" />"Word
 was unable to mail your document."</a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/193acb3c-d54f-4ef6-87ea-556cf21b0e28?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/193acb3c-d54f-4ef6-87ea-556cf21b0e28?upload=true" height="119" width="329" />"Word
 could not finish merging these documents or inserting this database."</a></p>
<p>However, when I select to send as HTML, it goes through without a problem (well, there's still an issue of formatting, in which the signature image on the document appears out of place and ends up covering the document text on the sent email, but we can
 tackle one issue at a time). This happens both when I "Start Mail Merge" as "Letters" and "Email Messages".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<div>Hi Mirela,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>I just tested this on my side with the same version as yours, and I merge to Email as Text and Attachment. So could you try the following suggestion to help us troubleshoot this issue?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>1. Create a new blank document and start mail merge with a new list. First, we need to narrow down this issue to see if it's related to Word client, the document or the recipient list. It would very helpful if you could test a new document and a new list.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>2. If it's a client issue, a safe boot could help us to address the issue: </div>
