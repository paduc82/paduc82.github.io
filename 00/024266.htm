<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Insider</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest edition (updated 7/28/2015) of Windows 10 Pro, as part of the Insider program. I also downloaded the Windows 10 Home released 7/29/2015. Do I need to install the Home edition since it's an official release, or can I keep the Pro edition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the Pro edition expire and if so, to install the Home edition, do I need to do a clean install (wipe out all my data, apps, etc.), or can I install over the Pro edition and keep my settings, data., etc.?</p>

            <p>You can stay as an Insider and use Windows 10 Pro, no action from you will be needed, and I suggest you don't do clean installs nor upgrades as Insider at the moment, because Microsoft blocked Insider Build Activations until new builds start getting released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although if you have a Windows 7/8 Home CD-KEY (Genuine), you can install Windows 10 and use that KEY to activate Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Your Insider Win10 Pro does not expire as long as you stay in the Insider program. What you have installed as part of the Insider program IS the same as the general public is now getting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to opt out of the Insider program you will need to install a licensed version of 7/8.1 on you harddrive an then upgrade to Win10.</p>

<p>OK, so as long as I remain an Insider I can keep this version and it won't expire? If my computer crashes or something goes wrong, is there any way I could do a clean install of this version? Yesterday I downloaded the Windows 10 Home 64 bit version, could
 I use that in case I need to wipe my system and start again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to installing Windows 8.1 and then upgrading is a big hassle and a lot of work. Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            .dmg not recognized</h2>
                    <p>So, I've downloaded the .dmg file 3 times with Safari, tried Firefox and still no luck. &nbsp;This is an older MacBook with a fresh Lion install. &nbsp;DiskImageMounter is the app that .dmg files are associated with, so that's not it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: &nbsp;Turns out that Microsoft had a known issue with the .dmg file that was on their servers. &nbsp;They appear to have fixed it. &nbsp;They sent me an email that it was fixed and I downloaded it again and got a good image this time.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and Office 2015&#58; Stop redisplaying all minimized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toooldtotech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Office 2015&#58; Stop redisplaying all minimized documents whenever a new one is opened</h2>
                    I have the latest version of Office (bought, not the subscriber 360 version). &nbsp;I also have Windows 10. &nbsp;Whenever I have several Word or Excel documents open but minimized and I open a new document all the minimized ones re-display (maximize) to the screen.
 &nbsp;I cannot use the fixes suggested in earlier versions of this same problem because the newer Office and Windows programs do not operate the same as the older ones. &nbsp;This is very annoying. &nbsp;I minimized those documents for a reason and I do not want to have
 to re-minimize them again every time I open something new! &nbsp;Since Office/Windows10 offer various ways to view several documents at a time, this re-maximizing seems totally unnecessary.

<div>
<p>Provide the following information to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1) Is this issue specific with Excel and Word documents? Did you check with other Office application?</div>
<div>
<p>2) What are the troubleshooting steps you have tried so far?</p>

            <p>Neither. &nbsp;Apparently, I have Microsoft Office 15 (according to the Program files on my computer).</p>
<p>I only use Excel and Word. &nbsp;I do not use any other Office apps.</p>
<p>I have searched the Help files for any topic that seems even remotely likely to refer to this problem, but it is hard to guess what key words will find the relevant information. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Another member of the community has informed me that my Office 15 is in fact Office 2013. &nbsp;So to answer your question: I have Office 2013 and Windows 10. &nbsp;I don't use any other Office applications that display windows, just Excel and Word (and Outlook).
 &nbsp;I have tried to find answers using the Help function without success. &nbsp;I have searched online for posts from people with the same problem, but they all refer to earlier versions of Windows and therefore do not help because I cannot follow their steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very annoying and totally unnecessary and not useful thing that Windows 10/ Office 2013 do. &nbsp;Please tell me how to stop it.</p>

            <p>The first link is the one I have already read. &nbsp;Those fixes don't work, and as one person says, they are just duct tape applied after the problem occurs. &nbsp;The second link gives re-programming instructions that, since I am not a professional or amateur programmer,
 I do not want to attempt! &nbsp;Sorry, but this is not helpful.</p>

            <p>Sorry to dash your expectations, but you need to realise that "Microsoft Support Engineers" with names like that are contractors hired by Microsoft to respond to questions in these newsgroups and that is mostly done by them re-gurgitating from a list of

            <p>As my "handle" suggests, I wasn't born yesterday, and I suspected the "Support Engineer" was like many such people I have consulted in the past who just follow the same links I have already followed and don't really know anything for themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do not want to try to re-write the code as Jay Freedman says to do because I am not knowledgeable in programming and could easily make a small but deadly mistake and not know how to undo it. &nbsp;I have a relative who is a real programmer and the
 next time he visits I will ask him to look at Jay's code fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am just hoping to make enough "noise" to keep the issue alive and maybe some real programmer will notice and fix it in some future update. &nbsp;Call it a public service :-)&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Alternating row shading in tables for Word</h2>
                    I thought this was a standard feature, and I see you can do it by selecting a table style, but isn't there some place where I can manually set up alternating row shading (background color) in Word for Mac?

<h2>            Windows xhanging to a DOS looking screen and cannot even load Excel it comes out all black</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 16199 it was working perfect and about a week it changed to a DOS looking screen. All of the icons are in the start menu, but they also look like old DOS programs and they all have boxes around them. I looked for a fix, but there
 have been nobody else that I can find that is having this problem. Even looking at this screen now it is black and white with the menu at the top of this box is all yellow, with the exception of the "Format" button. I cannot reset the computer again because
 now it set because I do not have the Product Key.&nbsp; I bought this laptop from Rent-A-Center and they are telling me that they tell me that they get it from there HQ with the program on it. They are also telling me that if I need it fixed it will now cost $100.00
 and it will take about a week</p>
<p>Anybody help, I cannot have this computer looking like DOS. I try to print out something in Excel but it comes out a all black screen.</p>

<p>Is the Excel program ok? That may be a whole separate problem.</p>

    <title>mixed up sheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frelbow  say:</h3>
<h2>            mixed up sheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I help run a small school. I am trying to organize the students files in one excel file. My boss wants to see everything on one sheet such as payments and lists of classes they have taken. There are a few pages on one student sheet. 1 has payments 2 have
 classes 3 other classes 4 supervision dates. I have a sheet for each student.</p>
<p>Now I need the "main" sheet that just lists the students and the classes. I plug in on that sheet the date when they take the class. I have managed to figure out how to have that date pop into each students individual log(sheet). My problem now is that when
 I add new students to the main sheet I have to alphabetize it but then all the student's individual sheets data is all mixed up. I did have to add
</p>
<p>=INDEX(Main!$D$7:$AG$7,ROWS<span style="color: rgba(0, 97, 7, 1)">(</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 87, 214, 1)">L$8:L8</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 97, 7, 1)">)</span>) to the students sheet because the main sheet is a horizontal list of classes and the individual student sheets are
 vertical.</p>
<p>Any ideas??&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So in short how can I alphabetize the main sheet and have the individual sheets perserve or sort their data correctly.&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>What you are describing is a database. You can do this in Excel by creating a sheet for each data type, e.g. one sheet for student details like student ID, name, birthday, specialty. Another sheet for attendance with columns like you have above. Enter the
 student ID and the date of attendance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can use a third sheet to pull data for a specific student, but you don't need a sheet for each student.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter the student name at the top, then use formulas in the rest of the sheet to pull that student's data from the other two sheets. When you want to see another student's data, just change the name at the top of the sheet to the desired student. The formulas
 will then update the looked up data for that student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a simplified example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1403a85-0f51-4aa6-9c4b-9d2442e4cb26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1403a85-0f51-4aa6-9c4b-9d2442e4cb26" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a much more efficient data architecture than keeping individual sheets for students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you've been busy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the CLS&nbsp;sheet&nbsp;you may want to give each row&nbsp;in&nbsp;the table a unique code, so that there are no blanks in column B. Maybe "CLS 701-1" for part 1 and "CLS 702-2" for the part 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, you need a data entry sheet where you enter the student, course and date. You need columns for Student ID, course code, date, eval, Notes and attended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you enter data into that sheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a link with a sample file that has a matching setup. The payment data is on another sheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the report sheet enter the student ID in the yellow cell and the course attendance tables will update with the data. The payments are in a pivot table. You need to manually select the same student ID in the pivot table unless you want to program VBA macros
 to do that automatically.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You need to understand that the Preview/Insider is a test site for beta software for people who have some knowledge of computers and know how to do proper testing and searching for fixes, most people on here are unpaid volunteers and not MS employees, so
 demanding that someone to fix an issues isn't part of this program, suggest that you take sometime and read some of these forums and you will see how "we" have helped each other over that last couple of years. now back to your issue, best to go to the Feedback
 Hub search for the issue and when you locate it you can add to it and upvote, if you can't locate anything about your issue you can post your own so that others can upvote it. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I just checked the Feedback Hub for your issue and found that it has been posted and upvoted and acknowledge by staff, so MS knows about the issue and is working on it.&nbsp;</p>

 back to a early build, or just wait for a new build or two which might fix the issue, this has been the normal course for the Insiders/Preview program.

<h2>            Automatically consolidate filtered lists from multiple Excel docs to one</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 Excel docs with client information - names, addressed, DOB etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need&nbsp;to create a list in a separate Excel doc with all clients born in a particular year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, I need to compile a list of all clients born in 1990 for example&nbsp;using "MCL 2012/13.xlsx" and "MCL 2013/14.xlsx" as the source files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate a simplified version of the data tables:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Col A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col&nbsp;&nbsp; D</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can think of a couple of ways to do this.&nbsp; We can first consolidate data from both workbooks to one workbook and then filter the data.&nbsp; To dynamically consolidate data from multiple workbooks into one (in any version of MS Excel), you may refer to my solution
 at the following link - <a href="http://www.ashishmathur.com/create-a-pivot-table-from-multiple-worksheets-in-different-workbooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ashishmathur.com/create-a-pivot-table-from-multiple-worksheets-in-different-workbooks/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please select Table in step 13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are using Excel 2010, you may accomplish the same via the Power Query add-in (free for download and use) from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you wish to get my help on this, then please upload the two workbooks to SkyDrive and share the link of the uploaded file
 here.</p>

    <title>Is there any VBA that can select the conditionally formatted cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeycheunghoyin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there any VBA that can select the conditionally formatted cells with same background color within a range&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a range of numbers and I have applied conditionally formatting to highlight those numbers, say &gt;5,000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are then a number of non-contiguous Cells being conditionally formatted to be the same color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering is there any VBA code that can allow me to select all of the conditionally formatted cells with same color within the range? As I'd like to see the same of those conditionally formatted cells by applying such VBA, rather than having to select those
 non-contiguous cells by clicking them one-by-one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I was managed to find a code that allows me to select Cells with same color within a selected range, however, it only applies to normal colored cells but not for those filled with conditional formatting)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the code for selecting cells filled with the same color (other than through conditionally formatting)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
Sub SelectCellColorCellbyCell()<br />
<br />
Dim CellColorFormat<br />
Dim RangeString<br />
Dim c<br />
<br />
CellColorFormat = ActiveCell.Interior.Color<br />
<br />
RangeString = ActiveCell.Address<br />
<br />
For Each c In Selection<br />
<br />
If c.Interior.Color = CellColorFormat Then<br />
RangeString = RangeString &amp; "," &amp; c.Address<br />
End If<br />
<br />
Next c<br />
<br />
Range(RangeString).Select<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />

    <title>Office 365 Mailbox Archives and One Drive for Business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helen ashton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Mailbox Archives and One Drive for Business</h2>
                    <p>When a license is removed from a user, my understanding is that access to the mailbox is lost as well as the users One Drive for Business files? What about any online email archive that is in place? We currently archive mail that is older than three months
 and thus, if we were to convert a user's mailbox to shared once they've left the business, the contents of the archive is lost, along with their OneDrive for Business files? Is this correct? What is Microsoft's recommendation for enterprises using these functions
 and managing their licenses when employees leave?</p>
<p>

</p><p>No, I didn't find a method to automatically export the emails to PST files by using scripts. I suggest you use E-Discovery to export emails which should be easier than using Outlook client one by one.</p>

<h2>            User has meetings that are being cancelled with no interaction</h2>
                    <p>We have a user in our Office 365 environment who on several occasions has had meetings she created cancelled on their own without her interaction. This has happened on 3 separate occasions with multiple meetings being cancelled at once.
<br />
<br />
During that time her office PC was turned off and I verified that she is the only person with permission to delete items from her calendar.<br />

Please help,</p>

<p>Hi Cengiz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, meetings can be cancelled by the creator and delegate of creator. If the user doesn't have any delegate or no one has the permission to access her mailbox, please confirm if there is anyone who has her account information and can sign in her mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if her mailbox has been enabled&nbsp;audit logging, you can try to run&nbsp;a non-owner mailbox access report as following article to check if her mailbox has been accessed by someone other than the user:</p>

            <p>Hi vfmn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure in the history section you have the radio button for detected items marked and aren't in the Quarantine Section (which is likely given the buttons you mentioned).?&nbsp; If you go to the right place, you should see what you want.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure there have been detected items in the last 15 days so there is something to even be there?&nbsp; If not, try downloading the EICAR Test file
<a href="http://www.eicar.org/86-0-Intended-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eicar.org/86-0-Intended-use.html</a>&nbsp;to get a certain entry you should see both in the detected items section and in the quarantine section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those buttons at the bottom in the Quarantine and Allowed sections all remain greyed out unless until you click an item and then they "light up" to give you the options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember the detected items history is just a log.&nbsp; If you click to delete it you're just deleting a log and not affecting any of the files.&nbsp; I'd leave it alone since it eventually purges itself automatically (15 or 30 days - used to be 30 but some evidence
 it may now be 15) and in the&nbsp;meantime it may be useful information.&nbsp; It's different if you use the buttons in the Allowed or Quarantine sections.&nbsp; If there's nothing in those sections, of course the buttons cannot be activated because there's no file to choose
 to activate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>During my test, the recipients have these options from the forward meeting inviate email.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, please go to calendar to check if the recipients can find this meeting and right click this forward meeting inviate and choose the options:</span></p>

<h2>            I want to remove &#34;Inbox.com&#34; from Chrome browser</h2>
                    I downloaded a free Webster's Dictionary and along with it I got an "Inbox.com" tab at the top of my Chrome browser which I can't remove.&nbsp; I think it would be called a toolbar but may be some kind of extension.&nbsp; I just can't figure it out.&nbsp; First I uninstalled
 the dictionary but the tab remained on the browser.&nbsp; I tried the Chrome Help and a lot of other suggestions from others, but nothing worked.&nbsp; Finally I uninstalled the Chrome browser three different times and reinstalled it, and it still comes up on the tab.&nbsp;
 When I click on the tab, I can type in a word for a definition and I will get it, which I think is really weird since I uninstalled Webster's.&nbsp; I didn't like the dictionary anyway but now I'm stuck with a part I can't remove.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me since I would really like to start using the Google Chrome again.&nbsp; wannierob<br />

            We ran the repair and this issue is better but I am still having issues with the freezing. &nbsp;I created new workbooks to see if that would help and it does but it still freezes when trying to switch pages and look items up.&nbsp;

            Do you have any other security utilities apart from Windows Defender installed?
<br />
<br />If not, then a repair upgrade is your only best option to get it working again.

    <title>New Version of Hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> happy_girl3  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Version of Hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Please&nbsp; will you advise on how I can go back to the old version of hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problems are too many list, but the main one is that I cannot do <strong>advanced searches</strong> like in the previous version. By advanced searches, we previously had the functionality to search by keywords and date ranges, and now this appears to
 have been removed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other one is when it comes to cell phones, the <strong>left menu pane</strong> is taking up too much room on the phone. On the previous versions we did not have the menu bar on the left of screen. is there anyway to minimize this on a phone.</p>
<p>
Is this version the one that we will be subjected to forever, and if so how do I migrate my emails to another email account?</p>

<h2>            Error MEssage in Word 2010&#58; the global template normal.dotm is already open as an add-in program</h2>
                    <p>I am on &nbsp;Toshiba laptop Running a fully updated version of Win7 and MS Office 2010. &nbsp;All malware/spyware/virus protection is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of the blue, with no system or software changes, I now get an error message when opening ALL MS Word files. &nbsp;It says: "the global template normal.dotm is already open as an add-in program"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont use and have not made any specific templates at all, and have no idea why this message is showing. &nbsp;I've seen this posted on other forums, but none offer any results for me thus far. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I very much appreciate your repoy, but I did see this potential solution in my original search for answers...but I dont understand it. &nbsp;It may be basic, but it's not in my meager MS Word knowledge base. &nbsp;I dont know how or where to search if something is
 pointing to a same folder. &nbsp;It's nothing I've ever used or customized for that matter, so I dont know where to begin, nor as I stated in my initial post why this change orrurred out of the blue.

<h3> vgargiulo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft HUP and Digital River</h2>
                    I purchased Office Professional Plus 2016 through the HUP program and received an email with the Product Key on 9/6/17, along with the backup DVD and flash drive. I have not yet downloaded the software because I planned to purchase a new laptop. Now I&nbsp;have
 purchased a new laptop and am ready to download the product. Is the original product key still active for me to use it tomorrow? If not, who do I contact to resolve this and get the date extended? I have the emails that were sent confirming my Order Details/purchase.
 Thanks.

<h2>            Office 2013 - Toolbar, ribbon, and icons inverted and have borders</h2>
                    <p>Hello -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time posting here.&nbsp; I am using Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 (15.04963.1002).&nbsp; When using any of the products - Word, Excel, and so on, the toolbar begins to invert and become less responsive.&nbsp; Screenshot attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set the Office Background and Office Theme to all the choices in hopes that it was just a bad theme choice but regardless of what I pick it starts to happen after a few seconds of running. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran the quick and full repair.&nbsp; I have uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled...and still it persist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have check to make sure I am running the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried signing out of my account and back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the different contrast setting in Windows (10 Home - also updated to the latest).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be great.&nbsp; The office suite becomes almost unusable after about 10 minutes of use with lag and the toolbar icons disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<h2>            IE mobile view</h2>
                    <p>Since resetting all the setting back to default in IE9 on W7 (32-bit) some sites come up in mobile view and it is really frustrating. Is there any way to stop this happening?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tested the same URL's in Firefox and I get the full view so it must be an IE specific setting but I can't seem to find it anywhere.</p>

            <span>Hi Alec,</span>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you are facing issues when opening some websites. I will be glad to assist you.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<br />
Which websites are you referring to(Ex: Bank and Secured websites)?<br />
</span>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<b><span><span>Refer to the following suggestions:<br />
</span></span><br />
Method 1: Follow the steps suggested in this article.<br />
</b>
<p><b>Webpages do not display correctly in Internet Explorer 9 </b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2404821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2404821</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode check.</span></b>
</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, and select
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>, and select
<strong><span>System Tools.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <strong><span>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</span></strong>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>If your browser appears to be working properly in Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) mode, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing
 the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>Also refer to this link:</b> Cannot access some websites in Internet Explorer

            <p>Hi, the first KB 2404821 states a menu option that I don't see (Accelerated Graphics section)</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then browse to the
<strong>Accelerated graphics</strong> section. </li><li>Click to select the <strong>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering</strong> check box.
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Also the second KB is a reset for some sites if you don't see them, that is not the problem. I see them but they are in mobile mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example I went to <a href="http://www.f1.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.f1.com</a> today and it stated it detected I was running a mobile browser!</p>
