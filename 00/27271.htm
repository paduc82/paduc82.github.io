<h2>            access to your account has been turned off</h2>
                    <p>Somebody has locked me out of my email account. It took months last time to fix the same issue and all that happened was I got a new email account with the same name but lost all my emails and contacts.</p>
<p>So far all I can find is people saying this process is nothing more than frustrating and no actual assistance is given. Lets hope I can get a response before I loose everything in this mail account again.</p>
<p>Here is all the info I can gather</p>

<h2>            Date Stamp &#38; BST</h2>
                    <div>My wife has a NetBook, and she saves her files onto a memory stick, for which I do the backup. She rarely deletes any files - but we have had a couple of sticks die...</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I have done in the past is simply to copy the entire stick onto my backup drive, into a folder named with the date of the backup.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>This means that my backup drive now has a large number of duplicate files, some identical, but some are different versions of the same file.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what I wanted to achieve (in very simplified form):-</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>On my add-on external drive, my BackUp drive, say F:\, I want to store a copy of every version of every document - but only once.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have now run an Excel VBA routine that "stamps" (using "MyFile.DateLastModified") every single file with the date and time as a 14 digit suffix (yyyymmddhhmmss),
</div>
<div>i.e. "MyFirst.doc" saved at noon on 15th April 2011 became "MyFirst 20110415120000.doc", and the next version, saved a week later, was given a different suffixand became "MyFirst 20110422133547.doc"</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>These two files were in separate folders, and I have now consolidated all these backups into one.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>But there is a problem !</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because of British Summer Time, some files have now arrived with several different copies of the identical file but with stamps an hour apart !</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Which is the correct time; </div>
<div>What is the best way of deleting the copies with the wrong suffices; and</div>
<div>How can I prevent that happening again ?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Office for Mac has determined that your product key is not valid</h2>
                    my MS Office was working just fine for YEARS, until today. i accidentally installed an "update" for MS Office that the system prompted me to install. the result was an error message stating that the product key is not valid when i now try and open MS Word.
 the disk and product key are LONG gone. now im not able to use MS Office because of a stupid update that ruined the program. i did absolutely EVERYTHING that the support link tried to help me with, but still, im unable to open MS Word without a new product
 key. i am NOT paying for MS Office AGAIN. i want this issue fixed IMMEDIATELY! very frustrated with Microsoft for installing this stupid "update". how do i fix it? i probably already tried everything that you're gonna tell me.

            Yeah, I'm with the other guys. There's thousands of people out there trying to steal Microsoft software by ware*, torrent or "sharing".
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft has 'bots cruising the net looking for them. As Microsoft finds them, it cancels the product keys. That's what has happened to you. Nothing "accidental" about this "update", your software got repo'd :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Of course the people who get caught by this, and particularly, their customers, DO tend to whine about it, and you will indeed see this stuff all over the net.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your brother has ripped you off. You may be one of many. He has sold the key to more than one person and he got caught.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may consider buying your next copy from Microsoft, so you you know that YOU actually own the key. Oh, and don't let anyone else know what the key is, or your key (the one you own...) will get the same treatment.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps your understanding.</div>

            That's because in Excel 2016 for the Mac, you are not allowed to customize or modify menu itmes. That facility is coming, but it will not support VBA modifications in the way you are trying to do it.<br />

</p><p>How did you manage to get 14383 installed?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW on 14385 I just tried closing Edge when one of the tabs had some open input that would get a warning about "Leaving" that page.&nbsp;&nbsp; That worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; No tabs were closed but the problem tab flashed yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the problem tab and clicking OK resulted
 in the close of the window completing.&nbsp; I don't use the prompt and thought that this was a good example of something really "working as designed."</p>

    <title>MathType Equations in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julesthibault  say:</h3>
<h2>            MathType Equations in Word</h2>
                    <p>I used MathType in Word for years without any problem. Yesterday, after&nbsp;a Windows update, only 2/3 of the equations is visible. The other third is hidden by the line above. I tried changing line spacing and many other things but nothing works. The document
 is fine on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Windows will make an update that creates a problem instead of letting quiet something that works well? The IT technician in our services are at loss. as well. Any idea how to resolve the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Do you mean that the equation appears like this?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e71b1918-6ae6-48f8-b509-b4e69360dd16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e71b1918-6ae6-48f8-b509-b4e69360dd16" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That usually means that the paragraph that contains the equation has its line spacing set to an Exact amount that's less than the height of the equation. (It doesn't have to be an equation -- it could be an inline graphic or text with a large font size.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Paragraph dialog and check the line spacing:</p>

</p><p>If it's set to Exactly, change it to At Least. That will let Word increase the line height to accommodate the larger object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a specific style is applied to all the paragraphs that contain equations, change the line spacing in the style's Modify dialog.</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same problem. We use MathType in our department and every single person now has this problem, the equation/object has been moved up and the top part is cut-off.</p>
<p>Changeing the spacing does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the text that was perfectly normal up until yesterday:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1083894-1e16-46b2-b965-1a501b235052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1083894-1e16-46b2-b965-1a501b235052" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the same text with spacing set to double:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b02814ef-2eac-4281-81bc-8734088d92b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b02814ef-2eac-4281-81bc-8734088d92b2" /></a></p>
<p>The spacing changes, but the object does not move at all.</p>
<p>I'm getting what you are saying, there should now be enough spcae and the object should fit in, but clearly it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, every single document I have with these objects in them are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a VERY BIG problem that must please be sorted out.</p>

            <p>I just had a look at the updates that were installed yesterday.</p>
<p>Uninstalled update KB3115135 changed nothing, <strong>then I uninstalled KB3178674, a Security Update for Word 2016</strong>, and that solved my problem.</p>
<p>I changed nothing in the document and after uninstalling, this is how the sentence looks:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e22e1575-77d1-42a5-8230-3731c545c558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e22e1575-77d1-42a5-8230-3731c545c558" /></a></p>
<p>Clearly that specific update changed something in how these obejcts are handled in Word.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this works for anybody else.</p>
<p>

            The same workaround for the dodgy update is mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-msoffice_custom/ms-word-and-mathtype/35d5fd68-3258-468e-9300-1dc79083eeee">this thread</a>.
 Of course, if you can't prevent the update from reinstalling, it's going to be a recurring problem until Microsoft releases a fix for the update. The Office Development Team has been notified.

            <p>So it seems Microsoft fixed one problem only to create an even bigger one. </p>
<p>There is a new update out update for Word 2016 (KB3178720).</p>
<p>It fixes the onscreen problem, all the equations now look great, but as soon as you print, they are still all incorrect.</p>
<p>Just printed 234 copies of a 13 page test thinking evertyhing would be OK, it look great on-screen, but not on the printed document.</p>
<p>PLEASE make sure about your document before printing!!!!</p>
<p>The on-screen document after the latest update:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd3e5057-9c57-4e13-8e34-1219bcdf842d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd3e5057-9c57-4e13-8e34-1219bcdf842d" height="335" width="521" /></a></p>

 do not like Microsoft Edge. Very frankly, it is a lousy program.&nbsp;Please fix this program because all other website state Internet Explorer browsers are out of date, even if you have the newest browser. Thank you.

<h2>            Automatically format date with non breaking spaces</h2>
                    
<p>Here, at the agency I work for, We are fond of dates, particularly dates that don't break across lines. I thought it would be easy to insert a date field in a word document with nonbreaking spaces. apparently not. what i have is this:</p>
<p>{Fillin Date \@ "MMMM d, yyyy"}</p>
<p>Obviously! I thought using nonbreaking spaces in the format would work. Word just takes them out. some of the other date formats don't have this problem but, we must show dates this way.<br />
There is no switch, and there is no variation of this format with appropriate effect.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>thank you</p>

    <title>Changing the Username - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samijansen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the Username</h2>
                    <p>I created a new Skype account today that I want to use for work purposes.</p>
<p>The first time I tried, it shows my private email address as my user ID (I don't want people to have my personal email address).</p>
<p>When I tried a second time with my phone number, it gives me this as a user ID: *******************</p>
<p>The article Skype gives me on this page:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA110/how-do-i-change-my-skype-display-name seems to be completely outdated! And it seems that a LOT of people are having this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be fixed? And why has Skype been making this so difficult for users???</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Skype name cannot be changed.
</span><span>You only have an option to change the display name of your account and not the Skype name. It will not show the email address of your account</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Skype name is the
</span><span>username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number. If you are using an email address or phone number when signing in on Skype, then you have a default
 Skype name that has the word “live:” and it will not show the email address of your account. Also, creating a Skype name or username is no longer available.</span></span></p>

<p>So you're telling me I'm stuck with the ridiculous default user ID that SKype has given me??</p>
<p>There are 21 people with my EXACT name. So what, shall I just get people to search for my name and then randomly contact all the other people with my same name to see if it's me??</p>
<p>How much sense does it make not allowing people to create a USERID?? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Really really disappointing Skype.</p>
<p>I'll be looking at alternative communication methods.</p>

<p>When I search for my name, there are 21 other people with the SAME NAME.</p>
<p>The "live:" username is different, sure - but it's this massive, long outlook address, OR if I've signed up with my own PRIVATE email address, it shows my email address (which is NOT ideal). It's more than 10 digits long - which makes it pretty certain that
 a person is going to make a mistake when they type it in.. How is that user friendly?? As far as I' concerned - Skype has gone backwards in time. The user functionality is no longer as easy as it was to use previously, and now even the user id is no longer
 customisable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know - a lot of people usually put their skype user ID into their email signature.. I'd love to know how you propose that people do that going forward with this ridiculous format that you've thrown at us.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your thoughts and opinions are highly appreciated, rest assured that this will be forwarded to the development team as feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As what have Van_m mentioned, there's no option to change the Skype name, actually, it has never be possible to change Skype names. In this case, if you wish to use a different username the only possible option is to create a new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an effort to improve the sign-up experience, Microsoft now offers a new simplified method for creating an account. You will no longer have an option to create your Skype name because the new simplified account sign-up method only requires an Email/Password
 or Phone Number/Password as minimum requirements for sign-up. This new method aims to reduce the sign-up effort by presenting a faster and more flexible experience for new users.</p>

<h2>            Dialling numbers in Skype with the 60 minute subscription from Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am trying to dial numbers in Skype but nothing happens, even when it states I have the 60 minutes allocated from Office 365.&nbsp; Of course, you can't get access to Live chat, so hopefully someone knows how to do this as the telephone symbol button does
 nothing.&nbsp; It's a business phone number, so they don't have a skype name?&nbsp; Thanks</p>

Even today, I tried to call a landline in Austria (on the list of countries for 60 min landline calls), but the system doesn't work.<br />
Actually, I don't remember that I ever could make use of my monthly 60 minutes....<br />
I consider to deposit a complaint for false business practices with the EU authority.

It is visible in skype -that there is 1 subscription etc....-.</p>
<p>That is not the problem.</p>

<p>Hi SathurukanMahalingam,<br />
<br />
I understand that you can open Outlook 2016 client. Based on my experience, I would suggest you try the steps below:<br />
1. Create a new profile and add your account into this new profile.<br />

<br />
If the issue persists after all the steps above, I’d like to confirm the following information for further research:<br />
1. Which email account have you added into the Outlook 2016 client, an Office 365 for Business account or a non Office 365 account like a Gmail account?<br />
2. The detailed Office application version number. You can check this in Control Panel by clicking Control Panel-&gt;Programs and Features-&gt;Selecting the Office or Outlook application.<br />

<p>Hi Sathurukan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates and I do understand the inconvenience caused to you.</p>
<p>For “tried to repair via office 365 tool “, what tool are you referring to? If not the following method, you can try it.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, some corrupted Outlook data file might cause such an issue. Please try repairing your Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost).
<br />
1.&nbsp;It is needed to use the Inbox Repair tool (scanpst.exe) to diagnose and repair errors in the file. The location of scanpst.exe depends on your version and language of Outlook.<br />
Outlook 2016<br />
32-bit Windows: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16<br />
64-bit Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16<br />
64-bit Outlook: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16<br />
Office 365: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16<br />
2.&nbsp;Then you can refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to perform the left steps.</p>
<p>Also, some third-party software (like anti-virus) may cause the issue, so we suggest you try Clean Boot via the instruction<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135.</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, since you are using the Home Edition of Outlook, we suggest you contact the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;tab=Threads&amp;status=&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=All&amp;threadType=All&amp;tm=1431414783487&amp;tm=1431414783487&amp;auth=1">

<h2>            Unfollowing Group Emails, but Still Receiving Meeting Invitations</h2>
                    I have set up several Groups for project teams in my office. These team members "follow" or "unfollow" the Group's inbox based on who's assigned to respond to messages on behalf of the Group during a certain periods of time. Team members (myself included)
 who have unfollowed the Group's messages are still receiving meeting invitations sent to the Group email address, and we can't figure out how to make it stop. When we unfollow the Group's inbox, we don't want to receive any messages, regardless of the type
 -- email or meeting invitation. Is there a setting that I can use to allow Group members to stop receiving all message types when they unfollow the Group? Thank you!

<p><span>Hi Leslie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the group option “ Subscribe New Members” has been enabled, and the group members are still receiving group invitation emails in their own inbox folder. In this case,
<span>&nbsp;</span>your group members ( including yourself) can try to sign into the office 365 outlook web app</span><span>（</span><span><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</span></a>
</span><span>）</span><span>and then find out the group settings which is on the up-right corner of the outlook web app, follow the steps below to have a try:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the office 365 group which you don’t want to receive invitation emails in your inbox folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Please click the group settings, and then choose “ manage group email” in the settings</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Stop following in inbox settings, <strong>
please try to "choose receive only replies to you" or&nbsp; “Don’t receive any group messages option”.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Save your changes and then check if you still receive the invitation emails in the group.</span></p>

    <title>Do Word and Excel settings synchronize via Microsoft account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Do Word and Excel settings synchronize via Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i've purchased the subscription model of the new office (office 365 home premium), and now i'm wondering which settings exactly do synchronize, and which ones do not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've installed office on two PCs running Windows 8 PRO, using the same microfoft account. Now i'd like to know whether for instance if i change some
<strong>Styles</strong> on one PC - for example when i change the standard font on the Style Normal - if then this change is only automatically done on the other PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, which changes DO synchronise?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the free man.</p>

            It is my understanding that all of your customization settings are supposed to be associated with your 365 account so that when you log in to your ID on any machine, your "user experience" is supposed to be identical.&nbsp; I haven't tested this myself.<br />
<br />
I'll keep looking for explicit references to this feature.<br />

<p>Because yesterday i changed my standard style for all new documents from Calibri to Times New Roman, added some other styles and so on on one of my two PCs. So everytime when i open&nbsp;a new word document, these styles are there.</p>
<p>But when i open a new document on my other PC, then these styles are NOT there!</p>

            No, I'm not sure. I'm not setup to actually test the proposition. BUT, I've read the same thing in several places since then. I guess we are all reading from the same MS playbook.<br />
<br />
None of the documentation I've seen says you have to do anything special, just that your settings are copied to Skydrive.&nbsp; I (mis?-) interpreted that to include NORMAL.DOT and QAT settings files.&nbsp; Sorry.<br />

</blockquote>
No problem, you are learning, and that is what this site is set up to do, share knowledge ...<br />
<br />
NORMAL.DOTM is the core template file that Word uses to store many of the default settings used to create new documents.&nbsp; WAAAAY back, in the 80's, before Windows, NORMAL.DOT held all of the setup info.&nbsp; When Word was Windowized around in 1991, some of the
 settings were moved into the registry, and other other files.&nbsp; Key settings that you described, style definitions (calibri to times roman) are still in Normal.DOTM&nbsp; (The "M" is part of the relatively new "x-file' format that was created for Office 2007).
<br />
<br />
The QAT, Quick Access Toolbar, is the remaining ribbon element that users can completely customize.&nbsp; By default it displays in the upper left corner of the Ribbon.&nbsp; The customizations used to create the QAT are stored in settings files<br />
<br />
So, it was my assumption that when MS said that settings were "portable" in Office 2013 and Skydrive, I assumed they meant that those files would be copied up to skydrive and used to carry your personal customization to other machines that you log in to.&nbsp; From
 what you've said, that does not appear to be happening.<br />
<br />
Right now I have no need for 365 so I'm using a local install of Office 2013, so I cannot check that those assumptions are right, or apparently wrong based on your observation.&nbsp; Hopefully someone else with hands on experience&nbsp; in 365 will be able to confirm
 my assumption or your observation of what is happening and point how to make my assumption correct (if possible).<br />

            <p>Ok, thanks for this detailes answer. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked again today, and it really seems that the styles do not synchronize. But that's not a tragedy, it's just good to know for certain, so i can adapt to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course, if anyone knows a way to make it happen, i would be glad to know. ;)</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for this detailes answer. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked again today, and it really seems that the styles do not synchronize. But that's not a tragedy, it's just good to know for certain, so i can adapt to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But of course, if anyone knows a way to make it happen, i would be glad to know. ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an old thread but I just ran across the same problem. I looked hard for a Microsoft or other qualified suggestion including discussing in person with the local Msft store technicians, and found no solution. In addition to styles and such I needed
 to have my macros, custom dictionary, autocorrections and so forth available on any of my three Windows 10, Office/365 PC's. Microsoft's default location of normal.dotx or normal.dotm is on a local drive at a path like&nbsp;C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates.
 My solution was to relocate the file path to "my" OneDrive in a folder I created called "Templates", and specifying through advanced custom settings on all my PC's where the templates were now stored. This has resolved the problem - so far. But I have only
 tested the macro availability and not everything else. I am surprised that there is not a published resolution to this problem, or if there is, I am surprised that Dr. Google could not find it. I didn't try Dr. Bing. I did find where a Microsoft Certified
 expert advised to "...never share a normal.dot*". I am assuming she meant with other users.</p>
<p>Is there a more suitable solution that anyone might alert me to - since 2013?</p>

            <p>Old thread. In case others are wondering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Styles exist in NORMAL.DOTX. Take this file from "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates" and send it to your home, and replace the one there (keep a backup). &nbsp;Load Word and you should have all your styles from work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also locate this file on a shared drive, etc. and then point Word to that location via as a previous user pointed out. &nbsp;FILE-&gt;OPTIONS-&gt;ADVANCED-&gt; look for the button marked "File locations" and in the next screen you can set the location of various
 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ribbon customization and keyboard customizations can be exported from Word through FILE-&gt; OPTIONS-&gt; CUSTOMIZE, then use the IMPORT/EXPORT button to export these settings to a file. Send the file home. Follow the same instructions to IMPORT that file into
 the receiving computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Voila.</p>

            <p>Why on earth MS won't enable AUTOMATIC roaming/sync of user settings (incl. Quick Access Toolbar and Options) for all Office applications (incl. Excel, Outlook, OneNote) via O365 account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, it would require a couple of new general parameters to manage that (think Chrome 'Advanced sync settings'). Also to manage MS O365 personal vs O365 business accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it must be absolutely doable and definitely worth it!</p>

    <title>CMT Flashing Failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chardudett  say:</h3>
<h2>            CMT Flashing Failed</h2>
                    
<p>So the yellow telephony functions disabled message was appearing now and then, not too often, but enough to become an annoyance however I cleaned the sim and connector pin and that seemed to do the trick for awhile. But then all of a sudden yesterday the
 red slash over the sim card wouldn't go away and popping in and out the battery and sim wasn't working anymore. I went home and did a flash (emmc and fiasco), however everytime I went to the fiasco section, it would say:<br />
<br />
Sending and flashing rootfs image (185856 kB)...<br />
100% (185856 of 185856 kB, avg. 11460 kB/s)<br />
Finishing flashing... done<br />
CMT flashing failed<br />
<br />
I searched around more, read up other possibilities I could do, like a cold flash, which the process worked, but still no luck with the telephony functions. I'm out of warranty (bought this back in Nov of 09 in the states), and I'm wondering if there's any
 other options I can do, or is my hardware/radio module just dead? :\</p>

<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately doesn't sound good as radio module may have died, hence it can't even talk to it to either erase or flash.</p>

<p>just a shot in the dark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>how old is your sim?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>even ifit is a couple of monthsold, i would try to get a new siim from your providorfirst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have had issues iwth sim card aging in the past where even if you do not take it in and out, you will see some dents in the sim...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>next, how did you try to flash it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>di dyou try to do the vanilla first or the OS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>be sure you do the OS first, and then the Vanilla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also, be sure you are using the most currnt global or US version of the os when flashing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you were able to flash the os, butt not the vanilla, be sure you you have the correct vanilla file that is the most current.&nbsp; that would be an easy mistake too.</p>

<p>My sim is a year old. I def noticed dents on it, and it had a little bit of a hard time reading on my old nokia e65 (which is what im using til i figure out whats goin on with the n900). I'll request a new sim from my provider!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now regarding the flashing, I flashed the US OS first (and yes its the latest and greatest), and got the CMT flashing failed. Maybe what i "shouldn't" have done is attempt the emmc/vanilla after that, which actually succeeded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I noticed that the telephony functions were still not working, I read up a little and saw that people mentioned saying the Global OS did the trick. So i downloaded the latest and greatest of that, flashed it, and still got CMT flashing failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious though, does the vanilla flashing also talk to the CMT at all? I wonder why that would succeed with no issues, but the OS one did?</p>

            hmm. **bleep**.<br />
<br />
your memory is fine.<br />
<br />
so to confirm, you tried to download a fresh copy from the tablet page for both the pr1.3 and the vanilla.<br />
<br />
and also to confirm, you have tried flashing using flasher tool on different 32 bit machines but get the same error?<br />
<br />
let us know you have downloaded fresh copies and tried it.

<h2>            disable people discovery on about me page and delve substitute</h2>
                    
<p>We have an educational O365 environment. As it shouldn't be possible for students to be able to find all staff members and other students, on Sharepoint we disabled people search by means of Query rules. Delve has been disabled (office graph disabled), which
 results in students getting some sort of delve-substitute when going to the -my.sharepoint site.
</p>
<p>However, on this page (the student can easily reach this by clicking 'about me' on the launcher), people search is not disabled. On the left side a people search box is displayed, and it's really easy to find any staff member or other student using this
 part.</p>
<p>How can we disable this people search? </p>

<p>hi l.greenfield,<br />
<br />
it's not feasible to disable the people discovery in the about me page. after we disable office graph in sharepoint admin center, the delve will be removed from the app launcher. however, on the person's page (about me), users can still search for other people.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c29c423f-e31c-45e0-ba6a-115fed516a79" title="shirleymosquera">
<p>
</p><p>In Skype account creation, it is not advisable to use work email, or organization email as this may include restrictions that prohibits the email to be used in Skype. In addition to that, there are telecommunication companies that do not support receiving
 SMS from Skype. These scenarios&nbsp;would explain why you cannot receive the verification code for during Skype account creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that, it is best to use pers<strong>onal email address</strong> in creating Skype account. You may refer to the steps provided on this FAQ.

            I don't have a straight answer for you, but check out www.pocketpcdubai.com. I think I saw an article about that sometime ago. While you're there, contact the site admin, he might have the answer. I sincerely hope they will be able to help you because
 you have a great device.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sorry for the late reply. We are currently experiencing high volume of inquiries. By the way, if you think that your account is hacked,
<span>it would be a great help if you take your time reading these articles:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/account-security-password-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Password information</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/hacked-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Hacked account</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/phishing-faq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Phishing emails</span></a></p>
&nbsp;
<p><span><span>The solution that I can think of is you need to fill out an account validation form and submit it to us so that
 we could validate it manually. If you passed the validation process, we will send the password reset link to the email address you want. Here’s how to do it:</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to this link:
</span><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://account.live.com/password/reset</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Choose <b>
I think someone else is using my Microsoft account</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on <b>
Reset your password</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>4. Enter your Microsoft Hotmail account and the characters in the picture below.
</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click <b>
Next</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>6. When prompted to select an option for resetting your password, choose
<b>Customer Support</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>7. On the text box, enter your new alternate email address. Make sure that the email address that you will provide is working.
</span></p>
<p><span>8. Click <b>
Continue</b>. This will refer you to the Microsoft account recovery page. Fill out the form.
</span></p>
<p><span>9. Then, click <b>
Submit</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please provide enough information in the form for us to verify your account. Also be reminded that the password reset link expires after 3days and can only be used once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For additional help, it would be better if we address your concern&nbsp;on a one on one basis.&nbsp;This is to ensure your account's privacy.
 All you have to do is&nbsp;post your&nbsp;inquiry as a private support request. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to this link:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/hotmail-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/hotmail-support</span></b></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the error message that you are receiving and on the next page, fill out the needed information and click
<b>Submit</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, I will now lock this thread.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
