<h2>            On Xbox 360 im getting error code 8c150009 when trying to view xbox subscription in My Account tab.</h2>
                    <p>hi all</p><p><br /></p><p>since a few days, on my other account, which is my gold account that i play online with. Im getting error code 8c150009 whenever i try to view my gold subscription info in the My Account tab. It says there is a problem with the xbox service, please try again later. After i click through the error message. I am left with a empty subscription tab telling me, we cant show your subscriptions at the moment, please try again later. It will not pull up my gold subsciption info at all annymore. Just the error message when i enter the My account Tab. I also own a&nbsp;Xbox one and on there it does show my 12 month gold info. It also shows&nbsp;i have 12 month gold on the Microsoft&nbsp;billing and subscription website. But i did notice that Microsoft changed some things related to my subscription and billing date on their end. I found some info on these changes&nbsp;on their support pages.

<p>Hi, Have you tried this several times in different days? If its the same every time are you either using an actual Xbox 360 to view your details or are you using the Xbox one integrated 360 OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the actual 360 to view these issues maybe connectivity issues with Xbox live services disrupts this visual on the consoles side I have experienced this issue on the Xbox one several times when my internet was running low at that time. If
 it could not possibly be connection issues then contacting Microsoft with the details that Error 8c150009 shows up and Xbox live services is up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are viewing the details in 360 Via Xbox one then the issue could be with that. there could be several issues that could cause this attempt to view your details on another Xbox One Via Xbox 360 game (trusted friend or extra Xbox). If it displays the
 same the issue doesn't Lie at your console but could be with your account (Try Xbox 360 Solve then). If the details displays on the other Xbox but not yours it could be that your 360 interface on the One is corrupted. I am unable to guide you through fixing
 that but I'd not advice reinstalling updates for they get tricky with data loss and having to re-download everything that's on the consoles internal memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempt some of these to try and figure out what could be the problem and if you have narrowed it down contact a Tech support to guide you through fixing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helped.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 &#34;Family Safety&#34; and migrating child account from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptr000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;Family Safety&#34; and migrating child account from Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I've been trying to find a step-by-step guide to _migrating_ and existing child (MS) account from Win 8.1 to the new "Family Safety" system in Win10. I have seen LOTS of posts by people
 having trouble, various posts by MS team members directing to sites with guides on how to set up NEW accounts, but no guide on exactly what to do when taking an existing child (MS) account used on multiple machines (some of which are still Win8.1 in my case)
 over to the new Win10 "Family Safety" system. I find this odd and this is exactly the situation that people will find themselves in after upgrading.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>So, does anyone know how to do this? On my "Your family" web screen I can see my child's pending 'invitation' and various other accounts with the same child from Win8.1 machines or recently
 upgraded machines: Some of these have red "This device has been upgraded to Windows 10 and settings for this account have been turned off. Select this child to turn the settings on again.". There is no option to 'select this child'. This is a "Fix it" option,
 which just sends an invitation. When my child (i.e. ME, as he's way too young to use email!) accepts the invitation I just&nbsp;get told that the account has to leave the existing family first. There is no information on&nbsp;_how_ to do this! So I am confused. I tried&nbsp;removing
 the&nbsp;child account for one&nbsp;of the machines with the red text and then accepting the invite on that machine again, but nope, same thing happens.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>So how&nbsp;do I add my child so that he can log in on the Win10 machines and Win8.1 machines and have "Family Safety" settings enabled?&nbsp;Because requiring me to&nbsp;completely remove my child's accounts&nbsp;in
 the web interface for&nbsp;ALL machines and then accept the invite would just be ridiculous, so&nbsp;presumably I don't have to do that(?).</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Moreover, presumably once I have my child&nbsp;on the family for Win10 then it is smart enough to know that for all machines? i.e. I don't have to&nbsp;add the child for each machine? He already has
 accounts on these machines, with lots of&nbsp;files and settings&nbsp;he/I would not want to lose, so it better be the case that once&nbsp;"Family Safety" is turned on then it just starts working for all machines. Removing&nbsp;the existing accounts is not an option.&nbsp;I assume
 this is not necessary?!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>For the most part I have had little issue with Win10 so far, it hasn't changed all that much over Win8.1, and where it has the impact has been low. However, when it comes to "Family Safety"
 it seems to be an utter disaster so far. Hopefully it is just me misunderstanding the situation and someone can&nbsp;enlighten me&nbsp;with some clear steps on how to proceed.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p><span>Phil</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of those links address the issues I was asking about in the OP. Specifically, how to
<em>_upgrade_ </em>an existing Win8.1 child account to a Win10 one when that account is already set up on multiple machines?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do not want to do is to have to delete that child account from any machines (i.e. risk losing existing files/setting). I would also like to preserve FS settings for the same child account on other Win8.1 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Phil</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I connect my Samsung GS6 to my new Window 10 system, I get a pop up asking what to do with the device.&nbsp; I select view files, and then it searches and can't find any files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get windows to recognize the phone and files so I can transfer all of my phone pics?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating and annoying.&nbsp; Thank you Microsoft!</p>

<h2>            When &#36;60 Isn&#39;t Enough</h2>
                    
<p>This article pretty sum up what I was feeling, how about you?</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<p>Until recently, I was just fine with the digital era of gaming. I didn't mind downloadable content that shipped on the disc but needed to be purchased separately. I didn't mind unlocking online multiplayer modes with one-time use codes from new games or
 a $10 online pass. And despite some misgivings, I didn't even mind microtransactions or retailer-exclusive preorder incentives when they were done right.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the rise of premium subscription services like Call of Duty: Elite and Electronic Arts' Season Ticket is a fee too far for me. My tolerance for incremental revenue streams has died a death of a thousand cuts, and I've lost all taste for publishers' short-sighted,
 exploitive, and (in the case of free-to-play games) downright predatory tactics in the marketplace.
</p>

In most of these cases, publishers will tell us that the game on the disc is every bit as good as it ever was, and that gamers are getting everything they're accustomed to--a full-featured product with sufficient bells and whistles to justify a $60 price tag.
 And to take their side for a moment, each one of these approaches is defensible.
</div>

<p>After all, the difference between DLC on the disc or not is a question of semantics: Should transferring MB of data to access the content instead of KB really make a big difference to the consumer? As for combating used game sales, why shouldn't publishers
 take issue with the practice? These companies spend millions making and marketing a game to convince people to go to their local GameStops to buy the thing, only to have the retailer sell them a used copy from which the people who made the game won't see a
 dime. Those sales add up pretty quickly, given that GameStop annually rakes in $2 billion in used game sales, an amount roughly 13 percent the size of the US retail gaming market last year.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even microtransactions and preorder incentives have had their place. Who could argue with Rock Band's a la carte approach that gave gamers access to thousands of extra songs, tailoring the game to their exact musical tastes? And I'll be the first to admit
 I preordered Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike just for the preorder disc that featured the old Star Wars arcade game.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when taken together, every one of these incremental revenue streams that publishers so desperately crave might leave a bitter taste in a gamer's mouth. While the $60 we once spent for new retail games is arguably buying just as much, it certainly isn't
 buying any more than it did before. In fact, that same $60 is now undeniably buying a second-class game experience.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
If you don't buy the collector's edition with the extra content, the map packs, and the subscription service with the whiz-bang Web-based tools, you're only getting a fraction of the total game experience. And if that fraction doesn't meet your fancy and you
 trade the game in, you're getting less value in return because GameStop knows it's getting a disc with crippled online features. As a result, even consumers who always buy new games at full price are being punished by this scheme.
</div>

<p>Publishers can say the core product doesn't suffer as a result of these initiatives, but the problem is one of perception. I perceive that my $60 is no longer enough for them. I perceive that their focus is shifting from making a game to making a business
 model. I perceive that the more desperate they become for my money, the more cynical, manipulative, and dehumanizing their approach to getting it will become. I can't even convince myself that I am a valued customer any longer; I am simply a potential revenue
 stream with an incidental pulse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the more examples I see of downright disrespectful cash grabs from publishers, the less common it becomes for my full-price purchase to get me a complete, cohesive gaming experience and the more I'll appreciate (and happily shell out for) the games that
 buck that trend: the Vanquishes, the Children of Eden, and the Shadows of the Damned.

<p>One of the many huge advantages of PC gaming over console. Free mods that are equivalent, if not better, than console popular DLC. Anyway though, my $6.75 was enough for Valve. When it's not? They provide me with free DLC lol. For the price of 4 copies of
 L4D2 on steam, one could buy a single copy of it on 360 without DLC ^_^. THAT'S a steal lol</p>

                    <p>On my desktop and laptop I'm accustomed to opening recent documents by clicking on the taskbar shortcut and dragging up to open the Jump Menu, then releasing the mouse over the recent or pinned document I wish to open. Recently this has stopped working and
 I have to drag the menu open then click the file I want. This is happening with every program I have pinned (Office apps, Firefox, Chrome, Dreamweaver, Spotify, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a trivial nuisence, but is there any way to fix it? <br />

            <p>That never should have been possible.&nbsp; When you drag up, the mouse pointer should not "highlight" any items in the list until you let go of your drag.&nbsp; in fact the drag itself was meant for touch screens.&nbsp; Mouse users can do it, but it's faster to right-click
 because you don't have to invoke any motion paths.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Can&#39;t find network printer connected to Windows 7 computer in a Workgroup</h2>
                    <p>Setup a new work computer that came with Win10 Home. Upgraded to Win10 Ent. All my other staff computers (Windows7) are setup with a "workgroup" NOT a "homegroup."&nbsp; This way, all staff can print to one printer (which is connected to 1 of the staff machines).
 All machines have static IPs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to "add" printer, but this Win10 computer can't find it. Tried to auto find it, find it by name (computername\printername, etc.) This printer won't have an IP address, because it's connected to a computer. Hence, the workgroup -- which has been used
 for a decade w/out any issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did a search to try and add a different printer (Copier/Printer/Scanner) that does have an IP address -- it did find it, but it wouldn't let me connect to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEED this computer to be able to print!&nbsp; This is a University, work environment and I've spent days trying to fix this issue.</p>

<p>Good morning Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the steps, but no luck. *Optional Features didn't have "SMB 1.0/CIFS Automatic Removal."&nbsp; When browsing the computers manually, I receive "cannot access."&nbsp; I'm not sure I did #2 correctly. I went into Explorer and clicked on Network. It didn't
 prompt me to enable. (I did see all the computers in my workgroup, but can't access them).&nbsp; **I didn't try to add the machine to the Windows HOSTS file yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried:</p>
<p>-- Enabling services as Automatic: DNS Client; SSDP Discovery; UPnP Device Host; TCP/IT NetBIOS Helper</p>
<p>-- Reset Network</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if when I upgraded to Win10 Ent., that some network settings were lost?</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took your suggestion and downgraded to Windows 10 Enterprise 1703. And, everything works now!&nbsp; I still couldn't add the printer in the traditional way (printers and devices), but was able to find the staff machine that's connected to the printer in my
 "Network" listing. Added it like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the suggestion. I really feel sorry for all the people who don't have access to the older build. I tried every suggestion I could find over a period of 2 days and nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again. Take care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karen</p>

<p>I ran into this issue with a network shared printer (shared from Linux with samba) after upgrading windows 10. Instead of downgrading I decided to use Zeroconf for network discovery as an alternative. You'll need to install a Zeroconf implementation on both
 the computer sharing the printer and all client computers that want to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On windows you can install <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apple's Bonjour</a> and on Linux you can use <a href="http://avahi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Avahi</a> (usually installed by default on most distributions). For configuration using Bonjour on windows I followed the steps on this
<a href="https://benmetcalfe.com/blog/2006/11/bonjour-on-windows-and-printer-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blog post</a>. I was able to use the network shared printer normally after this.</p>

=========================================<br />
Maybe the freeware Super would be worth a try:<br />
<br />
SUPER © Simplified<br />
Universal Player Encoder &amp; Renderer<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/SUPER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/SUPER</a><br />
(the mirror download site is faster)<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good practice to create a<br />
System Restore point before installing new software)<br />
<br />
After installing SUPER...open the program and<br />
drag/drop your .VOB file into the Active field.<br />
<br />
Output Container...choose...wmv.<br />
<br />
Video Scale Size / No Change<br />
<br />
Left click the Encode button.<br />
<br />
Choose: Simple Profile / OK...<br />
<br />
Wait...<br />
<br />
(FWIW..I have better luck with video if I do not<br />
try to multi-task while a file is being converted)<br />
<br />
When the file is converted...you should find it in...<br />
Program Files / eRightSoft / Super / OutPut.<br />
<br />
Or...you can type...Ctrl+T...to open the Save<br />
Window and choose a save folder.<br />
<br />
Good luck... <br />

            Hello Nenad,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>The probable cause for this issue could be&nbsp;due to incorrect app settings or could be also due to apps corrupt.</div>
<div>I can understand how frustrating it could be when things don't work as expected. However I will try my best to help you resolve this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to know the following information for better understanding on this issue:</div>
<div>1. Do you receive any error message when you try to access the apps which crashes?</div>
<div>2. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let’s run the app troubleshooter and check if it helps. You can follow the methods:</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Refer to the link to run the Modern User Interface App troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store. It's only available in English, but will work on PCs running any language.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and check if you are able to open apps with it crashes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows
 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>

            Hi Nenad /gary and Serkan,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue, sorry to know this issue is still not resolved on your computer, I appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cause for this issue could be due to the apps are not up to date or the Windows Store apps needs to get re-registered.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's the following methods and check if this helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Ensure to install the app updates either automatically or manually and check if this helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>App publishers sometimes update their apps to add new features and fix problems. The Windows Store can automatically install app updates when they become available.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Turn on automatic app updates: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/automatic-app-updates-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/automatic-app-updates-help</span></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Ensure to keep the computer up to date with all important, recommended and as applicable optional Windows updates. Once the updates are installed, restart the computer and check the game status.</div>
<div>
<p>In the link below you will find answers to some common questions about updating Windows automatically.</p>

<p>
</p><div><strong>Method 3:</strong> First, clear Windows Store cache and check the issue. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + R keys.<br />
b. In run window, type the following command and press Enter.</div>
<div><strong>wsreset.exe</strong></div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> I&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;you&nbsp;to re-register Windows Store App and check. To do so follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press Windows key + X.<br />
b. Click command prompt (Run as administrator).<br />
c. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. <br />

            <p>Sorry but you seem to be just covering every possible scenario. My app if you choose to read was a weather app by Microsoft!</p>
<p>At the end of the day I revolved this issue by returning the computer to its factory state and it seems to be fine. It would be helpful if Microsoft just came clean or just put things right.</p>

            <p>I updated my Windows, and I done everything you said, but the problem is still there. The troubleshooter is now showing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Store cache may be damaged &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not fixed</p>
<p>Windows Store configuration may be damaged &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Detected</p>
<p>Display adapter drivers might be out-of-date &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Detected</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw that PCI device driver has an update, but I can't perform it. I don't know does this have some connection with my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for answers and for effort, I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Yes, you might be prompted to go through the install routine with just the 5 mb web installer, but you don't actually have to do the download, just make the acquisition and the product key will be presented to you in the Upgrade Assistant (you will also
 have a copy sent to your email address).</p>

<p>
</p><p>First, I'm interested in 1 - one - ting only, how to get control of these folders (C:/Program Files and C:/Program Files (x86)). I have taken ownership of every single folder and file on my reisntalled PC. I had to reinstall because I wasn't able to uninstall
 MSE (at least I wasn't able to reinstall), but that's beside the point now. I want full and total control of each and every file and folder on my PC. Please don't answer "Why would you want that?" I just want it, it's my PC and I don't want a single file or
 folder staying hidden or closed to me.</p>

    <title>Window 10 Native Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brenthurst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 Native Apps</h2>
                    <p>After we started&nbsp;migrating our&nbsp;organization to&nbsp;Windows 10, we had a Windows Update come through that began causing failure of the Windows 10 native apps.&nbsp; After more than a month of trying to resolve the issue, Microsoft eventually released the Anniversary
 update (v 11 or 13) which resolved the issue.</p>
<p>Now we are having similar issues.&nbsp; On a few Windows 10 Pro workstations, the native apps will open, but have all been corrupted to some degree.&nbsp; All native apps have lost their icons and appear as "TWINUI" in default programs and when trying to open a file
 with a specific native app.&nbsp; If the native app is the default program for a file, attempts to open the file result in a "class not registered error."&nbsp;

<h2>            Too long to start - error code 0x8027025a</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having an issue where it's saying my games are taking too long to start. &nbsp;It's mainly happening if I switch between different games. &nbsp; This had happened previously to me with Fallout 4 and I deleted the game and re-installed and it worked OK. &nbsp;Yesterday
 I tried playing RB4 and received the error. &nbsp;Again I was able to delete and re-install and it worked for me. &nbsp;Today I tried starting Fallout again and am receiving the error. &nbsp;I'm assuming I can delete/re-install again but don't want to have to keep doing
 that. &nbsp;I had tried doing the reset, unplug, etc. like is always suggested and this never worked for me.</p>
<p>I had added an external HDD a few months ago and never noticed this problem before then, so I wasn't sure if this was the cause or if it is just issues developing with the console. &nbsp; Just wanted to check to see if any others had been having this problem
 and if they had a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have this same problem! I got my Xbox One almost a week ago, and the first time I used it there were uncountable problems like the Xbox being extremely sluggish and apps and games crashing constantly. Then today, I was trying to play Fallout 4 when the
 same message you posted appeared on my screen. I don't have any external storage devices plugged in, so I don't think that is the case. Hope this helped a little, maybe we can work together to fix the problem.</p>

<p>When things get "sluggy", try a refresh. Can't really think of anything for the games showing error messages, is there something wrong with the HDDs?</p>
<p>For refresh:</p>
<p>Just hold down left trigger, right trigger and Y at the same time for a second or two and then let go of the buttons.</p>
<p>-OR-</p>
<p>Hold the power button to shut down the system and make sure the power brick goes amber.</p>
<p>Then power on.</p>

<p>Bimnog,</p>
<p>I have tried this as well. But, ALL of my games are doing it, and I just installed some of them, so a few haven't even been played, as I can't get them to load.</p>

            You need to download and install the latest driver for your graphics adapter.&nbsp; Even in the one installed seems to be the latest, do it anyway.&nbsp; The driver should be available from the website of your computer's manufacturer or the manufacturer of your
 video card.
