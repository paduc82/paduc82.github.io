<h2>            Help&#58; Changed default program for .lnk files to Internet Explorer.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>So yesterday I did something stupid. I managed to change the default program for all of my .lnk files to Internet Explorer. I'm running Win 7 (64).</p>
<p>When I double-click any file on my desktop it attempts to open the file with Internet Explorer. Same goes for most program files in my start menu. I've encountered a few fixes for this problem, but all of them have been for past OS's such as Vista and XP
 so I didn't want to run the chance of messing up my registry even more by running an out of date program. If any more information is needed just ask.</p>
<p>Help as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance people.</p>

    <title>Constant Updates Driving me insane&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kharrisma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant Updates Driving me insane&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know if there's a way to force Windows to STOP continually downloading "updates" and re-booting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deliberately do NOT shut down my PC when I'm done with it... I don't like the long boot times that Windows users have to suffer through, and I especially don't like the startup time that some Windows programs require as well... if there's a program that's
 slower to load than Windows photo viewer, I've not seen it (other than GIMP, anyway.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows mainly for gaming (and Linux for any serious work), and many of the games I play have very long load times as well.&nbsp; Not wanting to have to wait through this load up time multiple times per day, I just alt+tab out of the game and put it down
 until later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got it set up as a dual-boot system: Windows 10 and Linux Mint.&nbsp; The system defaults to Linux Mint if it gets no input from me.&nbsp; This is how I know that Windows has updated/rebooted yet again, as when I open it up, I'm looking at the Linux login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This *&amp;%@@#'! thing has "updated" fully three times in the last five days, and I'm getting really sick of it.&nbsp; Another reason I don't shut things down is that many of the games I play don't have a "save and quit"&nbsp; option, they use the odious "checkpoint"
 system, so unless you've reached a checkpoint, if you quit the game you lose any progress since the last checkpoint.&nbsp; I have had to laboriously re-trace my way through the same game segment three times because of these updates, and I'm about to put a shotgun
 round through it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Windows has to update (since they can't ever get it right in the first place), but I want to update it at a time when it's convenient for ME, not for Microsoft.&nbsp; Who owns this thing, anyway, Microsoft or me?&nbsp; Linux has NEVER been so inconsiderately
 rude with it's update policy; it's far more respectful of the user than Microsoft has ever been.&nbsp; So how can I get this 600-pound gorilla of an OS under some semblance of control?&nbsp; I can't find any option to disable updates, or confine updates to a specific
 time of day/night, or forbid updates at other times.&nbsp; Can I just disconnect from my home network as a makeshift way of cutting Windows off from being able to download it's oh-so-critical update files?&nbsp; Will this work to get this (expletives deleted) OS to
 behave in a manner less annoying to me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions to fix this intensely annoying, out-of-control OS.</p>

<p><span>Hi Kharrisma,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We recommended not to stop the updates, since the updates consists various security patches and latest driver updates which helps to keep the computer
 safe and secure. Updates will eventually need to be downloaded and installed. However, we’ve introduced two new features in the latest build of Windows 10 to provide more control to the user over updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Pause Updates: Select the Start button, and then select Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update. Then choose one of the following options: •Select
 Pause updates for 7 days.</span></p>
<p><span>•Select Advanced options. Then, in the Pause updates section, select the drop-down menu and specify a date for updates to resume.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that once the pause limit is reached, you'll need to install the latest updates before you can pause updates again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to let you know about this feature called ‘<strong>Active Hours</strong>’. Active hours let Windows know when you're typically at your
 PC. We’ll use that info to schedule updates and restarts when you’re not using the PC. Active hours are a time range you can set to let your PC know when you’re usually using your device, so it won’t restart automatically during those times.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get updates when you're away from your PC with active hours in Windows 10</span></strong><span>:

    <title>PC cannot communicate with USB devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobcat2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC cannot communicate with USB devices</h2>
                    Using Dell Dimension 8300 with Windows XP Professional. USB devices not recognized. Have flashed BIOS, downloaded and installed Firmware, and loaded appropriate drivers. Still, computer cannot communicate with any devices. Computer clock tracks time and
 date accurately and USB devices show as working properly in Device Manager. A possible ESD (Electro-Static Discharge) may have occurred during plug-in process of mass storage device. USB currently enabled. Additionally, have shut down computer for one minute
 while unplugged which restored ability to use USB flash drive. Question: could the issue be related to USB only being able to operate at the 1.1 but not 2.0 speed? If so, what is the fix? Could it be something else?

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any software changes to the computer recently?</div>
<div><br />
Method 1.<br />
Let us start with running the FixIt in the article below and check if the usb devices get detected.<br />
<strong>A computer that is running Windows XP cannot detect a USB flash drive, an Apple iPod, or an external hard disk drive<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925196</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2.<br />
If the issue still persists let us reset the usb controllers and check if the issue is resolved.<br />
First, please disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:<br />
a. Click "Start" button, type “devmgmt.msc” (without quotation marks) in the “Run” and press "Enter". Click “Continue” if necessary.<br />
b. In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".<br />
c. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".<br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows XP will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<p>Answer to question 1:</p>
<p>Over the course of this problem were changes to find a resolve. Some, as outlined in the original question, others came in the form of Windows updates. As in the aforementioned, a possible ESD event may have occurred while writing to a CD. During the process
 plugged in a Coby Mp3 and video player and heard a “click” sound. Immediately, the CD writing process stopped and ejected the disk. Subsequent to that none of the USB ports worked.</p>
<p>Answer to question 2:</p>
<p>On several occasions, all the USB ports uninstalled as suggested but no resolve. The Fix-it diagnostic identified only the CD write/read but nothing for USB. CD works fine with no changes.</p>
<p>Question to you:</p>
<p>It is my understanding that Windows programmed (or perhaps was built in by manufacturer) USB 1.1 and 2.0. The flash drive (Scandisk) now operates after powering down and leaving PC unplugged for 1 minute. Is it possible that whatever occurred, corrupted
 ability for USB to operate at 2.0?</p>

<h2>            Stuck in Repairing disk errors. This may take longer than an hour... Acer Aspire E1-522</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;A couple of days ago I was using my laptop and&nbsp;the desktop started glitching so I decided to restart it. Upon restarting it I ended up in the automatic repair,&nbsp;it&nbsp;diagnosed than went to repairing disk errors.&nbsp;I let it run over the weekend and nothing happened
 it&nbsp;was still showing the same thing: repairing disk errors. This may take longer&nbsp;than an hour.&nbsp; Today I took the power cord out to use with my other laptop and it shutdown. It goes to the same thing over again when I restart it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the hard drive out of this&nbsp;laptop and put it in the (notworking) laptop, it worked perfectly fine. So I know that the problem is with&nbsp;the hard drive for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the files on my hard drive though, they are important university files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix my hard drive? or any shortcut I can use to get to the blue screen so I can try using cmd to get my files.</p>
<p>Also I saw something on youtube about flashing&nbsp;the bios. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried making a&nbsp;recovery drive using this computer and putting the drive in order 1 from&nbsp;f2 menu.</p>
<p>only difference is this is windows 8 and other is windows 8.1. I got a glimpse of the blue screen before it went back to the loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help with detailed information, i'm not amazing with computers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cortana&#47;Search Bar not working at all.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on my ASUS gaming laptop. When I try to click on my search bar on the task bar, nothing happens. It doesn't pop up into the little menu that it used to, and even Cortana is completely inaccessible. In addition to this, trying to right-click
 on the Windows button in the bottom left hand corner does nothing as well. When looking up how to fix it elsewhere, it was suggested to restart it through the task manager, but I couldn't even find the application. How do I fix this?</p>

            Hi Steven.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible fixes that are working for webcam problems.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by to help.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try also these steps from Microsoft for when webcam isn't working:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/s13753/windows-10-camera-does-not-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/s13753...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello Steven,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please refer following suggestions:
<br />
<br />Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot.

<br />1. Press Windows +X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin).
<br />
<br />2. Type/paste following and press Enter key:
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.WindowsCamera | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. Close Windows PowerShell and see if this resolves the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows + X, select Device Manager. 
<br />
<br />2. Under Imaging devices, right click on your camera device and select Uninstall. Click OK. 
<br />

<p>Try to delete the title update on your console and all the corrupted files from your console.</p>
<p>After that. go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage. Highlight the Hard Drive and press the "Y" button. Select "Clear System Cache" (Clear the system cache 3 times). Then after that we need to turn off your console and unplug the power supply of it. While the console
 is off, press and hold the power button for 10 to 15 seconds. We are doing these to remove the excess static on the console.</p>
<p>If it still didn't work try to delete the system update of your console.</p>
<p>(note: I would best recommend you to use wired connection to make sure the connection on your console is fast&amp;stable, unstable internet connection can cause corrupted file.)
</p>
<p>Here's how, </p>
<p>Press the left bumper.</p>
<p>Press the right bumper.</p>
<p>Press the X button.</p>
<p>Press the left bumper.</p>
<p>Press the right bumper.</p>
<p>Press the X button.</p>
<p>When prompted, select Yes.</p>
<p>After the console restarts, sign in using an Xbox LIVE gamertag, and download the update again by testing the Xbox Live connection.</p>
<p>Once it's completed, try to download the game update on your console.</p>
<p>Let me know if it works, thanks. :)</p>

    <title>Remove Microsoft XNAComposite driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> engrjpo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Microsoft XNAComposite driver</h2>
                    <p>I just recently bought an XBox 360 wired controller. I followed the instructions to download and install the software and driver for it, and the device works fine. Now that I don't intend to use it, I uninstalled the XBox 360 software.&nbsp; However when I ran
 System Restore, and selected a recent restore point prior to the XBox 360, in the list of programs that will be deleted I saw an entry for "Microsoft (XnaComposite) 08/13/2009 2.1.0.1349."&nbsp;What this tells me is that even after uninstalling the XBox 360 software,
 a copy of the driver file still remains in the system and is still listed in the Registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The obvious solution to completely remove it is to run the restore point to remove this entry, so this is not my question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is instead this: How do you manually uninstall / remove this driver -- or any lingering driver for that matter --&nbsp;aside from performing a System Restore restoration from a previous checkpoint?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is not specific to just this Microsoft (XnaComposite) driver.&nbsp;My question is about how to handle such lingering driver files. &nbsp;This is not the first time that I've seen a driver file still lingering in my system after uninstalling the software
 that put it there in the first place.&nbsp; I'm tired of performing a System Restore to completely erase such "orphaned" files, so I'm hoping to hear an alternative approach to make this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there really is no other solution than to do a System Restore, then I want to get such feedback as well, to get closure over this matter.&nbsp; (In other words this will mean the only way to completely erase said files is to do a System Restore.)</p>

<h2>            Need to synchronize Outlook 2010 Calendar with iCloud Calendars from iPhone and iPad</h2>
                    In newly installed Windows 10 I can no longer access synchronized iCloud Calendars in the Outlook 2010 Office application. Emails and Contacts are available, but no calendars can be opened. Under Win 8.1 I had full synchronization, but this has disappeared.
 Opening iCloud drive on Windows PC shows that the synchronization box is checked for Outlook, but it does not function. Also, I cannot find the file iCloud64.msi in my system, although I have downloaded it successfully. Please find a solution.

            The iCloud installer says that I don't have the correct iCloud64.msi to either install, update or uninstall iCloud. This has happened since I upgrade to Windows 10.

            well the error message when I Try formatting is " windows was unable to complete the format". and no I am unable to open in Win7. I will try to scan with defender and Norton Internet Security 2011, instead because it's our family computer and my dad has
 the system admin password and I know right now he's not going to let me put it on.

Just a guess, but it's likely that the drive has failed and is no linger usable. They don't last forever.</p>

<h2>            user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer</h2>
                    I am an unpaid volunteer providing PC support for small public library with 4 Win10 PCs networked.&nbsp; We were sharing files using Homegroup until 1803 upgrade. Renaming PCs and changing some settings, I have been able to get all but one PC to share.&nbsp; The
 one in question cannot access any of the others shared files but all the others can access the shared files on it.&nbsp; I can ping the others from the uncooperative PC and all PCs show up on the Network page. When I try to open a window to one of the other PCs,
 I get the message "user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer".&nbsp; I am out of ideas on how to fix. Would appreciate any thoughts on what to do next.

            Hey Bitwiddler.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Homegroup has been removed in the latest version.   Here is what is working to correct File Sharing problems caused by Version 1803:   
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot  sharing problems:

<br />
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>

            Before posting, I made the services.msc changes to all PCs.&nbsp; I changed the sharing options on all and turned on SMB 1.0 through the Windows Functions option. This morning before library opened, I changed all the machine names and sharing miraculously appeared
 between the others.&nbsp; I can access all shares from any of the others, including shares on the problem PC.<br />

            Yes, it got me part way with the other PCs but it was inconsistent. Then when I changed machine names, everything started working properly. I set all PCs up as automatic (delayed) per the posts I found during my search.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>I tried the Windows + R function you suggested but still couldn't access it.&nbsp; Had wild idea and changed all the PCs from DHCP to static IP addresses and the problem went away.&nbsp; All is working now. Do not understand why that would make a difference.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Maybe you deleted or moved accidentally the shortcut to Windows Media Player. If you want to create the shortcut in Start - All Programs, please follow the steps:<br />
<br />
1. Right click on <strong>Start </strong>and select <strong>Explore</strong> .<br />
2. Enter on <strong>Programs </strong>folder.<br />
3. Up on <strong>File </strong>menu, select <strong>New </strong>- <strong>Shortcut</strong> .<br />
4. Click on <strong>Browse </strong>button and select <strong>wmplayer.exe</strong> from
<strong>C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player</strong> <br />
5. Type a name for your shortcut, like <strong>Windows Media Player</strong> <br />
6. <strong>Finish</strong> <br />
<br />
Now you must have your shortcut to Start - All Programs.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!

            Give it a few days and it should activate automatically.
<br />
<br />I would also first check to make sure all the latest Windows Updates have been installed. 
<br />
<br />If you have the Windows 10 product key for the product key for the version of Windows you upgraded from (Windows 7 or Windows 8), you can use it to reactivate.

<p><span>Hi!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have MSI GE60-0NC-255RU running Windows 10 Pro (Version 1511, Build 10586.122)</span></p>
<p><span>It shutdowns exactly after 30 minutes since I turn it on or wake it up from sleep
 or hibernation but it doesn't show me a BSOD.</span></p>
<p><span>When I check the windows event log there's the following error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">Log Name: System</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Source: Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Description: &nbsp;The system has rebooted without
 cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What's the problem?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>P.S I know that my laptop doesn't officially support win 10, but I've had this OS
 installed for a few months before I started to get random shutdowns.</span></p>

</p><p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool
 as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in
 normal mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans. </span>

<h3> donsilver surfer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop updates completely</h2>
                    <p>590I had to roll back before the crash date on windows 10 because I am on satelite internet and setting it to metered does not help with updates.&nbsp; I pay the highest per bit cost in the states and I simply can't afford updates that I don't choose what I update.&nbsp;
 I mean microsoft can use up all your bandwidth in just a couple of updates and then you simply have paid for nothing and have no more internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Metering does not work.&nbsp; When you are actually limited to x amount of gigabytes in data downloads and x amount of speed you can't have software that updates on it's own... you can't... you simply pay for something you don't actually get to use then...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if microsoft wants to pay for my internet then it would be ok... but i have yet to be able to find a way to stop it from updating on it's own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't control what I update and when I simply can't use it, at all....&nbsp; So someone out there tell my how I go back to the old way of updating so I have control of what and when I update anything.... somethings just don't get updated unless I can get
 an update from someone else on cd.&nbsp; that is just the way it has to be when you pay ungoshly amount of money and are extremely limited on data limits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so someone plz tell me how to turn it off completely or control what and when i update.. otherwise I will have to stay with 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>Wow, no replies from anyone Microsoft... so I guess the answer is people like us just can't use windows going forward.&nbsp; I have been a supporter since slogging on with 15 disk for windows 3 lol and i can't believe Microsoft is going to be so insensitive to
 people that simply must control the updates.&nbsp; If I only have a gig left of data and they have a large update it could wipe that out in one update... then I have no internet and have paid large amount of money for something I did not get to use because of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a great deal of customers like me out there and I see this being messy for Microsoft.&nbsp; You can't force people that pay for bandwidth to use it to update without compensation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must simply give people like us control back to update only what they need to and when they need to because there are certain times also involved in using your bandwidth.&nbsp; I simply can't believe that no one from Microsoft has come forward to broach this
 subject yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is telling me that we simply must go back to windows 8.1 or move to free open source Linux.</p>
