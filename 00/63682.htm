</p><p>I bought Norton security and i have also tried Lenovo security, however i dont trust that it clears all the viruses or protects me completly. When i scan the computer i dont think the viruses are all found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is should i reset my PC completly every year or 6 months or should i trust the security apps.</p>

    <title>video_tdr_failure in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> circus_alchemist  say:</h3>
<h2>            video_tdr_failure in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Blue screen (video_tdr_failure) on start up, with a video glitch (lines).&nbsp; Will not boot into normal mode.&nbsp; With a frustratingly stupid number of steps, was able to get into Safe Mode.&nbsp; (I am typing from there now).&nbsp; Video works fine as the BasicDisplay.sys,
 it seems.&nbsp; This should mean that the card is fine, it's a driver issue right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The automatic steps of repair (sort of forced upon you as you try to go to Safe Mode)&nbsp;and system&nbsp;restore (nothing old enough)&nbsp;have been tried, with no luck.&nbsp; I did manage to get all the manufacturer video drivers&nbsp;uninstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, no&nbsp;new card has been installed.&nbsp; The last driver installed was a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; Recent, but not that recent.</p>
<p>(current card is GeForce 880gx, but the drives have been uninstalled so it may not be relevant).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SRTTrail file confirms that a recent driver installation or upgrade may be preventing the system from starting." Yep, figured that.&nbsp; The only non-zero error code listed is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Repair action: System files integrity check and repair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Result: Failed. Error code =&nbsp; 0x490<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time taken = 995926 ms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the system repair trying to fix it, right?&nbsp; So I go to the system configure and set to boot into BaseVideo mode.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I run the gauntlet to Safe Mode options again and select the VGA Mode option there (#3, I think).&nbsp; Also no.&nbsp; By "No" I mean:&nbsp; it
 tries, it hangs, it reboots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it will not boot into VGA mode?&nbsp; What driver is it trying to load if not BasicDisplay.sys? (which is working in Safe Mode!)&nbsp; Is this a case of SFC restoring a corrupt file, perhaps?&nbsp; I don't see a way to disable SFC, except through GPO which I can't get
 into from Safe Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A side note:&nbsp; Safe Mode sucks now, especially for this sort of debugging.&nbsp; I have zero rights.&nbsp; (This is my home box, so I have admin rights).&nbsp; The local GPO will not load (I assume permissions).&nbsp; I cannot download files or set internet settings (they look
 correct in the registry but IE still blocks download -- is there some overriding key that causes IE to ignore it's settings in Safe Mode?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd rather not wipe and reinstall but it's been 2 days now of this thing and I just don't see it.&nbsp; It's probably obvious, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping one of you guys has come across this problem&nbsp;(does that means I'm wishing you ill?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have this same issue on my Toshiba laptop. &nbsp;It has two video cards, an Intel HD 4000 for desktop display, and an Nvidia GTX 670m for gaming. &nbsp;Whenever this error occurs, I lose the Nvidia in the device manager. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Then, I started getting the Driver_power_state error. &nbsp;I fixed that by changing the power state while plugged in to always on, rather than the "power saving" defaults.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I uninstalled a lot of "tools" I had installed (CCleaner, Daemon tools, etc) and that seemed to help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At this point, I have the Windows 8 default drivers installed, and it seems to be ok. &nbsp;I'm thinking that the "extra" items that Nvida is adding to their drivers (enhancments) are causing issues. &nbsp;I'll try just installing the drivers without the "extra"
 stuff and see what happens.</div>

            As it turns out, this can also be caused by faulty hardware, as in my case. &nbsp;I've had to return my laptop for service twice now, as the Nvidia card was faulty, it even completely burnt up once.
<div>Now that it's working correctly, no more errors popping up. &nbsp; So, don't let these support people keep telling you &nbsp;it's only software related, because that's not true. &nbsp;Just make sure you have the most current drivers. &nbsp;if you keep getting the errors,
 it's probably a hardware issue.</div>

            Windows 8.1 Custom built computer. It has onboard video card and AMD Radeon 7870. My computer randomly restarts every 3-5 days. I noted that it does not stay on longer than 5 days for one or another reason. I did not try to check disk because it is SSD.
 And what would my disk have to do with anything? It happens when computer coming out of sleep. It attempts to start and fails. I do not have any graphics or video applications running- only couple of web pages open and couple of Word documents. &nbsp;

            <p>Sorry for mistakes but english is not my mother tongue (feel free to correct)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got the same issue but now it is solved. this problem occured just after&nbsp;upgrading to &nbsp;Windows 8.1&nbsp;with a &nbsp;fully formated disk (no personnal data, no applications installed, no games just OS).</p>
<p>It was a nightmare as it didn't apear immediatly after the boot but later. I have re-installed many time</p>
<p>the entire system from the Microsoft Windows 8.1 CD Rom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>find&nbsp;below steps I have executed to fix issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Start desktop in SAFEBOOT mode </p>
<p>2) uninstall&nbsp;graphical driver (mode vga will be used)</p>
<p>3) reboot system</p>
<p>4) downoad and install latest graphic driver from the manufacturer</p>
<p>5) reboot the system</p>
<p>these simple steps were sufficient for my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I suppose the Microsoft Windows 8.1 CD Rom&nbsp;came with a&nbsp;corrupted driver for my specific hardware. Below result of DxDiag command showing hardware. Hope this helps !</p>

                    <p>Hi, I am getting this BSOD since a while after I installed Windows 8.1. I tried everything including virus(Kaspersky) and malwarebytes scan in safe mode, change graphics card, install fresh copy of windows 8.1 and all the updates. But the BSOD continues.
 I happens random which makes it really unpredictable to find a reason. I have contacted many engineers and they all failed to sort out my issue. Hope one of you guys can finally break the deadlock.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Zak</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick reply.</p>
<p>I only found out the WERS on manual and changed it to automatic. The rest were fine.</p>
<p>Below is the link which contains all the minidump and the other bigger dump files.</p>

</p><p>The kernel-dump is of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION (133)</strong></span> bug check.<br />
<br />
<em>This bug check indicates that the DPC watchdog executed, either because it detected a single long-running deferred procedure call (DPC), or because the system spent a prolonged time at an interrupt request level (IRQL) of DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>BugCheck 133, {<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1</span></em></strong>, 1e00, 0, 0}</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system exceeds a larger timeout of time spent cumulatively in all DPCs since the IRQL was raised to DPC level, the system will bugcheck with a 0x133, and the first parameter will be set to
<strong>1</strong>. This is what happened in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally you need to use Xperf to actually debug this because it's occurring for more than
<strong>one </strong>reason, but we can give it a go with kernel debugging.</p>

<br />
<strong>Which should I download?</strong><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
Do note that some older generation motherboards do not support USB-based booting, therefore your only option is CD (or Floppy if you really wanted to).
<br />
<br />
<strong>How Memtest works:</strong><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search bar &gt; Type cmd (right click run as admin to execute Elevated CMD)<br />
<br />
Elevated CMD should now be opened, type the following:<br />
<br />
chkdsk x: /r<br />
<br />
x implies your drive letter, so if your hard drive in question is letter c, it would be:<br />
<br />
chkdsk c: /r<br />
<br />
Restart system and let chkdsk run.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "Computer" window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the drive in question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Tools" tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Press Windows Key + R and type powershell.exe in the run box<br />

Paste the following command and press enter afterwards:<br />
<br />
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSKResults.txt<br />

You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be driver related issues that may cause conflicts or a false positive, it may be a wise decision
 to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS). I always recommend running Seatools in DOS if absolutely possible.<br />

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>I will run memtest and others as you have asked. I just wanted to inform you that I got 2 DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION today while the pc was in idle !!! On both occasions the BSOD got blurred and frozen completely, so I had to reset using the reset button on
 the CPU casing. Also, none of those&nbsp; BSOD created any dump files either which is very surprising.</p>
<p>Finally,I don't think I can update the bios myself as I am little scared that I might mess things up.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Zak</p>

    <title>Why has this &#34;Setup has failed to validate the product key&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why has this &#34;Setup has failed to validate the product key&#34; been locked&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Following up on the Win 10 download fiasco, I believe that Microsoft has changed it's corporate process in order to reign in what it sees as piracy. This in effect stops the cheap vendors from selling keys and forces one to first buy a key from
 Microsoft at $119.00 for Win 10 home, $199.00 for Win 10 Pro and some higher near $400.00 for Business. The other caveat is when you buy a new PC&nbsp; with windows installed, it is up to that vender to provide the buyer with a method for repair and recovery. That
 process is usually a repair hidden section on the drive that many buyers had deleted to provide more room on the drive, trusting to the down load ISO to provide that repair function which Microsoft liberally did up to now. You see calls for help from people
 that bought a new computer with Win 10 installed and contacted Microsoft complaining that the ISO would not work and Microsoft told them to contact their vender. The gist of the problem is that the newer down load ISO from Microsoft will only work if your
 25 digit/alpha key code is already in their computer, and this can now only happen if you purchase the Win 10 from Microsoft directly. I presume that the free upgrades that Microsoft passed out earlier is in their computer. I will be testing this soon on my
 qualifying installations.</div>
<div>The safest thing that people can do now is to make a clone of that drive on a new drive and keep it on the shelf. When you think about it a 1gig drive cost $50 plus dollars and a new upgrade of Win 10 is $99.00. If you have a vender supplied computer
 and the drive fails you have no recourse except to buy a new win 10 at $119.00 unless you have a second drive with the original installation. This also is a problem with the new Laptop computers as the battery and H-drive are sealed inside and in order to
 replace the drive you have got to crack the case and that is a daunting task for anyone as the cases are very thin and break easily.</div>

            Highest amount you can pay for a Windows 10 license is $200 for the Pro edition.
<br />
<br />There are websites reselling MSDN licenses that are eventually blocked by Microsoft.
<br />
<br />Some white box vendors will sometimes use these keys or buy them off auction sites because they are cheap and don't want to go through the valid route. 
<br />
<br />About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys 
<br />They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.
<br />
<br />In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.
<br />
<br />If you purchased or receive a computer with a valid license, you can reinstall and reactivate it as many times on the same hardware. Just as long as you are reinstalling the same edition.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<p>Mr. Da Costa:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting and lengthy as your answer is, the outcome of my question still stands. Did the locking of the previous questioner's&nbsp; on May31, 2018 hide a Corporate change in the Window's 10 ISO?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your answer indicates that everything is quite the same and it is the questioner's fault that the problem exist.&nbsp; I have to differ with you in the respect that my Windows 7 computer came with a Genuine Microsoft Windows 7 from the manufacturer. Upon trying
 to update the machine using Microsoft's update process, the update failed (4) times with "setup has failed to validate the product key. This was a test that I carried out to understand why so many were reporting the above error. I concluded that Microsoft
 had changed the update process to reign in the sellers of "Keys" and at the same time put the onus of the maintenance of preinstalled Win 10 os on the manufacturers. I have two other machines that I allowed Microsoft to "free" update with Windows 10 of which
 I plan to test with the download ISO to see if they offer the same error. I presume that they will pass the test, but here to fore my Windows 7 machine would pass the test.</p>

            You could download, create a bootable copy then attempt the upgrade offline without being connected to the Internet.

<br />Without knowing where you bought your computer or how it was originally configured at the factory, the edition installed, its hard to make a judgement call.

            I had the same problems then Username2016 and hundred and thousands of tutorials don't help if you don't have access to the Control Panel nor the Administrator Command Prompt. In my case, after several attempts, the systems detected itself that there was
 a problem with the C: disk and "repaired" it somehow. From that moment I had again access to the Control Panel and I achieved reinstalling Windows 10. I lost however the programs and had to reinstall them one by one. Since then the Laptop works but reboots
 from time to time with different error codes as CRITICAL_PROCESS_END or CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED. I suspect that I have a Hardwareproblem.

<p>I'm asking that XBOX bring back TMNT 1989 Arcade Game along with the original version of Turtles in Time not the Reshelled version.&nbsp; There are so many gamers who still want both of these games.</p>

<h2>            my hp pavilion f1503 monitor has two blue boxes in the middle of my screen that wont go away</h2>
                    <p>Original title: monitor problems f1503 </p>
<p>my hp pavilion f1503 monitor has two blue boxes in the middle of my screen that wont go away. one says OSD main menu and on top of that one it the window that says birghtness contrast... when i push menu on my monitor they disappear but only if i hold the
 menu button in. if i push in the select button to try and go to default settings or exit sub-menu everything goes haywire and starts running through the options at warp speed and wont stop. the buttons on the monitor are of no help, I have tried unplugging
 the monitor from the computer and the wall and leaving it sit, tried restoring the system, nothing is working and the two blue boxes just sit and block my view. To write this I had to use one hand and hold in the menu button so as to see. Can anyone help me?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
How old is your monitor? It's possible that there could be a short somewhere within it, or perhaps the menu button has been damaged or pressed in too hard.
<br />
<br />
Also, aside from testing with a brand new monitor, changing the connection cable that links the monitor to the computer might do the trick.
<br />
<br />
If all else fails, you may just need to take it in for repairs. <br />

<ul>
<li>Did you experience the same issue when you send an email to this group through web (or when you access the account through web)?
</li><li>How did you create the email group? </li><li>Do you experience the same error condition with other contact groups? </li><li>Did you try to re-create the email group? If so, did the same issue happened?</li></ul>

            <p>Within Windows Live Mail you will see your name on the top menu bar and the opportunity to "sign in" or "Sign Out".&nbsp; Try Sign Out, and then sign back in (it will ask for your password, so make sure you know it before you do this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had the same problem as you, and I suspect with the "recent switch" over to the some different&nbsp;webmail platforms under Hotmail&nbsp;/Windows offerings that&nbsp;something needed to be updated in WLM client also..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Give some feedback if it works.&nbsp; It did for me&nbsp;( after many days of thinking and looking for a solution).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you have signed out and back in, try sending to a group by typing the name in the To: or CC: or BCC, but before you send it, try to expand the Category by clicking the +plus sign in front of the group name.&nbsp; If it expands, and all your emails show up,
 it will mail out to the category, SO LONG AS&nbsp; you don't have more than 100 contacts in the category.&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a second category&nbsp; (ie Group1 (A-L)&nbsp; Group2 (M-Z)
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Silly me, I notice this problem was from April 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now Dec 5 2013.&nbsp; Since the problem&nbsp;still persisted in Dec 5 2013 I&nbsp;suspect a Windows Update might be in order somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-people/windows-live-mail-category-problem/fdc70f55-8456-466a-aa65-5f0b04f50f3f?page=29&amp;tm=1425931398063</p>
<p>
</p><p>On page 2 of 29 I read that making sure your app passwords are entered may clear up some category syncing problems (between your webmail and your email client installed on your computer). &nbsp;Just a thought. &nbsp;I banged my head on that one for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opted to keep my Windows 7 computer and use WLM 2011 on it.<br />
</p>
<p>But.... I do have a Windows 8.1 &nbsp;netbook so I could familiarize myself with the new technology but I have not loaded WLM on it yet because I find the web interface reasonable and do most large mailing list work on the Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better options for large mailing lists are using MS Office products such as MS Outlook and using Mail Merge with Word Documents. &nbsp;Or more simply using a Spreadsheet (or preferably Datasbase Program such as Access if you can figure it out) to manage your
 mailing lists.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know this does not solve your problem with WLM on Windows 8, but suggest you post specifics and revive the discussion specifically for Windows 8 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this neat page, and I did not know Category names had length limits of 60 characters.</p>
<p>https://wlmail.wordpress.com/contacts-1/using-categories/</p>
<p>It's probably because the Category is, &nbsp;in essence, &nbsp;a "folder" which we should always keep short also (in Windows explorer file system in general), with each contact being a "document" in the folder.</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for the reply...It is becoming more and more obvious to me that Microsoft has no intention of ever fixing this problem and they are just full of B.S. &nbsp;Although I have learned how to use Windows 8 and find it actually has some very nice features
 I've struggled with this small issue now for at least a year. Someone has recommended a product called Thunderbird which I think I will try, and to hell with Microsoft and their B.S.

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps randomly crashing &#40; AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Build&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all I would like to apologise for my bad english writing skills. English is not my primary language.<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm getting really frustrated with my PC. I have a new AMD ryzen 5 build with a clean windows 10 install. But unfortunately I'm keeping getting random crashes.<br />
I have the PC for 2 months now and ever since I build it it keeps randomly crashing.<br />
<br />
1ste instal:<br />
<br />
installed windows 10, no problems<br />
installed all recent drivers from al components.<br />
Flashed bios to newest version.<br />
OS installed on a samsung SSD 850 EVO ( did already a SSD health check, everything seemed alright)<br />
<br />
after a few day's of use, the PC started crashing with BSOD<br />
all BSOD messages were always different<br />
<br />
IRQL note less or equal<br />
0Xc0000221 (ntfs.sys error)<br />
Kernel security check failure<br />
and so on..<br />
<br />
After I began to get these bsod, I once again checked for software problems, hardware drivers etc. nothing came out.<br />
antivirus + malware check, everything seems alright.<br />
Memetest check, also nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
after these test the computer would still randomly crash.<br />
<br />
After a while I was suspecting that i has to be an SSD problem or faulty windows 10 instal.<br />
SO I bought a new HDD, just to check,<br />
<br />
Here I began my second instal.<br />
<br />
Right away i noticed that before i could instal windows 10 on the HHD my PC would start crashing. So my logical thinking was that it had to be a hardware problem. ( my own thought was that it had to be the motherboard or GPU)<br />
after some crashes (aprox 10) the Instal of windows would magicly continue without any crashes.<br />
After I completed the instal, I decided to not instal any drivers or software. just to check if the problems were caused by certain drivers or software</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hop. <br />
The computer would stay on for 3 days straight, without any activity and everything seemed alright, there where no dumpfiles, so no crashes etc.<br />
<br />
So after&nbsp; these 3 days the computer started to crash again, with no activity at all.<br />
I'm collecting the dump files so you guys can take a look at it.<br />
I will drop them on a shared link on onedrive and will keep them there for any future cases.<br />
<br />
https://1drv.ms/f/s!Apm9l7T7RdNkjUWGaS1iM6x6i1Ya <br />
<br />
My setup:<br />
AMD Ryzen 5 2600<br />
Asrock B450 Pro 4 (bios updated)<br />
MSI GT710 1GB DDR3<br />
Corsair VS450<br />
Team group Vulcan 16GB DDR4 3000 (TLGD416G3000HC16CDC01)<br />
Logitech K260 ( keyboard + mouse)<br />
sharkoon Ca-M case<br />
</p>
<p>Hope you guys can help me out!</p>

<p>To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />
Choose the applicable link for the operating system:<br />

<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive or drop box to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-OneDrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07<br />
<br />
This command will automatically collect these files:&nbsp; msinfo32, mini dumps, drivers, hosts, install, uninstall, services, startup, event viewer files, etc.<br />
<br />
Open administrative command prompt and copy and paste the whole command:<br />
<br />
copy %SystemRoot%\minidump\*.dmp "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\"&amp;dxdiag /t %Temp%\dxdiag.txt&amp;copy %Temp%\dxdiag.txt "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\SFdebugFiles\"&amp;type %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts &gt;&gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\hosts.txt"&amp;systeminfo &gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\systeminfo.txt"&amp;driverquery

<br />
There are two files for you to find manually:<br />
<br />
a) C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP<br />
<br />
Use file explorer &gt; this PC &gt; local C: drive &gt; right upper corner search enter the above to find results.<br />
<br />
b) dxdiag:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In the left lower corner search type:&nbsp; dxdiag &gt; When the DirectX Diagnostic Tool opens click on the next page button so that each tab is opened &gt; click on save all information &gt; save to desktop &gt; post one drive or drop box share link into the thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For any BSOD that occurs after the above steps perform the following steps:</p>
<p>a) run the administrative command prompt command and post a new share link into the thread using one drive, drop box, or google drive</p>
<p>b) open file explorer &gt; this PC &gt; C: &gt; in the right upper corner search for:&nbsp; C:\Windows\memory.dmp &gt; if the file size is &lt; 1.5 GB then zip and post a separate share link into the thread using one drive, drop box, or google drive</p>

<p>I don't think i understand question1 very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the steps as mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>So my answers to question1</strong></p>
<p>6) Make sure that there is no over clocking while troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>(I did not overclocked my cpu so i don't know how to check if cpu is overclocked. so I assume the cpu is in original settings. The CPU is bought new)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>7) uninstall the Nvidia GPU driver using DDU (display driver uninstaller)</p>
<p><em>(I installed DDU, restarted to safemode and unstalled the drivers here.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>8) re-install the Nvidia GPU driver from the Nvidia website.</p>
<p><em>(I downloaded the lastest drivers from nvidia and installed it with no problem)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>9) make sure that you check the clean install box and if available install the physx driver.</p>
<p>( This option never showed up during the install of the drivers, so i couldn' t select this option)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>completed the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I had another BSOD.</p>
<p>The file in onedrive is called fourth crash.</p>

<p>1) The latest BSOD misbehaving was a recurrent driver:&nbsp; nvlddmkm.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Temporarily turn off Windows update of non-Microsoft drivers:</p>
<p>https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48277-enable-disable-driver-updates-windows-update-windows-10-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) uninstall the Nvidia GPU driver using DDU (display driver uninstaller)<br />
4) re-install the Nvidia GPU driver from the Nvidia website<br />
5) make sure that you check the clean install box and if available install the physx driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Display Driver Uninstaller Download version 17.0.8.2 (or newer version if available)<br />
https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/367109-display-driver-uninstaller-how-use.html<br />
http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx<br />
http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/display_driver_uninstaller.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Make sure that Nvidia GPU driver that is installed is a different version than:</p>
<p>25.21.14.1694</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) If there is another Nvidia GPU misbehaving driver then the Nvidia GPU card needs to be tested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Some computers can produce a display from the motherboard without dGPU.</p>
<p>If you are able to have a display without the Nvidia GPU then then the Nvidia GPU card and the Nvidia drivers can be uninstalled to evaluate the computer for stability/instability.
</p>
<p>If the dGPU is required for a display then a swap is another testing option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>8) See if you can find a friend, neighbor, relative, or local computer store to swap the GPU card.</p>
<p>Perform two tests.</p>
<p>Test a new card in the problematic computer.</p>
<p>Test the card from the problematic computer in another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) The next step is test another Nvidia GPU driver.&nbsp; If this different driver causes a BSOD then plan to test the GPU hardware.</p>

<p>I did all the above steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did step 2&nbsp; accourding to option 2 of the link.</p>
<p>I restarted my pc in to save mode to performe DDU and uninstalled the driver for de GPU. But then something strange happend.</p>
<p>I unstalled the driver of nvidia, then I needed to restart my computer so the changes could take effect.</p>
<p>Once restarted i noticed the the screen looked as of it had the drivers installed.</p>
<p>meaning the screen was not bulky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked in to the installed apps and noticed this.</p>
<p>Remember i did not installed any new drivers yet.</p>

</p><p>can you check if it is still de gpu.</p>
<p>because i saw a message saying ntfs.sys</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 after last &#34;AUTOMATIC&#34; update hangs - can&#39;t logout&#47;shutdown anything</h2>
                    <p>Went from Windows 7 home premium and upgraded to 10. &nbsp;After most recent automatic update system hangs during bootup. &nbsp;Can't shutdown / restart / access network. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got into safemode.. funny but msconfig / taskmanager work. &nbsp; Restored to previous point, system worked for a day until Auto update ran and locked me out again. &nbsp;Your decision to force updates was without a doubt a **** move. &nbsp;Have to love how you just
 want to tick off your "former" customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have now returned back to Win 7.. didn't go smoothly but at least I'm running now.</p>

            <p>Hi Raian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to print Word document from the printer.
<span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Are you able to print from other application like notepad, internet browser, etc?</span></li><li><span>Are you getting any error message/code while printing the word document?</span></li><li><span>Is that printer set as default?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer and printer?</span></li></ol>
<p>
I would suggest you to try these steps and check.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the built-in Printer troubleshooter to fix any errors with the printer settings. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Run the Printer troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Change permissions</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check if the user account has permission to print and manage the printer. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +C, select control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under Hardware and devices, select view devices and printers</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate your printer and right click
</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the Printer properties from the menu and select security tab</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select your user account name from the list of user accounts</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Make sure that all the check boxes against the permissions are marked as “Allow”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the permission is already set as “allow”, then this could be a network setting issue. Check if your account is configured correctly to the network and check the network options.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Re-install the printer</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the permission settings and the network settings are set correctly and yet you are facing this issue, I would suggest uninstall and re-install the printer and check. You can follow the steps provided below to do so:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please make sure that you have the setup file for the driver of the printer before uninstalling the current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press Windows and x key together and click on Device Manager.<br />
b) Locate the printer driver and expand the driver icon.<br />
c) Right click on the driver icon and click on Uninstall.<br />
d) Follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the driver.<br />
e) Locate the setup file of the driver for the printer.<br />
f) Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p><br />
Check if you are able to find the printer online.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Rehab Uddin,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft community! You've reached the right forum for your question. You may try the suggestions provided and check if you are able to perform the update.<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What is the exact error message?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may try the suggestions from the link:<br />
What to do if you have problems with an app: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a>
</p>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />

e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
<br />
f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
<br />
f) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now try to update the apps and check.<br />
</p>
<div>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
<br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<div>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
<div>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </div>
<div>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.<br />
<div>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<div>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.<br />
<br />
Step 7:<br />
<br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.<br />

<h2>            spider solitaire windows 8 won&#39;t let me change to four suits</h2>
                    Spider solitaire shows up on my windows 8 start menu. When I check out the instructions, it talks about using four suits. But there is no way to change the setting so I can actually
<em>PLAY</em> with four suits. Been playing <em>WAY</em> to long to go back to one suit.....Please help!

            Just one of the quirks of Windows 8.&nbsp; Apparently, that "charms" bar to the right side of the screen controls or works on the apps as well, so you go to that and SETTINGS and change to four suits there.

                    <p>My current configuration of my pc is</p>

            32 bit Windows will only see 4GB of ram no matter how much you install. &nbsp;First you must check to see if your computer has 64 bit hardware installed. If it has you need to install a 64 bit version of Windows which will recognize all the ram you have installed.
 It's a waste of time and money installing more than 4GB of ram because the 32 OS won't be able to use it.

            <p>32 bit does only support a maximum of 4 gigs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change architecture you will need to completely wipe the HD and do a clean install of 64 bit from the ISO which you can get at the below.&nbsp; Be sure to back up your data.&nbsp; You will of course have to re-install everything.</p>

<p>System Restore is completely different to a System Image Backup.</p>
<p>System Restore points are set/stored on the C: partition where the Operating System is installed and are automatically made by Windows, if System Restore is turned on, which it should be by default.</p>

            Hi,
<br />This is a known issue with 1803. Immidiate fix would be to rollback to 1709 but you can see the below options:
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

<p>I feel Sorry for the bad English.<br />
Hello everyone. I would like to ask for help about a problem. I saw that in the multipayer screen, appears "NAT Type Closed". In fact I can not almost never find a match online. How can I open the NAT on windows?<br />
Another question; you can disable the voice chat in the game, to use an external program? Type Skype to talk to my friends? Thanks so much!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 does not recognize USB devices. Hangs at &#34;detect hardware changes&#34;</h2>
                    <p>HiI am having major issues with Win 8.1 Device Manager. It does not recognize any USB unless it is plugged in on start-up. I have tried "detect hardware changes" but it hangs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried DeviceWin8.meta.diagcab but it hangs at resolving problems. I have also tried the Win 8.1 troubleshooter - same thing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it always asks me to choose Firefox as my default browser and does the same for Vuze for torrents.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do a non-destructive reinstall but it got stuck at 39% at 9pm and was still at the same place at 9 am the next morning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth but it fails with unable to download files - use source to specify or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be welcome. </p>
<p>

<li>Do you get any error message when it gets stuck at "detect hardware changes"?</li><li>Did you try to perform 'refresh' when you say 'non-destructive reinstall'?</li><li>What is the exact error message that you get when you try to run the DISM tool?</li></ol>
<p>As per the issue description, the errors depict a major system file corruption in the system causing the issue. To diagnose and troubleshoot the cause, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter: <br />
a. Press “Windows key + W”.<br />
b. Type “Troubleshooting” without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c. Select “Hardware and Sound” from the Troubleshooter Window.<br />
d. Select “Hardware and Devices” under Devices option.<br />
e. Follow the On Screen instructions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any system files corruption in the system.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>

            <p>Hello Shane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please <strong>run DISM tool </strong>and check. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click Search. Type Command Prompt in the Search box, right-click
 Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Type the following command, and then press Enter.<br />
</p>
<p>It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After you get message “The operation completed successfully” type second command and press enter. It will take some time to
</p>
<p>finish.</p>
<p><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: when you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            KB981013 Hotfix self extractor PW invalid</h2>
                    
<p>I request hoftix for KB981013 Vista Ultimate x64 SP2<br />
I've used this fix in the past without issues. (11/16/2010)<br />
I've downloaded the file several times and even tried 3rd party extraction tool (7zip)<br />
but the supplied password seems to be invalid.</p>
<p>To test other factors I requested win7/2008 hotfix for 981013, it extracted fine, but of course won't install.</p>
<p>KB Article Number(s): 981013<br />
