            Possibly those songs you are adding have come from an album that had&nbsp;david guetta/Rihanna as the artists like the song "Who's that Chick? I'm not sure if there is a way to change that info if the song uses both names Michael.

<h2>            LTE is destroying my Lumia 920&#39;s battery life</h2>
                    
<p><em>Spellchecker doesn't seem to be working on this website, please excuse any errors.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a Nokia Lumia 920 and I have known ever since I have fist gotten my phone that AT&amp;T's LTE drains my phone's battery life very quickly. It only takes around 6 hours for the battery to drain under LTE and my phone gets very warm as well. The phone
 gets exceptionally hot when charging while on LTE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wasn't an issue before because the area I live in didn't have LTE, but apparently AT&amp;T has just recently set up LTE in my area so now my phone's battery life has been wrecked. This, of course, can be somewhat resolved by cutting off data from the phone,
 but then why bother having a smartphone at that point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any option to switch to only 4G? It was wonderful being on 4G; the Lumia 920's battery would last over 24 hours. Now with LTE, not so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, thanks!</p>

<p>4G and LTE are the same thing. I presume you mean 3G. Having LTE enabled where the LTE signal is poor will significantly reduce battery life. If you are in an area with poor LTE signal but good 3G signal then you can disable LTE by going to Settings&gt;mobile
 network&gt;Highest connection speed and set this to 3G.</p>

<p>Although 4G is synonymous with LTE for most of the world, AT&amp;T use the term 4G to describe the 3.5G (enhanced 3G) network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure I read somwhere that the ability to limit the mobile data connection speed in the phones settings was removed in the latest firmware update. Also, the Field Test menu is no longer available after the update too, so you can't use that method to restrict
 the phone to 3G speeds either.</p>

<p>^ Is that the case...<br />
But yes, I am referring to AT&amp;T's 4G.<br />
I am rather sad to hear that there is no solution to my dilemma however. Is there anything else I could do? Would Nokia honor a phone trade (if a phone trade would work that is)?</p>

    <title>How to recover lost emails&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to recover lost emails&#63;</h2>
                    I've used hotmail for like 15 years, and I had a lot of old sentimental emails stored in my account. I used it sort of as a storage for all my old stuff when I got a new account. I signed in every now and then to make sure things were in order still. I
 somehow missed the notification of the switch over to Outlook. So when I went to sign in a few days ago, I was shocked to see that everything (folders, saved stuff) in my account had been deleted and that I now had outlook.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it possible to get my emails back? And doing the restore in the deleted file does not work, because the emails were deleted more than 5 days ago or whatever the day limit is. And they were not deleted by me. I have chatted with MS about this, I have
 sent emails, so far no help. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have had 15 years worth of old emails, photos, and memories taken from me, and I am not pleased.</div>

<h2>            Windows Defender turns off by itself</h2>
                    <p>Hello.<br />
I have a problem with Windows Defender. When I turn it on, it turns off by itself after few seconds. I do not have any other anti-virus program installed however.<br />
I did have Avast and AVG installed years ago, but I uninstalled both of them correctly.<br />
But I found out that for some reason Windows Explorer shows me&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/gr3r0Tg.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">avast! Online Security</a>&nbsp;[for some reason couldn't upload a photo here], marked in the red box (under View menu and Options
 submenu). When I click it, it does not do anything I cannot get rid of it by any means. Could it be related to the main problem?<br />
I tried to use CCleaner many times and it did not fix the issue. I even tried to reinstall and uninstall both Avast, Avast Online Security (an extension for Google Chrome) and AVG but didn't make a difference. I think the problem might be solved by messing
 with the register, but I have no clue where and how.</p>

            Hi Kin72,<br />
<br />
I guess this is the way it had been designed. A workaround that I use to get pass this when I need to know the number, is via Options, Use number, Edit.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

<p>Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability</p>

<h2>            In Outlook the following characters &#38; &#43; &#92; &#47; &#59; &#34; &#39; &#58; &#62; &#60; &#40; &#41; are not allowed in a Folder name, however, in a Yahoo mail, they can.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
I need any one to address these points to me:<br />
<br />
1- Why In Outlook the following characters &amp; + \ / ; " ' : &gt; &lt; ( ) are not allowed in a Folder name, however, in a Yahoo mail I can name a folder with these characters.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40fd5a52-2f98-458a-95f1-50ca744b1bdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40fd5a52-2f98-458a-95f1-50ca744b1bdf" /></a><br />
2- How to let subfolders are &nbsp;hidden in their parent folders whenever I open my Outlook?In Yahoo mail, whenever I open it, I found subfolders are hidden in their parent folders. So, This can let mail look in small preview in the folders side. Yes, I can do
 that manual, but I want subfolders &nbsp;automatically to be hidden in their parents folders whenever I open my outlook e-mail as what happens in my Yahoo mail.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sway is an Office 365 app that you can use to create interactive contents such like presentations, reports, stories with images, text, documents, videos and more. You can easily modify the results to get the look and feel you want. It
 is web-based so you can share contents with others by simply sending a link, then others can view them without signing up.
</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about Sway, you can see the video in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Getting-Started-with-Sway-2076c468-63f4-4a89-ae5f-424796714a8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>You seem to have done your homework alright :-)</p>

<p>Something I have seen that helps is to add a new user to the system so you get a fresh profile.</p>

</p><p>Is there a way to easily transfer this or do I have to deactivate their computers and then share...will this share show up properly since 365 is already on their computers or do we need to uninstall and reinstall after the share??</p>

            I have to agree with Smartin75, Syed. Your links didn't address the question he asked. So do we have a solution to this query? If we want to share from a Windows 10 to OneDrive using the share button how do we do that? How do we add OneDrive as a default
 to the sharing option? As it sits, I can natively share to Box, OneNote and a few other services, but not to Microsoft's own cloud storage? Does that make any sense at all?

<p>
</p><p>I am running Office 2007 on my WinTen laptop.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried to repair the installation with no success. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to uninstall it, &nbsp;which did not work for whatever reason.</p>
<p>

    <title>resetting Word 2016 to factory settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            resetting Word 2016 to factory settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work on a Mac using office 2016.</p>
<p>I inadvertently changed HEADING 1 to a different default and renamed it HEADING 1a and also amended the settings under it (font size etc).</p>
<p>However, ePublishing software won't recognise the new heading name and for some reason it won't change back no matter what I do.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can simply return the whole programme back to default settings please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards</p>

<p>If you haven't already followed it, please ignore the incorrect [IMO, irresponsible] suggestion supplied by Ping Cheng. Those steps will do absolutely
<em>nothing</em> to change an existing document but may cause unwanted changes in the behavior of the program. Style modifications are stored only in the document in which they are made unless you specifically choose to
<strong>Add to Template</strong>. Style definitions stored in the Normal.dotm template affect only
<em>new</em> documents &amp; Preferences are not involved at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to provide a useful approach, though, more information would be helpful...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you create a new blank document is the <em>modified</em> version of the Style available? If
<em>not</em>, you did not tick the Add to Template check box when making the modification, so your Normal.dotm was not affected. IOW, the Heading 1 Style is still set at its default definition.</li><li>In the existing document, exactly what is the name of the Style as indicated in the
<strong>Styles Pane</strong> or in the <strong>Format&gt; Style</strong> dialog window?</li><li>Please indicate your specific update level of Office 2016 [<strong>Word&gt; About Word -
<em>Version</em></strong>].</li></ul>

            <p>Should be indicated as retail on your order confirmation page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;think MS is trying to get away from the FPP abbreviation.&nbsp; FPP once stood for "Full Packaged Product" but in 2013, there's no such thing as Full because there are no more upgrades, and there's not much to the word Package since the only thing in the package
 is a card with a product key on it.&nbsp; And when you order online you get&nbsp;it via Electronic Software Distribution (ESD) so there is no package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I can tell there are no more OEM licenses for Office 2013.</p>
