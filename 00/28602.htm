    <title>The OZM scam - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The OZM scam</h2>
                    <p>Hi all...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got scammed by OZM and read some posts about the steps I should take to ameliorate my compromised position. Some posts spoke of saving all my files and doing a clean reinstall, cancelling all my cards, changing the passwords to all my accounts, etc.
 I didn't take to that at all and wondered whether or not such posts were going waaaaay overboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I decided to bite the bullet and get help from Microsoft Support. Their main number is
<strong>1-800-426-9400</strong>. It was well worth the $49 I paid for this help! I was connected to a very savvy technical person who answered my questions and got my whole system cleaned up. I had, in particular, one question about a "program" the scammer
 used to make it look like my machine was being cleaned of a "network hack." I was unable to remove it from my machine using System Restore</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He ran this program, one that displayed an impressive dump of all folders on my C drive. He told me OZM used this "program" to convince me that they were doing great things to ensure the "safety" of my network. I'll add, too, that the technician who fixed
 my machine (online through remote access) didn't know the answer to my question right away. He needed to get more information before he could come back to me with a definite answer.&nbsp; IN all, the technical help I got from Microsoft was polite, patient, and
 very knowledgeable.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And the takeaway is...? I urge that if you find you've been scammed, <strong>
<em>use the services that Microsoft provides first</em></strong>! Your circumstance may not be anywhere near as dire as the scenarios your mind has created. Unlike the scammers who "sold" me Network Protection Software, moreover, all Microsoft personnel were
 respectful, patient, and over-the-top polite. Their attitude was diametrically different from the reception given me by the scammers.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I consider myself to be computer savvy (clearly with limitations!). I spent about 40 minutes talking with the scammers before I reluctantly bought their "product." They were able, after bandying about a lot of jargon and taking me to some websites supportive
 of the trouble the purported I had, to convince me that my machine was indeed compromised. The fact that I was locked out of my machine with a repeating audio message urging that I call their telephone number was very convincing. They were nasty good!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So let me close with one more takeaway:&nbsp;<strong><em>Microsoft will never, repeat never, solicit calls to any of their corporate numbers about making repairs on your machine.&nbsp;</em></strong>The technician who helped me let me know that this is corporate
 policy. I repeat: if your machine has been comprised, go to Microsoft first! For $49 and 30 days worth of service, it's well worth the price tag.</p>

<p>There are several fraud cases like this one and you may report them to Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="https://cyberdefend.wordpress.com/2014/12/20/report-technical-support-scammers-to-Microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cyberdefend.wordpress.com/2014/12/20/report-technical-support-scammers-to-Microsoft/</a>
</p>
<p>Contact your credit card company and tell them about this fraud case and also inform authorities in charge of fraud in your country.
</p>
<p>If you installed any program or forced to install , take a note of them and remove them all and make sure run a full system scan with your antivirus software.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too was scammed, I really feel terrible and quite embarrassed. There was one person who called initially, then a second, where these conversations took more than an hour, to a an hour and a half.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They reassured me many times that this was legit, they had me run a file that brought up a box telling me all of the things wrong with my computer. They just seemed to know things that made me feel that it was for real, but that is what criminals do...dont
 they!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third person called almost a week later to verify everything and confirm payment...I actually believed the computer was better. They kept asking why we did not respond to the errors messages and the bottom right of the screen. He said there would be an
 icon there. He also kept saying that we almost never call people, they were just that slick and convincing. They used the log-me-in to take control of the computer and left anti-hack icons on our desk top. In the end, I paid, but hopefully we can still do
 something about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely...very embarrassed!</p>

<h2>            Alias from the sender in Outlook for mac is not the same in owa</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my technical environment: Exchange 2013 &amp; Outlook 2011 / 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have the problem that I get mails from an address (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and this brings a sender alias (John Doe). In OWA and in Outlook for Windows, this alias will be displayed correctly at the sender. But not in Outlook for Mac. Does somebody has
 any idea? In the mail header - the sender is displayed correctly.</p>

            <p>Outlook for Windows is not connecting through the same protocols. It uses MAPI. iOS devices (or mobile phones in general) use ActiveSync, but Outlook for Mac (and Mail) use Web Services instead.<br />The Exchange servers can have very different configurations depending on the protocol used and that could very well explain what you are seeing here, especially since it affects Mail as well.<br />&nbsp;Corentin</p>

<h2>            Page Title</h2>
                    OneNote keeps changing my page titles in the preview to "untitled page" even when I have content and a title on the page. I copy and pasted all the content on a new page and the title would be in the preview but as soon as I went to&nbsp;a different page it
 would default to "Untitled Page". I also tried copying it into a new notebook, but none of this has worked. I take lecture notes and need them to be organized for my tests and this is making it extremely difficult. If anyone knows how to fix this problem,
 PLEASE help!

<h2>            How can I add a custom shape to H1 with a list style applied&#63;</h2>
                    I have set up a template document for a client.<br />
<br />
I have set heading styles with list style applied to get multilevel list numbers. So heading 1 cascades to 1.1 and heading 2 to 2.1 etc. I've applied styles to each heading, however I don't know how to achieve an effect that will help me to fulfill the companies
 brand guidlines.<br />
<br />
I'd like to add a custom shape to the heading 1 behind the heading number. <br />

            In Word, styles include only formatting, not shapes or text. List styles make a special exception for text, but shapes (as opposed to characters that look like shapes, such as Wingdings) aren't supported.<br />
<br />
You can add the shapes to the headings after the headings are inserted with the correct styles. As a manual operation:<br />
<ul>
<li>Insert the shape anywhere in the document, and then cut it to the clipboard.</li><li>Open the Replace dialog and click the More button.</li><li>Click in the Find What box, then click the Format button and choose Style. Select the Heading 1 style and click OK.</li><li>Click in the Replace With box and enter the code&nbsp; <b>^c^&amp;&nbsp;</b> (which corresponds to the clipboard content followed by the found text).</li><li>Click the Replace All button.</li></ul>

                    I have windows 8- 32 bit installed on my laptop. I accidently uninstalled internet explorer 10 from my laptop. How do I reinstall the same?

            <p>Internet Explorer 10 is part of the Windows 8 operating system.&nbsp; The only way you can re-install it is by reloading Windows 8.&nbsp; This is possible, through something called<strong> REFRESH</strong>, which is a WIN 8 option that saves your personal files (documents,
 pictures, videos, Windows Store apps) and uninstalls everything else. Then it reinstalls Windows 8, updates your system, and reinstalls your personal files.&nbsp; It will also reinstall a clean copy of Internet Explorer 10.&nbsp; Essentially, REFRESH puts your computer
 back the way it was when you bought it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how many programs you may have bought, downloaded, or whatever, but if you do a REFRESH it will uninstall all of them and you will have to reinstall them one at a time.&nbsp; It will leave a file on your Desktop telling you which programs it uninstalled,
 so you can reinstall them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should write down the website address of all sites you have Pinned to Start, because they will be gone and you will have to go back to the site and pin them again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When REFRESH is finished, it will automatically start applying all of the Windows<u> updates</u> that have accumulated over the past few months.&nbsp; This will take awhile, but what you have&nbsp;pre-installed on your hard drive needs to be updated (which, I suspect
 is why you're having these problems).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it happen..................</p>
<p>At the Start screen type "REFRESH"</p>
<p>Select "Settings"</p>
<p>Select "Refresh&nbsp;your PC"</p>

<h2>            how do I access the back of my Nokia 2760 to change SIM card&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried to remove the backing cover for my Nokia 2760 as I need to swap the SIM card from my wife's mobile which has broken and can no longer be used. However, I can see no diagram advising me how this can be done so help!<br />
Thanks to you all in advance for your help in this matter.

<h2>            Lost document in copying from OneDrive and merging - help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I copied a document from OneDrive to a new computer, but lost all the changes I have made for the last week. I think this may have happened in the copying process, when I was asked by Word if I wanted to merge documents with the same name, and I said yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I deleted the original file from OneDrive, because it was full - hence the copying process. Also, my File History was not on, and I can't find previous versions using "Compare", in the "Review" pane. Is there any other way to try to get my changes
 back?</p>

<br />Did you also empty the Deleted folder in OneDrive? If you deleted it from the OneDrive app on your computer, check in the deleted folder on the computer where you deleted it too.  
<br />
<br />If its fully deleted and not synced to another computer, then unfortunately it is gone.

<p>Yes, strangely my OneDrive really should not be full, according to the size of the files I've got on it. But it still says it's full, and won't let me save anything further. But that's a separate issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, File History was not turned on. But I think the crux of my problem is less that I deleted the file, and more that I merged two files, and ended up with the wrong one. So basically, I need to undo the merge.</p>

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip, I checked the OneDrive deleted folder. I hadn't emptied it, and I found a lot of other stuff there, but unfortunately not the changes I lost. And it's also not in the Recycle Bin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's no other way to undo the merge of the the two documents? I think that's how I ended up losing my changes.</p>

</p><p>For instance, if today is 10/1/2014, then</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/1/2013 - 1/3/2013 = 0 days within the last 365 days</p>
<p>9/1/2013 - 9/1/2014 = should only count from 10/1/2013 (one year ago today) to EndDate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how return the value. Should it be done in the table or the query?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm stumped. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>I created another query and set the EndDate column just fine. Unfortunately, I'm getting an error when I add the criteria in the AdjStartDate column in the query:</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 does not login to Skype</h2>
                    My Lumia 640 does not&nbsp;login to skype even though it runs windows 10. I get the usual "You cannot be signed in this time. Please check your network settings and try again". I see that other Lumia users are having the same problem but their phones are running
 Win 8.1 which no longer supports skype. The Lumia 640 has windows 10 so why won't it login to skype? (btw there are no network problems and I have uninstalled and reinstalled skype).

            In the end, I used the windows tool and uninstalled win 10 taking the phone back to windows 8.1. I then reinstalled windows 10 and accepted the two updates. It is now working fine but it took me the best part of a day to complete all this nonsense.

<h2>            Shared Calendars show &#34;duplicates&#34; of same meeting</h2>
                    
<p>were a team working close and, we all share our "default" calendar (the one that gets created per default when creating a user) with each other.</p>
<p>there's a lot of thing to be sorted out in this matter as we all use mac's, but that have to to come second.</p>

<p>as for now, viewing my cal i owa, i can see my calendar, and all the others. check.<br />
but as you can see on the pic i've attached meeting's where i've invited colleges to&nbsp;<br />
attend (normal accept/decline invite) - they appear in duplicates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>logic yes - in the way that i'm actually seeing a "copy" of h*r cal, i'm with yu on that one,<br />
but utterly disturbing the times we have a meeting where five, seven of us are invited to.<br />
(or just two - as here).&nbsp;</p>
<p>clutters upp and becomes my headache as i have to fix this.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a19abbb-98b1-4de3-b64b-7f817c5831cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a19abbb-98b1-4de3-b64b-7f817c5831cb" /></a></p>

<p>is there anyway to configure this better?</p>
<p>the ultimate goal is for all of us in the team to see what everyone is booked into/what customers they've invited etc etc.<br />
but when viewing all the cals i my owa, as i am the organiser of the meeting it would be slick to se&nbsp;<em>one</em> meeting instead of seven..</p>
<p>is there anyone having a solution for this?<br />
maybe there's a better way to do all of this - save my day!</p>
<p>deeply grateful for any input o this matter,<br />

<p>as for now, viewing my cal i owa, i can see my calendar, and all the others. check.<br />
and i see the calendar that is the default calendar, see image below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7e9e68a-e868-4b36-b4fe-be17c9ab7a04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7e9e68a-e868-4b36-b4fe-be17c9ab7a04" /></a></p>
<p>but as i add these calendars in my ical, (we're working only on mac's not using outlook,<br />
so this is kind of a priority thing) i see all the calendar's the "person" have, and i've tried to choose to only<br />
share "kalender", which is the default cal.&nbsp;<br />
as for now i've changed so we'er sharing "limited details" with each other.<br />
<br />
full detail or delgate made us be able to change in each other calendars,<br />
wich is no problem here due to security or privacy, but made everyone get emails<br />
of everything all the time.&nbsp;<br />
enough about that.</p>
<p>so as you can se on the image above, i see the calendar that i'm sopposed to see,<br />
but in i'cal i see all the person have, as for example my college's private gcal she connected&nbsp;<br />
to her account.<br />
<br />
see image:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be24a57e-14c9-43a5-b3fa-ffae4ed1cc75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be24a57e-14c9-43a5-b3fa-ffae4ed1cc75" /></a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>is there any one having a clue why this is happening?<br />
i know many of you just think this is a matter for apple support community,<br />
but they normally bounce me back to you.<br />
<br />
so - i'm deeply grateful for any input - thoughts - anything.</p>
<p>when i add these to ical this is the config:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6092a4e-ba47-4988-8ab6-d2fc75cd0caa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6092a4e-ba47-4988-8ab6-d2fc75cd0caa" /></a></p>
<p>i've fiddled with all different accesslevels regarding sharing.<br />
as you can se above moa i greyed out as i only have access to "limited details",<br />
all others i have "full details" to.</p>
<p>but i still se moas other and personal calendars.</p>

<p>Hi BlondeCityFix,</p>
<p>Regarding your initial post, I find that you view multiple calendars at the same time. Since the meeting exists in each person’s calendar, it’s expected that the “copy” of the calendar is displayed. It’s not feasible for just one meeting to show up if you
 are viewing multiple calendars including the participator’s calendar. </p>
<p>About your second post, the issue seems to be that when you add the default calendar of another Office 365 user into your own mailbox, all the other calendars of the other users show up. To further narrow down the root cause, I’d like to collect some more
 details below:<br />
&nbsp;1. As you said you are not using the Outlook client, I would like to confirm that whether you share the calendar in Office 365 OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) and add the shared calendar in the default calendar app on Mac.<br />
2. To make sure that this issue is only related to the default calendar app on Mac not the Office 365 account, could you try to add the shared calendar in OWA to see if only the default calendar show up?<br />
3. Does this issue only occur to this user’s private calendar?<br />
4. As you said the private gCal is connected to the user’s account, does that mean this gCal calendar is connected to her Office 365 calendar? Could you provide us the with detailed steps to do this?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Welcome to Microsoft Office Community and thanks for posting the question. By the description, I understand that you get an error 0x80072EFD while activating Office 365 Home Premium.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I have a couple of questions before we proceed.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1. Have you installed Office 2013 after downloading?</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2. How are you activating Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Login to </font><a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>www.office.com/myaccount</font></a><font><font><font color="#000000"> with the same Live ID which was used to purchase Office 365 and click if it shows
 the current computer registered.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Let us follow the steps below to find the cause and activate the Office 365 suite.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><b>Step 1</b>:<br />
Check for multiple/trial copy of office on the computer.<br />
1. Press the <b>Windows + R</b> key on the keyboard.<br />
2. In the <b>Run</b> windows type <b>appwiz.cpl</b> -&gt; Click <b>Ok</b>.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you find any other version of office, then remove from the computer and restart the computer.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b>Step 2</b>:</font></font></font><font><font color="#000000"><font><br />
One of the common reason is, if have proxy settings running in the browser. Disable the proxy setting and then try to activate the product.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font><font><b>Step 3</b>:<br />
Restart the computer in Clean Boot and activate Office 365 Home Premium. Refer the article on How to restart the computer in Clean Boot:<br />
</font></font></font><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><b>Note</b>: After you have finished troubleshooting in clean boot, ensure you restart the computer in normal mode.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Srinivasu,</p>
<p>I am having the same exact problem activating Office 365. I have tried these steps and the issue has not been resolved. In my Office 365 page it shows the software registered on the computer, so I am not sure what the issue is. Do you have any additional
 steps I could try?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

 SUCCESS - Office was uninstalled and reinstalled several times by the technician and a scan conducted of my computer. The technician eventually escalated my "concern" (****!!) to a more senior technician who will take 2 days to contact me - I was however told

    <title>Publisher rotating booklet document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nwa print co  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher rotating booklet document</h2>
                    I'm creating a booklet in Publisher 2010. When I go to print, the print preview looks correct and I have my printer (Canon ImageRunner 8500) set to print a booklet in landscape, but once printed, the entire document gets turned 90 degrees with two pages
 per half page. It looks more like a calendar than a book. It flips the second page lengthwise (as is correct because flipping shortside inverts the second page upside down) Changing to portrait makes it only print one half page per letter sized page.
<br />
<br />
I can set it up so that it prints multiple 2 sided pages (which is a different option than booklet) and it prints fine other than the fact it won't saddle stitch it. It will only stitch it in the upper left hand corner which does me no good. When in this mode
 I am in landscape. <br />
<br />
I think this is a printer issue but I don't know if there is a way to fix through Publisher. Any ideas? Can I rotate all documents 90 degrees in Publisher (which is only a guess that
<span style="font-style: italic">MAY </span>work)?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
JJ<br />

            What is the version of the font you downloaded? Since it is only happening in OneNote, you can try to remove the font then reinstall it again and see if the issue persist.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Adding font styles in OneNote only applies to the app itself. This means, the Inziu Iosevka font style will only available on your OneNote app. However, not all font styles will be compatible to use in OneNote which could be the reason why there's a line spacing
 bug issue when using Inziu Iosevka.<br />
<br />
In OneNote Online, it doesn't have all the font styles available in OneNote app, which also means that the Inziu Iosevka is not available online.<br />
<br />
We would appreciate if you could raise this to our OneNote team as a feedback by using our
<strong><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327186-onenote-for-windows-windows-phone/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote Suggestion box</a></strong>. With this, our team could work on with this font style and find a way to
 make it compatible and works fine in OneNote.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<h2>            Navigation Pane not showing on Website</h2>
                    I am using Publisher 2003 to design a webpage.&nbsp; When I am designing the pages, the navigation bar is present and shows the correct links.&nbsp; When I preview the pages as a webpage, the navigation bar does not show.&nbsp; I tried all the tips on the help page but
 they did not work.

<p>Here is a long version of Spike's answer that also addresses the problem with Publisher 2007:</p>
<p>There is a compatibility issue with IE8 and Publisher 2003 and 2007. Any<br />
design elements that are 'grouped' together, which includes the Publisher<br />
wizard built navbars, do not render when you view the web page in IE8 . The<br />
fix in general is to ungroup the elements. There is both a manual fix to<br />
these issues and a Service Patch that has been issued to fix it for Pub<br />
2007.<br />
<br />
Reference: Navigation bars and other content is missing from Publisher HTML<br />
output in Internet Explorer 8: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969705</a><br />
<br />
A manual method of fixing this grouping issue:<br />
<br />
After making and saving any changes to your Pub file, and prior to uploading <br />
new web files, make a copy of your publication by doing a 'File &gt; Save As' <br />
and in this copy go to each page &gt; Edit &gt; Select All &gt; Arrange &gt; Ungroup.<br />
This will ungroup the Publisher built navbar and disconnect it from the <br />
wizard, and the navbars will render correctly in IE8. 'Publish to the Web' <br />
from this copy of your publication. When you want to make further changes in <br />
your web, go back to the original Publisher file, make the corrections <br />
there, save your changes, and again make a copy, ungroup the<br />
navbars and produce new web files for uploading. The advantage of this <br />
workflow is that you will not have to rebuild the navbar if you choose to <br />
add a page to the navbar. If you do not need to add a page or section to <br />
your site, you can leave the navbar ungrouped and skip the step of saving a <br />
copy.<br />
<br />
Publisher 2007 can be fixed manually or with the Office 2007 SP2:<br />
<br />
Reference: Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)<br />
and of Microsoft Office Language Pack 2007 SP2:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=953195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=953195</a><br />
<br />
Some users have found SP2 breaks Publisher, and makes it impossible to open<br />
existing Pub files...you know, break one thing to fix another, so there is a<br />
hotfix for that:<br />
<br />
*Publisher cannot open this file Error 1100009.*<br />
<br />

27, 2009<br />

<h2>            Outlook View Settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>My Outlook veiew settings have changed from this <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ddb2e94-cf45-43c6-b872-00c01df1ca8c" height="707" width="530" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>to this &amp; seemed to have just changed for no reason.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12ff63b5-f383-4500-8c5f-6af8718ab8ef" height="841" width="631" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything to change the view settings back is there anything I'm missing? I hope these pics are clear enough.</p>
<p>The Emails on the left pane have gone smaller and I have tried to adjust with the font settings etc but it still doesn't look right. I've reset the view to default and this also has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>My outlook did the same thing last night. It suddenly changed to this format/view after I was creating a rule. It looks as though the inbox has switched to the Microsoft Outlook 2010 view. The calendar and sidebar have remained in 2013 style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is incredibly frustrating and it seems impossible to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another support engineer had recommended someone else in another thread to just start using Mail on Windows, but that just avoids the problem rather than deal with it head on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Onestop Reporting error &#34;.net programmability support for excel not enabled. please make sure this feature is selected in your office setup.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I was receiving this error when I was attempting to install Onestop Reporting and BI360 on our work machines. We are running Windows 7 and Office 365. With Office 365 we were running Office 2016 locally. The thread that I found the issue was (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/o365-excel-net-programmability-support-not-enabled/e1d0c609-3d39-4650-84d3-240a7a92f79a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/o365-excel-net-programmability-support-not-enabled/e1d0c609-3d39-4650-84d3-240a7a92f79a</a>).
 I was unable to reply on that thread, so I am creating a new thread with my resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2016 needed to be uninstalled, It would not support the .NET. Reset the machine.</p>
<p>Ran CCleaner to clean the files and registry. Reset the machine.</p>
<p>Log onto Office.com. I chose the Office 2013 download, both x86 and x64 worked. Download, do not run.</p>
<p>Right-click and view properties. At the bottom the file shows at blocked. Unblock it and click apply.</p>
<p>Run the installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I didn't have any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one person that did upgrade to Office 2016 from Office 2016 and doesn't have any issues, but it appears that a clean install of 2016 doesn't work. At least in my experience.</p>

            How about posting it here instead of concealing it there? I think I've searched everywhere for a resolution to this but haven't found one yet. Most say install on another computer (not possible) or buy Visio 2016, &nbsp;only weeks after I bought Visio 2013.
 Maybe I can have my earlier investment returned?

            Palcouk, what's the point of sending me that link? All it shows is that there are very many very angry people who have been deprived of their Visio 2013 functionality by Microsoft when installing Office 2016. But there's no evidence there that Microsoft
 is doing anything about it, apart from (very selectively) allowing one or two people to upgrade to Visio 2016 for free. To my mind that's the only fair option if Vision 2013 truly doesn't work with Office 2016. I paid several hundred dollars for Visio 2013
 only a few weeks ago. Now it seems it's worthless. What now, Microsoft?

            Dear Kevin,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You have posted your question in Outlook.com, so I assume you are using it in browser.
<br />
<br />In order to retrieve the emails that were deleted you can try to use Email Recovery App <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380447?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/o...</a> First insert the Microsoft Account from which you want to retrieve emails (These instructions better to perform on PC in browser)
<br />
<br />1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />2. Click the gear icon at the upper right side of the screens then click view full setting.
<br />3. Select Mail &gt; Customize actions, then click Get Add-ins and hit save.
<br />4. In Inbox, click an email (if you don’t have an email, please try to send a test email to your own email account, then once you received the test email, please click on it.)
<br />5. Click the Gift icon (Get Add-ins)
<br />6. Type Email Recovery
<br />7. In the search result, under the Email Recovery, click Add button.
<br />8. Go back to Customize actions page, click Email Recovery and click save.
<br />9. Again, in Inbox, click an email, then the Email Recovery icon will be visible now, and click on it.
<br />10. Recover both Recoverable Items and Purges.
<br />11. Please do not do anything while the recovery is in progress.
<br />12. Once it’s finished, a folder will appear on the left pane which contains the emails that you recovered.
<br />
<br />Please note that there is no guarantee that those emails will be restored as it depends on server status and what happened to the storage space where they were stored.
<br />
<br />I hope these helped to recover your emails you’re looking for.
        </p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp; I just used your step by step info and it was great! But hoping that I did everything correctly I do not see the folder that appears on the left pane which has the emails in it I recover? Perhaps I did it incorrectly? I accidently deleted all my
 inbox emails from the folder not the first section which would obviously be recoverable. I did get two folders not renaming them but I did not write them down. did I need to do that?</p>
<p>Help! Thank you!!!!</p>
