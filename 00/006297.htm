<h2>            Power Point 2016 &#40;Motion background and text box&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get a text box to appear on top of my purchased motion video for a power point I am making. I have inserted a video and arranged it to the back, then inserted a text box and arranged it to the front of my power point. When I play the slide show,
 I am able to make the video move but the text box is not there. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Do you have "Play Full Screen" checked. If so uncheck and stretch the video to fill the slide instead.

<p>========================================<br />
AFAIK...you cannot actually disable&nbsp;the Task Pane&nbsp;but you can <br />
drag it somewhere out of the way and minimize it.</p>
<p>If you place your pointer on the background of the panel and<br />
press your left mouse button you will see a 4 way arrow...then <br />
you can left click drag...and if you place your pointer on the <br />
edges until you see a 2 way arrow you can drag to reduce the <br />
size of the panel. Once resized and moved...it will remain <br />
there when you close and reopen the program.</p>

<p>==========================================<br />
Maybe closing the task pane each session is your best bet if you<br />
do not wish to move it. I hope you find a permanent solution but <br />
I am not aware of one.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a personal user and have been using the above on my laptop for around 2 years. All of sudden when I go into any application eg excel, word etc is saying that the programme isn't activated. When I attempt to enter my activation code I can't complete
 it as it is saying that it isn't valid. It also says I have 20 days to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at previous links in the help and can't find a solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>

                    <p>microsoft, what gives with the stupid account locks for "unusual" activity?</p>
<p>even when I review my history there is nothing "unusual" about my logins other than your IP lookup being terribly wrong about geolocating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello microsoft... devices, devices on dynamic ips in cell networks</p>
<p>this is how the world works now, please stop locking accounts because someone has their phone checking mail on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>today I have locks on both my hotmail accounts and honestly? it looks like you simply did it to force me to look at the app you're offering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>well the heck with your stinking app, I have too many useless apps raiding my contacts, Im not about to add yours to the mix.</p>
<p>quit being prehistoric microsoft, learn to cope with device logins</p>

            <p>What makes you think you need to use an app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right about IPs changing, particularly with a mobile device configured to use convenient WiFi networks. Starbucks will have a different network than McDonalds, which will have a different than Burger King, which will have a different network than
 Costco, and that will be different than your cell carrier's network. Each time you join a different network your IP address changes. In fact, your desktop computer's visible IP address can change from day to day because your router periodically asks your ISP
 for an IP update. My desktop computer some days appears in one city and a week later in another. Both addresses are in the ISP's address space, but from a different central office, depending on the IP address handed out by DHCP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've updated my Outlook.com security information sometimes five times in one day and have never once been made to wait 30 days for the change to take effect. For example, I've added alternate addresses and telephone numbers to the account so I have
 alternate ways to obtain password verification, without needing to wait. I've also changed my password three times within twenty minutes on one occasion. I know it happens to many people, but I've never experienced it and am not sure what triggers it.</p>

<p>Yeah me too. I think I remember seeing a blog which said connect it to your computer, select 'mass memory' rather than pc suite. In windows explorer click one of the tabs (sorry, don't remember which) and it'll have 'show invisible files' or something. It's
 in there somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, I wiped all my music the other day, i went into all songs, mark all, delete. That seemed to get rid of them</p>

<p>Connect to pc using the massmemorymode and delete the musicfiles from the maps this way. If the musicfiles still won't be deleted you could always format your memory. Format does delete everything!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should have format your memorycard once befor using it in your device. Lot's of issues with the 5800, has to do with the memorycard.</p>

<p>Hello Basil65,</p>
<p>Sounds like the computer thinks there's a second display (monitor) connected and it's sending the maximized Word window to that second display.</p>
<p>Check your Display Properties settings.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer &#40;no add ons&#41;</h2>
                    I have windows 7 Home premium 64 bit.&nbsp; A few weeks ago I tried updating to windows 10 but my internet would drop continuously so I did a system restore back to windows 7 and everything works just fine again.&nbsp; However, I noticed today that when I went into
 accessories/system tools there was no longer an option to open IE without any ad ons.&nbsp; This option was always available until I did the revert back to win 7 fron windows 10.&nbsp; Does anyone know how I could get that capability back?&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why you lost that option but there are 2 other ways to reach no add-ons mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start&gt; Run (or Windows logo key + r) type in <strong>iexplore.exe -extoff </strong>
then hit enter.</p>
<p>2. Internet Options&gt; Advanced&gt; uncheck "Enable third-party browser extensions"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen reports that this doesn't always disable all add-ons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If MS Safety Scanner also finds nothing this is probably a "false positive" notifcation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've&nbsp;read similar reports on this forum of "Action Center" alerting to this specific malware yet independant malware scans failed to identify any malware on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hi Bala9773, if you did change the security code, please follow the advice given by Farby.

<h2>            Duplicate Skype accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I installed Skype for Android on my phone and created a username. Then, I bought a new phone and installed Skype using a different cell number. My username isn't visible when I open Skype on my new phone. When I search for my Skype username, two accounts
 appear. Please, can anyone tell me how to consolidate the accounts - or should I just delete one of the accounts? Thanks..... :)</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c5bac08f-a05a-452d-9f11-727004eabae9" title="LeighOlsen">
<p>
</p><p>All Skype accounts were transitioned to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016, although users with legacy accounts
<em>(Skype Name-created accounts) </em>still need to fully update their accounts to enjoy the benefits of a full Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>can anyone tell me how to consolidate the accounts - or should I just delete one of the accounts?
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> It is not possible to merge two Skype accounts. You can only merge an existing Skype account to a new/existing Microsoft account. You can refer to the following links below for additional details.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34652/bringing-skype-and-microsoft-accounts-together?q=%E2%80%A2%09Bringing+Skype+and+Microsoft+accounts+together" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bringing Skype and Microsoft accounts together</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Updating your Skype and Microsoft accounts</a></strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It might be best to close the account that you will not use. Please be reminded that when you close your Skype account,
<strong>its associated Microsoft account will be closed as well </strong>that is why it is very important that you go through the list of things you need to consider before you proceed. You can refer to this link for additional details.
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your account has been marked for closure, there will be a <strong>60-day waiting period
</strong>before the account is completely removed from the database. Should you change your mind regarding the closure, you can cancel it anytime by logging in to the account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have further inquiries. </p>

<br />
<br />Hi Alex
<br />
<br />What you need to do is set the Data FIle for the Gmail account as the default data file for the profile. Default email accounts and data files are mutually exclusive.
<br />
<br />To change the default data file, go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab
<br />
<br />(above is applicable for all Outlook versions '2010 and later)

            You're going to need to create a new Outlook profile and configure the accounts as per the description in
<br />
<br />Set Another Data File as Default When Using an Exchange Account

<br />
<br />The critical items to remember when going through this exercise is to configure the IMAP account first followed by your EX account making sure to configure the EX account as a non-cached account as per the attached screenshots. This MUST be done at the time you configure your accounts.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d344a3c0-1845-4338-9782-b6ec87aecbc3?upload=true" />

<br />To set the default mailbox of Outlook, click the “File” tab and then click the “Options” menu item. Click the “Advanced” tab and locate the "Outlook start and exit" segment. Click the “Browse…” button and select the folder you want to use as your default mailbox. The list that opens up when you click the Browse button will include all folders you currently have access to, including group folders, if you are properly connected to the folder’s network. Click “OK” and your new default folder will be selected.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fdc8373-87a5-45eb-915c-a7a10db9238a?upload=true" />

            <p>Tim, since you started a new thread instead of replying to an existing post, we don't know what disappearing image problem you're referring to (and Hannah isn't likely to know about your post, either). If you can find that post, copy its URL and paste it

            <p>Jay,</p>
<p>The issue is just as your link explains (graphics inserted into&nbsp;the document have disappeared and now there is just an empty box with a red cross where&nbsp;the image&nbsp;should be with the note "the image part with relationship ID rId18 was not found in the file").</p>
<p>But not all of the images, the document is about 50 pages and the first 15 pages show the images and then the images start to disappear spasmodically. It doesn't print the disappeared images on the printer or PDF.</p>
<p>I have gone thorough all the suggestions in your link, checking and unchecking boxes, most images were in line with text anyway but it didn't make any difference when I changed the wrapped text back to in line. I am in Print Layout and single line spacing
 to all paragraphs. It did show the images when I was creating the document and they only disappeared the next day when I open the file. I have also tried opening in WORD 2101 to see it was a WORD 2013 issue but still no images.</p>
<p>The link to the previous thread is below:</p>

<h2>            Google Calendar not showing on Outlook.com</h2>
                    I hope this is the right forum. I've already been called once for asking in the wrong place. When you've come from 7 years of XP this Win8 seems like a different culture and language. I have gotten the Outlook.com ( online not within Win8 ) to mirror my
 Gmail contacts correctly. When I go to the command bar above and click on Calendar I see 3 listed Jack's Calendar ( which I would have expected would show what the Google Calendar does but it doesn't? ) and a Holiday Calendar and one other.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So why is not my Google Calendar with my events not showing on Jacks Calendar or as they should on the Outlook.com calendar.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All help is greatly appreciated. &nbsp;jack</div>

            You don't need a T-Mobile SIM card to remove T-Mobile's SIM restriction.<br />
<br />
Simply insert your own SIM card. The phone will complain that the SIM card is invalid but that doesn't matter for now.<br />
<br />
Enter the restriction code you were given this way:<br />
<br />
#pw+...............+1#<br />
<br />
You get the 'p' by pressing '*' 3 times.<br />
You get the 'w' by pressing '*' 4 times.<br />
'...............' replaces the restriction code you were given.<br />
<br />
The phone will now be unlocked. You might have to switch it off and on again for the SIM to register.<br />
<br />
Do not attempt to enter this key sequence too many times. If the wrong sequence is entered, I think, 3 times in total (either because you mistyped it or because you were given the wrong code in the first place, it does happen) then the phone will be locked
 permanently to T-Mobile and no code will be able to unlock it.

            Try again as follows.<br />
<br />
Enter the 15 digit Network Unlock Code as follows:<br />
<br />
#pw+ followed by the 15-digit unlock code then +1#<br />
<br />
For example: #pw+123456789012345+1#<br />
<br />
The keypad will only allow you to enter numeric digits.<br />
<br />
To enter p, press the * (star) key three times.<br />
<br />
To enter w, press the * (star) key four times.<br />
<br />
To enter +, press the * (star) key two times.<br />
<br />
5. The phone will display ?Phone restriction off?. The handset is now unlocked.

Let me try again.<br />
<br />
Quoted from the post you replied to:<br />
<br />
You get the 'p' by pressing '*' 3 times.<br />
You get the 'w' by pressing '*' 4 times.<br />
<br />
DO NOT PRESS 7 OR 9 AND HOPE TO GET THE LETTERS P OR W.

<h2>            Factory ROM Instead Of Branded Rom</h2>
                    I know I can replace the branded (Sprint, AT&amp;T, Verizon) ROM on my phone with the factory ROM? I want the ROM from Nokia/Microsoft.

            Ha! Fair enough. It seems odd if I own the phone why I can't restore it to the original manufacturer's intended ROM.

            The original manufacturer's intended ROM is the one on your handset out of the box. You are not asking to restore it, you are asking how to change it to a different one, for whatever reason.<br />
