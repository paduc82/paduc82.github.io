<h2>            OneDrive install fails Build 9879</h2>
                    After updating to 9879 the OneDrive install ran but crashed multiple times. Now I can't get it reloaded and configured. How do I rerun the OneDrive installation on 9879?

            <p>Hi Grant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are experiencing issues using OneDrive after installing the new build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What do you exactly mean by OneDrive installation? How exactly are you installing it?</p>
<p>2. Are you referring to the OneDrive folder or OneDrive app crash?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, let's check the Event Viewer and send us the event error.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Event Viewer</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> is an advanced tool that displays detailed information about significant events on your computer. It can be helpful when troubleshooting problems and errors with
 Windows and other programs. </span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If that does not help, </span>I would suggest you to convert the Microsoft account to a Local account and back to Microsoft account and check if you are then able to setup OneDrive:<br />

    <title>Allow or Deny Access sending emails through Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bald eagle bangor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Allow or Deny Access sending emails through Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Using MS Office Pro 2013 and Windows 10. In Access a procedure (used every 6 months) scrolls through contacts to send emails. Last time this&nbsp; worked OK but now Outlook says ‚ÄúA programme is trying to send an email message on your behalf.&nbsp; If this is unexpected,
 click Deny ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>The operator has to click Allow each time.&nbsp; What has caused this change?&nbsp; How can we make sure that our emails will all be sent without interruption? Help points me to the Trust Centre.&nbsp; But the Programmatic Access page options are greyed-out, although it
 appears to be set at 'Warn me about suspicious activity when my antivirus software is inactive or out-of-date' neither of which is the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just spent most of the morning on the phone and on Web Chat with Microsoft with no solution. &nbsp;I have seen other threads here regarding a similar problem with non-Microsoft software. &nbsp;But surely there must be a way within an integrated package like
 Office Professional where you can give permission for emails to be sent without operator intervention for every single email!! &nbsp;And it has worked previously so what has Microsoft done in the last 6 months to cause this problem?</p>

</p><p>To assist you with the issue, have you tried the suggested resolution on this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-get-warnings-about-a-program-accessing-email-address-information-or-sending-email-on-my-behalf-86cc5ece-379e-45e3-b8eb-3fefba09946b?CorrelationId=1f063b11-c36e-4ab6-b802-4abe1a7c0848&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;ocmsassetID=HA010355062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thanks for pointing me to the Microsoft article that addressed this issue. &nbsp;I had already seen that and it has not resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my original post, when I get to the P<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rogrammatic Access page the options are greyed-out, although it appears to be set at 'Warn me about suspicious activity when my antivirus software is
 inactive or out-of-date' neither of which is the case. &nbsp;My antivirus status is showing as Valid. &nbsp;I use Kaspersky Internet Security.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This glitch is handicapping the work of the Charity that I developed the Access database for. &nbsp;Just over 100 emails needed to be sent and the operator had to click 'Allow' for each one!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Something has interfered with the procedure that worked before. &nbsp;And I haven't made any changes that would have caused the problem. &nbsp;So can you please tell me how to allow Access to send emails through
 Outlook without operator intervention?</span></p>

            <p>Just an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled my Internet Security (Kaspersky) and relied on MS Defender for a period to see if there had been a problem caused by a Kaspersky update. &nbsp;But nothing changed so I have reinstalled Kaspersky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled a few Outlook updates that occurred over the last 6 months (since the procedure worked before). &nbsp;But again there has been no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do we go from here? &nbsp;My MS Outlook was installed a few years ago as part of MS Office Professional Plus 2013 which I got through a download. &nbsp;So the only copy of my Outlook software is as part of an .ISO file. &nbsp;I'm not familiar with uninstalling and
 reinstalling my software. &nbsp;If I uninstall MS Outlook an I able to reinstall it from the .ISO file without interfering with the other elements of MS Office? &nbsp;And will my emails still be available in Outlook as at present?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can appreciate I am reluctant to do anything that will cause other problems. &nbsp;But I am baffled as to why this message has suddenly started to appear on both my computer and the one used by the charity that the Database was created for. &nbsp;This implies
 that some Microsoft update has caused the problem. &nbsp;So I need Microsoft to find out what it did which has caused the problem and restore it promptly before we need to use this procedure the next time.</p>

<h2>            wireless phone</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung Galaxy S6edge phone. The phone is locked.&nbsp; The erroneous reason is that t he phone has been lost or stolen and if the culprit returns the phone the 'owner' will then have the phone unlocked. As you have guessed I am the culprit and the owner.&nbsp;
 Can anyone help me unlock the phone.&nbsp; Samsung is no help. </p>

    <title>Desperate&#58; Recurring calendar reminders notifications occur only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zurasm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desperate&#58; Recurring calendar reminders notifications occur only once</h2>
                    I am desperately trying to solve the following problem on my Nokia Lumia 800 (Windows Phone 7.8 ver 7.10.8860.142).&nbsp; I have spent a great deal of time and effort searching the 'net and forums and trying to solve the problem myself, without any success.&nbsp;
 I am very close to the point of moving to a non-Windows phone!<br />
<br />
Here's the problem: I can create recurring calendar reminders, however I am notified of only the first reminder in the series.&nbsp; This renders this calendar functionality useless.&nbsp; Many of my appointments/reminders are recurring on a daily, weekly or monthly
 basis.&nbsp; I relied on this functionality on my old Nokia E71 and it worked extremely well.<br />
<br />
I have checked all calendar settings - they are correct.<br />
I sync'ed it with Windows Live - reminders worked for a day but not after that again.<br />
I rebooted - no difference.<br />
I have tried keeping my data connection on permanently thinking that it could be a sync issue - no luck (this is a Windows Live calendar only).<br />
I have checked on Windows Live and mobile calendar reminders are set on.<br />
<br />
Strangely, if I fiddle with the time on the phone it makes a difference.&nbsp; For example, I had two daily recurring appointments for 7am this morning.&nbsp; I did not get the notifications at 7am.&nbsp; I changed the time on the phone to 6:59am and the reminder notifications
 occurred as they should at 7am. Why did they not go off at 7am the first time?&nbsp; And they won't go off again tomorrow...<br />
<br />
I am desperately in need of help from somebody as I rely heavily on this calendar functionality and have exhausted all my options (I have even tried to find a replacement calendar app!).&nbsp; I would very much appreciate help from Microsoft Support as my patience
 has worn very thin now.<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Zurasm, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand your recurring calendar reminders are only delivering the first reminder but not any additional reminders and I&nbsp;can definitely&nbsp;understand how important having all reminders come through can be
 for managing one's schedule. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see where you've edited some of the entries on the phone, though it isn't clear where the calendar reminders were originally created. Did you first create them on the phone or at
<a href="http://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendar.live.com</a>? If you haven't already done so, can you try creating the reminder again using whichever method you haven't previously tried?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know what you find out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Nate W.H. </p>

Good day Nate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;All my calendar appointments, reminders, etc were created and edited on my phone.&nbsp; As you suggested, I created a recurring reminder on calendar.live.com as a test. In fact, I created two.&nbsp;Surprisingly, both&nbsp;have been
 firing perfectly every day. I&nbsp;then also&nbsp;created one on my phone and it too has been firing&nbsp;which it never did before. Strangely, all my other reminders that were not working&nbsp;now also seem to be working!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am puzzled why this has solved the problem. Do you have any idea why&nbsp;creating a reminder on live.com instead seems to have suddenly solved all my problems? And, can I expect to not have the problem again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am most grateful for your assistance and can finally use the calendar reminders properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
        </p>

<p>I can't really be certain as to what was causing the issue syncing between the Live Calendars page and your phone, though I'm happy to hear that everything is now working as expected!</p>

            <p>Good day Nate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have to report that a day after our last communication my recurring reminders stopped working again. I deleted them and created two using Windows Live calendar and two using my phone. Thwy worked fine for two days and then the reminders stopped.
 Something is definately up with recurring reminders. Again, setting the time to one minute before the reminders are due to fire caused them to fire a minute later. I set the correct time but the reminders have not fired since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am at a loss as to why the calendar functionality is behaving so unreliably.&nbsp; It is a real problem for me as I depend on recurring reminders.</p>

            <p>It doesn't look as if Microsoft has any intention of offering any other options except basic daily/weekly/monthly. This was reported 2 years ago!</p>
<p>I went looking for an app I could use. Most seem to have only the same basic options. I finally found 2Day. It does everything I need and more. I now create my to-do items in 2Day and then it syncs with the standard outlook calendar. Its great. Well worth
 the price. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's default behavour for Excel and it can only be changed by using VB code. I can post some code if you want but IMO it's far simpler to select a different worksheet, insert to the left so it ends up on the right of the sheet you want. You can also insert
 a sheet and right click the sheet tab and select 'Move or Copy..." and move the sheet to the correct place.</p>

    <title>Red X instead of Image in word and excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jÓ±ÒÅ∫ÒáÓ±ÔÖ  say:</h3>
<h2>            Red X instead of Image in word and excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been unable to figure out why these images won't show up on my Macbook Air on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 and Office 2016 version 15.40, but instead display a red X. Both of these documents (One is a Word document &amp; the other is an Excel document) were downloaded
 off my my school website where us students download lecture slides/documents for our courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go and open these files after downloading it, the images that are suppose to be there are not present. I've been able to get around this by opening opening the documents on a desktop computer and then re-saving the file to a newer format, and then
 sending myself the re-saved document. The documents were originally created using word &amp; excel 97-2003.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I preview the documents instead of actually opening them, I can see the image there no problem, but once I open the document, I'll see the red X.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Three of my other friends who are also using a Macbook have no problems with the image not displaying. All three of them are also using Office 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried completely uninstalling Microsoft Office 2016 via their guide and reinstalling, but it still failed to display the images.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be useful, thanks.</p>

<br />
Please check if this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-see-a-red-X-and-not-my-picture-or-clip-0010edc5-21b9-4903-ae40-a14272b4e8c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I see a red X and not my picture or clip</a> helps.&nbsp;<br />

Meanwhile, to better use Office &nbsp;version 15.40 (15.38 or higher), try updating your Mac os to high serria to see if there is any improvment.<br />

            The red X indicates the image was linked rather than saved within the document. However, if you do this, you are supposed to send a Copy of the image with the document.

<p>Hi Sky,</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I also forgot to mention (I've edited it into my main post now) that when I preview the document, it'll display the image, but once I go to open the document, the image is replaced with the red X.</p>

<p>The image is probably a PICT or EPS file. These formats are no longer supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try using File &gt; Save As and saving the file in current Word format (.docx) instead of the old (.doc) file format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once saved as .docx, make a duplicate of the file in finder, and change the .docx file extension to .zip.&nbsp; Use Stuffit Expander to explore the zip file's contents. You should see a media folder that has the pictures. Open them in a graphics program and convert
 them to jpg or png and save them elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open the saved .docx file and right-click on the red X image placeholders and replace them with the correct pictures.</p>

 So I didn't provide this kind of suggestion again. Also, he said the images work on his colleage's Mac. So I didn't think it is a picture format related issue. I will wait for&nbsp;</span><span>JŒ±—Å–∫—áŒ±œÖ's updates.
 Anyway, thanks for your feedback.</span></p>

            It is likely the file opens ok on an Mac that does not have current updates if it contains pictures of PICT or EPS.&nbsp;

<h2>            Video and Audio files not playing consistently in Presenter View</h2>
                    We use PowerPoint (version 16.18) for running our school assemblies and have been having a lot of trouble with embedded video and audio not playing as it should in presenter view, when set to playback either 'in click sequence' or 'automatically'. Sometimes
 the audio/video starts as expected, other times it doesn't, and it seems to be random. We usually have to close and reopen PowerPoint a few times throughout each assembly so we can get the music/video to play. It's been happening all year through different
 versions of PPT and with both High Sierra and now Mojave on MacBook Air laptops. The embedded audio/video files are usually in mp3 and mp4 format. The display is on two large outdoor screens via an AV system, connecting with an HDMI cable (we've tried several
 cables). Please note: It works seamlessly when we test it on the laptop prior to each assembly, and after each assembly, but not when connected through the AV system. And it's completely random... of the 4 audio/video files in

<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for posting in our forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this issue happens randomly, and it doesn't occur with specific Office version or OS version. In this case, could you please connect another external monitor to your Mac? This will help to check whether it is related to the AV system connected method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as a workaround, you may consider using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
QuickTime Player</a> to record screen while playing the slide show.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It will recorder the audio as well. After that, you may play the video directly.</p>

<p>Hi Zixuan,<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for your reply. We have taken the laptop around to several different screens around the school now and tried it - it worked on all of them. So we took it back outside to the original AV system and it worked on that, too. We also swapped out the
 various HDMI cables and it worked with all of them... but I'll bet my bottom dollar it won't work at next Friday's assembly, because it never does :P&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else to try or what else to report... it's just so strange...</p>

</p><p>Dear ufogirl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your follow-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct that it's odd. Since it works in all of your tests, it seems not be related to PowerPoint itself. Given this situation, as we discussed, the better workaround may be using
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
QuickTime Player</a> to record screen while playing the slide show and play the video directly in the assembly.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Zixuan, thanks for the workaround, however due to the fact that only the first 7 slides and the last 5 are the same each week (with different slides in the middle, depending on each class's item) we'd need to record a new video each week, which is just
 not sustainable. I'll keep looking for other solutions, but thank you so much for your time and prompt responses.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<h3> don.w  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge option to sync favorites grayed in build 14931</h2>
                    <p>The option to sync favorites in Edge is turned off and&nbsp;grayed out. Below it is a message in red that says: "Some windows features are only available if you are using a Microsoft account or work account." The thing is, I am signed in with my Microsoft account,
 and have Sync enabled in Windows Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened in build 14931, which I just installed from the iso made available from Microsoft. It was a clean install.&nbsp;During the install process I created a local account. But soon after the install was completed I changed it to a Microsoft account.
 The Sync option became available in Windows settings, but not in Edge settings. I've tried switching back to a local account and back again to a Microsoft account. I also tried creating a second user&nbsp;account&nbsp;with a Microsoft login. That second user didn't
 have Sync available in Edge either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this?</p>

            I'm not sure what troubleshooting steps you are talking about. The problem I have is that the option in Edge to sync favorites is grayed out with the message "Some windows features are only available if you are using a Microsoft account or work account,"
 implying that it doesn't think I am logged in with a Microsoft account.&nbsp;When I look at Settings-&gt;Accounts it says I am logged in with a Microsoft account (neither an Azure or a 365 account.) Also that thread was started a year ago.&nbsp;The issue I'm seeing seems
 to happen with insider build 14931 (and maybe after) and only when installed via a clean install. I have another PC running 14931&nbsp;and&nbsp;Edge sync is&nbsp;working fine, but the version was installed through regular update process.

<h2>            Resource with 0h usage</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>In some of my project, in the resource usage view,&nbsp;I found a lot of resources (about 200) without a task assigned on the project (0h usage) and I want to show only resources (about 10) of the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp;use enterprise team resource, but also if I save local the project&nbsp;I get the same.</p>
<p>I tried&nbsp;search for an option,&nbsp;a visualization&nbsp;filter, but nothing.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answer,&nbsp;Dale!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in several projects we have conventional 0h tasks (e.g. just an approval click, a print&nbsp;or similar) assigned to a resource of the team. So I cannot delete all resource with 0h from the Build Team dialog but&nbsp;I need to filter the tasks to discovery
 resources with really&nbsp;no tasks on the project (that is, by the way,&nbsp;what I'm doing in the meanwhile).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm searching for, if exists, a sort of recalculate function that rearrange the team of the project with only resources that are really engaged in&nbsp;the project.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Calendar time out of sync.  It&#39;s 7 hours ahead of all my mobile devices but they all on same TZ.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Outlook.com calendar time is 7 hours ahead to all my mobile devices.&nbsp; I have Samsung Galaxy W, Sony Neo V, iphone 4s &amp; ipad2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a calendar entry in outlook.com say 12pm noon.&nbsp; It will appear as 5AM on all my mobile devices.&nbsp; 7 hours behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling is related to recent trip to Hong Kong which is 7 hours ahead from UK where I'm based.&nbsp; Now I'm back in UK but all my timing on mobile devices are messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked outlook.com account settings is on London, United Kingdon(GMT) and devices are all in London GMT.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was all working fine before the trip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have change settings in outlook.com to USA Mountain time (7 hours the other way to try compensate) but it did not seems to budge or make any difference on outlook.com.&nbsp; I have a feeling something in broken with my outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have the same issue?</p>
<p>

<p>I don't think you can restore them if they are gone from your web account as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should have reset the 635 and used a different account to set it up from the one you use on the 1320 before giving it away.<br />

<p>Hi GerryTJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no setting for you to change in your tenant. The only setting is in the Outlook client to enable this voting button.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-polls-in-email-messages-and-review-the-results-4d10e079-8ea1-489a-a79c-18cb71ae12dd?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-polls-in-email-messages-and-review-the-results-4d10e079-8ea1-489a-a79c-18cb71ae12dd?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The recipient should see the request by default if they are using Exchange accounts. &nbsp;If your customer enable this function in the Outlook client, can you see the email with the tip to vote? The users under Office 365 tenants may not use Exchange Online/server
 account. You can let them confirm the type of their accounts.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been facing issues with MS word where it stops responding whenever I try to change the Page Orientation AND/OR try to change the margin TOP/BOTTOM of the document, etc. It only responds after waiting for 10~15 minutes++ in order for it to complete
 loading e.g. Page Orientation from Portrait to Landscape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I downloaded the latest Office 2016 Proplus 64 bits from the Office 365 account and updated to latest office version. Previously, I used Office 2013 32 bits, downloaded from Office 365 account and have been facing the same issues as well. I thought downloading
 the new latest version might help to solve the problem but apparently not..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone facing similar issues and able to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>Laptop Model: Dell Inspiron 7447 64 bits</p>

</p><p>I have an user who is trying to login to two networks in same tenant yammer/contosX.com and Yammer/contosY.com which are in same tenant. Now When the user log in with account @contosX.com which is part of both networks. Now when&nbsp;she logging in&nbsp;to Yammer/contosY.com&nbsp;she
 is being re-directed to Yammer/contosX.com. she tried in different browsers but the result is ame she is re-directed to only one X network.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your office 365 tenant has multiple Yammer network, You can browse to Yammer Admin center &gt; Network Migration to see the list of Yammer networks associated with your office 365 tenant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Multiple Yammer networks may get created if the domains that are added in office 365 have a past history of Yammer either a free Yammer network was created using this domains or domains might be connected with other tenant which was using Yammer enterprise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Once you verify this domains in Office 365 the Yammer network associated with that domains gets connected to your office 365 tenant and you have multiple Yammer network scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that having multiple Yammer networks in one office 365 tenant is not recommended by Microsoft, since in Multiple Yammer network scenario, we might get issues like
 users from same tenant redirected to different Yammer networks and not able to see the data / groups on other<span>&nbsp;
</span>Yammer network, user profile, profile pictures not syncing from office 365 to Yammer, users of same tenant getting redirected to different Yammer networks with separate URL.. Also the new feature<span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In order to fix this issue, we will have to perform Network Migration and consolidate multiple Yammer networks into one so all the domains that are verified in your office 365 admin centre gets synchronised to a single Yammer network</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<p>
</p><p>
It is recommended to initiate a Network Migration from Yammer network whose Data is important and need to be preserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>
</p><p>
If you wish to have export data of the Yammer network before migrating, you can login as an admin to respective Yammer networks by creating a test Global Admin account with the domain of<span>&nbsp;
</span>the respective Yammer networks that you wish to migrate and export the data from Yammer network Admin &gt; Export Data. (Note: the exported Data will be available only for reference purpose and cannot be imported back to Yammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Please follow below steps to perform network migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Login into yammer home network with Global admin rights
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on gear icon&gt; Network admin&gt; Network migration
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Step 2 of 3 - Choose a Yammer Network to Migrate</span>&nbsp;page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click next </p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the domain name of the domain to migrate
<span>&gt; Start Migration</span> </p>
