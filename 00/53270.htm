<p><span>If it works on another machine, then backup the data on another machine and format the same. Check later if it works.

<h2>            Suspended&#33; Prepaid a year but MS wants me to buy a month at full price</h2>
                    
<p>So, I maxed out my cards due to an emergency and had to buy a prepaid card to pay for my Gold Subscription.</p>
<p>My account was due on 5/20. they tried the card, it declined (see above).</p>
<p>I purchase and redeem the 12mo prepaid card first thing on the morning of 5/20.</p>
<p>Today I get a message my account is suspended.</p>
<p>I call customer service, they say even though I prepaid a year, I must purchase one additional month first because I redeemed it the day my account was due.</p>
<p>My cards will be maxed for the next few months so I cannot pay the $9.99 (and don't have Visa debit just ATM another story)</p>
<p>The rep talked to his manager and said they cannot refund my prepaid not allow me to use it. So I'm stuck with no way to get what I paid for. WTF is this?</p>
<p>I thought it would be apparent that since the payment declined, the pre-paid card I used on the due date should have covered this month.</p>
<p>I am so pissed, I feel ripped off, on top of that I have all these new games I got during a great sale, with great multiplayer support, but cannot play.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Just wanted to vent, I already spoke to CS, there's nothing that can be done, hopefully I'll be able to play in a few months.</p>

<p><span><span><b>Hi there.
</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>As stated above, you cannot use a pre-paid Gold card subscription to "pay off" an outstanding balance against your account, it can only be done with a valid credit/debit
 card. Once you have some money on the card linked to your account visit www.billing.microsoft.com, sign in and you should then be able to resolve the outstanding balance.

<p>I didn't have auto renewal on (and my profile stated it was off) although the rep told me even though my account said it even though it said OFF, I had to call and verify that (I've seen nothing anywhere that told me that) wth does that mean.
</p>
<p>Was I supposed to call Microsoft and verify all my settings as they appeared on the XBox and online profile? Even though I had no reason to suspect my auto renewal was on?</p>
<p>So with auto renewal off and paying with the prepaid card the day my service expired, I'm in the wrong and have lost the money I paid for the card if I don't straighten out my credit cards? Like I said, it will be months before I recover from the financial
 damage that occurred in May.</p>
<p>Why not tell your customers this, it would have made it easier and I wouldn't have wasted the $60 on a worthless prepaid card.</p>

<p>So basically, even though I had no balance (they want me to pre pay for a month I didn't receive) and if for some reason I can't pay off my credit cards in the next few months, I'm screwed.</p>
<p>Thanks Microsoft for making a product that lies (tells me auto renew is off when it wasn't) and holding my money hostage while making me pay for a service I didn't receive. (My account expired ON 5/20 which is why I renewed it with the card, who knew that
 even though paying on the date it's due it's already considered "in arrears".</p>

<p>I get that. The point was it wasn't supposed to be auto renewed, it was off so I could let the month expire and get the 12 month card. Now, had I not paid the month then later on attempted to pay the month with the card I could see where your coming from
 but that's not the case. It was supposed to expire on 5/20, so on 5/20 I paid with the card expecting it to renew since obviously it wasn't because A)The other card was maxed and B)I expected it to expire because AUTO RENEWAL WAS TURNED OFF.</p>

<p>I can try again I guess, the problem is my service was supposed to expire in May as my Auto Renew was turned off (and it said so on the website and on my XBox that it was off), I knew the amount of money I put on my card for another transaction would cause
 it to go way over the limit, so I bought and redeemed a 12 mo prepaid card so that I could continue accessing XBox Live. Again, my account stated it would expire on 5/20.</p>
<p>They accepted the card and I went on playing, until today. Now I havent played in a couple of days so I don't know how long it's been suspended but it is.</p>
<p>When contacting them, they stated that since their system tried to auto renew anyway (even with the setting to OFF and calling them about it), they MUST recieve payment, even though I thought it was cancelled (which again is why I bought a 12 month card).</p>
<p>I don't know why people assume I had a balance (this was the exact same day my service expired THE EXACT SAME DAY, I OWED MS NOTHING AS I PREPAID UNTIL 5/20 THEREFORE I HAD NO OUTSTANDING BALANCE AND WAS NOT ATTEMPTING TO PAY AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE WITH
 THE PREPAID CARD.</p>
<p>(In caps because that's not getting through)</p>
<p>Now they acknowledge the service was not on auto-renew, but since the system didn't catch it, I'm out of luck.</p>
<p>Now they have my money (from the prepayment of a year of service) but have suspending my account until I pay my credit card off and am able to pay full price for a month of service I neither ordered or received.</p>
<p>No refund for my 1 YEAR of Prepayment (until 5/2012) and I am no longer allowed to play.</p>
<p>They basically took my prepaid card, kept it, and holding it hostage until I prepay for a full month at full price (again, I don't owe this money because it is a PREPAYMENT).</p>
<p>But everyone here seems to accept this, which shocks me, but I guess people are used to be screwed over so much it doesn't matter any more.</p>
<p>Oh well, fun while it lasted, anyone want to buy a 360 with most of the top 10 games of this year (LA Noire, Portal 2, COD, Mortal Kombat, etc) without Gold their worthless after you finish single player.</p>

<p>I think a better idea would be just go to a place like CVS and get a prepaid Visa card and put the money on it you need to get the one month. You have to get the special card that works for online purchases and you need to register it online. The one I used
 was Green Dot and it cost like $6 to put the money on the card but worked just fine after registering it for online purchases. I had to get one when I needed to renew my account after canceling my card cuz the PSN.</p>
<p>After you get it paid you will be able to use your 12 month subscription again.</p>

            <span>Definition of:<strong>x86</strong></span><strong>(1)</strong> x86 generally refers to definition #2 below; however, the term may also be used to differentiate 32-bit hardware and software from their 64-bit counterparts in Windows
 PCs (see <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/54977/x64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">x64</span></a>). See

<strong>(2)</strong> The world's predominant personal computer CPU platform. Used in Windows and Linux PCs, Macs and Chromebooks, the x86 line was developed by Intel and includes the Core, Xeon, Pentium, Atom and earlier 286, 386 and 486 models (hence, the
 "86").<br />
<br />
AMD is also a manufacturer of x86 CPUs with brands such as Athlon, Sempron and Opteron. Although Intel and AMD are the primary sources, x86 chips are made by others, and x86 CPUs are used in embedded systems, not just desktop and laptop computers. See

<strong>x86 Lineage</strong><br />
The x86 architecture, which has been enhanced numerous times, comes from the Intel 8088, the CPU in the first IBM PC in 1981. The 8088 was a slower version of the 8086, which begat the 80186, 286, 386, 486, Pentium and subsequent CPU families. See

            probably a 64 bit operating system and X 64 processor if computer is less than 8 years old.&nbsp; x86 could be processor&nbsp; if very old. Thanks for asking I am learning also. Very old could be 16 bit operating system x86 processor.&nbsp;

<h2>            USB printer suddenly stopped printing &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I am using an Epson POS receipt printer via a USB port and it suddenly stopped printing on my Windows 7 computer. I changed
 the cable to another USB port, cable. Still would not print. I have a second identical unit and I can't print to that one either. It won't even do a test print. I have another make and type of printer that I can print to with no problem using the same port.
 I downloaded and installed the manufacturer's latest software as an .exe file and it installed fine, but cannot get a test page to print. To further troubleshoot, another computer on my network installed the software and shared this printer with me (USB on
 that computer) on the network and I can print to it from my computer. This is totally weird. I've never seen this type of behavior. Any idea what's wrong and what the fix might be? Both receipt printers work from the other computer. When my computer starts
 up, it tries to install windows driver for the printer, which is a normal behavior, so it indicates the USB port is good.</span>

            <p>Stalemate is not a move, but a position that may occur. It basically means that when it is a player's turn that player can make no legal move whatsoever with any piece, but is
<u>not</u> in check. </p>
<p>Unlike checkmate, stalemate&nbsp;is a <strong><u>draw</u></strong>. </p>
<p>Even if one side has an overwhelming piece advantage if its the opponents turn and they can make no legal move, but are not in check then it is a draw despite the piece advantage. This situation often catches out inexperienced players near the end game who
 are rubbing their hand in glee at their piece advantage only to be crest-fallen when they carelessly create a stalemate situation thereby turning a winning situation into a draw..</p>
<p>Chess Titans should follow standard chess rules.</p>

            <blockquote>You say &gt; no leagle move&lt; well if that would be the case woulden't that be a checkmate?</blockquote>
<p><br />
No, in checkmate the king is in check. In stalemate it is <strong><u>not</u></strong> in check - it just does not have any legal move available. You will find some example stalemate postions on Wikipedia here:</p>

<p>Hi Leif,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 can set programs to run automatically during the start-up process of your computer. You can set or remove a program on start-up in
<strong>Task Manager</strong>. Visit this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/00850b6f-b61e-0108-8fe9-49f31d924d3d/change-startup-apps-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to know how to remove start-up
 applications.</p>

                    <p>I found it on a friends computer I was using and it looked suspicious as it was in the local hosts file with the

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DellCommandUpdate.msi</span></strong> - Having recent (severe) problems with my infected laptop I am suspicious when I see something out of the ordinary. Especially since my friend does not know what this is,

    <title>Problems caused by an invisible window of Skype for Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k_kolev1985  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems caused by an invisible window of Skype for Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype 7.36 came out (and it is still so for v7.37), me and a friend of mine have started noticing a strange invisible window pertaining to Skype for Desktop popping up. This window pops up when we press Alt+F4 to close Skype's main window to the system
 tray. I know better not to close such invisible windows and avoid them by pressing Windows+D when such a window appears. My friend is not so knowledgeable however and he closed this particular window with Alt+F4 most of the times that it appeared on his machine,
 thinking that it is OK to do so. And that was his mistake! Because this invisible window apparently pertains to Skype and its closure even though it does not close (terminate) Skype, it makes it behave strangely. And what I mean by "strangely":</p>
<p>1. Pressing ENTER on a contact or a recent conversation only selects it, but it does not open it as it should. Opening a conversation window in such a case must be done by executing the "Send IM" command from the context menu for the contact or recent conversation.</p>
<p>2. When a conversation window is opened with the alternative method described above, the chat history (chat content list) is completely empty.</p>
<p>3. Sending and receiving IMs seams to be working, but the messages do not appear in the chat history (chat content list) in the concrete conversation.</p>
<p>4. When there is an incoming call, even if the user answers it, Skype continues to ring. The user has to restart Skype to stop it from ringing.</p>
<p>5. Closing Skype works only from its icon in the system tray. Trying to do it from the "Exit Skype" command available in the context menu for the taskbar button for the window of Skype fails, although it does not throw any errors - Skype just does not shut
 down.</p>
<p>And maybe other problems as well, for which I'm not aware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few notices:</p>
<p>1. Me and my friend are visually impaired and use assistive technology (screen readers) to work with our computers. I'm using NVDA and he's using JAWS. That is how we've noticed those invisible windows - they are invisible, but focusable.</p>
<p>2. We both use Skype in mode with separate windows, so the conversation and other Skype windows appear in separate windows from Skype's main window.</p>
<p>3. In both cases the accessibility mode in Skype's options (in the last category - "Accessibility") is enabled.</p>
<p>4. We're both running Skype 7.37.0.103 at the moment of reproducing the problem.</p>
<p>5. The problem did not occur in Skype 7.35 and earlier, according to my friend (I haven't tested that).</p>
<p>6. I'm using Windows 10 Pro version 1703 (build 15063.413), 64-bit, in Bulgarian with all locale settings set to "Bulgarian". He's using Windows 7 32-bit, also with all locale settings set to "Bulgarian".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else reproduce this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more assistance or information from me about the issue, fill free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much in advance!</p>

            If you receive an odd pop-up that is tied to odd graphics and missing data, the issue may be related to paged memory resources that are not restored due to a driver issue. &nbsp;This issue tends to be triggered more often using the latest versions of Skype.
 &nbsp;Make sure your video drivers are up to date as these tend to be the primary cause, especially with Intel Video as this graphics is present on many computers. &nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt that it is the graphics card's fault. My graphics card drivers are up-to-date. Both me and my friend are on desktop machines and are using NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our screen readers have a command to tell us which is the application to which is the currently focused window. When the focus lands on that invisible window, the command tells us that that invisible window belongs to Skype.exe. That invisible window is
 empty (has no text at all), according to the screen readers.</p>

<h2>            Dedicated, virtual and shared video memory</h2>
                    <p>I have a little bit confusion about video memory types</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M with Intel Core i7-6700HQ (Intel HD Graphics 530)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifications of my laptop suggest that I have 2 GB of memory on graphics chip. In task manager it says that I have 2 GB of dedicated GPU memory. This is clear for me.</p>
<p>In task manager it also says that I have 8 GB of shared GPU memory. I'm not really sure what that means, but I would guess it's the extra memory that my laptop can use in case it runs out of those 2 GB, probably taken from RAM and shared between Nvidia and
 Intel chips. In task manager it says that for Intel HD Graphics 530 chip I only have those 8 GB of shared memory. No dedicated though.</p>
<p>So far it's clear to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check if I can run the game in System Requirements Lab's website it always shows that I have 4 GB of dedicated video memory</p>
<p>It also shows the same in Piriform Speccy (software that shows system stats of my device), more specifically it says Physical Memory 2047 MB, Virtual Memory 2048 MB. Another similar software CPU-Z only lists 2 GB of video memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some games in graphics settings it shows how much video memory I have and how much of that will be used if I change graphics settings. Depending on game it might say that I have 2 or 4 GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am usually monitoring performance in Task Manager while playing games. Some games, like Dirt Rally uses 100% of Nvidia chip plus between 40 and 50 % of Intel, while other games, like Middle Earth: Shadow Of Mordor only uses Nvidia</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone explain all this confusing memory listings? What is the difference between all those three and how much video memory do I actually have? Do I have 2, 4, 10 or 12 GB? And how can I use all of it so I can run games in higher quality?</p>
<p>

<p>This is completely different subject. I am quite familiar about system requirements of games and how the amount of it would affect gameplay. The question was about all the different video memory my system shows I have and how to use it all. Because, as I
 said, some software tells me I have 2 GB, other tells me I have 4 GB. If I count all this together, including shared video memory, it makes it 12 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Examples about Dirt Rally and Shadow Of Mordor wasn't about CPU usage, but Intel Graphics usage, which is shown separate from CPU in Task Manager. I have CPU, GPU0 (Intel HD Graphics 530) and GPU1 (Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, thank you for trying, but your answer is completely off topic</p>

<p>System requirement labs shows 4 gig of ram for my gtx 960 ssc card but only&nbsp; 3 gig vram available; this cuts the available games that are listed as minimum and recommended,</p>
<p>but think this could just be a push on their part for sales.</p>
<p>Just installed speccy version v 1.32.732 and it detected the full 4 gig of vram on the card,&nbsp;</p>
<p>granted I have a dedicated card and not the m version.</p>
<p>Windows 10 build 16299.192 task manager also shows the 4 gig on the gpu.</p>
<p>On an amd 3350m with 6620g, 512mb dedicated vram but it can go to 3 gig of vram; the system only has 8 gig of physical, but have been able to play just cause 2 on it.</p>
<p>The shared physical ram is when the gpu uses physical ram for the gpu, being you have&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 with the nvidia and intel, some is going to the intel as it is on the cpu, so cuts the shared system to the nvidia.</p>
<p>The 2gig dedicated&nbsp; &nbsp;to the nvidia is vram that is set aside for that gpu, not the shared system,&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your post, there is 16 gig of physical ram in the pc ? as windows will take half the physical ram for the gpu if not needed by the system.</p>
<p>I have 32 gig on this pc and windows 10 has 16 gig of physical ram in reserve for the gpu.</p>
<p>The only other issue could be the one that plagued the gtx 970 with 512 mb being of a lower rate.</p>

<p>I trust GPU-Z . </p>
<p>
</p><p>Dedicated GPUs have dedicated VRAM and dynamically allocated in system&nbsp; RAM when dedicated VRAM is not enough . Transfers are done via PCI-E interface . iGPUs have only dynamically allocated sys RAM . I have heard Intel is gonna roll out a chip with dedicated
 VRAM along with Radeon iGPU</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is :</p>
<p>GTX 960M 2GB dedicated VRAM + 2GB shared/dynamically allocated&nbsp; in sys RAM</p>

</p><p>thanks for the feedback. My console is not enrolled in the XBOX Insider but if you think it will be a great and the program can help in solving the problem, I can register<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)"><span>.

<p>Hi Panninho,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that the issue is still persisting. Now, I've thoroughly read every detail you provided on what you've been able to try. Since you've done all the available steps to troubleshoot and&nbsp; since it seems to be only Lego Worlds that you're having
 issues, I recommend reporting the bug/issue to the developer of the game. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's&nbsp; a helpful article on <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000194427-LEGO-Worlds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>f you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the

<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to contact your PC manufacturer.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>mpengine.dll</b> is a mpengine belonging to Microsoft Malware Protection from Microsoft Corporation Non-system processes like mpengine.dll originate from software
 you installed on your system. Since most applications store data in your system's registry, it is likely that your registry has suffered fragmentation and accumulated invalid entries which can affect your PC's performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with
 your existing antivirus software.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the
 Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>I assume you have installed the Logitech LGS510 x64&nbsp; software successfully but the wheel is not</p>
<p>recognised correctly.</p>
<p>The following&nbsp; also assumes the G25 also works on Win10, as does the G27.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - Glad you posted this. The profiling software worked with Win10 early on, but I've been dual booting
</p>
<p>with Win7 since something broke the LGS510 profiler and caused it to identify my G27 as a GT Driving Force wheel.</p>
<p>I had thought it was the 1607 update, but it looks like the real problem was an Logitech updater
</p>
<p>- Logitech Download Assistant - that came down via Windows Update (which I disabled in Task Manager &gt; Startup before it updated my other LGS mouse and keyboard software, but apparently it still managed to cause a problem with LGS510).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;While verifying the download page for the LSG510 x64 installer should you need it, I stumbled on the Steam forum page below. The video linked in the post shows how to fix this problem.</p>
<br />
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/310560/discussions/0/357286663687079488/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WARNING!! Very important to Logitech wheel users. Dodgy Logitech Update coming through Windows Update :: DiRT Rally General Chat</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/dual-action-gamepad/downloads#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dual Action™ Gamepad - Logitech Support</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the person who made the video went via Control Panel. I found his method did not work</p>
<p>for me (it didn't find any new device), so I went to Device Manager &gt; Universal Serial Bus Devices</p>
<p>( click on View &gt; Show hidden devices ) and located the G27 there (Windows does still pick it up properly).</p>
<p>- The other deviation from the video is I had no 'Change settings' tab in Device Manager so went straight
</p>
<p>to the Driver tab.</p>
<p>- Once I found the USB driver shown in the video (In <em>Human Interface Devices</em>) the wheel was recognised
</p>
<p>again in the LGS 510 profiler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly when I re-opened Device Manager just now the wheel still shows, but Device Manager</p>
<p>says it's not connected (Previously the G27 was listed twice with one supposedly active and the other not). Fortunately everything still works in the profiling software, and the G27 is also showing in
</p>
<p>Control Panel &gt; Devices and Printers, and is listed twice in Properties, as in the video (the Change Settings</p>
<p>option is there as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you are having a problem installing the software this trick can also be useful for installing the main</p>
<p>driver. You may have to first extract the files from the installer to a location of your choice though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Off to&nbsp; try a few games just to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

<p>Oh, no! It's all starting to come back. The nightmares... Yes, I remember now....<br />
This fix does not stick if you unplug the wheel. But even that is random. Some times, sooner, some times<br />
later, the fix gets undone and has to be redone. <br />
</p>
<p>Good news is going via the control panel on the next effort does work, and is a bit quicker.</p>
<p>Bad news, some, older mostly, driving games still only recognise the wheel on Win7.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I think there may be a registry key that needs deleting to prevent this not asked for Logitech Download Assistant malware from interfering with the LGS software.</p>

    <title>Using Skype Translator for Cell Texting &#38; Video Calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariavictoriaandrade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Skype Translator for Cell Texting &#38; Video Calls</h2>
                    <p>I am from New York and communicating to someone in France.&nbsp; We enjoyed 3-4 days of texting and video calls (using our IOS / iphone&nbsp;devices)&nbsp;with real time language translations.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden everything stopped working.&nbsp; Was that a 3 day trial and
 now we have to pay a subscription in order to continue?&nbsp; If so, how much is the subscription per month and are there charges per call&nbsp;&amp; text on top of the subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone give a specific link to read all about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
