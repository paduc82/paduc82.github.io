<p>2 problems.</p>
<p>first</p>
<p>onedrive is free and better and easier.</p>
<p>i'm paying for onedrive for business slows down my computer to a crawl. i've tried repairing, stop synching. it has 1tb great but only 20,000 item limit. it's always syncing or processing changes.</p>
<p>does onedrive have any limit besides the 100g?</p>
<p>under task manager</p>
<p>onedrive uses .5% cpu, 729mb memory,</p>
<p>onedrive for business uses 42.7 cpu, 102 memory.</p>
<p>under hidden icons onedrive how many mb or gb left and how many files</p>
<p>onedrive for business only shows how many files.</p>
<p>how can i get onedrive for business working as easy as onedrive and not slow down my computer</p>

<p>the second&nbsp;issue is my icons are different.</p>
<p>one the task bar onedrive has a blue cloud inside an open folder and onedrive for business is only a blue cloud</p>
<p>but in file explorer it's the opposite.</p>
<p>blue cloud is onedrive and blue cloud inside folder is onedrive for business.</p>
<p>how do i sync up icons?</p>

<p>and how do i respond to someone that asks me a question? i can't respond to their email and can't respond in this community forum?</p>

<p>thank you,</p>
<p>dc</p>

<p>If I'm not wrong, this forum focus on OD4B not OneDrive, you should go to OneDrive forum to ask more questions.
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=threads&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=all&amp;tm=1445569793101">

<p>There are a lot &nbsp;of cache creates when syncing using OD4B. Have seen a lot of posts, no solution. They will appear again after clearing them.</p>
<p>I think the icon image is by design.</p>
<p>Can't you reply post in forum? it is weird. Show screenshots to let them help you.</p>

<p>The issue is OD4B doesn‚Äôt allow me to use my computer properly. </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ OD4B uses 42.7 CPU, 102 Memory. (half of my CPU)</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Computer slows down to a crawl. </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ This is a new computer, a few weeks old 12G Ram, i5 and the computer works great without OD4B working.</p>
<p>OneDrive works great, Faster and easier. OneDrive uses .5% CPU, 729MB Memory. It uploaded 10 huge picture folders in less than 2 days.
</p>
<p>OD4B has been trying to upload only one of those folders since yesterday. It‚Äôs slow, stops, has errors, all things I didn‚Äôt have with OneDrive. When it‚Äôs not uploading folders it‚Äôs ‚Äúprocessing folders‚Äù</p>
<p>I want OD4B to be as easy OneDrive. What can I do to make OD4B work?</p>

<p>Hi Dave,<br />
<br />
As Green mentioned, high CPU utilization is usually caused by the OneDrive for Business cache. We can use the ‚ÄúFix it‚Äù tool in the article below to remove the cache:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to remove the OneDrive for Business cache by using the "Fix it" tool</a><br />
<br />
For the OneDrive for Business sync issue, I suggest you troubleshoot according to this article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-problems-e12c6a8b-4bbe-4391-9c23-1a52b55a1967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix OneDrive for Business sync problems</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we‚Äôd like to collect the log files for further investigation.<br />
I have sent you a private message for the details, you can access vie the link below:<br />

<p>Iris,</p>
<p>I used the fix it tool.</p>
<p>It seemed to sync most of my files. Files that had previously synced on the my old OD4B had trouble syncing for some reason but I went thru and saved new copies and deleted the troubled version.</p>
<p>Currently, OD4B has been syncing 1 file since &nbsp;yesterday.</p>
<p>When I open the OD4B folder on my computer I have mostly Green checks but a few Red X's and Blue Circle on the folders. When I dive down deep on the folders with the Red X and Blue circle, it opens the files within those Red and Blue circle but the files
 don't have any Green, Red, or Blue marks so don't know which files are good or bad. But there are 4 different folders with Red X's. And OD4B only shows 1 file still synching. So something is still out of whack.</p>
<p>My regular OneDrive folders stayed the same and didn't get deleted. I have to use it as well because with I have over 20,000 files, so saved some pictures in it until it was full.
</p>
<p>I still have 8,000 pictures that are not in the cloud. Does OD4B plan to expand the 20,000 files so I can save all of my files?</p>

<p>you don't have to force all files to od4b. Do you know that you can create additional document libraries on your personal site and sync down the files to your machine. This is a better way in managing files rather than stuffing everything to on library.</p>

<p>Please tell me more.</p>
<p>I'm not a business, so all of my files are personal.</p>
<p>What do you mean create additional document libraries on my personal site? What personal site? On OneDrive? I have the 15G maxed out already.</p>
<p>Or do you mean create more libraries on OD4B?</p>
<p>I have 8 main folders under OD4B-documents, letters, music 1 and music 2 (because all of my songs wouldn't fit into one folder), Outlook, Pictures, Shared with Everyone, and Videos. And each of those folders has sub folders under them, example, I break the
 pictures into categories 2015-Jan, 2015 Feb., but by doing this I maxed out the 20,000 limit.</p>
<p>I'm not too techy, so please provide more details of what you mean and how to do it.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>hi dave,</p>
<p>firstly, i would like to explain that, we can only sync up to 20,000 items total across all synchronized libraries. this includes onedrive for business libraries, team site libraries, or both. this includes folders and files. see:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738</a> . since all your files are maxed out the 20,000 limit, you cannot sync any more files. we‚Äôd appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>for your situation, if the purpose of your syncing is to store those files into office 365 cloud, i‚Äôd like to suggest you use another way- open with explorer command to bulk upload them. refer to this article to do this:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-copy-or-move-library-files-by-using-open-with-explorer-c27bc6f3-7b38-4c29-b947-5d00c7153384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
video: copy or move library files by using open with explorer </a></p>
<p>note: we need to use <b>internet explorer </b>browser to use this command.</p>
<p>what marcelo means is we can create more libraries in our personal site. firstly, please understand
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-onedrive-for-business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the difference between personal onedrive and onedrive for business.</a> the former works with microsoft live account, the latter works with office 365 work or school account. every office 365 user who has sharepoint online license has his own personal site.
 the onedrive for business library is the default library in our personal site. we can create more libraries by clicking
<b>gear</b> icon-&gt;<b>add an app</b>-&gt;<b>document library</b> to create a new library.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=614046ad-5978-46e7-998d-50fc4759f9a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d614046ad-5978-46e7-998d-50fc4759f9a0" /></a></p>
<p>for the issue you encountered, it is likely caused by the sync limit. so, could you use another way as i mentioned above to upload files to cloud?</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
iris</p>

<div>I can not change the order how the columns are displayed in my Inbox, Sent Items, etc.</div>
<div>For example - in the Inbox, I like the "Flag" to be the first column on the left. In the sent folder, I like the "To" to be the first column on the left.</div>
<div>With the older version of Outlook, I could simply drag and drop the columns BUT this version does not allow me to do that!</div>
<div>It gives me the little hand, but it doesn't move the column!!!</div>

Hi,</p>
<p>The Favorites Bar is simply a folder in Favorites. Open the Favorites Center (star on the right side of the IE toolbar) open (expand) Favorites Bar and right-click&gt; Delete the unwanted Favorites.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />

    <title>Activation of excel 2016 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activation of excel 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I paid for online and downloaded Office for Mac. I am in Argentina. When opening Excel 2016 a message pops up that requests calling a 0800 number in Argentina and inputing a long chain of numbers shown on the pop up window in order to receive an activation
 code. I did this twice but the activation ID is not being recognized over the phone and therefore I am not being given the activation code which needs to be input in the pop up window in order to activate and use Excel.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your advice</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Try method 1 in this article and try again.
<br />
<br />I really hope it helps.

            Sorry i sent you the wrong one, that was for Windows.
<br />
<br />For MAC:
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keychain first.

<br />
<br />If the issue persist try this.
<br />
<br />1. Check to make sure your internet is working on the Mac you're trying to install on. You can do this by opening your internet browser and going to www.microsoft.com. If the page loads, your internet connection is working.
<br />2. Reinstall Office 2016 for Mac and activate it again. 
<br />

<h2>            Current Canary is 17036</h2>
                    <p>Today's hatchling should be 17039, counting one per business day from Monday, and tomorrow's would be 17040.&nbsp; So if you're guessing for next week try 17040 on Wednesday (the vetting process takes four days, according to the team).&nbsp; But that all depends on
 17040 becoming a candidate (passing the vetting and determined suitable for flighting to the next ring).&nbsp; The fly in the ointment for next week is that Monday is a legal holiday in the US.&nbsp; That may push the flight to Thursday but no one really knows until
 the team comments (if they do).</p>

            &nbsp;Well I hope they fix the problem with AMD CPUs in whatever the next build will be.&nbsp; I just finished 4 upgrades from 17025 to 17035 with no problems, but that PC with the AMD processor of mine is making sounds about having been discriminated against.&nbsp;
 I hope it doesn't get upset and sending out bad CRC bytes in protest.&nbsp; :)

            As you just became an Insider yesterday, take some time with testing. Many of us have been here since the beginning, October 2014, testing at least 50 or more of these Insider builds. As we are a peer to peer group of volunteers here and not Microsoft,
 you should post your feedback as Cbarnhorst has suggested in the Feedback Hub one subject at a time where Microsoft can see and evaluate your feedback.&nbsp;

 to force multiple lines, spaces after paragraphs, and Calibri as the default for everyone, regardless of the needs of a particular work environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been suggested to make a different Global template and then show users how to get to it. The same people who cannot figure out how to change multiple line spacing are not going to understand Global templates and how to get and use them. This is not
 a solution for everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I ask again, for myself and for all the other people searching for a solution. How can we apply a Normal.dotm template that has had some parameters changed to all new users the first time they log in?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can I create poll on Skype&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I create poll on Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently work for a small organization and we would like to use Skype during a small meeting. Some people will not be able to attend the meeting, so we were thinking about using Skype for them. I know we can do a group call with Skype which is ok for
 us, but we need a way for people to vote on some subject. I read <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/take-a-poll-in-a-skype-for-business-meeting-6eb1fb85-18a6-422c-ae48-55519841f296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> that Skype for Business allow poll, but do you know if the normal skype has this option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, do you know a good way to share some polls to our people with results hidden to other people but us?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Nic
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor Specialist on Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I am  sorry to say, this feature is only available in Skype for Business, Skype for Business Online and Skype for Business Basic.
<br />
<br />If you have Microsoft forms you can create a form with what you want feedback on, and share it with participants for them to vote. Would this help?
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

</p><p>Actually, it is possible with the use of the new version of Skype for Desktop. You may download it through this link:

<p>
</p><p>If you are using Skype for Mac, the same steps would apply, the difference is that you may allot a schedule on when will the poll will end or expire.

<p>

</p><p>Thank you for the prompt response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also available on the Skype for Windows 10 application. It will only be a different method as it should be available immediately on your message bar. With this said, no worries as if they are either using the Skype for Desktop, Skype for Windows 10

<h2>            SOLVED - End of rope...perfect tasks, calendar, and notes sync...but not Contacts, error code 0x8503001C</h2>
                    Have scoured the Internet forums for the last several days, trying different solutions, and am coming up empty.&nbsp; Still cannot get my CONTACTS to sync.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here's the set up:<br />
New Toshiba laptop running Windows 7 64-bit, Outlook 2007, WMDC 6.1<br />
Verizon XV6800 smartphone running WM 6.1, connected to Toshiba via USB cable<br />
Sync set to cover contacts, calendar, tasks and notes (not e-mail).<br />
<br />
Sync quickly fails and throws error code 0x8503001C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sync does not update anything.<br />
<br />
Here's what I've tried thus far:<br />
-Deleting and restoring partnerships multiple times<br />
-Removing PC from activesync setup on the device multiple times<br />
-Uninstalling and reinstalling WMDC multiple times<br />
-Manually removing residual WMDC files using steps at http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/PocketPC/microsoft.public.pocketpc.activesync/2007-09/msg00101.html<br />
-Rolling back WMDC to 6.0 using files at http://rs46.rapidshare.com/files/15929947/wmdc_6.0_32bit_and_64_bit_edition.zip.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this automatically reinstalls version 6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My understanding is that you cannot use that 32-bit version of 6.0 still
 on the MS site.<br />
-Unchecking "enable advanced network functionality" on the USB connection settings on the phone<br />
-Running scanpst.exe (twice, errors found first time and repaired)<br />
-Running Office Diagnostics (no errors)<br />
-Manual scrub of contacts (twice), accomplished by export/import to external file, once using notepad to edit and eliminate any non-standard characters and again using Excel to edit and eliminate and non-standard data in fields<br />
<br />
<br />
My setup sync'd perfectly up to yesterday when my pst data was in C: My Documents\Outlook.
<br />
I today moved the Outlook data file to a new location in F: \Outlook.&nbsp; This was the start of the problems with contacts synchronization.
<br />
The various steps above leave the same result...everything syncs but the contacts<br />
<br />
Again...<br />
No problem with PC and VX6800 finding each other.&nbsp; <br />
No problem with sync of calendar and tasks.&nbsp; <br />
Sync works beautifully if I remove contacts from sync scope and just do calendar and tasks and notes.<br />
<br />
Calendar, tasks and contacts all contain notes. <br />
<br />
Did not try hard reset on XV6800 because last time I did that I was stuck on another phone with Verizon for more than 30 minutes trying to restore my service.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not a simple matter of dialing *228xx as some have reported.<br />
<br />
I am at the end of my rope.&nbsp; What else can I try?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
<br />

            Linley,<br />
<br />
Thanks for help.&nbsp; Here is how I solved the problem.<br />
<br />
I just started seeing errors this morning in Outlook trying to send messages to anyone in my contacts folder.&nbsp; Outlook said the contacts folder could not be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a new development.<br />
<br />
I tried to reestablish the contacts folder as an address book.&nbsp; This didn't solve the contacts folder could not be found problem.&nbsp; I ran scanpst.exe once more (didn't help), and repaired Office Professional 2007 (didn't help).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Finally I decided to restore my entire outlook.pst file from a backup copy of known good configuration.&nbsp; Noted the date that I would be restoring back to, archived all Outlook items from then to now, then deleted my primary outlook.pst file.&nbsp; Copied my backup
 outlook.pst back in its place, and restored all the archived items.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The sync worked beautifully.<br />
<br />
What I'll never know is how the outlook.pst file became corrupted in the first place.&nbsp; I also never know why none of the inbox or Office repair tools detected the problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for trying to help.<br />

<h2>            WIndows 10 and Kaspersky Internet Security 2018</h2>
                    <p>Shortly after converting to Windows 10, I noticed that Full Scan with Kaspersky Internet Security 2018 was stopping at 82%.&nbsp; It is stopping at the old Microsoft Windows 8 version files old.windows\software.... I am working with Kaspersky Support to resolve.
 I have been waiting on a response for two weeks.&nbsp; My questions</p>
<p>1. Does windows 10, windows defender interfere with virus software like Kaspersky?</p>
<p>2. Is anyone aware if there is a compatibility issues with windows 10 and Kaspersky Internet security 2018? Note: I used WIndows 8 and Kaspersky virus software for previous 5 years with no problems. This problem appeared with the upgrade to windows 10 and
 Kaspersky 2018.</p>

<p>Yes Patrick, I believe that both Andre and I fully understood the full scan to be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the May 2018 upgrade date, I suggest removing the old Windows backup completely using the Disk Cleanup, Clean up system files method I described above, followed by attempting to run the full scan after that to test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have issues with full scan completing after the removal of the upgrade backup, then trying Andre's suggestion to reinstall Kaspersky also makes sense, since this is the program that's misbehaving.</p>

            Have a look at the spacebar on your keyboard when you're typing. What language is listed there?&nbsp; A swipe right/left on the space bar will switch languages.&nbsp; If you've switched to a language where the pack hasn't properly installed you'll lose predictive
 text.

<h2>            Edge is really getting on my &#33;&#64;&#35;&#64;&#36;&#37;&#64; nerves&#33;</h2>
                    I've posted this before and got one quick reply from an engineer, it helped nothing. I replied to report about the problem but no longer get a reply on that post, so I'm making a new one for people having trouble like me.<br />
My MS Edge is not working, and so is everything depending on it (the sign-in feature). I took a look at event log and saw error reports like this:<br />

I tried everything I know and suggested to me (SFC, DISM, window reset,...) but nothing helped, window reset won't even work, it say it couldn't access boot device.&nbsp;<br />
I really hope to get a real fix this time.&nbsp;

            <p>Other thing I could think of to try c:\chkdsk at the admin cmd prompt. Without any switches should tell you if the file system is ok. If it runs and reports errors then run chkdsk /R which should fix any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't run chkdsk then your only option may be re-install the OS. If reset doesn't work then format and start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would use something like magicjellybean to recover the key you are using first though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest Safemode but I've found Edge doesn't run at all in Safemode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you could try running msconfig and disable all services other than MS.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business Permission Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have a situation where I have shared 2 folders within my OneDrive for Business with another internal user and given her Edit permissions. She is able to sync the folder and it's contents down and she sees changes that other users make to the files, however
 she is unable to sync her changes up.</p>
<p>I am an administrator on the sharepoint site so I can make any permission changes necessary. Please advise what change I will need to make to correct her&nbsp;permission level.</p>
<p>The folder structure is below. I have given her and another person EDIT permission to Folder 1 and Folder 2. But as stated above she can only sync changes down, her changes do not sync up.</p>
<p>Shared with Everyone</p>
<p>Group Folder</p>
<p>Folder 1</p>
<p>Folder 2</p>

<p>hi amy,</p>
<p>may i confirm some more information to get a better understanding of the situation?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;have you shared the folder to several users and only the specific user encounters the issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;what symptoms does she see when trying to sync the folder? is there any error message? if so, could you provide screenshots for our reference (please also check if there is an option
<strong>view sync problems‚Ä¶</strong> in the menu of onedrive for business)?<br />
3.&nbsp;can she sync her own onedrive for business with no issue?</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, you can click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then click the icon of
<strong>insert media</strong>.<br />

<p>1. yes</p>
<p>2. changes that she makes to the files do not sync. there is an error message offering several reasons why this might be the case. i have attached a screenshot. you'll see more folders in there now. those are just me trying to troubleshoot. there are only
 2 of them that she actually needs. marketing and receivables. those represent folder 1 and folder 2 in my orginal description. they reside under harboradmin which is at the root of my onedrive for business.</p>
<p>3. yes she can sync to her own onedrive for business. the problem only exists to the folders that i have shared with her.</p>

<p>hi amy,</p>
<p>considering ‚Äúshe is able to sync the folder and it's contents down and she sees changes that other users make to the files, however she is unable to sync her changes up‚Äù,&nbsp; can you check if her office upload center is paused upload as blow and capture a screenshot
 about it?</p>
<p>1. click the <strong>upload center</strong> in the task bar and select <strong>
open upload center</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=91eaa4f6-bce9-4b90-8ef3-9b2b1105d404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d91eaa4f6-bce9-4b90-8ef3-9b2b1105d404" /></a><br />
2. check if there is any files are pending upload or paused upload.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0b45660b-79c6-4d95-9d85-306f64fac7a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0b45660b-79c6-4d95-9d85-306f64fac7a6" /></a></p>

 .</p>
<p>if not, can you share with us a screenshot about the user‚Äôs permission for the files. to check the permission on the document, please refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>1. open the onedrive for business library and select the file you shared with her.&nbsp;
<br />
2. click <strong>share</strong> and select <strong>share with</strong> in the left menu.<br />
3. ÔΩÉlick <strong>advanced</strong>.<br />
4. click<strong> check permissions</strong> in the <strong>permission</strong> ribbon.<br />
5. enter her account into the <strong>user/group</strong> box and click <strong>check now</strong>.</p>
<p>in addition, to clarify the scenario, i‚Äôd like to know if the issue occurs on all files you shared with her.</p>

 will send these once i'm able to access her computer again. meanwhile, i am certain that i looked at this and sync was not paused. i still believe this to be a permissions problem in onedrive somewhere.</p>

<p>Hi Amy,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>To troubleshot the user‚Äôs permission for the files, can you help check if she can edit the files online instead of uploading the changes with the OneDrive for Business sync client after syncing the files to local machine?</p>
<p>If there is any update after checking her Office Upload Center, please post back at your convenience and we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>hi amy,</p>
<p>as you mentioned ‚Äúshe can open the file online but her changes aren‚Äôt saved‚Äù, i‚Äôd like to know if she can see edit in word online when she opens the problematic file in word online by right clicking the ellipses next to the file &gt; open in word online.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2e8a080f-34b9-42c2-8fc9-e9228b38926f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2e8a080f-34b9-42c2-8fc9-e9228b38926f" /></a></p>
<p>if the <strong>edit in word online</strong> can‚Äôt be seen, we need to check the permission ‚Äúcontribute‚Äù given to her if it includes edit items (we can save changed with default contribute permission). to do this, navigate to your onedrive for business with
 your account &gt; the gear icon &gt; site settings &gt; site permission &gt; permission levels &gt; click contribute &gt; check if edit item is ticked.</p>
<p>another test would be giving edit/full control permission to her account and try if she can sync changed file with this permission.</p>
<p>if the <strong>edit in word online</strong> can be seen and she can make changes to the file but the changes can‚Äôt be saved, it may be another issue. please let us know if this is the situation.</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t copy and paste from or into the OneNote app on my Windows 10 phone&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have recently upgraded my Lumia 1520 windows 10 phone. I also have windows 10 on my PC. After the upgrade I have lost the ability to copy and paste on both devices in the OneNote app.
</p>
<p>After looking up online for a bit I saw there might be an issue with the Office account. As I haven't got a full license for Office it seems to cause the OneNote app to go in View Only mode and I can't use the full features of the app.</p>
<p>Now my question is, am I going to have to buy the office license to able to use the OneNote again properly or is there something else that can be done about it?</p>
<p>I thought the app and it's full features are free since you can't buy in the app store, has anyone else had this issue and managed to get a fix to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

                    <p>I use Office for Mac (Insider Fast build) on a late 2016 Macbook Pro 15 inch touch bar, with High Sierra installed, and Outlook, Excel, Word all forces the switch to the discrete graphics card instead of the integrated graphics, seems to me outlook or word
 doesn't have enough power with a Intel HD Graphics 530 GPU.</p>
<p>This results in very poor battery life when using office programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do about it?!</p>
<p>I now use the gfxCardstatus tool to force the integrated graphics to be active, but I rather would implement a fix from Microsoft.</p>
<p />

<p>You need to run Microsoft Office&nbsp;<span>16.16 (180702), which is the 'Office Insider Fast' build. &nbsp;Alternatively, just wait for the main build to get updated. &nbsp;Hope this helps!</span><br />

            <p>You will need either video editing software, video recording software that allows you to convert the video files. There is also hardware that comes with software that will allow you to convert formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Youtube (a.f.a.i.k.) has a conversion tool that is automatic, as long as the original file format is a compatible one, but the rendered resolution suffers due to the compression used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have F.R.A.P.S and recored at lossless 1080p 60Hz. However, I do the recording/reformatting on a separate machine from the one I use for gaming, watching movies, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are programs like Adobe Premier, that allow you to edit, and reformat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I formerlly used windows moviemaker, when I first started out, because it was free. It workd quite well with smaller file sizes. But with larger file sizes, it's best to go with paid for software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also for your system, when editing videos, it really chews up a lot of resources, so make sure you have at least a medium to high end machine (quad core (64-bit) with at least 16GB ram). The more ram and stronger the cpu the better. I currently have 32GB
 of ram on my system, and I still seriously need to upgrade....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this will be of much help, but hopefull a little.&nbsp;</p>

 and WORD worked ok for a few days but now its requiring activation again.&nbsp; I used to support and defend Microsoft, now I feel used.

<p>Hello Sandy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I want to know if your mailbox is an Office 365 for Business account or other type of mailbox? As this issue may be related sender or recipient, you may need to involve him to this thread so that I can help you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assume that you are using Office 365 for Business account. Based on the description, it seems that only one person cannot send emails to you, even though this email is shown in his sent items. For this sender, would you mind let me know if he is an
 internal account or it is other type of the mailbox(like Gmail or others)? For this email, does it include some large attachments? You can let him try to send a test email to see if there is any difference.
</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950 microphone</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am the owner of Lumia 950. When recording movies there is a big problem with the microphone. You can hear a very large amount of recorded murmurs, clicks, rubbing the fingers on the phone. And now the question is-if I can find in the software of
 the phone filters to these murmurs mute?. Best regards. I am using a translator-sorry for any bad spelling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone wanted to and could help-I would be very grateful. My email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Best regards</p>

<p>Let's start checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update and security &gt; Phone update &gt; Check for updates.</strong><br />

            In order to check the hardware, I downloaded from the store Windows, an application-Pause Video Camera. I recorded video-sounds very clear and with no murmurs, glitches and clean. The picture in the movie also. So, however, the wine software for the camera.
 I hope that Microsoft quickly correct this error. I cordially greet and thank you for your time.
