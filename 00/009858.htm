            The USB cable that comes with the phone can only be used as a data cable. To charge the phone you have to use the charging port on the phone.

<p>That is correct, the 5800 cannot be charged by USB.&nbsp; It can only be charged through it's charger port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If USB charging is required you need one of the following products or a 3rd party alternative:</p>

            Why do people automatically assume that a phone with a USB port can be charged through that port in the first place? Especially if the charger connects to a charging port (2mm socket on recent Nokia phones) and not to the USB port...

<p>Because probably most user of such a phone will spend a lot of time in front a computer and having a usb port not capable of charging is, besides a sign of total disrespect to it's users, also incredibly STUPID. The 2 mm socket chargers creates nothing but
 trouble. It's hard to use, it breakes very easy and it doesn't offer any advantage to a usb charger. A normal charger should be offered maybe as an option. Oh and yeah, another thing: it's cheaper to create a usb charger rather then a normal one, and done
 properly will charge the battery with a lot less chance of a fatal&nbsp;surge then a normal one. There is really no point in NOT having USB charging but market ones. Thanks again nokia for **bleep** services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, maybe I'm upset that I don't have USB charging, but plz do share with us noobs the advantage of having a 2mm charger? Just because they are to lazy to put the socket from the usb wire to the charger? A wire that by design&nbsp; is capable of charging a device.
 God forbid we actually make use of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll tell you why, because of people like you who have no interest in actually doing a thing good all the way and are content to live in mediocrity and indifference and then have the guts to criticize someone who made an excelent point that for some strange
 reason it bother you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And before you start telling me I'm rude and so one, give me a good reason why it shouldn't be able to charge via USB, then you can call me all kind of name and whatever you want.</p>

            If you're careless with your 2mm chargers then that's your problem. For my part, I have yet to break one. I'm not saying that won't ever happen, I
<i>am</i> saying that the things are much less frail in normal use than you seem to be making out.<br />
<br />
As for why most current phones with USB connectivity cannot accept charge through their own USB ports, it's because of the extra electronics and software required to detect whether the phone is connected to its dedicated charger or to a computer's USB port.
 If the former, it will draw more power than if the latter.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I've had phones with USB connectivity, several brands, since 2006. The only phone I've had that did have this feature was a Motorola RAZR V3. It is comparatively new, which is why it's not generalized yet. It is, however, becoming more popular with more
 and more present and future models from Nokia incorporating it.

<p>"If you're careless with your 2mm chargers then that's your problem"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legaly yes, it's my fault, moraly no, it's not ONLY my problem. I have been extremly careful with my charger and even so now it's seriously bent. It still fits the socket but I'm afraid to use it so I don't damage the phone so I bough another one. The charger
 is ridicously fragile. Unprotecded in some box&nbsp;it will bend in any tight lugage on any bumpy road, so no, I'm not hapy with it. And I can say I have seen a lot of bend nokia chargers, a looot. Just because it didn't happened to you it doesn't mean it's ok.
 You either had very good luck or you're a very, very careful person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"As for why most current phones with USB connectivity cannot accept charge through their own USB ports"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets see Apple, HTC, PALM, Samsung, Sony, Motorola and probably the list can continue, all theur new models have usb charging. Right, and I'm crazy thinking that only nokia doesn't use this. Even my sony which I got for free from the store has usb charging!!!!!
 And gues what, I have no need for usb since it's memory is 4MB but I still charge it that way, because it's more confortable, quiker, it's near me all time as I'm always at the pc, and so on. I admint that for most of them you have to pay extra, but that I
 understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need to run now. I had a lot more to say on this, maybe tomorow</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 5800 shows the charger as plugged in then just shows "not charging" - does anyone know why, my N73 charged OK from the USB port of the PC, but this one doesn't seem to want to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Facebook unaccessible in every browser but Project Spartan - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Facebook unaccessible in every browser but Project Spartan</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the Windows 10 Insider Preview and I have been using it for almost a week now. Since my first use, till right now, I can only access Facebook through Project Spartan. Neither Google Chrome nor Firefox can access Facebook. I don't know why
 this could happen to both browsers so I don't know which exact possible solutions to try out.</p>
<p>Also, when I connect to YouTube from Project Spartan I cannot disable Safety Mode, although I am logged in to my account and&nbsp;I also cannot change the language, which, to me, seems like a cookies problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as one could realize, I am in a situation where I have to have both Project Spartan and Chrome open for Facebook and YouTube respectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could resolver my two problems, or at least the developers could see my problem and try to fix it in the final version, that would be good.</p>

            Hi Darry, yes this problem with BT Call Protect has been reported before . . .
<br />
<br />Set up Skype Caller ID, then once Caller ID is activated, your calls should no longer be blocked!
<br />
<br />Here is how to do that:

<h2>            Auto Selection of Pivot table items</h2>
                    <p>I have a pivot table that is linked to a large data sheet.&nbsp; Using a drop down box to filter my weeks (not typical date format) I want to be able to select the latest 13, 26,&nbsp;or 52 week time frames without having to go through the filter and check/uncheck
 each box.&nbsp; Is there a way to set this up?&nbsp; I would also like it to change which dates are selected whenever I update my data in the pivot table so that the latest weeks are always selected.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to set rules to move emails to my computer for Outlook 2011</h2>
                    Hi Team <br />
<br />
I'm currently running Mac OS 10.7.2 and MS Office 2011version 14.1.3 with the latest service pack for Mac.Hopefully my question has not been posted as i went through the forums and blogs about this.<br />
My company is a big organization with over a 1000 Mac users using&nbsp; Outlook 2011 mail client on the exchange 2010 server, and basically the company has initiated an email retention policy to run within 30days.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Basically now i want to create a rule for the users from Outlook that certain emails that come to the inbox from the exchange server to be
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"moved to certain folders" on my computer".</span></span><br />
<br />
Hope fully the developers were still working on this one.<br />

            Well the option is already in place.
<div>You can create a rule, and for the action, simply select Move To, then select an On My Computer folder as the destination.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure you select Move to and not Copy to.</div>

<p>Hi SupportServiceMgr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your question is that you want to get the version number to verify whether you have the right software for the fix to search issue in Outlook, so why are you going to check it in Word? To view the detailed version number, you can refer to the link below
 (Same steps in Word.):</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, currently, there is only a workaround for the search issue in Outlook, please modify the registry editor via the link below:</p>
<p><strong>Issue#5: "Something went wrong..." or "Search results may be incomplete" error when searching in Outlook [FIXED]</strong></p>

<h2>            Help in changing the default Yammer URL with Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I have a customer who wanted to change the url of his yammer account to his verified domain instead of the .onmicrosoft.com. What happened is that he access his yammer account with out verifying the domain first. So his url appeared like .onmicrosoft and
 there are other network links that are still .onmicrosoft. We verify his domain and we are able to change his yammer email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. We also activate his yammer by going to dashboard&gt;included services&gt;activate yammer account. However the url still
 appears to be using .onmicrosoft. He wanted to get rid of that. Is there a way on how to do it?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Signed&#47;Encrypted message not saved in Sent Items</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problem with Outlook 2016 (Office 2016 Pro Plus) and signed or encrypted messages. When I send them, they are correctly sent, but they are not saved in "Sent Items" folder.
</p>
<p>Of course, I tried check outlook setting for "Save copies of messages in the Sent Items folder" and this is already checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas please?</p>

            2003 doesn't have built-in PDF conversion so you'll need a third-party solution. This could be an add-in, a Web site that does conversion, or some other third party product. If the product can take it from the print output, you can print from PowerPoint
 and choose Handouts under Print What and pick the option for six slides per page (if that is what you mean by "six slide PDF"). Otherwise you can go File &gt; Send To &gt; Microsoft Word and choose options from there; then, you can use whatever product you choose
 to convert the Word document to PDF.<br />

<p>i have set up my office 365 group and added people and that worked fine. when i clicked on files, to go add new files, i get a new tab (edge or chrome same issue) that flashes with a postback the above image over and over again like it is in a loop. it has
 been an hour and still unable to add files. i need a resolution and my gut feel is that this is a glitch on the microsoft side and probably a simple fix. can someone check out this issue?</p>

<p>I think "Keep me signed in" plus going to the group via onedrive solves the issue. Once i create the group and then go directly to the group files via Groups does not work properly for me. I went via onedrive and it was able to set up my files page.

    <title>How to change font color depending on the nature of input - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change font color depending on the nature of input</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if its possible (and if it is, how) to create a formatting rule in which the font color of a cell changes depending on whether the number in the cell is inputted manually or&nbsp;is the result of a formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example:</p>
<p>I would like the cell B17 to be <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>blue</em></span> if I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>manually write</em></span> the number "234", and
<strong>black</strong> if the cell contains a <strong>formula</strong> such as "=(M13/K8)+34", from which the result is the number 234.
</p>
<p>I have tried to create a rule in which the cell must be black if it contains the sign "=", but it hasn't worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the font in b17 to blue then select B17 and then</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conditional formatting</p>
<p>New rule</p>
<p>use a formula to decide which cells to format and enter the formula </p>
<p>
</p><p>=ISFORMULA(B17)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the format button</p>
<p>Font tab</p>
<p>In the colour dropdown select a black font and OK out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the font will be blue but if you enter a formula then the conditional formatting takes precedence and the font becomes black.</p>

                    <p>I would be very grateful for advice on how to insert a footnote separator in Microsoft Word for Mac.&nbsp; I inadvertently removed the separator from all footnotes when trying to remove a stray separator (no number or text, just the separator) from the bottom
 of a document. Microsoft Word Help explains how to remove the separator from footnotes (though not a stray one) but not how to restore it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Select the drop-down list under <strong>Home. </strong></p>
<p>4. Choose <strong>Draw.</strong></p>
<p>5. Choose <strong>Lasso Select </strong>and then select <strong>Start Inking.</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>If you are running Windows 8.1 on your phone, then it sounds like you have corrupted system files. You may need to run this simple tool which is called 'System File Checker' tool. Follow this Microsoft page&nbsp;for instructions on how to run this tool: &nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should help you fix that issue. Good Luck!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi LAKE_67,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The use of a third-party antivirus programs are not recommended with these beta builds of Windows 10. They are deeply rooted and invasive and interfere with the installation and performance of these builds. I would suggest that you use the built-in security
 software, which is Windows Defender, or go back to a stable version of Windows 10, which is version 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also encourage you to submit this issue using the Feedback Hub. You can either vote on an existing submission or submit a new issue. When you submit a feedback item, we gather additional details and information about your issue that will help determine

<strong>Cortana </strong>search, then launch the app.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Feedback </strong>in the left menu, then press <strong>+ Add new feedback</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.</li><li>Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking <strong>Begin
</strong><strong>monitoring </strong>(or <strong>Start </strong><strong>capture</strong>) near the end of the form;
<strong>Stop </strong><strong>monitoring </strong>when you‚Äôre done.</li><li>Once you‚Äôve completed the form and monitoring, click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>C</strong><strong>ontinue using Feedback Hub</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>My feedback</strong> at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).</li><li>Open the item you submitted, then click <strong>Share</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Copy </strong>link, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/&lt;unique link&gt;).</li></ol>

                    <p>I have set the Bing location as my home city. That produces local weather and news in "Interests" along the bottom of the browser screen. Is it possible to set Bing (or maybe IE11) to auto detect the current location to give local content when traveling?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Location, location, location </p>
<p>When you conduct a search, Microsoft collects the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Search term and time and date of your search
</li><li>IP address, browser configuration and approximate location
</li><li>Any unique identifiers contained in the cookies
</li></ul>
<p>When you set your weather location the IP address is detected and the server nearest you is where the weather feed &nbsp;information is located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you‚Äôve allowed a Microsoft service or application that uses Bing services to access your location, the approximate location of your device will be sent to Microsoft along with the search terms, time and date of your search, and a unique identifier generated
 by the Microsoft service or application. </p>
<p>
Mapping features in Microsoft's services and apps also use Bing services, and when you submit information such as an address to be viewed on a map, that service or application passes it to Bing services for processing. The location information sent to Bing
 Services will be used to provide and improve search and mapping results. With your consent, some mobile applications that use Bing Services may collect more precise location information to provide a more relevant experience or provide enhanced features that
 rely on knowing your location.
</p><p>Also, if you connect a Bing Service or app to another service that has ‚ÄúCheck-in‚Äù or ‚ÄúReminder‚Äù features, such as Facebook or Foursquare, when you use these features Microsoft will
 store the approximate location of your device along with your Microsoft account information.

            <p>When you record a macro, and open a dialog, the recorded macro will *not* display the dialog but merely perform the action of the dialog.</p>
<p>For example, if you display the File &gt; Open dialog and open document A while recording a macro, the macro will open document A without displaying a dialog.</p>
<p>To display a dialog in a macro, you must write the Visual Basic code yourself, for example to display the File &gt; Open dialog:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Dialogs(wdDialogFileOpen).Show</p>

<p>Hi Hans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can confirm that you are using an Apple add-ins for Outlook. For us to investigate on this, may we ask the reason why you want to update your add-in? Are you receiving any error messages when trying to use your Outlook?</p>

<p>Yes, I receive some error Messages like this, when starting Outlook :</p>
<p>"Your Outlook-add-in is not working correctly! If you can see this message often,</p>
<p>please update the outlook-icloud add in!"</p>
<p>Since the first time of this message my icloud-calender is not working correct!</p>
<p>Sending from pc to my mobiles is ok, but</p>
<p>receving from my mobiles doesn¬¥t work with Outlook 2010!</p>
<p>This failure was coming up in Sept.2017! In earlier times every calender was ok!</p>
<p>I think the failure was coming up with an auto-update from Windows 8.1 in early Sept.2017.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and best regards</p>
<p>
