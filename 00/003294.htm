<h2>            Stop Code &#34;Driver IRQL not less or equal&#34; after switching to Windows Insider Fast Ring</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I switched to the Windows Insider Fast Ring. My system was updated to build 18298. After that I got this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I restart, shut down or put the computer to sleep, I get a blue screen with the stop code: "Driver IRQL not less or equal". Then the computer automatically restarts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then updated to build 18305, but the same error persists. I went to 18298 again, trying to go even before that, but I was informed that I can't go more than one version back in time. I know I can install the official build and see if that solves the problem,
 but before that, is anything I can make to solve the problem? I am now on the slow ring and patiently expect the next build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Nikola</p>

<p>Your dump files are from build 18298 (early December, 2018). Rather than trying to troubleshoot an older build, you should install the latest build 18348, as the cause of the bugcheck crash may have been resolved in a subsequent build by now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dump indicates that some driver is attempting to use an IRQL that is too high. It does not identify which driver caused this. I used
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windbg-preview/9pgjgd53tn86?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Outlook 2013 Blocked Senders List not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Blocked Senders List not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I am having an unusual problem with Outlook 2013 Pro on my Lenovo W530 laptop, running Windows 7 Pro 64.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it has to do with installation (unlikely) or a bug in the program.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To simplify my description, I will refer to two POP3 email accounts.&nbsp; One is a POP3 "gmail" account, and the other is a POP3 account on a different server I use, hosted by Pair.com.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Both email accounts are set up properly (as far as I know) and send/receive mail reliably.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I get a junk email from someone sending to my gmail account, I can right-click on that email, select "junk" and then click on "Block Sender".&nbsp; That email adress then gets added to my "Blocked Senders List" where I can view it in the listing to confirm
 that this was done.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I get a junk email from someone sending to my other account, I can right-click on that email, select "junk" and then click on "Block Sender".&nbsp; That email adress
<strong>does NOT get added to my "Blocked Senders List</strong>".&nbsp; I need to fix this.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A technician from Microsoft in Bangalore, India, Prashant, spent almost four hours with me tonight trying to sort this out.&nbsp; We used the repair tool on the 'pst' file to make sure it was good.&nbsp; We used the "repair" tool to make sure Outlook 2013 had no errors.&nbsp;
 We re-created my email accounts, created a new PST file, and then imported the email from the old file.&nbsp; Nothing made a difference.&nbsp; Only the emails coming from gmail could be added to the "blocked senders list".&nbsp; Prashant was very thorough, and he expected
 it to work properly when we finished - but we still have the same problem.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(I checked this on my older Sony VAIO TT laptop, that the W530 replaced.&nbsp; The Sony is running Office 2010, under Vista Professional, 32-bit, and everything works fine.&nbsp; I've done this for years with other computers, and never had a problem.)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem could be because of something different between the old laptop and the new W530 Lenovo.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It could be Office 2013 has a "bug" that Office 2012 doesn't.<br />
</p>
<p>Or, it could be because I'm using a 64-bit system, not 32 bit.<br />
</p>
<p>Or, it could be because I'm using Windows 7 Pro instead of Vista Business.<br />
</p>
<p>Or, it could be becasuse I'm using a Lenovo W530 instead of a Sony VAIO TT<br />
</p>
<p>Or, it could be none of the above.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>None of the above sound logical.&nbsp; I gave Prashad my email information so he can try out "my" email account on his own PC at Microsoft.&nbsp; The problem isn't "urgent", and this way he can take his time and figure out what is going wrong.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I thought I'd also ask here, in case someone else has already solved this problem.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp; .....and thank you to Microsoft for having such great tech people available to work on these problems!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be in India again until September, but I wish
 I could thank Prashant personally for all the effort!<br />

            I have already done that.&nbsp; Nothing has changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since yesterday, I've noticed that not only is the "blocked top level domains" filter not working (emails from .ru are still getting through), absolutely nothing is being blocked!&nbsp; My junk mail folder is empty, even though half a dozen incoming emails are obviously
 junk.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Something is seriously wrong here.&nbsp; It's as if Outlook is refusing to use the "junk" settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE<br />
I created a "rule" to move any emails with the word "junk" in the subject to my junk email folder.&nbsp; Using that on the emails already in my inbox worked, so that's a start.&nbsp; I need to wait and see if it will do so for incoming mail, that isn't yet in my inbox.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I think I've tracked it down.<br />
<br />
I have five email accounts, all feeding email to a single data file.&nbsp; Let's say the five email addresses are:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
Outlook wants me to set one of these to be the "default email account" that it will use for sending new emails.&nbsp; In the above example, I selected "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".<br />
<br />
<br />
If I receive junk email from any of my email accounts other than "a", I can right-click, select "block sender", get the message that this email address will be added to my blocked senders list, but nothing happens.&nbsp; Nothing gets added to the list.&nbsp; Or, I can
 right-click and say add to the "safe senders list" and again, I get the message, but nothing gets added to the list.<br />
<br />
Everything works fine though, as long as the incoming email was sent from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", the one I selected as a default.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't heard back yet from my technician friend at Microsoft, but at least I think I understand what is happening.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What I need now, is to be able to reach someone, to pass on the error, so maybe it will get fixed in the future.<br />

            Thanks, Shelton - but I don't see anything helpful there, only additional ways to contact Microsoft.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What would be most helpful is an email address for someone directly involved in Office 2013, so perhaps they can fix this bug.<br />

<br />
This issue has been bothering me for a while now, but yours is the first time I've seen it actually resolved to the default email account vs. the others.&nbsp; Sure enough, I checked the various accounts on several computers (Dell desktop; Sony, Toshiba, and Asus
 laptops) and the problem was consistent on all of them with Outlook 2013:&nbsp; blocked sender list updates only on the default account, not the others.<br />
<br />
Thanks for at least figuring out that aspect of the problem.&nbsp; It's repeatable and not unique to you or a particular platform.&nbsp;
<b>Clearly a bug with Outlook 2013.</b><br />

            Thanks for confirming that it also works for you (and on multiple devices).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Maybe you'll have better luck than I had, in passing this on to the appropriate person who can do something about it.&nbsp; Even the people I've spoken to on the phone at Microsoft Tech Support don't seem to know how to pass it on to the right people to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
As for me, until two days ago, I had six email accounts coming into one server (pair.com).&nbsp; I decided this was too much trouble to deal with (all get junk email every so often, and I got tired of changing the default account so I could block the junk), so I
 created a brand new email account, and changed the settings so email from my other accounts all goes into a single email folder on the server.&nbsp; I now have one email address to use in checking my mail, and this bug is no longer causing me any problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it frustrating to figure something out, but have nobody around to tell about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and thank you for condensing everything into a single sentence:<br />
<br />
<b>"Blocked sender list updates only on the default account, not the others."</b><br />

Can anyone clarify if it is just the adding of the email address to the block sender list OR is it that the block sender list (using manual add or import) only works or is honored for the default account?   



For example,  if I have one pst for 5 pop3 accounts and 3 ost IMAP accounts, will a manually constructed (I know it is pain in the ****) filter junk for all accounts?

            Both.<br />
<br />
Let's say you have two accounts, "A" and "B".<br />
Let's say you set your default email address to "A".<br />
Let's say you then add *** Email address is removed for privacy *** only to the blocked senders list.<br />
<br />
If *** Email address is removed for privacy *** mails something to "A", it will be blocked.<br />
If *** Email address is removed for privacy *** mails something to "B", it will NOT be blocked.<br />
<br />
If you set your default email address to "A", you will see *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as blocked.<br />
Change your default email address to "B", and you will NOT see *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as blocked.<br />
<br />
<br />
The way I think this should work, is you should have a single blocked senders list for all your accounts, which are feeding mail into the same "pst" file, and if "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" is added to the blocked senders list, it should be blocked for all email accounts
 being directed at that single ".pst" file.<br />

            <p>Each account has it's own&nbsp; junk mail settings, including blocked and safe senders list.&nbsp; There is a limited number of addresses that can be blocked or marked safe and you should only block addresses that repeatedly send you mail, not the address of every

<p>
</p><p>#1 - Depends on who your current email service provider is presuming you have an existing email address already - do you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Outlook is an &lt;email client&gt; that syncs with &lt;email accounts&gt; via various protocols (POP3, Imap, ExchangeActiveSync, Exchange etc). It does notsync to "devices" whether other PC's or phones. Each device is similarly configured to use the same email

</p><p>I understand. It must be referring to the edge swipe functionality and not the Microsoft Edge
<em>beta</em>. You can go ahead and try to enable the edge swipe function in&nbsp;<strong>Group Policy Editor</strong>. However, please do take note that Group Policy Editor is only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open&nbsp;the <strong>Start</strong> menu, type <em>gpedit</em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong> to open the <strong>Local Group Policy Editor</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to <em>Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Edge UI</em>.</li><li>On the right pane, double-click/tap on the&nbsp;<strong>Allow edge swipe</strong> policy to edit it.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Enabled</strong> and press <strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;<em>Refer to the screenshot below</em>.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f73a30d7-7ec3-4b10-9956-5c2607316331?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f73a30d7-7ec3-4b10-9956-5c2607316331?upload=true" /></a></li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you also enable/disable the edge swipe function through the <strong>
Registry Editor</strong>. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> menu button, type <em>regedit</em> and press
<strong>Enter</strong> to open <strong>Registry Editor</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EdgeUI</em>.</li><li>On the right side, create a new <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong> and name it
<em>AllowEdgeSwipe</em>.</li><li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the newly created value and set the <strong>
Value data</strong> to <strong>0</strong> (zero), then press <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<br />
DONT take the risk. I am not very familiar with the updating process but I am pretty sure that it wipes out your language.<br />
<br />
DO NOT UPDATE IT IF YOU ARE NOT SURE.<br />
<br />
Wait for a SURE response.

<h2>            New Asus laptop with Windows 7, need Microsoft Office product key</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Asus lap top for gaming and it is under Windows 7. My problem is that I seriously need the program Microsoft office w/ word, excel, etc in it. When I got the computer, I had it but now it won't open. It says to go into control panel to repair for
 it, so I went to control panel and tried repairing it. I got a pop up allowing Microsoft office on my hard drive. Then I got this other pop up that said I needed to enter 25 characters of the product key which I found on the bottom of my laptop label. I typed
 it in like 3 times and it said it was an invalid key. I don't understand what is going on. It worked when I got the lap top a few months ago. I don't know what to do. I wasn't sure if it was just a trial I had or if I have to purchase it. I just thought it
 was already installed in my hard drive and all I had to do was put the product key in which I did, but it didn't retrieve it. Please help. I desperately need the program.</p>

<p><strong>Can't Activate Office With Windows Key:</strong> <br />
Are you using the Windows 7 key that's on your computer/DVD case? That will not work to activate Office - only an Office key will activate Office. Many new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced functionality mode
 unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial period, you'll need to purchase a Microsoft Office license. Or if you're trying to activate a trial version of Office you'll need the correct trial key. If you need to buy a key for Office:<br />

<span>Hi Stormy,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>From the logs you uploaded, there isn’t any information to let us know the issue symptom in your environment for our troubleshooting. For us to move forward, we need to know when the Word 2016 for Mac will crash
 and what you do in Word 2016 for Mac to trigger the issue. So providing a video showing the issue is a good way for us to clarify the issue and test in our environment for troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>As some applications on your Mac may cause the issue, to exclude the scenario, I’d like you to run
</span><span>your Mac in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(85, 26, 139, 1)">Safe Mode</span></a>&nbsp;to see whether the
 issue goes away.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><em><span>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</span></em></strong><em><span>Microsoft provides no assurances
 and/or warranties, implied or otherwise, and is not responsible for the information you receive from the third-party linked sites or any support related to technology.</span></em><span style="color: rgba(151, 151, 151, 1)">​​</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Moreover, I need some more information for investigation.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. When did the issue occur?</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Check if the crash issue happens on a specific file.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks for your effort.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Cliff</span></p>

            I understand this is the start button.....nothing happens as did with 7 when I hover or left click on the start button. When I right click the start button it gives me certain places to go to such as control panel, programs and at the bottom sear, run,shut
 down&nbsp;. When I first downloaded Windows 10 after using Windows 7 this worked. After several updates it does not work any longer. and I still show Office 2010 in program's but cannot use it.

<h2>            9300i Memory Full - Delete some files - Memory Full... &#40;Mail&#47;index&#41;</h2>
                    I had trouble with my 9300i, it started saying "Memory Full" and told me to delete some files. The problem was, I tried to delete files, but the phone couldn't do it, because the memory was full... I couldn't do anything.<br />
<br />
The Control panel's "Memory" said I had 500 Kb of messages, 500 Kb of calendar, and 79 megabytes of "Other file types".<br />
<br />
The File manager did not show me anything other than "My own files" and the folders were empty.<br />
<br />
I couldn't find any help from Nokia sites. A friend adviced me to make a Full backup on a MMC card, transfer it to PC and delete a certain file: Mail/index. That's what I did, then I resetted the phone to factory settings and transferred the Full backup back
 to phone.<br />
<br />
This helped and my phone was once again operational. However, all my messages were gone, and I had to save the email settings from scratch, so beware, if you need to do the same.<br />
<br />
So how can the memory fill 100% if I use the "Delete sent messages after X days" and keep deleting the new ones?! What is this "index", and why is there no clever way to make it smaller...<br />
<br />

            Dear Jaime,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />As I understand your query, you are using OneNote for Windows 10. It is lighter comparing to Office OneNote and there are differences between and defiantly there are some features missing.
<br />

            Hi Jamie, you are probably using the OneNote App version as opposed to the full OneNote application
<br />
<br />Microsoft has dropped support for the Desktop version of OneNote in favor of the App version for Windows 10 and that has been removed form the Office 365 download . . . 
<br />
<br />Check this link for downloading OneNote 2016, it should work with your version of Office 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.onenote.com/download/win32/x86/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.onenote.com/download/win32/x86/en-us</a>
<br />
<br />Please Note, that will seem like it has not installed, give it time, it will install . . .

<h2>            Office 2013 Silent Install - Enable &#34;Use Recommended Settings&#34; on install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd630736.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works great, I setup the config.xml and am able to silently deploy Office 2013 across a bunch of workstations remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one issue I'm running into is on first run, the users are prompted to select if it should be updated automatically or not (See the attached image). None of the users have Admin access on these machines and this Window requires a user with admin privileges
 to select it. This window cannot be bypassed, cancelled or minimized. They basically cannot use Office until they make a choice on this screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9224e349-a6ff-4e63-adad-5028337cdaf9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather not have to log in to each machine as myself and configure this screen individually (there are a lot of computers). Is there any key or property I can add to the config.xml to enable the "Use Recommended Settings" option during install so
 that the users can just open up MS Office and start writing/excelling?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any tips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Realized I am using Office 2010, but I don't think it matters since I followed the guide for silently installing Office 2013 and everything worked fine.</p>

            With my vista machine I use the following firewall rule to allow windows update, this also allows MSE update on this machine.<br />
Process - %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe<br />
Services - Windows Update<br />
Remote ports 80, 443<br />
On my Windows 7 (64) machine I need to add the following second rule to allow MSE updates.<br />
Process - %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe<br />
Service - BITS<br />
Remote Ports 80, 443<br />

            Are you opening Word from a shortcut on the Start menu, Desktop, or Taskbar (or whatever their equivalents are in Windows 8), or are you trying to start it by double-clicking on a Word document? If the latter, then your problem may be just damaged file

    <title>Outlook 2016 Email Printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterinnottinghamshire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Email Printing</h2>
                    Previous Microsoft mail programs have kept emails to Portrait width and that is how I have printed them. &nbsp;Outlook 2016 needs Landscape format to get everything on the page, which is wasteful and awkward. &nbsp;Can I change any setting to get emails to fit Portrait
 format?

<p>Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;I am afraid I haven't worded the question properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently I have always used MS mail programs such as Windows Mail or Live Mail. &nbsp;I have always been able to print all my emails on Portrait A4 without losing any of the text and without having to change printer settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have switched to using Outlook 2016 all the emails are suddenly too wide for Portrait A4 and have to be printed on Landscape A4. &nbsp;This includes emails sent before I used Outlook 2016 so the problem I have is with Outlook 2016. &nbsp;I've changed printer
 settings to Landscape but that is just wasting paper. &nbsp;Do I ditch Outlook 2016 and go back to Live Mail or similar or can Outlook 2016 settings be changed to set the width to Portrait A4?</p>

            <p>There are two types of mail format settings, apart from portrait/landscape, being table style/memo style, on the rare occasions I've needed to print a mail I've not had any of the issues, that you seem to have experienced.</p>
<p>If you have a pdf printer you could see if the results differ for the better</p>
<p>The problem is with your system settings, not OL - I cannot replicate your issue</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;It is not my printer settings. &nbsp;Emails that used to be in portrait format and could be printed in portrait are now in landscape only. &nbsp;Never happened before Outlook 2016.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen that Bing Maps are a little behind in respect of Greece. I'm mostly talking about places, marks, buildings, restaurants, cafeterias etc. Bird's eye (3D maps) are also available only for Athens and not the whole country. Greece isn't supported on
 Bing search&nbsp;engine, too&nbsp;but this is another subject. </p>
<p>So, any plans on making Greece 3D?</p>

<p><span>We’ve already identified the most likely cause of this issue – Windows Defender quite often doesn’t get properly turned off in its registry key when a third-party AV app is installed. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>But Error 0x0070643 is a generic error code, so how can I be sure that this registry issue is really the problem in my case?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>The formal diagnostic procedure for this issue is to run this command at the command prompt (copy, paste, and enter this line at the command prompt):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">reg query "hklm\software\microsoft\windows defender" /v DisableAntispyware</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the return value is 0x0, then Windows defender hasn’t been properly disabled in its registry key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>But I’ve been warned to stay away from the registry; and I have a severe case of Command Line Phobia – isn’t there some other way to see if this is actually my problem?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Of course there is. The informal diagnostic procedure is to simply type “Defender” in the Cortana search bar and then hit the enter key once the “Windows Defender” entry is selected. If you see this screen, then Windows Defender hasn’t been turned
 off in its registry key. It’s still turned on; but the service can’t be started – so Windows Defender is in a state where it can’t install the definition update.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>OK, it looks like that’s my problem; but do I really need to fix it?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>No, you don’t – there haven’t been any serious consequences resulting from this issue. Other updates seem to be processed without any trouble, and the associated Error 577 (on attempting to start the Windows Defender Service in services.msc) is a false
 alarm. There’s really nothing wrong with the Windows Defender Service executable (MsMpEng.exe).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>This stuck update really bothers me; so how can I fix this problem?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Repeating the installation of the third-party AV app after uninstalling it and running its clean-up utility should manage to switch Windows Defender off in its registry key. However, this has been reported to fail repeatedly with Norton products –
 and redoing the installation might be considered too time-consuming in other cases – so we have a shortcut that uses Group Policy to completely turn off Windows Defender. This is done with the Group Policy Editor in the Professional edition of Windows 10,
 and with the</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span><span>Ten Forums </span><strong><span>Turn_Off_Windows_Defender.reg</span></strong><span> file in the Home edition. Everything you need is right here:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We also have a prospective solution that appears to directly update the relevant registry entries in the Windows Defender key when the third-party AV app is disabled; Windows Defender is started; and the third-party app is then turned back on while
 Defender is still turned on. This seems to work because it mimics the state changes that occur in a reinstallation:</span></p>

</p><p><span>So we see that Microsoft has opted for a new feature that could either add chaos to confusion&nbsp;for this definition update issue, or potentially resolve it – but which in either case will probably break our current ideas about the proper operational

    <title>How To Change Pin Position to Top-Left using VBA Code&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;g70115&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Change Pin Position to Top-Left using VBA Code&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a method of using VBA Code to change the Pin Position to Top-Left instead of the default Center-Center??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate what VBA code is required for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a more general method of assigning any possible combination to the Pin Pos assignment with VBA Code???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is deeply appreciated!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>

<p>strange! one year ago I used Visio 2010, and there macrorecorder included, even in Visio 2003 include macrorecorder!</p>
<p>which edition of Visio 2013 you use: Standard or professional ?</p>

<p>Yes</p>
<p>, you can start macro recorder and change pin position in window Size and position. After these steps you get code like this:</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim DiagramServices As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DiagramServices = ActiveDocument.DiagramServicesEnabled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.DiagramServicesEnabled = visServiceVersion140 + visServiceVersion150</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UndoScopeID1 = Application.BeginUndoScope("Size &amp; Position 2-D")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.ActiveWindow.Page.Shapes.ItemFromID(1).CellsSRC(visSectionObject, visRowXFormOut, visXFormPinX).FormulaU = "102.00000306377 mm"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.ActiveWindow.Page.Shapes.ItemFromID(1).CellsSRC(visSectionObject, visRowXFormOut, visXFormPinY).FormulaU = "207.50000623267 mm"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.ActiveWindow.Page.Shapes.ItemFromID(1).CellsSRC(visSectionObject, visRowXFormOut, visXFormLocPinX).FormulaU = "Width*0"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.ActiveWindow.Page.Shapes.ItemFromID(1).CellsSRC(visSectionObject, visRowXFormOut, visXFormLocPinY).FormulaU = "Height*1"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EndUndoScope UndoScopeID1, True</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.DiagramServicesEnabled = DiagramServices</p>
</p><p>You can modify it for re-use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left side have minimal coordinates at cartesian X-axe. it is reason why used formula for LocPinX - "Width*0".</p>
<p>Top&nbsp;side have maximal coordinates at cartesian Y-axe. it is reason why used formula for LocPinY - "Height*1".</p>
<p>
