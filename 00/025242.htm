            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Textbox is the preference of the spreadsheet users since it offers more formatting functionality vs. a cell.&nbsp; Or textboxes are easier to use for the spreadsheet users for formatting vs. making format changes in a cell.&nbsp; They want to use things like bullets
 or indenting, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the userform front, I haven’t educated myself enough to bullet a userform.&nbsp; However, all people will want to do is type in the file for userform, like in Microsoft word.</p>

            <p>When I mentioned that text box controls were ActiveX controls above I was correct but you are using the shape text box, not the ActiveX control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The limitation still applies: they are disabled when sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no alternatives of which I am aware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workbook sharing is also not reliable and is known for causing workbook corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the users be OK without sharing the workbook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, then you will have to come up with something more creative such as formatting a range of cells to act as the bulleted notes entry area.</p>

    <title>Information about a removed game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deniaganovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Information about a removed game</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Recently, one of the most popular games on the WP platform was removed from the store.&nbsp;<br />
The entire community is now wondering what'll happen with the game, since it's still operational and running, but no one can download it anymore, meaning that we loose all new players and also if you loose the game from your in one way or another, you're left
 without.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The game is named Legend of King II, it's a ARPG that's currently hosted by MoreFun from China. This means that their support is very limited mostly due to language barriers, so we're not getting any clear answers from them.&nbsp;<br />
It has recently had quite a lot of technical issues with servers that have had some major network problems, hickups etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the players have purchased quite a lot from micro transactions in the game, some up to several thousands of US dollars.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My questions to you guys are following:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get an answer from Microsoft on why the game was removed from the store?<br />
Can someone answer if the game will be back?&nbsp;<br />
What are the possibilities to get money refunds? We've been paying for a service that's non existent, ergo breaking the terms of service.<br />

DeniAganovic</a>. There is possibility that the game/app developer already remove it on the store. Only they can provide you information&nbsp;if it is still going to be available for on Windows Phone platform. What we can recommend is contacting them directly for
 more info. Let us know if you have other questions.

    <title>Upgrading Office 2003 to 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julie aoh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading Office 2003 to 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the 2003 version of MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook forever.&nbsp; I have purchased 2013 but have not installed it yet.&nbsp; I am worried about losing my data or overwriting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I lose all of my emails in Outlook?&nbsp; I have them divided into lots of folders.&nbsp; When I have looked at the PST files before (and tried to download them when my computer died awhile back) I only got the Inbox emails.&nbsp; All others in other folders did not
 seem to be there.</p>
<p>Since then, I have rebuilt some of the structure of the files and have more emails.&nbsp; What will happen to all of this.&nbsp; What should I do about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about my other MS office documents of all kinds in all parts of office?&nbsp; Will I lose them?&nbsp; Do have to uninstall 2003 in order to get full functionality of 2013?&nbsp; Will the docs etc. remain if I uninstall?&nbsp; What about Outlook?&nbsp; Will I lose all of that
 data completely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me know how to handle this so that I can join in the current technology.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You do not upgrade Office 2003 to Office 2013. Both offices can run side by side, other than Outlook which can cause problems. You cannot uninstall Outlook 2013 so you should uninstall Outlook 2003,
<strong>But</strong> not before you have installed Office 2013. You should not loose anything. I had Office 2003 and installed Office 2013. I did not loose anything and all my emails and contacts were transferred (Copied)&nbsp;from Outlook 2003 to Outlook 2013.&nbsp;
 I could still use both versions of&nbsp;Outlook. I still have&nbsp;Outlook 2003 on my old laptop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just be clear so far as documents etc are concerned they are untouched by installing Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have purchased Office 2013 and have been provided with a 25 character Key Card you can install your office at:
<a href="https://setup.office.com/?ms.officeurl=setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office Setup</a>&nbsp; The most important thing is to make sure that you use a Microsoft Account during the process, that is, an email address and password for a Microsoft Account. Doing this creates an Office Account which you will be able to access at:&nbsp;

 how important it is. Also keep the Key Card safe as that is proof of licence.</p>

            What more do you need to know?&nbsp; So long&nbsp;as you do not use the MSI deployment tool to install Office 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;you should have no problem.&nbsp; I installed Office 2013 over Office 2003 with no problem.&nbsp;

<h2>            Word 2016 - Why does a table skip to the next page when using bullets&#47;numbered lists&#63;</h2>
                    I am using numbered lists in a table.&nbsp; Everytime I do this, the table skips to the next page if the table gets too big leaving a giant empty space on the previous page.&nbsp; If I take the numbered list out, the table returns to the original page.&nbsp; If the table
 gets too big, the next rows go or cross into the next page (depending on if a row is selected to cross-over pages or not in the Table settings). How do I prevent the Table from jumping pages using numbered lists?

            Is "Keep with next" enabled for table rows? In that case, Word will keep the rows together, and move the whole table to the following page if required to enforce "Keep with next" for the rows.

    <title>Missing feature&#58; Grouping items in OneNote. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boregore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing feature&#58; Grouping items in OneNote.</h2>
                    <p>I have been using OneNote for taking notes while training for the C# certification, and
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">it's been a decent experience</span>. There has only been
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1 missing feature from making it</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> a
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">great</span> experience, and that is
<strong>the ability to group items</strong> (text, images, inks, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one who's sometimes frustrated by this missing feature? Especially when I have to rearrange my notes, all this dragging stuff around is decreasing my productivity substantially.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I just have to add some text to a paragraph above another paragraph, it can totally mess up my notes - e.g. I can have small paragraphs&nbsp;floating over long paragraph, with arrows pointing to important details. If I add text to a third paragraph, which
 is located above the other two, then the floating paragraph and the arrows aren't moved down together with the long paragraph, and then I have to drag the arrows and the floating paragraph down manually and make sure it is all aligned again - so frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to learn of any workarounds for this.</p>

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WEEKNUM returns a number but (say) weeknum was returning 2 for week 2 and the cell was formatted as DDD then that 2 would display as Mon. Ensure the formula cell is formatted General.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Show us your WEEKNUM formula including the date it is referencing.</p>

<h3> teester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com Auto Account Setup not working in Outlook 2010 on Vista 32 bit PC</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to set up my Outlook.com account in Outlook 2010 on a PC running Vista Home Premium 32 bit. The procedure worked fine on a netbook running Outlook 2007 under Windows 10. When I use Auto Account setup in Outlook 2010, the process appears
 to complete successfully, with green check marks and an instruction to restart Outlook. I do note that the new account is still not listed under account settings. When I restart Outlook, Outlook is slow to start up, and I eventually get a dialog box with a
 server field that is completely blank. Since I have no idea what to put in this field, I cannot continue and have to press cancel. Outlook finishes starting, but there is no trace of the Outlook.com account. I have tried setting up the account a few times
 now without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem accessing the Outlook. com account in a browser or on the netbook. I have not previously set up the Outlook.com account or any Exchange account on this PC. My Outlook.com account has been migrated, so Outlook Connector will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate suggestions about how to fix this problem. For example, is there any way to configure the account with manual settings?</p>

            Hello VivekanB,<br />
<br />
Thanks for visiting the Answers forum.<br />
<br />
The process that you're describing is&nbsp;a bit incomplete actually. While it is indeed possible to manage contacts online and export them with a .csv, that file cannot be used on the Phone itself.<br />
<br />
The purpose of exporting contacts as a .csv is in case you wish to <strong>import</strong> those contacts to another account or to create a backup of your contacts on the account you just exported the contacts to.<br />
<br />
I imagine that you're trying for the former, so while at <a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://contacts.live.com</a>, sign in to the account that you use on your Phone, and then instead of going to
<strong>export contacts</strong>, go to <strong>import contacts</strong> instead. Select the .csv, and then your contacts are now saved with that account.<br />
<br />
In order for this to update on the Phone, go to <strong>Settings, Email and Accounts,
</strong>and tap and hold your account and choose <strong>Synchronize</strong>.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to convert Word Perfect 11 files to MS Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    I have many Word Perfect 11 files on my old XP desktop and now have a new laptop with Windows 7 and want to convert ALL files to Word.&nbsp; Do I have to do this one file at a time or is there any way to do a batch conversion?

I always send pdf files unless I want the person on the other end to make changes. If I send a Word file, I do so recognizing that what they see may not be exactly what I sent.
<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/sharing/willmyformatchange.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What happens when I send my document to someone else? Will Word mess up my formatting?</a>
<br />
<br />
The last three links do give some bulk conversion utilities, I believe.<br />
<br />
If you are using Word a lot, you need to focus first on learning how styles work in Word - it is very different. In WP styles are a nice feature if you want to use them; in Word they are central to how the program works.<br />
<br />
<p>If you are using Word more than 6 hours a month you owe it to yourself to learn to use Styles in Word. Within two months at that rate of use you will more than have recovered any time you spend learning them. If you use Word more than that the savings are
 much more dramatic. See <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Understanding Styles in Microsoft Word</a>, <a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/styles/stylesms.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Tips for Understanding Styles in Word </a><span>&nbsp;</span>and <a href="http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Yet Another "Use Styles" Verbal Beating!</a></p>
<p>I recently had occasion to edit a 100-page document that was created without using
<a href="http://addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">styles</a>. It was formatted completely with direct formatting. Each page ended with a page break.&nbsp;</p>
<span>Each time it had to be saved, the save took more than 60 seconds, during which time Word was frozen. A similar-sized document formatted using Styles takes less than 3 seconds for me to save. This difference was due entirely to the document being directly
 formatted - a much higher level of complexity. Each paragraph mark in a directly-formatted paragraph carries with it up to fifty different formatting commands. When formatted using Styles, that paragraph mark will carry with it one command - use this style!</span><br />
<br />
BTW, conversion of WP files to Word often inserts a page or section break at the end of every page in multi-page documents.<br />

            I'll second Charles's suggestion that you invest some time in learning Word fundamentals. It iwill help in the long run. Either take an instructor lead course or some online courses. There are lots of free and paid resources online.<br />
<br />
PDF is good, especially for contracts and invoices, but forget about Adobe Reader, there are lots of free and cheap alternatives that load MUCH faster. I've been using PDF-Xchange Viewer for a while&nbsp; now (because of the editing / markup tools), but I've used
 other freeware before that .&nbsp; They all beat Adobe Reader hands down.<br />
<br />
Word is not really setup for batch processing, but there are a lot of things that can be done with macros.&nbsp; However, document format conversion is one of the things I would not want to trust batch processing to do well.
<br />
<br />
Although it sounds counter intuitive, if MS Word is not handling the WP documents gracefully (not a surprise, they never did play well together), try some of the free alternatives to Office as intermediaries to open the WP docs and SAVE AS to Word DOCX format.&nbsp;
 Some of the freeware tools handle the 2 formats better than Word/WP do directly.<br />

<h2>            Got windows 10 working&#33;</h2>
                    Hey guys, it is possible to get WP10 on 512MB of ram, I just downloaded it on Lumia 635 with 512 MB of ram and I haven't had any real issues after an hour of exploring it and the only time I had a problem with lag was when all of the app updates were downloading.
 I think WP10 can work on 512 MB phones but Microsoft just wants us to buy higher end phones ;) I got WP10 using the Windows Insider by the way.&nbsp;

<h2>            Where is the Excel 2011 preferences file located&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>I'm having the same problem with the Standard and Formatting toolbars not displaying everytime I open Excel 2011.&nbsp; So I see deleting the preferences file might clear the problem.&nbsp; Where is that file located.&nbsp; I'm on OS X 10.5.8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA,</p>

            Let's not overlook the basic [but not necessarily <span style="font-style: italic">
obvious</span>] solution :-), but since you don't mention having tried it...<br />
<br />
If you're on OS X 10.5.8 you should be able to simply click the little oblong button at the right end of a document title bar to turn off the "Minimize Toolbar Area" feature of the OS. Once it's turned off it should stay turned off.<br />
<br />
Deleting the .plist file is only helpful [and probably only works] if you're running OS X 10.7.x (Lion) because Apple removed the feature just as abruptly &amp; with the same lack of explanation as when it first appeared. BTW: Leopard was the first version of OS
 X to sport the little button.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Bob J.<br />

<h2>            How do I update passport details when I don&#39;t own the domain or email address any more&#63;</h2>
                    I registered my passport account with an email address on a domain I used to own. &nbsp;I haven't owned the domain for some years, and am consequently unable to do anything with the account such as change the password, add a new email address etc, as all of
 these things require a confirmation via the original email address the account was registered with. &nbsp;I have tried contacting help before now and got no response, but as messenger bugged me this evening about updating my details, and I stumbled on the forums
 from there, I thought it was worth asking.

            I'm not quite sure what you mean about registering the domain in Windows Live? &nbsp;It's my Windows Live ID that is the whole problem here.
<div><br />
<div>My MSN account is a very old one - I've been using it since around 2002! &nbsp;It's in the format of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;I can't remember how I set it up as it was a very long time ago - as far as I recall all it involved was registering with an email address
 and then probably confirming that email address by clicking on a link sent to it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I haven't owned the domain for ages, and there is simply no way that I can gain access to emails sent to that email address. &nbsp;It didn't occur to me at the point that it expired that it would cause problems with this :(</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess I can just try to contact everyone on my contacts list and ask them to add an alternative instead, then delete all of the contacts and as much personal data as I can from the current one, but apart from anything else it seems a shame to be doing
 that with an account I've held for a decade.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community. I will help you with determining the cause of the issue so that we can fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the common reasons is if the Anti-Virus detects the e-mails as spam or threat while, the email that you receive will be converted from HTML format
 to plain text format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed, I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does this happen with specific e-mails or for specific sender’s or with all the e-mails received?<br />
2. Are those e-mails receiving in HTML or Plain text format?<br />
3. What is the Anti-Virus program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this happens with a specific sender, then you may remove this particular contact from the Outlook contact list and restart Outlook. Then ask the
 sender to send the email again and check how it shows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, then provide additional information on the issue so that we can continue further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. This does not happen with all emails. I don't know if they are received in HTML or plain text, how do I find out? I suspect HTML. BTW, the email lo.oks fine on my Hotmail and my iPad. It is only screwed up in Outlook. I am using
 Microsoft Essentials for anti virus, etc. Doesn't Outlook and Hotmail put suspicious emails in your Junk folder?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I removed the contact from my Outlook contacts and restarted Outlook and the email looks the same.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BTW, within the last week, every time I start Outlook I get a pop up that asks me if I want to let Outlook to change my hard drive. This is something new, which is a nuisance and I never know why these things occur<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, it seems that most Antivirus products are not compatible with windows 10, until the third party vendors start to release products suitable for windows 10, it would be advisable to use windows defender, this is only advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I upgraded to windows 10 preview, I completely uninstalled all my security, hence avoiding any compatibility issues, build 10162 iso, then 10166 via update. My pc runs great,&nbsp; ive run all malware tracking, root tracking to ensure my pc is running
 ok. MS have worked quite hard on ensuring windows 10 is not open to threats, although there is always something out there that even high end antivirus products cant detect.</p>

            <p>yeah when I saw the topic I wanted to laugh, then snark, then post something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>people don't even practice 'safe surfing'. &nbsp;web sites do what they can to make content UNAVAILABLE if you don't allow unsafe script settings and trackable cookie settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I avoid those places. &nbsp;why do I *need* them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also doing my web surfing from FREEBSD helps a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"safe surfing" I define as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) disallow scripting BY DEFAULT, only white-list (using plugins like 'NoScript')</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) be careful what you download, it might not be what the file extension says it is</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) block ads - ALL ADS - since they often are used to spread VIRUSES, like in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/14/malvertising_expands_drudge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">THIS ARTICLE</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) block *ALL FLASH*, particularly when found in ads. &nbsp;Your load times will improve DRASTICALLY as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e) 3rd party scripting BLOCK BY DEFAULT - often enough it will be exploting XSS vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>f) don't visit web sites that aren't friendly to "safe surfing". &nbsp;their content is NOT worth the risk!</p>
<p>
</p><p>in any case, if you practice 'safe surfing' you probably won't even *NEED* defender, but if you can manually scan things with a 3rd party app, your system performance should improve. defender HOGS things too much. &nbsp;I turn it off in all previous windows versions.
 &nbsp;Also if you develop software, don't let it scan your output directories. &nbsp;ew.</p>

<p>A new Fasty would likely be on the 9th.&nbsp; Assuming not a lot has been done with canaries during the holiday break.&nbsp; It takes four days to vet a new canary so none hatched this week would be vetted as a candidate in time to flight this week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's hope the next build flighted meets quality standards sufficiently enough to flight the following week to Slow Ring.&nbsp; I have no doubt that the team wants to service Slow Ring ASAP.&nbsp; Its been a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Patch Tuesday is the 8th, I am watching the Release Preview ring to see if RP is finally going to be useful again.&nbsp; This month may not be a good test for that because of the Winter break in Redmond, but MSFT needs to get new patches out to Insiders
 for a pre-release look in hopes of improving on the embarrassing record of updates the past few months.&nbsp; At least, I think the record is embarrassing.&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess about Buildfeed is that MSFT has closed down Buildfeed's sources.</p>

            &nbsp;I'm wondering the same thing.&nbsp; MS said no more builds in 2018 after 18305, but according to my calendar, we're 3 days into 2019 now.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Seriously my guess is sometime around Tue. next week.&nbsp; We'll see "<em>in the fullness of time</em>" as the saying
 goes.

    <title>Word Moves Text Boxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> landolphe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Moves Text Boxes</h2>
                    My 268 page book manuscript has many small text boxes sprinkled throughout the doc. Every time I Save the doc, Close, and re-Open, Word has moved many (not all) of the text boxes either vertically or horizontally. Some will be moved into the Header space
 on the following page, from which they cannot be moved with either mouse or keystrokes, requiring a delete and recreation and reinsertion. Is there any way to tame these floating Text Boxes? Also, Word will arbitrarily change the margins on some, but not all,
 pages in the same Section, of the doc????

            <p>Many users have issues with text boxes "mysteriously" moving around, but Word's actions are predictable and repeatable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key to positioning text boxes is found by selecting a text box, then choosing
<strong>Format&gt;Text Box...&gt;Layout&gt;Advanced</strong> and selecting the <strong>Picture Position</strong> tab. This is a complex dialog, since there are first several position types for Horizontal and Vertical measurements: Alignment, Absolute position and Relative
 position. For most purposes, <strong>Absolute position</strong> is the best choice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, there is the measurement, and finally the object that the text box will be positioned relative to. For this last parameter, very often I find I choose
<strong>Page</strong> for both horizontal and vertical. This keeps a text box at the same position on a page regardless of where the paragraph is to which it is anchored. The exception is when the paragraph moves to a different page, then the text box moves
 with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second most common positioning occurs when the text box content is directly relevant to a particular paragraph. In this case, the text box is usually close to the paragraph. Then you want to change at least the Vertical option to
<strong>Paragraph</strong> instead of Page. When you do this, the text box will closely follow the vertical position of the paragraph on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be worth a few minutes of your time to play with these options to see how they affect the position of text boxes relative to their anchoring paragraphs. Though it is complex, it is also very customizable to exactly the behavior you require.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In almost every circumstance, there is nothing random about text box positioning. The exception is when you anchor a text box to a paragraph, but then also apply text wrapping that is meant to apply to the anchoring paragraph. In this case, the text box
 is changing the formatting of the paragraph to which it is anchored and you can end up with unpredictable and weird results.</p>
