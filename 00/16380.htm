<h2>            Unable to edit site. Team site link is now gone</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having trouble with the "team site" link. As I was trying to solve the problem, I tried adding it to "promoted sites" When I removed it from there, the link is no longer on the page. I've been unable to edit my site for two days. How can I get
 the "team site" link back? Or how can I get in to edit my site from some other route?</p>

<h2>            ISSUE &#34;Can&#39;t open file.&#34;&#58; EXCEL 2016 Android mobile App&#58; ERROR We found a problem with some content in&#34;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I was referred to Microsoft by ONEDRIVE support who said since file was saved by Android 2016 Excel app on mobile phone Microsoft will have to restore file.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PLEASE help restore an EXCEL file that just disappeared. file name: "Expenses - 2018.xlsx". Located in Documents - LUX folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was viewing file on Excel Android mobile app and closed file. Then when attempting to open file again a pop-up error message says: 'We found a problem with some content in 'Expenses - 2018.xlsx' It give YES or NO option. When chose YES another pop-up
 says: Can't open file.</span></p>
<p>I noticed the same issue on another file however I thankfully created a backup file for that file. The Expenses - 2018 file has NO back up created by me annd I pray Microsoft can restore file on their server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I checked ONEDRIVE via laptop and browser log-in and the "Expenses - 2018.xlxs" file is not displaying. It is as if Microsoft deleted file. There is NO files trash to recover.</p>

            Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Aside from the description that you provided, I still need to verify some information so that I can further isolate your concern:<br />
<br />
• Which version of Excel are you using?<br />
• Does the issue occur on a specific file or it also happens on other Excel file that you have?<br />
• Have you made any recent changes on your PC prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you may refer to this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-excel/file-is-corrupt-and-cannot-be-opened-in-excel-2016/3e378431-83c6-474e-a852-eaea3bb802a8/">article</a></strong>
 specifically responded by&nbsp;<strong>Vijay_Verma</strong> and <strong>Rohn007 </strong>
which I found out to be similar to what you are experiencing right now with your Excel file. Kindly check if the link that was provided was able to help you with your concern.<br />
<br />
If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.

<p>Hi, thanks for reply. However I only use Android mobile phone Excel app. So those desktop suggestions are not appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel mobile&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version 1.0.1 (16.0.10730.20043)</p>
<p>Android play store latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue noticed with file name</p>
<p>'Expenses - 2018.xlsx'</p>
<p>I really need Microsoft to restore this file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next noticed Issue with another Excel file. Fortunately I made Backup of 2nd file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Excel files open and close ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files are not accessed on laptop. However I did login to verify&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Expenses - 2018.xlsx'</p>
<p>Is NOT listed when log into Onedrive via browser and sync files on laptop do NOT list&nbsp;'Expenses - 2018.xlsx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft just restore file</p>
<p>'Expenses - 2018.xlsx'</p>
<p>From it's backup server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did nothing different. Just closed file and could NOT open.</p>

Signal is excellent, but it isn't the problem, beacause my LAN works perfectly with my laptop and desktop.<br />
USing internet with E70 browser, the phone connect to the WLAN, it begins to download web page, but during downloading it stops working...sometimes it never begin downloading..sometimes it works for 1 page completely, but when i try to click on a link, it stops.
 I think my WLAN network card in the phone can't stay connected to my router ..why? Sometimes it works..sometimes no...<br />
it may be a software bug..or a phisical problem of my wlan card.<br />
Can you help me? Is there a firmware update for my phone that can solve this problem? It is impossible to work with this phone...<br />
my firmware version is<br />

            I can't help you but for what it is worth I have the same problem with an Apple Airport Extreme although it isn't as bad as you describe it. I just lose the connection once in a while when I am browsing. I suspect this is a bug. You should try the phone
 out at various HotSpots or Internet Café's to see if is limited to your WLAN access point or if the problem is less severe with other access points than your Netgear router.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://P.S." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">P.S.</a> How did you get the firmware version? I had to punch is a special code (*#62209526#) just to get the MAC address to configure my Airport's access restrictions.

btw - to discover the firmware version key in *#0000# and send<br />
<br />
Another wierd issue with another open WLAN AP is that it shows NOKIA logo on screen for a few seconds and than a message for a NEW VOICEMAIL pops up. Offcourse there is no voicemail, but it never connects thru that access point.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Thanks a lot.

 it to work with a static IP. I tried a static on the E70 but no change. The interesting thing is that when I try to connect the E70 to the netgear with a static IP, while the E70 is working it's way towards a failed connection, If I run a constant ping to
 the E70 static address from another system on the network, It starts responding with widely varied response times during the E70's connection attempt.<br />
<br />
When I tried the E70 on a large enterprise network comprised of Cisco AP's, I was able to get a few web pages but then it would disconnect. When watching the signal meter, the signal level keeps jumping all over the place from 50% to 0% even though another
 system right next to me has a normal, stable 80% signal strength.

            Your phone was intended for sale in a part of the world other than where you are. The importer/retailer installed the appropriate language packs for you but didn't tell you that this was the case. If you have a gripe against anyone, it's against the importer/retailer.<br />
<br />
We can't direct you to the Nokia care points for your country because we don't know what your country is. What you can do is go to

<p>I want to know about is there any option to take snapshot or Configuration backup of complete office 365 tenant including all services. So that whatever changes after that point of time, if needed can be cancelled by restoring such configuration file.</p>

<p>Best practice is to register a staging tenant side by side and not carry out any test on a production tenant. Also make full use of first release feature for selective account. Older days change management process had changed in the cloud era</p>

            <p>If I understand your problem, when you open a pivot chart or pivot table ,from your switchboard, it defaults to design view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set the default view, open your pivot chart in design view. In the upper right hand corner of the design tab you will see a button labeled "Property Sheet". Click the button and the object's property sheet will open. In the property sheet the first tab
 should be "Format". Under the "Format" tab in the property sheet you will see "Default View". Using the drop down menu next to the "Default View" label change it to your desired view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few entries down you will also see "Allow PivotTable View" and "Allow PivotChart View". Make sure the appropriate selections are made there as well.

As you know, Publisher is not an advanced image <br />
editor or paint program. But you can create the <br />
Round shape and highlight it in some ways. If you<br />
experiment and use your imagination you might be <br />
pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
Create a round autoshape...<br />
<br />
Right click the autoshape and choose...Format Autoshape...<br />
<br />
Colors and Lines tab / Fill section...<br />
<br />
Open the Color drop window and choose...Fill Effects...<br />
<br />
Try experimenting with the various colors and shading styles.<br />

            I just went to it from my machine and no filter about malicious.
<br />I wonder if it's cause you clicked from outlook so it is an outlook message that is warning you.
<br />Try opening a browser any browser and go to the site by typing it in and see if you still have the message.

<p>Of course it's from within an Office application SarahKong, since the notification displayed includes the Office 365 logo well as the address bar contains safelinks.protection.outlook.com, indicating that this message came from the Outlook Advanced Threat
 protection system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why Judith is trying to notify someone here, since as the link in my own previous post indicates, there's currently no method provided to allow for the submission of a false positive URL within the interface itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as one of the other pages linked from within my second URL poste above indicates, the specific notification screen displayed to Judith is an older version, with a newer format in the process of being rolled out to customers.&nbsp; Though I've seen no
 documentation that this new notification alert contains the ability&nbsp;to submit a false positive, I am unable to confirm this myself, since I don't personally have access to a supported version of Office in order to check.</p>

<p>Yes, I can get there directly via any browser, just wanted to get this false-malicious label off in Office 365. I don't think it will keep folks off the site, but it looked like an issue that, unaddressed, could spread. :)</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Cannot Preview Word Attachments</h2>
                    
<p>Outlook 2010 on a Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>When viewing an email with a Word attachment, the previewer does not work. Error message: "This file can't be previewed because of an error with the following previewer: Microsoft Office Word previewer"</p>
<p>From looking at other forum posts, this has been a "known issue" ALL YEAR LONG.&nbsp; And according to forum posts, there is still no clear answer (contrary to tags on the posts as "answered").</p>
<p>If there is actually an answer, please let me know.</p>

            <p>I found this answer at another site from another user, but it WORKS GREAT.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow the DCOM permission got changed, so it wouldn't allow certain applications access to simple things like Preview mode on Outlook 2010 / 2007, or opening up attachments without it saying file corrupt. I also was having an issue with Pop ups in IE8,
 where javascript messages about security tokens were not authenticated.</p>
<p>The solution is as follows, and then you can turn on your protected mode back on in word, excel, and your "Preview mode" in outlook will start working again.</p>
<p>Go to start, then run. Type dcomcnfg and push o.k. Component Services should come up.</p>
<p>Expand Component Services, click on Computers, then "Right click" on My Computer and go to "properties".</p>
<p>Click on Default Properties tab, and make sure the following is set:</p>
<p>Default Authentication Level: Should say Connect, not "None"</p>
<p>And Default Impersonation Level: SHould say Identify.</p>
<p>When those are set properly, hit o.k and turn on your protected mode back on your Office applications. Everything works as expected :)</p>

<h2>            Inbox outlook emails already deleted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After I've read an email in my inbox, I will hit "delete" and get a message saying that the error was already deleted.</p>

</p><p>If I try to block a sender and then hit the delete button, I get the same message--that it's already been deleted.</p>

</p><p>I have no rules set up, I have two email addresses that are on the same server. It's very disturbing that these emails may already be deleted even though I haven't read them yet. These are emails for my business and I do not want to have my customers think

                    I just started getting an error code when I send/recieve mail. It says "Receivig' reported error (0x80040600) : 'Unknown Error 0x80040600'". When I click to fix it I get "Run Scanpst.exe" - Of course that does not run or fix it - any ideas? I'm on an HP
 laptop using Windows 7&nbsp; and Office 2007 which is upgraded from my old office 2002 - All are ligit.

<h2>            Outlook 216 Message View &#40;from MS Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    Occasionally I will receive an e-mail, the body of which is in the message pane.&nbsp; The left margin of the message is so far to the right of the pane that it is not readable.&nbsp; Some messages have slide bars in order to move the body of the message to the
 left, but many do not have one and the message remains unreadable.&nbsp; I would like to know if there is some way to invoke a wraparound if the message goes off the right boundary of the View Pane, or can there be a way to fix the right margin???

            The person sending the message either set a margin on the message (generally users, especially those with large monitors) or are using tables with hard-coded widths (more likely with ads/bulk mail). 
<br />
<br />If you aren't downloading external content, doing so may help, but only for bulk mail -they use external style sheets while users don't. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you can't change it on your end - the only option is to view mail in plain text, but you can't set it on a per message basis and need to change it in options, then change it back.

<p>I want to make sure I understand your answer.&nbsp; What is it that the user can set??, the left margin or the right margin?&nbsp; If the user controls it then I can ask him or her to adjust it accordingly.&nbsp; It looks to me as though these happen mostly with forwarded
 messages, which, as you say, may come from bulk messengers. My mail is mostly personal, so I don't believe it is a 'Table' problem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you view the e-mail message as a text message??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I appreciate the answer you have given and it looks more and more as though we are stuck with what we have until either a wraparound or the ability to move the left margin to the left becomes a feature.</p>
<p>

            &gt;&gt; What is it that the user can set??, the left margin or the right margin? They can set both margins but should not set either, and if they do, just a small margin.  Information on margins - <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/email/setting-margins-when-composing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/email/setting...</a> - but if the problem is only on forwards, i suspect its not margins. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; It looks to me as though these happen mostly with forwarded messages, 
<br />It's a bigger margin than in the red box in this screenshot? <a href="https://www.screencast.com/t/gUZVWgVgt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.screencast.com/t/gUZVWgVgt</a>  There is a setting in file, options, mail to include and indent. It's not bad on the first forward, but the indents get ridiculous if its forwarded too much. The simple include message is better.  
<br />
<br />It's possible its a CSS issue and the CSS is messed up in the forward.  Ask the sender to forward it as an attachment and see if it opens ok- In the respond tab there is a button labeled more (icon looks like a cell phone on a calendar) - expand it and select forward as attachment.
<br />
<br />To read all mail in plain text, file, options, trust center, trust center settings, Email security - there is an option to read in plain text. It will be a pain to toggle it off and on for one message here and there. 
<br />
<br />A better option, especially if you need to read but not click links, is drag the message or a copy to your junk mail folder. That will display it as plain text. Not easy reading if it's bulk mail with a lot of pictures though. Links are dead in the junk folder - security reasons.

<br />Not really, but it depends on the contents of the message. You can try adjusting the zoom level of the message - make it a little smaller so it displays better but not too small that you can't read it.

            &gt;&gt; I have done that before to my gmail account and been able to read the entire message there. I wonder how they do it?? It's the difference between editing in a browser and editing a mail client. This points to something involving external CSS though.

<br />
<br />That's pretty much the issue. Its not something i'm asked about often and I'm sure Microsoft gets even fewer calls about it. Plus its really hard to repro problems like this - there are a lot of variables that can affect it. If they cant repro, they likely cant fix.

<p>Hmmmm... maybe you could sync your contacts on your phone with your Live account.&nbsp; What if you went to Settings/Email + Accounts and turn on contacts under the sync options?&nbsp; I think that would then take your phone contacts and copy them up to your Live
 account...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
No, that won't work. WP7, and all devices like Android and iOS, keep the contacts in separate databases so if you add 3-4 services, all of your contacts, emails and appointments don't go to every account. Keeps companies happy as corp contacts and the like
 don't get sync'd to employee's personal gmail accounts for example.

<div>His contacts are in a database married to that exchange account. I know of no way to get them out unless there is a third party app in the app store that can extract them to a file.</div>

<h2>            64 bit proofing tool for hindi.</h2>
                    <p>I have MS office home and </p>
<p>I have installed hindi language interface.&nbsp; I reached the following dialogue.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c333096-4343-4c25-9cdb-13916ea4bedd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c333096-4343-4c25-9cdb-13916ea4bedd" /></a></p>
<p>I clicked on the Not installed link.&nbsp; A Microsoft webpage </p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Language-Accessory-Pack-for-Office-2016-82ee1236-0f9a-45ee-9c72-05b026ee809f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IN&amp;ad=IN</p>
<p>opened with instructions for download. I got to this dialogue</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/613da7ab-e13f-4a53-ac8f-038a9ce84afa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/613da7ab-e13f-4a53-ac8f-038a9ce84afa" /></a></p>
<p>I downloaded the 64 bit version. But, when I tried to install it, it said the programme was meant for 32-bit</p>
<p>office.&nbsp; Where do I get a 64 bit version?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I want to use hindi only for proofing, not as a display language.</p>
<p>Is this possible.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

    <title>Printing to a Label Printer from Access 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joleah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing to a Label Printer from Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hoping for some advice...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to make it so that when an employee enters information into an Access FORM, they can press a button and print the data (without having to go to a separate window or report) using a Zebra Label Printer.</p>
<p>I realize that forms are not intended to be used to print, and I am not opposed to creating other documents within my database, but I need it to be an automatic function for the employee who is entering the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any tips on how I can accomplish this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
