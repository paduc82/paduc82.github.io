<h2>            How do I multiply a field value by 50&#37; using Access VBA</h2>
                    <p>This must be easy but I cannot see where I am going wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Select Case Me.DriversAge<br />
&nbsp;Case Is = 17, Is = 18, Is = 19, Is = 20, Is = 21, Is = 22<br />
Me.TotalPoints * 150%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the driver is aged 17 to 23 I need to increase the value in field TotalPoints by 50% i.e. 8 needs to be 12</p>
<p>How do&nbsp;I go about this please? The case part of it works fine the multipling the field value is where it goes wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Bob</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Office 365 due to less hard disk space.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased an Aspire One Cloudbook 11, it comes with 1 year free subscription of office 365 which was one of the reasons I decided to get this netbook. It however, only has 32gb of internal storage which the majority has been taken by the
 OS and Apps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have attempted to install Office 365 but I require more space but after deleting the useless apps and add ware I am still without enough space. I do have an external HDD but it seems you cannot store on a different HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems stupid for the netbook to be sold with this offer when you cant install Office 365 and surely there must be a work around or will I have to consider taking this product back.</p>

            <p>If your PC was originally supplied with Win7 that PC maker would have provided the instructions to create the recovery disks from the hidden recovery partition.</p>
<p>If you create them you the delete any recovery partition,then in Disk Management expand C: to utalise the extra free space (Assuming what was D is adjacent to win C)</p>
<p>And since you have upgraded to win 10, if you run Disk Cleanup, system files section, there will likely be a windows.old folder that you can delete.</p>
<p>You can create a win10 ISO using the MS Media Creation Tool download.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 800 stops recognising Sim</h2>
                    
<p>in the past few days my Lumia 800 has stopped recognising my Orange Sim card. &nbsp;This happens at reandom points through the day and i have to switch it on and off several times to get it to register that the sim is there. &nbsp;As it happens randomly there is no
 garuntee that the phone is working as a phone and making it pointless to actually use it as a phone. &nbsp;Also since the latest update there has been no improvement in my battery life whatsoever&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
What I recommend you do is to contact your network provider and have them send you a new sim card as it sounds like the sim could be faulty. If after getting a new&nbsp;Sim card the problem continues then try resetting your device by going into settings &gt; about
 &gt; More information and then reset device. <br />
<br />
If after this your problem including battery life still exists then visit your local Nokia care point where they can test the device. You can find you nearest care point on the below link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/</a><br />
<br />
Also when you no improvement in your battery life, can you be more specific how long is it lasting? Do you have a lot of background applications? How live tiles do you have running? Do you have email accounts setup? How often are these checking for emails?
 Do you have WiFi and data on at the same time? Do you have WiFi on even if you are not connected to a WiFi connection?<br />
<br />
Please also refer to the following link with tips on improving battery life:<br />

<p>I had the same problem with the same phone. Did a soft reset a couple of times without it getting better. Then I did a hard reset (pressed and held volume down, power and camera-buttons) and placed a small piece of paper behind the sim-card. This was to
 press it extra firmly against it's connectors. This seemed to have helped.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using an original microSIM or a cut down Mini SIM? If the latter I would strongly suggest getting a proper MicroSIM instead. Ask your carrier for a replacement.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>For the last 2 weeks my hotmail account is experiencing bounce back when people try to email it. I use my account daily and have not changed any settings. Receipt of emails is intermittent and I have had reports from colleagues trying to send me emails and
 it failing. After checking the adress is correct I am left with no idea as to why it would not be receiving emails?</p>

            <p>Hi Santosh,</p>
<p>I have Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>I was perusing through the hotmail&nbsp;options and settings yesterday and since its been updated, the checkbox for allowing POP mail clients for that account had been disabled. I enabled it and now outlook 2016 on my desktop seems to be sending and receiving
 emails easily with that account. I have also added those two domains to my safe list&nbsp;now and sent a test report from my Solar system server to the account in question and it has worked fine. Not sure why but somewhere within the transition of the old hotmail
 interface to the new one, (as it only seemed to be upgraded within the last 2 weeks), the errors started occuring.&nbsp;Seems as if a couple of the settings may of been reset in the changeover some how. Thankfully though it seems to be a simple fix.</p>
<p>Appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

</p><p>The email of the sender was *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and they spelled email as both "E-mail" and "email" in the same sentence, which is pretty inconsistent, i think the real Microsoft could do significantly better, as well as address me by my name rather than
 "User". I don't see why Microsoft would threaten me like that, especially when i didn't get any emails regarding an update. I think it's pretty suspicious and likely a scam, I just want to be sure, i didn't click the links provided of course.</p>

<p>The trouble with versions is they are vague, and Microsoft's policy on new features is not cut and dried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Office 365 subscription you have Office 2019 and get new feature updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Office 2019 stand-alone (volume license, purchased outright), then you don't get new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the general idea, anyway. However, I would not rule out 2019 stand-alone users occasionally getting some or full functionality on some of the new features when they install updates. Microsoft has been known to support a few new features in older versions.
 That's why I suggested that Yushan Liu download the example workbook and give it a go. It probably won't work, but never know.

    <title>Excel 2010 &#34;SHARED&#34; file won&#39;t open over a VPN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prince_howie_knighted  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 &#34;SHARED&#34; file won&#39;t open over a VPN</h2>
                    <p>Our company is using Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I created an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>Excel 2010 SHARED ".xlsm" workbook </strong></em></span>to be accessed by multiple users over our&nbsp;company network.&nbsp; The Excel "Shared" Workbook has a feature we are using that Tracks any changes to the workbook over a specified period of time; this
 was the purpose behind my choice.&nbsp; Additionally, I&nbsp;chose&nbsp;an ".xlsm" file-type because I&nbsp;designed a macro button to invoke this Excel Shared File Tracking feature which prepares a History sheet that is&nbsp;available during any&nbsp;current session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first saved the workbook and tested it over the&nbsp;company network, I got some messages to do with "Enabling the Content" and "Trusted Files".&nbsp; I had some sort of error message&nbsp;which had to do with "Try Again Later" but persisted and saved the file multiple
 times to allow Excel to configure whatever it has to (I am in the dark as to the algorithm that Excel 2010 may be using to initialize these "SHARED" files).&nbsp; I am guessing that these SHARED-type files are either unstable for given environments or there is
 something I am unaware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK.&nbsp; So I managed to get the end-user to access the file over our internal network.&nbsp; But here is the current problem which occurred the day after:&nbsp; The staff member&nbsp;was now in the field at a remote site and was, for security reasons, using a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>VPN network </strong></em></span>setting&nbsp;to access our company network;&nbsp;incidentally, the location of the file is on the company network&nbsp;in a virtually mapped shared drive (i.e. "G" Drive).
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>The staff member could not open the file.</strong></em></span>&nbsp; However, I asked him to copy the file to his local hard drive through Windows Explorer to see if the results were the same; not surprisingly,
 he <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>was</strong></span></em> able to open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any insight into this problem?&nbsp; I do not have any direct experience with VPNs.&nbsp; However, I do know that the staff member must log into a particular web site from his mobile computer which co-ordinates with his VPN device that he carries
 with him. Incidentally, he is using the Rogers "Rocket Stick" to access the Web.</p>

<h2>            Cant update WIndows software to 7.5 on Omnia 7</h2>
                    I am having trouble updating my Windows phone. I have a Samsung Omnia 7 phone and I want to update it to the latest 7.5 software but I keep getting different error &nbsp;codes come up, the latest is code 801811a5. When it updates it turns my computer off during
 the update every time, is this meant to happen, I only get to stage 2 out of 10.

    <title>Disable Call Pop-Up Window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> conrad oscar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Call Pop-Up Window</h2>
                    <p>So there is this super annoying pop-up window that is stuck in the corner of my screen. It re-opens every time I click off of Skype, and is set so its always in the front, so I cant just put it in the background and ignore it. I've looked online, but Skype
 changes its UI every update and has made it impossible to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is simple; How do I prevent this window from opening so that I never have to see it again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>There is definitely a setting in Skype 7.x/8.x/12.x/14.x. Below is the setting in 8.25.05. You can disable this window in your Calling Settings (under your profile properties&nbsp; - Calling).</p>

                    <p>The VBA constant vbCrLf in VBA for Office 2016 seems to be incorrect? &nbsp;It should be a two character string where it is CR(ascii 13) followed by LF(ascii 10). &nbsp;But when I'm in the VBE for 2016, if I look at vbCrLf I get LF-CR.</p>

<h2>            O365 fowarding limitations</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have a requirment to forward an inbound external email to 13 recipients using a standard mailbox rule. I understand the limitation to forward via a mail rule is 10 recipients, so how would I achieve the requirement to forward to 13 recipients.</p>
<p>We have tried 2 seperate rules, rule 1 with forwarding to 10 recipients and rule 2 forwarding to 3 recipients - this did not work (yes we unticked the stop processing rule option)</p>
<p>What are the options available.</p>
<p>Is the limitation 10 recipients in total, or 10 per rule</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Shane</p>

<p>hi shane,</p>
<p>do you mean that set up forwarding rule in owa (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>)-&gt;<b>options</b>-&gt;<b>mail</b>-&gt;<b>inbox and sweep rules</b>?
<span>if so, the limitation isn’t 10</span>. as i know, we can add more than 10 recipients to the forwarding list. so by saying “<i>i understand the limitation to forward via a mail rule is 10 recipients</i>”, we need to
 confirm some information below:</p>
<p>1. can you not add more than 10 recipients to the forwarding list?</p>
<p>2. if yes, is there an error message when adding more than 10 recipients to the forwarding list?</p>
<p>in addition, i suggest you follow the steps below to meet your requirement:</p>
<p>1. create a dg (distribution group) and then add the 13 recipients to it. to do this:</p>
<p>a. login to eac (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>) with an admin account.</p>
<p>b. click&nbsp;<b>recipients</b>-&gt;<b>groups</b>-&gt;add (<b>+</b>)-&gt;<b>distribution group</b>.</p>
<p>c. type the information needed and then when you click add (+) to add members to the dg, there will be a user list for you to choose.</p>
<p>if you want to add users outside your organization to the dg, please refer to my post in this thread:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/p/435052/1103460#1103460</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: you need to be an admin to create a dg. if you aren’t, let your admins help you on it.</p>
<p>2. create the inbox rule like the picture shows below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9f5f5dc6-9b6c-42ec-ac1a-91dd103d56e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9f5f5dc6-9b6c-42ec-ac1a-91dd103d56e8" /></a></p>
<p>if this isn’t the case, please upload some screenshots about how you create the rules. to upload screenshots, select&nbsp;the
<b>use rich formatting </b>button in the forum, and then click&nbsp;<b>insert /edit media</b> like the picture shows below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=cf352a9d-cda0-4650-ba55-00a3cb5024b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dcf352a9d-cda0-4650-ba55-00a3cb5024b5" /></a></p>

<p>yes a fowarding rule setup in owa options-&gt;mail-&gt;inbox and sweep rules. it states in technet documents that the limit is in fact 10 recipients.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d30ca0a3-f962-4934-80ae-17fca685406d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd30ca0a3-f962-4934-80ae-17fca685406d" /></a></p>

<p>in answer to your questions;</p>
<p>1. can you not add more than 10 recipients to the forwarding list?</p>
<p>yes we can but the mail rule does not process if you have more than 10 recipients.</p>
<p>2. if yes, is there an error message when adding more than 10 recipients to the forwarding list?</p>
<p>no there is no error, the rule simply does not process</p>
<p>i believe a dg with more than 10 also does not work, but will need to retest this.</p>
<p>what i need clarified is thw limitation of allowed recipients when fowarding emails via a mail rule, because you are the 4th ms support pesron to provide a different answer.</p>

<p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates. And sorry for the misleading information, I have deleted it in my previous post.</p>
<p>After consulting the related team, the 10 recipients forwardee limit is the total limit. In addition, the DG is a workaround based on my tests.</p>

<p>Thanks for confirming that, can you also confirm if the DG can be a Contact List in OWA or it needs to be a DG ? I received an error when setting up the mail rule using a Contact List created in OWA.</p>

<p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>Do you mean whether the inbox rule works with the group created in OWA as well? If so, the answer is yes. But this group can only add internal users as members. If anything is misunderstood, please give more information about the ‘Contact List’.</p>
<p>In addition, please upload a screenshot about the error message for analysis.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Larry</p>

<h2>            OneNote IOS - Handwriting to text conversion - Why Not&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am not a fan of crippleware so I am frustrated that MS has chosen to cripple the handwriting conversion in the IOS OneNote app. The IOS app is already painfully poor in terms of options and features - infact IOS Files which is also dreadful actually does
 a better job if you don't mind using IOS Notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At what point will MS acknowledge that even if the iPad is not a 'computer' its user base is in the millions and therefore have the common sense to give the &nbsp;IOS version of the app the same functions / features as the PC tablet version?</p>

You may firstly<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> online repair the Office suite</a> to check the outcome.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. Does the issue occur with some existing files? If you just open Access and create a new file, will the ribbon/menu disappear?
<br />
2. The screenshots for “don’t have any ribbon or menu”.<br />
3. Open Access&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of Product Information. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim

            <p>Thanks for the fast reply.</p>
<p>I already did the repair. &nbsp;Both the quick repair and the other repair. &nbsp;No success.</p>
<p>Attached are screen images.</p>
<p>When the ribbon and Access "headings" are not displayed, if I slowly move my cursor from upper right left, when I hover at just the right spot, I can find "Close", "Maximize", "minimize" and "Access help" which works as shown in one of the images. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Image 1 - shows Access after it is opened - really that is what is displayed</p>
<p>Image 2 - shows when I found and clicked on "Access help"</p>
<p>image 3 - shows when i open my application which normally displays a ribbon and normal "headings"</p>
<p>image 4 - shows my application when I "found" and clicked on "Customize quick Access toolbar"</p>
<p>image 5 - my application displayed immediately after a reboot</p>
<p>Image 6 Account info</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running this on a PC with Windows 10 and Office 365/(Access 2016).</p>
<p>We recently upgraded the PC to windows 10. &nbsp;This problem did not occur with office 365/(Access 2016) with windows 7 pro.</p>
<p>I am connected in via Teamviewer so that is why there is the "other stuff" in the images.</p>
<p>I have been connecting in via teamviewer to this PC for the past couple of months, almost daily, working on Access.</p>
<p>Under Windows 7 Pro with Office 365/(Access 2016) I never had an issue like this.</p>

            Hi Bob,<br />
<br />
The issue may be related to your default graphics card on your computer. I suggest you take a look at the thread below:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-access/access-2016-windows-10-opens-to-a-blank-screen/64f7a950-e811-4aab-8943-544450ba596e">Access 2016 windows 10 opens to a blank screen</a><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, please confirm if the issue persists when you control the computer directly, instead of using TeamViewer.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, do other Office applications have this issue? If changing the graphics card settings don't work for and it is convenient, you may reinstall the Office suite to see the outcome.

            <p>I do not have access to the office 365 license to do the uninstall and reinstall.</p>
<p>I asked the owner about doing the uninstall and reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two different software products I use for remote access to the PC - in case one gets hung up hopefully I can still get in and force a reboot if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are:</p>
<p>Teamviewer 11</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remote Utilities 6.3.0.6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use Teamviewer and am the most familiar with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying Remote Utilities, which has the same Access problems as Teamviewer, I found it has an option of making an RDP connection to the PC. &nbsp;I clicked on that and got another screen, an RDP connection. &nbsp;On the RDP connection, Access displays correctly.
 &nbsp;And when I switched back to Remote Utilities, it also displayed the Access displays correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curious Huh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't forget that when Access is not displaying correctly, ALSO I cannot get anything when I single left click on the Windows Start button. &nbsp;The right click displays correctly.</p>

    <title>Change Notification Recipient For Password Reset Request - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Notification Recipient For Password Reset Request</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>How does Office 365 chose whom to send the notifications to? We are three administrators and only one receives, we need to change that.</p>
<p>It seems that there is a default GA who register the office 365 subscription, but I need to assign someone else to receive the temp password notification email.</p>
<p>I find a post for the same question, and I follow the steps,create 1 Global Admin,Password admin and user mgmt admin, but still the default GA receive the email,&nbsp; the password administrator did not receive the notification. Anyone know what should I do ??&nbsp;
 Or is there any powershell cmdlet available for that?</p>
<p>The post is as below:</p>
<p>In Office 365, only Password admins, User management admins and Global admins can receive the password reset request notification emails.<br />
If we have all the three types of admins above in your organization, then <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
only the Password admins will receive the notification emails.</span></p>
<p>So as a conclusion, the priority of receiving the password reset request notification emails is:
<br />
<strong>Password admins &gt; User management admins &gt; Global admins</strong> .</p>

<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>Your understanding is correct.</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, I'd like to confirm if the issue happens by performing the following steps:
<br />
1. Assign user A&nbsp;the password admin role.<br />
2. Let user B request resetting password by clicking "Can’t access your account?" in portal:<br />
<a href="https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/</a>
<br />
3. The message appears:<br />
"We're sorry, but your administrator has not set up your account for use with this service. If you'd like, we can contact an administrator in your organization to reset your password for you."&nbsp;Click "contact an administrator".<br />
4. Normally the request email will be sent to the password admin's mailbox.</p>
<p>However you found it will still send to your Global admin's mailbox, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, you may re-assign the admin role to this user and see the outcome, or assign the password admin role to another user to narrow down if it is&nbsp;an&nbsp;account&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>Please let us know the information for further help.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>Who is trying to reset user’s password will see the email address is his. That means, when a global admin try to reset a user’s password, the default filled email address is this global admin’s. When a password admin try to reset a user’s password, the default
 email address is this password admin’s. If we want the email to be sent to other admins, we can type the email address manually. Please check if this is your scenario. If not, there would be something goes wrong. Please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Iris</p>

<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>To summarize:<br />
1. If the user submit&nbsp;a reset password request, the password admin will receive the request email as you&nbsp;described in the initial thread.<br />
<br />
2. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;manually&nbsp;reset the user's password, by default it will&nbsp;use&nbsp;your current admin account's email address (the admin account you are&nbsp;currently logged in, so it is not a default option). But you can change it. You may need to manually type the
 email addresses (up to 5) to receive the emails&nbsp;each time. <br />
Note: You can&nbsp;reset password for a user or multiple users (bulk select the users and click Reset password) at a time.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Using Hyperlinks in Spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bokis123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Hyperlinks in Spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel Table consisting of several columns and several hundred records.&nbsp; One column is a Document ID number, such as "HBX1234" another is the URL that will take you to that document.&nbsp; The URL is a hyperlink in the format http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20012002/2420.pdf.&nbsp;
 When I click the URL I am taken to the document that corresponds to the Document ID number.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp; Is there some EASY way that I can "embed" the URL in the Document ID number so that the Document ID becomes a hyperlink, itself and I do not need to display the column of URLs?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like it should be fairly easy - but so far I have no success in my somewhat blind attempts to do it.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; I am not sure I am using correct nomenclature to describe what I want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should be asking the question the other way around -- Is there some way that I can easily cause the existing hyperlink to display as the document number (e.g., HBX1234)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;bokis123,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further isolate your concern, is it okay if you can share a sample copy of your spreadsheet?&nbsp;<span>You can share the file by&nbsp;</span><span>uploading it on OneDrive so that we can replicate it here on our end. Then,&nbsp;</span><span><span><em><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07#bkmk_getalink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>get
 a link</strong></span></span></span></a></em></span></span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>and post it in your reply.&nbsp;</span><span>If you want to share it privately due to personal information that might be included on the file,&nbsp;</span><span>you can reply to the private
 message that we've sent.&nbsp;</span><span>To view this, click your&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>username</strong></span></span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>or<span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><strong>account</strong></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><strong>name</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;on
 the&nbsp;top right corner of this page.&nbsp;</span><span>Then,&nbsp;click&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>View&nbsp;</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>private&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span><span><strong>messages</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you tell us the step-by-step instructions on how you created the hyperlink? You can use the Steps Recorder for&nbsp;<span>recording the exact steps you took. Here's an article on how to use it:&nbsp;</span><em><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22878/windows-10-record-steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Record

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I managed to "work around" what I though would be a problem.&nbsp; However, I still would like to understand whether I could have done what I wanted to do.&nbsp; Or whether I needed to do something different early in the process of creating
 the spreadsheet.&nbsp; Here is a link to an "example" file -- several lines from the actual spreadsheet. &nbsp;https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgnekDpFsyVfhZAdqBSNN5tqSv9b6w&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the spreadsheet somewhat by brute force.&nbsp; For each record, I found a document that was in my category of interest.&nbsp; I opened the document at the URL that is in the right-most field.&nbsp; Then, I copied that URL and pasted it into the right-most field.&nbsp;
 I either manually entered or copied and pasted certain additional information contained in the document and used that information to populate the other fields of each record.&nbsp; Then, what I wanted to do was to have each Bill Number be a hyperlink that would
 go to the same URL as the hyperlink in the right-most field.&nbsp; Or, alternatively, have the hyperlink in the right-most field display as the Bill Number. &nbsp; I had thought there might be some sort of "LINK" function where I would, for example, indicate that I
 wanted cell C2 to be hyperlinked to the URL in cell K2, or that I wanted the hyperlink in cell K2 to be displayed as the text in cell C2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I do not know the precise nomenclature or jargon for what I am visualizing.&nbsp; Hopefully my description is understandable.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnTLACpEASVmilgx38sQ_yRHPdzD</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps that I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I right-<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">clicked&nbsp; on the cell where I wanted to create a hyperlink. In this case,
<strong>C2</strong>. Then, I selected <strong>Hyperlink...</strong>.</span></p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Under&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><strong>Link to</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">, I click&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><strong>Existing
 File or Web Page</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Then,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">I enter the name and location of the web page that I wanted to link to. I typed that
 information in the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><strong>Address</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;box.</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"> Then, I clicked

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">On the hand, for the cell

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; This is exactly the results I wanted, and I understand what you are doing.&nbsp; However, I do not understand HOW you are doing it efficiently (which I assume you are).</p>
<p>Maybe I am just terribly dense.</p>
<p>On your step 2 you say, "<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Then,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">I enter the name and location of the web page that I wanted to link to.

 Then, I clicked <strong>OK</strong>."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">What I want to understand is EXACTLY how you are doing this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">You surely are not literally "typing in" manually the URL information from Cell K2.&nbsp; Are you doing this with a macro?&nbsp; Or, some other way?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 0, 1)"><span>Right now, to accomplish this step, the only way I have found to do it is this:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 0, 1)"><span><span>Go first to cell Kn (where n= 2 through 9) and right click to select cell Kn</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 0, 1)"><span><span>Go up to the cell content bar (or whatever the bar above the horizontal grid labels is called), select the contents and copy using Ctrl-C</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 0, 1)"><span><span>Go to cell Cn and right click</span></span></span></p>
<p>Click Hyperlink (as you described)</p>
<p>Past the contents that I just copied into the Address bar using Ctrl-V, Then click OK</p>
<p>Do this for each record where I want Cn to become a hyperlink.</p>
<p>It would take me hours to do this manually for every record, even in a table that has only 100 records.</p>
<p>I apologize for seeming not to understand HOW you are doing what you describe.&nbsp; I clearly understand the broad strokes of what you are doing and why.&nbsp; It is the details of exactly how you are doing it that I still cannot understand.</p>
<p>NOTE/UPDATE:&nbsp; I know essentially nothing about using Macros or Visual Basic.&nbsp; I have been fooling around a little with trying to create a macro in my test spreadsheet.&nbsp; I am convinced it must be easy for someone who understands Macros to quickly do what
 you describe.&nbsp; However, I do not have that understanding as of yet.&nbsp; If you did making the changes using a Macro or VBA program, could you provide me with a copy of the coding?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<div>Hi <strong>bokis123</strong>,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>We appreciate you for taking time in providing us an update. The steps provided by
<strong>Kris</strong> <strong>Ver</strong> doesn't include any macros. This is one of the ways you can use hyperlinks in your worksheet. Since you've mentioned that you will be doing over 100 records, this will really take time if done manually.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, there's a possible way of achieving this by using a formula. But we need to know how the data (links) are being extracted. Are those links included in the raw file or you include them manually? Also, do you have a reference list of the bill number
 with the links from another worksheet or file?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I HOPE YOU READ THIS "LOUD" NOTE FIRST.&nbsp; I am leaving in what I had written before I "discovered" how to do what I wanted.&nbsp; When I did, it took all of 1 minute to accomplish the results on the spread sheet of about 150 records.&nbsp; All I needed to do was go
 to the column C (labeled Bill Number).&nbsp; Select all cells C2 through C150.&nbsp; Do Ctrl-C to copy the contents of those cells.&nbsp; Go to Cell K2 and do a "paste special" using the Paste Links command.&nbsp; That gave me exactly what I want (or at least close enough) after
 all this time and frustration on my part and possibly on yours.&nbsp; A piece of cake when one knows what to do!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The remainder is what I wrote yesterday before "discovering" what I really needed to do about 1/2 hours ago:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, Eileen.&nbsp; My exchanges with Kris have been very helpful to my understanding.&nbsp; So, I will try to push on to the end.&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; The process that I used to develop the spreadsheet from which I extracted a few lines as a sample is very tedious and took
 me most of a day to complete.&nbsp; However, I will describe it.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to this internet site: http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/Search.aspx&nbsp;</li><li>Type in Keywords: homestead exemption</li><li>Go to Bill Type an select "House Bill"</li><li>Go to Session and select one of the "Regular Sessions."&nbsp; I started with "2001-2002 Regular Session"</li><li>For any specific session, the search pulls up about 10-15 pages, each page with 20 records.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I literally, manually scroll through each page, eyeballing each record.&nbsp; Based on keywords in the title of each record, and on the "Status" of the record, I judge whether or not the record is one that I am interested in.&nbsp; My judgment criteria for a "record
 of interest" is (1) Title starts with a county name (not a city name). (2) Title includes the words "homestead exemption." (3) Status says something like "Adopted" or "Governor Signed" -- the exact words change from one session to another, but generally indicate
 that the bill was, in fact, enacted into law and is not still in process.&nbsp; An example of a record of interest is HB726 on search result page 5 for the 2001-2002 Regular Session.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>For a record of interest, I right click on the HB hyperlink and open it in separate tab.</li><li>Go to the newly opened tab.</li><li>Scan (read) the summary description and confirm that the record is one I am really interested in.</li><li>If confirmed to be of interest, click on the link saying "Open current version in new window"; this opens the actual text of the bill in a new TAB."</li><li>Go to the new tab and scan (read) at least the initial part of the bill's text."</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>At this point,&nbsp; I MANUALLY enter information into a new record of my spreadsheet: Legislative Session, Bill Number, County, Tax Purpose, Qualifying Age, Maximum Income, and Exemption Amount. &nbsp; This requires working back and forth between my Excel spreadsheet
 and the open tab with the pdf file.&nbsp; In the window with the open pdf file, then:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Move cursor up to the URL address line and select its contents.</li><li>Copy with Ctrl-C.&nbsp; </li><li>Go from here back into my Excel spreadsheet.</li><li>Select the field named Link (currently empty).</li><li>Past in the copied URL using Ctrl-V.</li><li>THAT COMPLETES THE RECORD ENTRY FOR ONE RECORD OF INTEREST. &nbsp; (The other two fields came in later and are of no importance to this discussion.)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Close down the opened tabs, except the one labeled "Search Legislation."</p>
<p>Start looking through the Search Results again, starting from the most recent "record of interest."</p>
<p>When another record of interest is found, repeat the process described above to create another record in my spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After one has done this a few times, the manual process actually goes faster than it may sound.&nbsp; As I said, it took me most of a day to complete my spreadsheet which has only about 150 records in it.&nbsp; (I am mildly compulsive-obsessive and can put up with
 a lot of tedium at times.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my spreadsheet was completed, I looked at it and thought, "well, it would be nice if I could just turn the Bill Number into a hyperlink that, when clicked, takes one to the PDF file providing the text of the bill."&nbsp; This is really a cosmetic nicety
 -- not a necessity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>That basically is where I started my interchange with Kris.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if I can implement the cosmetic nicety fairly easily -- good, I will do it.&nbsp; If not, then such is life.&nbsp; I will just use what I currently have.&nbsp; I am confident what I want can be done with a macro or short VBA program.&nbsp; I just do not have the coding
 knowledge to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for tolerating this extended monologue -- If you have got this far into it.</p>
<p>Regards etc.</p>

<p>Added Information:</p>
<p>By fiddling around enough with this, I did find a relatively easy way to make the change I want -- probably in an hour or so --<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> provided I do not make any typographic errors in the process</span> (or learn to correct
 the result of the typo if I notice it).</p>
<p>Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on one of the Link fields (e.g., cell Kn).&nbsp; Where n is the row number of the cell.</li><li>Click "Edit Hyperlink"</li><li>In the "Text to Display," manually replace what is there with "=Cn" -- Where n is the row number of the cell (Bill Number)</li><li>Click OK.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If I do this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without</span> making a typographic error (such as entering, for example Dn rather than Cn, or entering the wrong row number) -- then the hyperlink in cell Kn is displayed as the bill number that is shown
 as simple text in column C.&nbsp; This is what I want -- if I do not make a typo mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I do make an error -- even if I notice it immediately because what I expected does not display in cell Kn -- I do not understand how to correct it.&nbsp; When I reopen the cell containing the error using "Edit Hyperlink," the Text to Display box is
 grayed out and says, "&lt;&lt;Selection in Document&gt;&gt;."&nbsp; I do not have any ability to do a simple edit to correct my error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this further explanation will be helpful to you in understanding my frustration (due to my lack of knowledge of Macros or VBA coding).</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
