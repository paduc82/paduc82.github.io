    <title>SOLVED - Cannot image &#40;PXE&#92;USB&#41; Surface Pro 3 no matter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SOLVED - Cannot image &#40;PXE&#92;USB&#41; Surface Pro 3 no matter what&#33; HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Edit: I used Virtual Clone Drive to mount a Windows 10 .iso within the OS and ran the installation from that virtual disc. It installed right over Win 8.1. I still cannot boot into the network nor a USB after the upgrade though, I did try that again once
 Windows 10 &amp; all drivers got installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR: Microsoft makes it impossible to image surfaces outside of the OS, you have to be in the OS and mount a disc to get it to work. I have 2 now 3 different Surface Pros that I tried all this troubleshooting with and NOTHING works, especially the Vol Down
 + power boot option that every article says to do, it DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I had a previous support case with Microsoft that went absolutely nowhere. I'm hoping that someone has figured this out, I would appreciate any information!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two surface pro 3's that have been in storage for some time. I want to upgrade them to Windows 10. I have an existing image that I'd like to use. The image is accessible through PXE (both UEFI and old BIOS are supported on all DCs) and I also threw
 it on both a USB drive and a DVD. I also have 2 different KBE (KACE boot envrionment), one is WinPE and the other is the newest WinPE10. The boot environments are for use with my systems appliance manager KACE SMA, I can image every other machine even Mac
 and Linux using these KBEs. The surface is the only machine that is giving me problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried holding the volume down button and power to boot into the USB\PXE. I confirmed that the ports are enabled, boot order is correct, disabled TPM and Secure Boot. I have done every combination of turning those settings on and off and then trying
 to boot again. I have tried holding down the power for 5 whole seconds and releasing as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine literally skips the USB and PXE option altogether and just boots to the OS
<strong>EVERY SINGLE TIME</strong>. I have also used 2 different USB ethernet adapters, one is the microsoft surface ethernet adapter model 1821 and the other is a Belkin. I made sure that the machines can actually use ethernet and that their drivers work with
 these devices inside the OS, same for the USB ports and thumb drives. No matter what I do the machine just boots all the way into the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually shut the surface pro 3 down by doing the command shutdown.exe /s /t 0 /f then attempt to boot it into the network by holding down the volume key, then holding down the power key for 5 seconds. The surface pro 3 powers on with all red background,
 the little circle spins towards the bottom of the screen and then it boots to the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any advice as Microsoft support told me to create a data eraser tool on a USB (which is completely redundant of an answer, I literally CANNOT boot from USB and then these people tell me do exactly that...) Machine is OOW so they do not
 care at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Alex</p>

<p>SOLVED - I ended up having to use a program like Daemon Tools, I used one called Virtual Clone Drive to mount a Windows 10 .iso as a disc. Then I opened that disc while in the OS and it began installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also tried an external DVD with the KBE on it and that didn't work from the bootup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A weeks worth of troubleshooting just to image a device! Never getting surfaces again that's for sure!</p>

<h2>            Winbook TW802 -  November Update Freezes Tablet</h2>
                    <p>Originally posted in insider forum.&nbsp; Now confirmed in official release so starting new thread with additional info in proper version.</p>
<p>Per Title, this is a Winbook TW802 Tablet.</p>
<p>Tablet has run no issues with Windows 10 Release 1 (10240)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basics:</p>
<p>No SD Card</p>
<p>Installed from 1511 ISO. Update&nbsp;and/or disk reformatted with boot from ISO has same freeze results</p>
<p>Sometimes install freezes (at various points) and setup must be restarted</p>
<p>Sometimes install completes</p>
<p>
</p><p>If install completed:</p>
<p>Tablet sometimes freezes at logon screen</p>
<p>If able&nbsp;to log in:</p>
<p>Tablet always freezes within very short time period</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to get around this (not the fix):</p>
<p>Boot to safe mode and tablet&nbsp;will run no issue, so seems to be driver / services issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Safe Mode:</p>
<p>Disabling Bluetooth *and* wifi drivers will allow table to&nbsp;boot in "normal" mode and tablet will mostly run, but drivers don't seem to be root cause (see *Other)</p>
<p>Can't identify all drivers causing problems</p>
<p>Have noticed that tablet will not wake from sleep on many occasions after disabling above drivers (could be different issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other:</p>
<p>*To confirm if this is issue with Realtek drivers I installed a WiFi dongle (Tenda) .&nbsp; As soon as driver is installed and WiFi is being configured Tablet locks up. Seems to confirm this is not a Wifi driver issue (but I guess I could have hit the driver&nbsp;trifecta).</p>
<p>There was also an Intel service in startup that says something about (TCPIP).&nbsp; Allowing this service to start also freezes tablet, so this one also needs to be disabled for boot to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Image seems correct from all available checks (SFC, Dism)</p>
<p>

            <p>Some time back I had upgraded my Winbook TW802 to Windows 10 and it worked fine. Then this evening I used Windows 10's Start &gt; Settings &gt; Windows Update option to download and install the latest release 1511 of Windows 10. Everything went fine until the
 installation finished and did the final restart when it hung up cycling through the logo screen. That is, it shows the WinBook logo and the busy rotating circle three times in slightly different locations and brightness and then goes blank for about 15 seconds
 and repeated this cycle endlessly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems to be specific to Winbook TW802 since I also have a Winbook TW801 that I had upgraded to Windows 10 about the same time as my Winbook TW802 and this morning I updated this Winbook TW801 the same way to the the latest release 1511 of Windows
 10 without any problems.</p>

            Same experience. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">10240 works fine (except for known camera issues).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But 1511 wouldn't install correctly from Windows Update as it would hang while "getting things ready," and, when it did install completely from USB, it would hang shortly after getting to the Desktop.<br />
<br />
I suspect that the "getting things ready" freeze was caused by the same problem that causes the interface to freeze.<br />
<br />
I've used the windows update diagnostic tool to disable upgrades so that I can keep using my tablet.</span>

            <p>You might be able to recover your TW802 if you can get your hands on a bootable flash drive with the FIRST public version of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Using a usb hub to connect to the tablet will allow you to have keyboard, mouse and the flash drive. You'll need to press F2 while booting to get into the BIOS and change the boot order to use the flash drive first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 802 crashed with the 1511 update, but I was able to clean install the previous version by booting to the flash drive I made back in August.</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen P. or anyone at Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any updates you can provide on this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;Winbook TW802 tablet (happily upgraded from 8.1 Bing) &nbsp;is currently running just fine on build 10240, and&nbsp;I would be happy to leave my machine on build 10240 of Windows 10, except for one very annoying&nbsp; design decision ....
</p>
<p>************&nbsp;Those automated updates keep coming for the TH2 installation (is it possible to stop these)? ********&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If TH2 installs, my machine will be unusable (again, is it possible to stop these?).&nbsp; Upgrading will force me&nbsp;to restore my 10240 backup, at which point TH2 will download and reinstall once again,&nbsp;crashing my laptop and&nbsp;wasting endless hours for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue needs something other than the usual trouble shooting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To me it seems my only viable option is to leave my machine turned off to prevent download and any updates from installing.</p>
<p>

    <title>Automated reply loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian4882  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automated reply loop</h2>
                    In WLM how do you stop an automated reply from going to an address with an automated reply? &nbsp;As that causes a continuous loop.

            Yes, I set up message rules to tell people that my email address was changing. But then it also replied to messages from sites that had an automated reply. Hence the loop. How can I avoid the loop situation?

            <p>Are these sites from someone not in your address book? This is what I normally suggest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do this, you will have to leave your computer on 24/7, be connected to the Internet, and have your e-mail program open. If you want do this anyway, the link below will explain how to do it.
<strong>One thing I would suggest is that where it says to create a rule and check For All Messages, you change it and make the rule for people in your address book only. Otherwise you will be replying to Spam as well and could end up in an endless loop of
 bounces.</strong></p>

</p><p>Most ISPs/Mail Servers offer this service which would be a better choice.</p>

            <p>Hi HowardSmith,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Do you have any other language pack installed on your system?</li><li>Is this computer came preinstalled with Windows 7 or you have installed it on your own?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided on the following methods and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>You can run the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's power settings. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep
 mode. Adjusting these settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.
</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persist try to do some changes in the power options and hope it will help you to fix the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>Power Options </strong>by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span><strong> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" /></strong>, clicking
<span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span>, clicking <span><strong>System and Security</strong></span>, and then clicking
<span><strong>Power Options</strong></span>.</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On the Left side menu select <strong><span>Choose what the power buttons do.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Now go to section which says <strong><span>when I press the power button.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Scroll down and select <strong><span>shutdown.</span></strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select the <strong><span>Save Changes Button.</span></strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Repeat the same steps for <strong><span>sleep and hibernate options also.</span></strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Check the status of boxes stating <strong><span>Turn on fast start up, Sleep and Hibernate.</span></strong></span></li></ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Change the “Power plans” settings.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings (like display, sleep, etc.) that manages how your PC uses power. The power plans you can use depend on the kind of PC you have.<br />

<p>The power supplies are not interchangeable between the original Xbox and the Xbox 360 S. The only ones that are interchangeable are the Xbox 360 S (uses a 135w PSU) and the Xbox 360 E (uses a 120w PSU). There were several variations of the original Xbox
 360 S that varies from a 203w, 175w, or 150w PSU. So unfortunately it is not recommend to use your original Xbox 360 PSU as a replacement for your Xbox 360 S. You will either need to get a repair through

            Hi, I hope you're having a wonderful day.
<br />
<br />Try these methods and see if one of them works.
<br />
<br />Method 1 - Set display scaling to 100%
<br />
<br />Open the Settings app and go to System &gt; Display.
<br />Windows 10 not using full screen
<br />Find the Change the size of text, apps and other items and set it to 100%.
<br />You might have to sign out of your account and sign back in order to apply the changes, so be sure to do that. Once you do that, be sure to check if your games are working again.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 2 – Change your main screen
<br />
<br />You can experience problems with fullscreen and games if you’re using dual monitor setup. However, you can fix this problem simply by changing your display settings. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Right click on your Desktop and choose Display settings from the menu. When Display settings window opens you should see two monitors labeled with numbers.
<br />Windows 10 not using full screen
<br />In Display settings window click Identify.  A number should appear on your screen. Usually, it’s 1 or 2.
<br />Now in Display settings set the monitor with the same number you got in Step 2 as the main monitor.
<br />Save the changes and try running games in fullscreen.
<br />This is a simple trick that can help you fix this problem, so be sure to try it out.
<br />
<br />Method 3 - Change Nvidia Control Panel settings (If you have a Nvidia GPU)
<br />
<br />Open Nvidia Control Panel.
<br />Go to Manage 3D settings &gt; Global settings.
<br />Windows 10 not playing games full screen
<br />Change Preferred graphics processor from Auto-select to High Performance Nvidia processor.
<br />Click on Apply to save the changes and try running games in fullscreen mode.
<br />Few users reported that they fixed the problem simply by adjusting their desktop size and position in Nvidia Control Panel. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open Nvidia Control Panel.
<br />Go to Display &gt; Adjust desktop size and position.
<br />Windows 10 not playing games full screen
<br />Locate the scaling option and set it to No scaling and click on Apply to save changes.
<br />Windows 10 fullscreen games keep minimizing
<br />After making these changes, you should be able to run games in fullscreen without any problems. If you use AMD graphics, you should be able to find the similar options in Catalyst Control Center.
<br />
<br />Method 4 – Disable Teamviewer
<br />
<br />Many users reported various fullscreen issues with their favorite games, and according to them, the common cause is Teamviewer. If you’re not familiar with Teamviewer, it’s a remote assistance application that allows you to control any other PC remotely. This is a rather popular application and many users have it installed.
<br />
<br />Method 5 – Use the Compatibility mode
<br />
<br />If you’re having problems with fullscreen games on your PC, you might want to try running them in Compatibility mode. This mode is specially designed for older applications that aren’t fully compatible with Windows 10. To run a certain application in Compatibility mode, you need to do the following:
<br />
<br />Locate the problematic application, right click it and choose Properties from the menu.
<br />Games won't go full screen Windows 10
<br />Navigate to the Compatibility tab and check Run this program in compatibility mode for option. Now select the desired version of Windows from the menu and click on Apply and OK to save changes.
<br />Windows 10 full screen not working
<br />After enabling Compatibility mode, try to run your game again and check if the issue still persists. Keep in mind that you might have to try several different compatibility modes before you find the one that works for the selected game.
<br />
<br />Compatibility mode is a useful feature that allows you to run old software on your PC, so feel free to try it out.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards.

            Same issue. Pressing Windows Key + shift + enter fixed it for me. It's the general full screen command for Windows apps on Windows 10.

<h2>            &#8220;Free Fallout 3 code with digital purchase of Fallout 4</h2>
                    
<ul>
<li>Promotion name: ”“Free Fallout 3 code with digital purchase of Fallout 4 </li><li>Date of purchase: “July 2, 2015” </li><li>Issue:
<ul>
<li>I did not get my code until November 3rd </li><li>The message with my Fallout 3 code has expired. </li><li>I get error code <strong>0x80153016</strong><b>&nbsp;</b>when I try to redeem my Fallout 3.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>I pre-ordered Fallout 4 back in July directly, through the game store on my Xbox One. Part of the deal I purchased was I was supposed to get a copy of Fallout 3 for Xbox 360. Fallout 4 downloaded just fine and was playable on day one. Fallout 3 was supposed
 to come via redeemable code in the message center. I received a code, however it is not redeemable. I have been consistently receiving a region error every time I try to download the game. Here's the situation: I moved to Germany from the United States so
 my consoles are physically located in Germany, connected to the internet by a German IP and this is where i made the purchase. As I said, Fallout 4 worked fine but I got a region error when try to download Fallout 3. After several phone calls (beginning November
 22nd) and about 5 hours of xbox tech support we've confirmed the download code <b>
IS</b>&nbsp;for Germany, so&nbsp;my consoles (Xbox One and Xbox 360) have all been changed to german region, as well as my xbox live account, microsoft account, and my billing info. It's super inconvenient because a lot of info now displays in German despite my language
 preferences being English on everything, <strong>and the game still won't download</strong>. The last tech support I talked to said to post the issue here on the forums and you guys will take a look at my account and send me a new game code that will work
 for my region. I'll be waiting.</p>

            <p>Hey there DustDoggy Dogg.</p>
<p>Are you by chance using a VPN to connect to the internet? VPNs can cause issues such as the one you're having. If you haven't tried already, you can also redeem the code here on Xbox.com. Unfortunately billing issues like this are best suited for Phone support, as we aren't able to look into account related issues that may be causing your error message.</p>

<p>I am not using a VPN. One of the phone support reps suggested I try it but I don't feel I should have to do that. I feel like I should get a code that works just as easily as the fallout 4 code worked. Also, I HAVE tried to redeem the code on Xbox.com to
 no avail. I tried again just a few minutes ago. Phone support seems to think this forum is the answer. Anyone there who can provide a resolution?</p>

    <title>New Xbox one Controller D pad issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhythmneo  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Xbox one Controller D pad issues</h2>
                    
<p>Just purchased the new Xbox covert forces controller with the new 3.5 jack and updated bumpers however, when I tested the D pad I noticed a subtle thing. &nbsp;You must apply pressure on the Dpad for it to register. &nbsp;If I press it lightly it doesnt register.
 I tested it with Mortal Kombat X. &nbsp;I also noticed that its built differently. &nbsp;The previous Xbox one controllers D pad would click when pressed, the new updated controller does not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a specific manufacturer design issue? &nbsp;Or is this an isolated issue with my controller?</p>

<p>i tried the covert ops version out also, and yes i had noticed that the dpad is different, i should mention that it also is still disconnecting but somehow these disconnection issues dont go away even if you connect the microusb cables and use them in wired
 mode.</p>
<p>just a question for lolaib did you encounter those disconnections with the new 1tb console? if not then they definitly did more then just redesign some elements of the controller there. and didnt mention it....</p>

<p>I have the same problem, pressure needs to be applied to all directions on my dpad for it to register. Not the biggest issue but there are times when I push the button then die in my game cause it didn't register which does pies me off. Side by side with
 my original black controller all other buttons feel fine. &nbsp; should note this is the 3rd covert controller I've had cause I thought the first two were defected decided to just live with it on the third.</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same issue with the covert forces controller. I was really looking forward to try this controller out with my Astro A50 headset but right away i noticed something wasn't right with the Dpad and I went ahead and got an exchange and even
 this new one is just as bad. I'm very disappointed as I absolutely love the orginal Xbox One controller and I even used it to replace the Xbox 360 controller I used on my PC. The Dpad is the best improvement over that controller and now with the Covert Ops
 version its just as bad as the Xbox 360 controller.</p>

<h3> seventec  say:</h3>
<h2>            360 runs hotter with installed games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've read that if you install the games to the HDD the system will run quieter but unfortunately much hotter (the bottom). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm this... I don't have a HDD.</p>
<p>What if the games are installed to a USB stick... would the system still run hotter?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is summer is on the way and I don't have air conditioning.</p>

<p>The system runs quieter and cooler running games off a HDD. Not having the game disc in there spinning at 10,000+ rpm contributes to less heat being generated. The HDD will constantly spin at the same speed regardless of whether it's used or not, and reading
 off it isn't going to generate substantial heat. I always install my games before playing them even the first time.</p>

<p>One explanation is that in games that use a lot of content streaming assets can be accessed far faster from the hard drive than the DVD Rom. Since most of the textures in games are compressed along with other assets the CPU and GPU have higher constant work
 load decompressing them. Also once those are decompressed and loaded it puts more strain on the system to render the game. Just a guess since the 360 always runs hot and accurate measurement is practically impossible unless you pull the thing apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would always recommend installing games if you can the benefits are very noticeable and improve many things.</p>

<p>The system does not run hotter if you install your games to the hard drive.&nbsp; I don't know what give you that idea, but you don't need to worry about it.&nbsp; You're more likely to suffer a DVD failure than than a general hardware fault with the latest models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been running all of my games from my hard drive for the last two years without issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing your games means that the DVD drive won't be utilised as much, saving wear and tear on the drive motor and the laser.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently purchased Dishonored on xbox live and the first time i tried to download it the download got to 12% and then I got a message saying, "can't download Dishonored". I've tried all the suggested methods for resolving this issue. I have changed internet
 connections, restarted my console, cleared the system cache, etc. This problem has been going on for over 12 hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> davidk03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virtual keyboard Login to windows 10 only method allowed on a standrd laptop</h2>
                    <p>Running a Dell inspiron 11 3000 laptop, 4 months old, standard startup login (uid and password using the keyboard) with win 8.1 was OK.&nbsp; Upgraded to windows 10 and now the only way to login on startup is to:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; use the mouse to click on the virtual keyboard icon and get that virtual display up</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; enter the login detail</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; the laptop keyboard is enabled when the login occurs.</p>
<p>Clearly nothing wrong with the hardware, just a quirk of a new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How irritating, not to say illogical.&nbsp; User is quite pissed off.</p>
<p>What toggle on the startup display, or in the system config,&nbsp; will enable the real keyboard for a standard user identity login using that keyboard?&nbsp; Just like it used to be.</p>

            <p>Hi Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; yes, after login using the virtual keyboard (a querty image displayed on the screen when the virtual keyboard icon is clicked using the mouse, and then operated by 'touch'), the actual laptop keyboard is enabled and operates normally with installed applications,
 even windows.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It's a laptop - using another keyboard is pretty hard.&nbsp; Plugin via a usb slot? Maybe, but if the built in one doesn't work in the start-login phase I see no reason to expect an external/usb-connected one would.&nbsp; It's not as if the physical keyboard itself
 is failed - the OS just doesn't recognise it during start-login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really is a software issue.&nbsp; I have struck it in other apps, most recently the firefox UI for version 39 or later, whereby the developer is trying to present a common UI for every device - PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone etc, so the available image space
 on small devices is not used by mundane things like menus and tool bars.&nbsp; Crazy, and it drives faithful users nuts.&nbsp; No programmer or marketer has apparently thought to require a device specific face when the code is installed. The method is an icon toggle:&nbsp;
 click it once - no menus etc, click it again, menus tool bars etc displayed.&nbsp; In this instance, MS is trying to do the same thing:&nbsp; a common UI across radically different devices.&nbsp; And likely to have the same problems. A toggle would enable either the actual
 keyboard or a virtual one (eg, if installed on a device that had no real keyboard).&nbsp; How that happened with an update from win 8 to win 10 is worthy of referral to the development group.&nbsp; And thus the question I originally posed:&nbsp; is there a toggle to switch
 the real keyboard back on during startup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard driver update?&nbsp; Why, since it works fine when the OS lets it.&nbsp; What needs updating is the OS.&nbsp; Reversion to win 8 is possible, maybe even probable.&nbsp; Since this seems to not be in your script and the device is still under warranty, it'll go back
 to Dell to fix.</p>

            Hi  ziaddoueiri, please try the following fix, depending on the Edition of Windows 10 you are running . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Pro:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type gpedit.msc and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />Go to Computer Configuration - Administrative Templates - Windows Components 
<br />
<br />Scroll down and right-click on Data Collection and Preview Builds 
<br />
<br />Double-click on Allow Telemetry in the right pane 
<br />
<br />Check the option - Enabled and choose 3 - Full from the drop-down
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Now undo this change again:
<br />
<br />Double click on Allow Telemetry on the right pane 
<br />
<br />Set to Not Configured
<br />
<br />Then click OK to save settings 
<br />
<br />You should see that the message is now gone
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Home:
<br />
<br />Boot into BIOS (Usually F2 or Del on the Manufacturers logo screen when your system starts 
<br />
<br />Turn off Secure Boot in BIOS (UEFI) settings 
<br />
<br />Check to see if this resolves this issue, if not turn Secure Boot back on . . .

            <p>Well, just for the crack, I did what I suggested above and found the folder immediately... C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows NT\MSFax\SentItems</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it didn't work for you.</p>
<p>As for your complaint about importing/converting, I am not able to dictate to any software manufacturer about making their products compatible with alternate products. Also, for anyone to write a converter it has to be economically viable.</p>
<p>With regard to your comments about individuals and businesses relying on fax technology, I cannot say what the timescale will be but, IMO change will be forced, why not just go with the flow? Do you think companies will go on making fax machines or even
 anlogue modems for ever?</p>

<h3> stephen-c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista OEM Reinstall &#40;Packard Bell&#41; without original CD</h2>
                    I've had my machine for about 5-6 years now, it's running <span style="font-style: italic">
vista home premium</span> and is an <span style="font-style: italic">oem version</span>. I bought it from PC World and it is a
<span style="font-style: italic">Packard Bell</span> machine.<br />
<br />
I wasn't given a CD when I bought the machine and never had any prompt to make a disc when I first turned it on, nor did I know I had to. Looking back I really should have asked. So now my machine is bogged down from the years of use and I'm wanting to do a
 fresh reinstall so I have a nice, fresh and faster windows to use. The only thing that has changed within my machine is my
<span style="font-style: italic">graphics card</span>.<br />
<br />
So here is the question, a few of my friends <span style="font-style: italic">(one of which works for the council as a technician)</span> claims that if I get an
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">oem copy of my exact windows version</span>, that the oem key that I have
<span style="font-style: italic">(on the side of the machine case)</span> will work and I will be able to do this, but to be on the safe side as I don't want a machine that I can't use, so I phoned packard bell and the person on the phone said that it'll not
 work and that I'll need to buy a recovery CD from them for £50 (ouch), the thing is that I don't want to "recover", I want to fully reinstall. And I'm not exactly trusting the person from packard bell as I suspect he just wants me to spend money that I might
 not need to.<br />
<br />
So, which one is actually correct? And is it possible to do an install on an external USB drive so I can test if it works before doing it on my actual main drive for safety?

            <p>Hello Stephen-C</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you saying that you have an un-named partition of 8GB and then a C: partition which contains your operating system? If this is the case, regardless of whether it says you have 100% free space (my recovery partition is 18GB (Windows 7) and it also say's
 that the drive is empty, but it isn't) the files are obviously hidden. I suggest you try booting your machine and pressing F11 (I think) to see if it brings up a menu to restore your system back to factory conditions.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances the manufacturer, in their user guide, usually recommend creating recovery disks as soon as you start using the PC. Some people do this, other don't. If you are unable to use the recovery partition by press F11 on booting your
 machine the only other option is to obtain the recovery disks from Packard Bell.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 update error message</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following error message when I go windows update in settings -</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your device is at risk because it’s out of date and missing important security and quality updates. Let’s get you back on track so Windows can run more securely. Select this button to get going:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a nuisance, but does not seem to stop me getting quality updates, the latest installed was&nbsp;&nbsp;(KB4486458) recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to defer Feature updates some time ago, as the big fall update 1709 will not install on my HP probook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the quality updates are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just a nuisance, can you advise me what to do. I have tried to clear the update cache, but couldnt do this.</p>
<p>I am a bit of a novice at this sort of thing.</p>
<p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please run Windows Update troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

<p>Windows update 1709 will not work on my hp laptop , I have spent so many hours trying to do it, and it just will not work.&nbsp; So I used to defer quality updates by using advanced options in settings, but the buttons for current branch and number of days is
 now greyed out.&nbsp; So I cannot get any updates without risking my computer being tied up for up to 9 hours at a time for no reward!. I would like to be able to get security updates at least.&nbsp;</p>
