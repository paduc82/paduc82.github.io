<h2>            how do I find and remove a javascript virus&#63;</h2>
                    I have an issue with my computer using CPU and increasing amounts of memory. Resource monitor shows it was accessing the internet even though I did not start internet explorer. I have tried many things, including a re-install of windows and the problem
 did not go away. I eventually noticed that it was loading the Jscript9.dll. I temporarily moved this file to the Recycle bin and after a reboot the memory and CPU symptoms are gone. This is not a good permanent solution since it effectively disables Java on
 my computer. I have to assume this is some sort of&nbsp;javascript malware that is infecting my machine.&nbsp;A search shows thousands of .js files on my computer. I don't want to delete all these files since I'm sure&nbsp;many of them are legitimate and useful.&nbsp;I only have
 Microsoft security essentials as a virus tool.&nbsp;A deep scan does not find any malware. How can I find the problem and remove it?&nbsp;

            Rrrgh. &nbsp;I just bumped into this problem as well after trying to save 2 days of project work. &nbsp;Thankfully, I believe that I found a work around:
<div><br />
<div>1.<span> </span>Select, "Save As..."</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>For Format, select "Excel 97-2004 Workbook (.xls)"</div>
<div>3.<span> </span>cross fingers, then select, "Save"</div>

            <p>I've read this thread with great interest. Thanks everyone for all your insights. I'd like to share my experiences and solution in hopes that it will work for others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a rather elaborate project dashboard workbook from chandoo.org. The workbook (.xlsm) requires macros and VBA, has multiple sheets (some protected), and clearly lets you know if Macros are disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began entering my data into this workbook using a 2008 MacPro running OS X 10.6.8 and Excel 14.4.1. No problems there. The file is living in a DropBox folder that is shared among 3 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went home and opened my Mavericks-running (10.9.2) i7 MacBook Pro with the same Excel version. I opened the same file from my DropBox folder, clicked the enable macros button, and entered some data. When I tried to save the document, I received the dreaded
 "Document not saved" message. I noted that a temporary file briefly appeared in the destination folder when I attempted a "save as.." but the error still appeared. Using the save as .xls option wasn't an option for this document. I tried .xlsb with the same
 "not saved" result. I have no oddities in how my permissions are set on my drive and no naughty file names, excepting a hyphen in the root drive's name. Since I also have a hyphen in the name of my 10.6.8 drive, I gave that a very low causal score.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then opened the file on my 3rd machine (via DropBox), also running 10.9.2 and the same version of Excel. With no apparent problems, I ruled out a 10.9.2 incompatibility as the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to my misbehaving MacBook Pro, I copied the file to /Users/Shared/ and opened it using a fresh user account. The problem persisted, so I focused my attention on items outside my own home folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noted these additional odd behaviors on the troublesome system: The workbook was alerting me that Macros were NOT enabled; Opening the VBA interface caused Excel to CRASH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on these observations, I removed Office 2011 by PARTIALLY following this guide:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to completely remove Office for Mac 2011</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I skipped any steps that involved removing items that resided in my user home folder, or made reference to removing licensing components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then reinstalled Office from my original media and manually applied updates to the latest version (vs. launching an Office app and running the auto-updater).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I launched Excel, answered the initial setup questions, and opened my shiny project dashboard file. Fingers-crossed, I hit "Save." Boo Yaa, in 'yo face, point for me (it saved successfully). Opening the VBA interface works now too, and the workbook
 no longer complains about macros not being enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this MacBook Pro was setup via Migration Assistant from the 10.6.8 laptop it replaced. It was originally 10.7 and was upgraded in place to 10.9. I have to wonder if this "avoid the effort of a clean install" process broke or lost an Office component
 along the way. Alternatively, perhaps by not installing Office within 10.9 caused some component to be 'blacklisted' by Mavericks' sandboxing and protections mechanisms. Whatever, it works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure hope this isn't a fluke fix and that others will benefit. Best of luck.</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 documents&#58; number of pages increases when opened with earlier versions.</h2>
                    I created a 64 page document using Word 2013 which I saved and sent to a friend as an email attachment. My friend has Word 2010 installed on his computer, when he opened my document it was 70 pages with a bit of tweaking he was able to get it back to 64
 pages.<br />
<br />
If I save the same document in Word 97-2003 format or RTF format it saves in both cases as 71 pages.<br />
<br />
What is causing the problem or is there a master plan by Microsoft to drive people insane!<br />

It is rare for a lengthy Word document to appear the same on two different computers. Use of manual page breaks and blank paragraphs will amplify differences.<br />

            There are a few reasons.<br />
<br />
First of all, those 2 versions use different "rendering engines", the underlying code used to display the document, so there are minor differences how characters are displayed.&nbsp; This sometimes causes a word at the end of a line to move to the next line.&nbsp; These
 extra lines are sometime enough to push the last line on the page to a new page.&nbsp; As Charles said, if you use manual page breaks, then these "new pages" may only have one or 2 lines.<br />
<br />
The only way to ensure that a document is viewed on 2 computers with exactly the same layout is to use a static format like PDF or XPS. Of course, then the file is no longer editable.
<br />
<br />
The insanity is not part of any master plan, just a happy happenstance. <br />

<h2>            How to disconnect my two email addresses</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a few years ago I decided to connect my university email to my personal email. My university email uses outlook and my personal email is a hotmail account. I am not exactly sure how I did it but I think I used email fetching through POP (?),
 not forwarding or adding an alias. But now I want to stop this and I can't find a way even though it sounds like such a simple task. I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my hotmail account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Settings - options - your email accounts - there's nothing there, no indication of the other email account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email forwarding - Still nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>POP is enabled, but I need this for my phone email right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my uni email (outlook 365)</p>
<p>Settings - options - other (to go to the earlier version) - account - connected accounts. There it allows me to change my default reply address and it shows both of my emails but no option to remove one!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions! What am I missing?</p>

<h2>            Excel 2010&#43;Pivot Table&#43;External Data&#43;Slicer Refresh</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm on Excel 2010</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm downloading data from an external source into a separate worksheet (RawData)&nbsp;in&nbsp;a workbook.&nbsp;The external data is&nbsp;a SharePoint list. The sharepoint list data that is downloaded into the RawData worksheet reflects the security on the sharepoint list i.e.
 thus there may be 100 items, yet if security wise you can only see 10 in SharePoint itself, that's what you see on the RawData worksheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data refreshes when the spreadsheet opens up automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then go to the Data Tab&gt;Refresh All. This updates my pivot tables, but it doesn't seem to update&nbsp;the slicers connected to the pivot table</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I right click refresh on the slicer, it doesn't update to reflect the downloaded data.&nbsp; It seems to reflect all the possible data in the SharePoint list</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that happens is that my slicers are filtered so that&nbsp;I can only use the filters that I have access to, based on the RawData. Yet, why would is show even if disabled items that I don't have access to.&nbsp; i.e. RawData Employee Name X, I have access to I
 can filter on that Name, yet I also see EmployeeName Y, yest it's disabled and the RawData doesn't have EmployeeName y anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sharing this workbook with lots of people. I know they will panic that people could see data that they shouldn't have access to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I refresh my slicers automatically and I'm guessing, after my RawData has been refreshed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

    <title>Weird blurry misaligned widgets on the homescreen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alwayshungry---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird blurry misaligned widgets on the homescreen</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having issues with my widgets on the homescreen. For some reason, any widget that pulls data and requires refreshing, such as Battery Monitor and Accuweather, will become blurry and misaligned. Anyone else having this issue? I've attached some screenshots.
 I have no idea how to fix this problem. I'm not sure if it's some other program conflicting with them or what. I'm also updated to the latest firmware, PR 1.1, and I still have the same problem. This occurred around the same time I installed
<strong>F-Secure Mobile Security</strong>, but I'm not sure if that's the root of the problem and I have since removed that program. I'm not sure if there are any other lingering files from the installation that I'm not aware of. And also, I've tried the 8
 sec reset, reinstalling the widgets, etc etc and nothing works. I'm more than willing to bet it's some sort of conflict with some lingering file from
<strong>F-Secure Mobile Security </strong>although I'm not certain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: In the first screen shot, the text in the Accuweather widget is blurred and the picture of the disconnected cell tower on the bottom right corner of the widget is cut off - you can't see the entire cell tower. In the second screenshot, the battery
 monitor is off center to the right and down. It is not centered in the middle of the widget box and the text is slightly blurry and not as crisp as other text on the homescreen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The widgets are still functional. It's just annoying that the text is blurry, not crisp, and is off center! Ahh!</p>

Use Find and Replace and click the More button and then with the selection in the Find what control, click&nbsp;on Format and then on Font and check the box for Strikethrough and then back in the Find and Replace dialog, click on Replace All.&nbsp; There is no need to

    <title>Getting 4625 security errors on server after installing Security - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcbsys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting 4625 security errors on server after installing Security Essentials on desktops</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; I have <u><em>not</em> </u>installed MSE on a server.</p>
<p>I <em><u>did</u></em> install MSE on several desktops in a small business environment. After that, I started getting errors on a server on the same network.</p>
<p>So this question is about MSE on desktops generating errors on a server. </p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>- One Hyper-V host running Server 2008 R2, not joined to domain.</p>
<p>- Hyper-V guest running Server 2008 R2. Acts as domain controller.</p>
<p>- Several Windows 7 SP1 desktops joined to domain.</p>
<p>Recently I installed Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) on the Windows 7 desktops. MSE does a scheduled scan once a day or once a week.
</p>
<p>Every time MSE runs a scan on the desktop, I see hundreds of 4625 errors in the Security event log on the Hyper-V host server (example below). The errors on the server only happen when the desktop does an MSE scan. If the desktop only scans once a week,
 the errors on the server only occur once a week. There are no errors on the desktop.</p>
<p>The errors show repeated attempts by the desktop to establish a NetBIOS connection to the Hyper-V server. (The errors show high Source Port numbers like 50351, but from a Wireshark capture, they are targeting port 445.) It looks like the desktop is trying
 to establish a connection as a domain client but it cannot because the Hyper-V server is not in the domain.</p>
<p>Why is MSE on a desktop trying to connect to a non-domain-joined server on the network?&nbsp; Can I stop it?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            The registry key change does seem to have stopped the network probe from the one machine where I implemented it. I will deploy the registry change to all machines via group policy to confirm.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this was somehow related to the Network Inspection System (last feature listed
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/security_essentials/FeaturesBenefits.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>). That sounds to me like inspecting traffic on the NIC, not scanning network files.<br />
<br />
Here for reference is the registry change from the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/how-can-i-exclude-mapped-network-drive-in-security/5c90c46c-f71d-495c-b967-a0264771144e">
other thread</a>, edited for clarity:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit, then navigate to this key:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware\Scan<br />
<br />
[You may have to change the permissions on the key by taking the ownership of the key from advanced tab, then give write permissions to yourself]<br />
<br />
Create a new DWord value (right click &gt; New DWord value):<br />
<br />
Set the name to be DisableScanningNetworkFiles<br />
Set the value to be 1<br />
<br />
So the key should look like this:<br />
<br />
DisableScanningNetworkFiles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_DWORD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000001 (1)<br />

                    <p>I had to add hotmail.com email address to Outlook.com account because an incorrect email was put into Microsoft Account on windows phone (Lumia 530) and everytime I went to change the email address the following screen said there was an error and to try
 later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So by adding the correct hotmail email address to Outlook,&nbsp; and checking off contacts to sync, it seems my contacts should be in my Microsoft account but I can't seem to locate it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To check account on your phone go to Settings -&gt; email+accounts-&gt; Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then sign in with that account &nbsp;to <a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://contacts.live.com</a> page and check if you see them there.</p>

<p>My update to new builds under new system has changed for the better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online process:</p>
<p>I now let the update come to my pc. Before when I heard there was new build release I would keep clicking Windows update button to get new release started. I find now maybe hour or two after I hear there is new release I check Windows Update settings page
 to find that update process has already started. I de-authorize my itunes acct. I generally surf on web while online process is taking place. Listen to some music via VLC app. But I do stop all machine activity when new release install process starts. So to
 follow Jason suggestion I will discontinue that practice and use my pc until I get that notice "Windows Update Ready to Install"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Offline Process:</p>
<p>I do believe it is slightly faster than under previous system but really not so much. Its no 10-15 min. faster. I do think restart &amp; continue process goes smoother. (not long periods of nothing but green screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have checked that option to get reminder that restart will begin in Settings-Windows Update-Restart Options</p>

<p>And now I have, at least the part about the upgrade being that slower. I don't think you'll find me a fanatic webcast follower but I do very much like the fact that Jason[MS] posted it smack bang in the FH. Good on Jason[MS] Indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, the facts and reasoning's are not all that unexpected and to be honest, I'm fine with it, but yes, an upgrade-at-full-power option (for Insiders only) sounds good to me.</p>

                    <p>About six to eight weeks ago I updated my Zune software.&nbsp; Ever since that update, every time I connect my Zune (30GB), I have to enter the password in order to get the sync to start.&nbsp; Occasionally, the Zune software will also require me to sign in before
 it will download some of my podcasts.&nbsp; This is a new behavior as well but I haven't figured out why it does this only occasionally.</p>

<h2>            Excel xlsm file stops with 1004 error and restarts as xlsb file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote an application for the King card game in Excel with VBA.</p>
<p>In this application you can play 3 rounds of the same game.</p>
<p>In the first round everything goes OK, in the second round the program closes without any message and restarts automatically as an xlsb file.</p>
<p>This xlsb file says somethin like "Recovery mode" between parentheses in the title bar (I have&nbsp;the Dutch version of Office).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run this in debug mode I receive the error 1004 saying something like: "Method Range of object_Worksheet failed".</p>
<p>In the pop-up of this error I can only end the program,&nbsp;clicking the button to go to the&nbsp;VBA coding does nothing, it simply close the program and restarts it as&nbsp;an xlsb&nbsp;file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that for the second round the program uses exact the same coding as for the first round.</p>
<p>The error also occurs not always at the same time but it occurs always somewhere&nbsp;during the second round.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the 64-bit version of Office 2016.</p>
<p>I did quite some programming for this application.</p>
<p>Is there a way to "clean" the Excel file, something like Decompile in Access?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            No and that would not help.
<br />
<br />The most reason for such errors is the use of SELECT, SELECTION, ACTIVECELL, which is slow and error prone. Always refer to the objects directly.

    <title>N-95 &#47; Navman S90i SMS Sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> szer0  say:</h3>
<h2>            N-95 &#47; Navman S90i SMS Sync</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
Is there anyway that Nokia PC Suite allows for direct SMS Transfers to the PC (and what software, other than PC Suite) is needed.<br />
<br />
My Navman displays everything except the SMS Messages and I don't like driving and looking at my phone at the same time, hence 1/4 of the reason I chose to get a Bluetooth GPS.<br />
<br />
I know GPS aren't what you do, but I have a feeling it has something to do with the PC Suite Sync options on the N95 itself, as I can see it has SMS / Messages, but I can't seem to activate it (And i'm 99% sure that's where the Navman grabs the phonebook and
 all related data from).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance<br />
<br />

            <p>Thanks PFurches, I did try your suggestion, but renaming that file to v32.cab did not help in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to resolve the error code 30029-27&nbsp;by setting the update path (within my XML config files) to the default Microsoft Click-to-Run source.&nbsp; (which in my case was
\\my_server\my_clicktorun_source)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards!</p>
<p>--</p>

    <title>Dialing extensions on Windows Mobile 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod macpherson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dialing extensions on Windows Mobile 10</h2>
                    <p>i understand how to add pauses to phone numbers with extensions in the contacts list, but if I search for a contact in the Global Address List &nbsp;in AD and it comes back with just the extension the phone should have a setting somewhere where I can define the
 corporate phone # to dial before the extension. &nbsp;I cannot find where to set that on Windows Mobile 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I search the GAL and find a fellow employee it shows me the 4 digit extension, but I can't just click on it to dial because it will just dial the 4 digits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I set the default phone number to dial if only 4 digits are stored in the GAL?</p>

    <title>Most recent Windows Insider Program messed up my license, now wants - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farmall.dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Most recent Windows Insider Program messed up my license, now wants license key for Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been an "Insider" for a LONG time. I've installed several advanced versions. This most recent one, a few days ago, somehow messed up my licensing. My PC has ALWAYS had&nbsp; the Pro version of the OS, even before I was an "Insider". It came pre-installed.
 So, I logged on this afternoon and see a warning that I need to activate my OS. Strange. I tried to activate it and got a message that I was trying to upgrade FROM Home to the PRO Insider version. That I needed to either roll back to the Home version or buy
 a valid license. Huh?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I thought, no problem. I'll just do a system restore back to before the recent upgrade since that's the most likely cause. To my shock and horror, I find System Protection TURNED OFF!! I am absolutely certain I had it set on, I rely on that feature from
 time to time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm stuck. The only option I have is to do a fork lift reinstall of the original OS, which in itself is iffy. It's on a disk somewhere, and I THINK the key is on a sticker on the bottom. (I'm not near it presently to check). I'm hoping this is not an
 isolated incident and there is a quick and easy solution so I don't have to go down that road.&nbsp;</p>

            Found the answer to the license issue. Not sure about the System Protection issue though. Did one of the updates dork that? Anyone else see that happening?
