<h2>            Cannot use email to search for Skype members</h2>
                    <p>I found one posting about this from six months ago and it doesn't seem to be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update in December for Mac (v8.20.0.9), I cannot use email addresses to look up Skype contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one case, I looked up the contact via name (because she had a very unusual name I could find her). I looked at her email on her profile, then did a second search using just the email. Nope. I get the "cannot find. Invite to Skype."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So very aggravating that this function isn't working and hasn't worked for the last half year, apparently. I don't need to add Skype contacts frequently, but when I do, I need to do it right away because other methods of communication have broken down.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello EdieSellers, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If you are unable to search using the email address, it is possible that she has used a different email address in registering for the said Skype account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is also possible that her <strong>Account Discoverability settings</strong> is unticked. This function will either prevent or allow people from searching one‚Äôs account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can have her check her Discoverability settings: </span><a href="https://secure.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Sign in to Skype</span></span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">. &gt; Click

<h2>            Windows 10 Compatibility installation problem</h2>
                    <p>I am using a&nbsp;USB flash drive to install the windows 10 technical preview, however when I boot using it&nbsp;and I begin the installation I have a problem. Right after clicking&nbsp;the "upgrade" installation option&nbsp;I get an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It says; Compatibility report: The computer started using the windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer so that windows starts normally. Then, insert the installation media and restart the upgrade. (Do not select
 Icustom [advanced] to perform an upgrade Icustom [advanced] installs a new copy of windows and deletes your programs and settings.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what to do, should I try the other installation option "custom"???????</p>
<p>If you need other information just ask.</p>

            <p>DouglasBedell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct this issue you will have to complete the upgrade within your current Operation System.</p>
<p>to complete the upgrade you will have to restart your computer leaving the USB connected.</p>
<p>Once your device has rebooted navigate to This PC and you should see your USB device as Removable Storage. Within your Removable Device you should see setup.exe. Launch this executable then complete the upgrade. This should resolve your issue. Let me know
 how you go.</p>

<p>I can't technically explain why but many are reporting that some AVs were determined to be the root cause. Once removed, they were able to complete the installation. Here's are examples from a win 8 thread that should apply to win 10 as well:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/we-cant-tell-if-your-pc-is-ready-to-continue/e9027fb1-13e8-41d7-8e28-e12a9cc1c010?page=1">We can't tell if your pc is ready to continue installing Windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Googling the issue yourself may yield other things to try since it has cropped up during other Winx installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>PS: The naming of your USB drive looks OK as that is done by the program you used to convert the ISO to a bootable USB application. I assume you downloaded your ISO from here:</p>

            It's actually really simple. Do custom installation and delete your hard drive you're installing win 10 to install to. It will reappear then you can install :)

<p>Hi Nikita_3496,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update and glad to know you can save the document to a different location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding you still cannot save the document to the folder you want, we suggest you try the followings:</p>
<p>1.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your Mac in safe mode</a>.</p>
<p>2.Reopen the document and save it to the folder you want, then close the document, see if it still asks if you want to save. If it asks, click<span style="font-weight: bold"> Save</span>, then check
 if you can save and close the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Disclaimer: Microsoft provides no assurances and/or warranties, implied or otherwise, and is not responsible for the information you receive from the third-party linked

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we'd like to confirm the following information for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.Where is the folder which you want the document saved in? In local location on your Mac(the
<strong>Document</strong> folder?) or in OneDrive for business/personal OneDrive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Based on your description, you can save the document to the folder at the first time. While when you close the document, the message appears and asks if you want to save the document, although you
 click <span style="font-weight: bold">Save</span>, the message still appears.</p>
<p>If there is something misunderstood, please feel free to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Does the issue happen to other documents? Please create a new document and check if you can save it to the folder you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Excel Crashes When Sorting</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem with Excel in Office 2013. Any time I tried to sort data, in any document, it would crash. I checked for compatibility issues with Add-Ins. I ran a full online Office repair. Neither worked, so I deinstalled Office 2013 and upgraded yesterday
 to Office 2016. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still have the same problem with Office 2016. Again, no Add-In compatibility issues. The only anti-virus software I have on my computer (and have always had) is Windows Defender. Excel continues to work in Safe Mode (as it did under Office 2013),
 but I am reluctant to use this for heavy data analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise how to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating your Windows to Version 1705 (Build 8201.2075) will fix the random crashing in any Office 2016 application. To isolate your concern about Excel, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Windows build and version are you using? Type <strong>winver </strong>in the search bar and press
<strong>Enter </strong>to find out.</li><li>Is your Office updated? You may open <strong>Excel </strong>&gt; <strong>File </strong>
&gt; <strong>Account </strong>&gt; <strong>Update options</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong>.</li><li>Have you <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">run the Office Configuration Analyzer Tool</a></strong> (OffCAT)? It will provide a detailed report for any Office issues.</li></ul>
<p><span><span>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good to hear from you! </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I am using Windows 10 Build 15063.483 and Version 1703. However, after updating Office under 'Account' in Excel it says Version 1707, Build 8326.2059 (yet it remains Version 1703 using the winver prompt);</li><li>Yes, Office is updated yet the problem persists;</li><li>I hadn't run it previously, but I installed the programme and ran a scan for Excel. I've uploaded a screenshot of the report below. Hoping this might mean something...<br />

<h2>            Using a literal quotation mark text and formula in same cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am trying to create an excel cell that includes a value from a previous cell and a text with literal quotations</p>
<p>
</p><p>something like this: 4000-5"x7"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The " is referring to inches. The 4000 is the value from another cell (A1). The dash is designating the measurement size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried =(A1)&amp;"-"&amp;5"x7"" but excel would not allow that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense. Please help if you can!</p>

<h2>            Synchronizing outlook notes with Atom notes</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to take my notes in atom using markdown. The only problem is that it can be a pain to access those notes on my phone. I was wondering if it is possible to automatically synchronize notes I take in markdown with outlook notes? I tried to look for a
 solution but could not find any useful information anywhere. If anyone can put it me on the right track with the right piece of script/code or any other solutions I'd really appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I am using outlook for mac.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello denizalpg√∂kta≈ü,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understanding that you want to synchronize the notes in Atom within Outlook for Mac client, right? Based on my experience, only the notes for the Exchange accounts will synchronize in the Outlook clients, because the data is stored on the Exchange server.
 It depends on the mail server. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do need to sync the Atom notes in Outlook for Mac client, or look for a script to import the notes, it is suggested to use the

    <title>Garbled email attached to old message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neillomas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Garbled email attached to old message</h2>
                    <p>I noticed this morning, Outlook 2010 was reporting a new message in my "Abe Books" folder. There was nothing there for today's date, so I scrolled down and found a new message dated 14th May. When I opened it, it was a message I had received that date but,
 attached to it, was a long message from Amazon. This was shown complete with message headers and with all images shown as long strings of text characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received another email from Amazon which has been placed correctly in my "Amazon" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A similar problem occurred a couple of weeks ago when an incoming email was attached to one received six days earlier. When I asked the sender to send it again, the second copy was also attached to the same old email. Eventually, after deleting the original
 old email and the two corrupt copies generated, a third attempt was received successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen often enough for me to check Webmail, but the fact that the corrupted emails are attaching themselves to existing messages suggests that&nbsp;the corruption&nbsp;is not occurring with my ISP and is not caused by transmission errors.</p>
<p>Added:</p>
<p>The message from Amazon attached to the Abe Books message wasn't a new message at all - it was sent on 15th May. The new message in the Amazon folder is reported by Outlookas having been sent on 15th May but the header is shown in plain text and gives the
 date as 6th June.</p>
<p>I have now apparently received a message from Telegraph Box Office which was actually sent on 14th May and has a garbled message from Amazon sent on 15th May attached to it. This is reported by Outlook as a new message from Telegraph Box Office.</p>

            <p>I have spent 2 hours trying to find the inbox repair tool, in the hope that that would fix my problem. Who would have believed that you needed to use Word to find a program that should have been installed with Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it took about half an hour to find that there were errors in the .pst file and repair them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I restarted Outlook and immediately received an email which was garbled and attached itself to the same Telegraph Box Office message as before!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now deleted that message and its (now) two corrupt copies, but I still don't know what is going on.</p>

            <p>This is a known issue for an IMAP account in Outlook 2010 but was fixed ages ago. Check whether you have applied all updates for Outlook 2010 already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least, you should have Service Pack 2 installed.<br />
See: <a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/580" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Permanent Link to How to check the Service Pack level in Office 2010">

<p>
</p><p>If so, specify which mail account type you are using and whether you are using a local installation of Outlook 2010 or a Click-to-Run installation. Your search for scanpst.exe via Word leads me to believe that you are using a Click-to-Run installation.</p>

            <p>Yes, I have a Click-to-Run installation, although I didn't know this when I bought it! I didn't even know what Click-to-Run was. The PC (a few years old now) originally came with a 60-day trial version of Office 2003 (I think), and I bought and installed
 Office 2010 a few days later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;Click-to-Run version is 14.0.7122.5000 and the Outlook version 14.0.7116.5000 (32-bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 7 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>All updates are applied automatically</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account type is POP3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received a further 2 messages which have attached themselves to different pre-existing messages in different folders, both dated mid-May. I can't see who sent them but the content suggests they were sent by the same person, which isn't the same as
 any of the previously-corrupted messages I have received.</p>

            <p>I deleted a large number of old messages and those dated between 14th and 16th May and compacted the pst file. That seemed to fix the problem for about 9 days then it occurred again. Apparently I had missed one dated 14th May and two incoming emails attached
 themselves to that. I deleted them and&nbsp;another load of&nbsp;old messages and ran scanpst.exe again, which reported insignificant problems and said it was optional to fix them. I did let it fix them and everything seems to be working again now.</p>
<p>I know earlier versions of Outlook corrupted the pst file when it exceeded 2GB, but I thought this had been fixed in Outlook 2010. Perhaps it merely let the pst file get a bit bigger before corrupting it - mine had reached about 2.6 GB and is now down to
 2.3 GB.</p>
<p>But I don't understand the fixation on 14th May.</p>

            <p>It's happening again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received two emails this morning, both attached to the same old email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That old email is one which I deleted weeks ago - permanently. It doesn't exist! But for the record, it was dated 14th May 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have again run scanpst, which said there were only minor inconsistencies, but I let it fix them anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Email.pst file is below 1 GB, so it can't be the size that is the problem. I don't understand what is special about 14th May and how it is finding emails that have been deleted and the pst file compacted.</p>

<h2>            Text Timestamp is wrong on my HTC Touch 2</h2>
                    
<p>Hello<br />
<br />
I have an HTC Touch 2 (Windows&nbsp;Phone 6.5)&nbsp;that I use on Fido. Unfortunately all my incoming text messages have wrong timestamp on them which makes the conversations hard to follow<br />
I remember someone suggesting a program or registry hack to fix this issue<br />
<br />
Any help please?<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>

            So if a message is sent to you, what is the timestamp you get?<br />
<br />
If you are getting the 2016 timestamp, then this thread should help you:<br />

    <title>MS Word 2010 inconsistent tab spacing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> serkanokar  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word 2010 inconsistent tab spacing</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I created a new document (no special formatting, just default doc). I started typing a line. When I click on tab the first time, the cursor&nbsp;moves in a certain space but when I click tab for the second time, it moves much farther than it does it in the first
 instance. I checked the tab properties, they are :</p>
<p>Tab Stop Position: blank</p>
<p>Default Tab Stops: 0.5"</p>
<p>Alignment: left</p>
<p>Leader 1-None</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I moved from one tab location to the other I checked those settings again and they seem to be the same. I can't figure out why it changes in that second instance, why it jumps farther than it does in the first instance. Also, it seems to follow the same
 space after the 2nd instance (so it's only the first tab spacing that is different). I don't have any settings on my ruler either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain why it is behaving that way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>From what you're describing, Word is behaving normally. That first jump is from
<em>the end of your current line </em>(the last character typed) to the <em>next </em>
default tab stop. So assume you typed a line such as "A quick tab test" in 10-point Arial (but leave out the quotes).&nbsp; That line is about 0.94 inch long. If you're at the end of that line and press the tab key, the first default tab (at 0.5 inch) will be ignored
 because you're already past it. The cursor will instead jump to the <em>next </em>
tab stop at 1.0 inch, traveling a distance of just 0.06 inch (from 0.94 to 1.0). The next press of the tab key will take you to the next default stop at 1.5 inches, and on each subsequent press the cursor will travel that same 0.5-inch distance to the next
 default tab stop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, if you set any tab stops yourself (in a paragraph or a whole document), they will override the default stops. So if you set tab stops at 1.25 inches and at 3.00 inches, type that same sample line ("A quick tab test"), and press tab, the first
 "jump" will be to the 1.25 tab you just set (a distance of about 0.31 inches), and the next will be to the 3.00-inch tab (a distance of 1.75 inches). After that, since you haven't set any later stops, the default tabs will once again be honored&nbsp;at every 0.5-inch
 interval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>How to change the column separator and other settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jp ronse  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change the column separator and other settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some questions about Application.International. In the following thread, the use of "\" as column separator in "other" countries was already discussed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-separator-and-when-to/b0163b3d-0226-4cad-8a1e-7a1d82614cc0">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-separator-and-when-to/b0163b3d-0226-4cad-8a1e-7a1d82614cc0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me first explain what I would like to do. I am working on an add-in which has already the option to switch between the Belgian and the International number format. (decimal &amp; thousand separator). Now, I would go a step further and change all settings
 to US or UK formats: date, time, separators, ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to map most settings in the Regional and Language options to the keys in HKEY_CURRENT_USER,"Control Panel\International" to the Application.International constants but do not find the key for xlColumnSeparator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the registry key for xlColumnSeparator</p>
<p>2. What is the US currency format</p>
<p>3. What is the UK currency format</p>
<p>4. If you know other pitfalls or have other recommendations</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            I assume that Excel derives the xlColumnSeparator setting from the xlDecimalSeparator and xlListSeparator settings.

            <p>Unfortunately I can't get the computer to clean boot, it needs to have 7 reinstalled but the discs give an incorrect media message</p>
<p>
</p><p>is that likely to be because it has 10 on it or a different problem</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the trouble it has caused. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a moder page(<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sharepoint-classic-and-modern-experiences-5725c103-505d-4a6e-9350-300d3ec7d73f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SharePoint classic and modern experiences</a>), I just tested
 in my test tenant. I added a File viewer according to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-the-file-viewer-web-part-e53a9602-e7b3-4fff-9126-de2f18d1900c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use the File viewer web part</a>&nbsp;and it
 works fine. So could you share screenshot with us?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the classic page, here are some questions we want to confirm with you first:</p>
<p>1. How did you copied the link? Select the PDF &gt; click Copy link on the top bar?</p>
<p>2. What is the web part did you add? This one?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dcdd7a8-645d-467b-9119-e5bd237f5865?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dcdd7a8-645d-467b-9119-e5bd237f5865?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>yes, what I am doing looks the same as you.&nbsp; I copied the link by going to the sharepoint document library and selecting the file and then the three little dots and "copy link".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So one issue that might derail this is that the file viewer doesn't work on mobile devices, maybe as a straight browser view but kind of defeats the purpose.&nbsp; I was looking for an easy way to view PDFs on mobile devices out in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Bigtalljv_2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-the-file-viewer-web-part-e53a9602-e7b3-4fff-9126-de2f18d1900c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">File Viewer</a></strong> looks like this in mobile devices. It's doesn't seem to be a recommended
 way to view PDF.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dcca536c-5622-45ab-836a-0184516f2625?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dcca536c-5622-45ab-836a-0184516f2625?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If you have a different situation, could you share some screenshots with us?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your purpose is to view PDFs, I think OneDrive for mobile device can do that too. Users can access SharePoint libraries in OneDrive mobile client and open PDF files. You could upload the PDF to a SharePoint library.</p>

            Yes, there are multiple options to view the PDFs on the mobile devices directly but some of them are quite large so I was trying to find a way to keep from having to download them.&nbsp; it's for an operations and maintenance manual situation, ideally I'd love
 for them to be html web pages but that a whole giant project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi&nbsp;Bigtalljv_2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that it would be a lot more friendly to end user that viewing a PDF in a webpage instead of downloading first, but currently, SharePoint does not have a good solution to this needs. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given this situation, we hope you could give feedback to SharePoint in <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint UserVoice</a>. If more and more user vote for the idea, it's more likely to get the attention of the product team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>

Did the technician or you reinstall the application?&nbsp; Was it pre-loaded when you got the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; All Programs &gt; PC Help &amp; Tools &gt; Select Recovery Manager</p>
<p>This feature will reinstall Software Programs, Hardware Drivers, and the operating system.</p>
<p>Click Next </p>
<p>Would You Like To Perform a Program Recovery, Click Yes </p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Screen Program switches and this will not reinstall drivers or the OS</p>
<p>Click Next </p>
<p>Next Screen, Select the program you wish to recover.&nbsp; Or, check The Program is not on the list.</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>The next screen requires the installation software</p>
<p>At this point you can cancel or open Programs and Features to uninstall/reinstall the software.</p>

            <p>Yes i'm serious, </p>
<p>You will be surprised how many users have finger prints on the lenses and how much a difference it makes in clarity how the pictures can look after cleaning the lens.</p>
<p>It does not always have to be a hardware issue.</p>
<p>If have tested it also my self with the phones I use for testing and have seen the difference with a dirty lens.....</p>
<p>Am also a photographer (use a range of Canon DSLRs) and clean lenses on a regular basis.</p>

            Make sure the phone OS and the apps are up-to-date. Sometimes an update, which you may have missed does wonders.

            <p>that does seem a bit daft that you can't set a default tab size in IE11. It's very odd when you open a window and the tabs at the top suddenly shrink.</p>
<p>I also run Slimbrowser and that does allow you to set a default tab size - in pixels - for the tabs. that is much better for tabbed browsing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If they can give that option, how hard could it be for Microsoft, a huge company, to get someone to sit down for a few minutes and add it to the IE 11 code?</p>

            the tabs and icons in the menu bars are too small for touch screen for those of us with large hands/fingers. using a surface pro 2. need ability to increase that region without changing main panel.

<h3> roberthsia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - IMAP emails keep disappearing after I move another email from Inbox to another folder</h2>
                    <p>Setup:</p>
<p>Outlook 2016</p>
<p>IMAP</p>
<p>Yahoo Mail</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>No filters&nbsp;on any folder in Outlook</p>
<p>Mail to keep offline: All</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example,&nbsp;I have 5 emails in my inbox.&nbsp; The inbox has subfolders.&nbsp; When I move&nbsp;email #1 from the Inbox to a subfolder,&nbsp;email #2&nbsp;in the Inbox disappears in Outlook - ie, outlook inbox now shows 3 emails .&nbsp; After some time (not consistent),&nbsp;email #2&nbsp;reappears
 in Outlook.&nbsp; When I go to yahoo.com,&nbsp;email #2&nbsp;is still in the Inbox (email #1 was filed correctly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another interesting tidbit - if I move email #2 using yahoo.com to anther subfolder, the message shows up in the proper subfolder in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS, please don't relegate me to using yahoo.com as my default email GUI - I have little faith in Marissa... :)</p>

            <p>Hi Praveen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nice try, but alas - it didn't work.&nbsp; it is still misbehaving.&nbsp; At this point, I wish I could use the old NES fix (take out the cartridge, blow on it, reinsert, power on), but something tells me that isn't going to work either.&nbsp; Perhaps MS could talk to
 the good people at Aabaco (yahoo sold their small biz email services to them).</p>
<p>

            <p>So I found one more aspect of the odd behavior...outlook 2016 "removes" the most recent email, but will go ahead and display the remaining emails in the folder.&nbsp; for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. send and receive</p>
<p>2. 4 new unread emails</p>
<p>3. read emails</p>
<p>4. send and receive</p>
<p>5. most recent <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>read</strong></span> email will disappear...outlook will only show 3 read emails</p>
<p>6. if you receive a new email now, read it, and execute a send / receive...then the email that disappeared in #5 will return and the most recently read email will now disappear</p>
<p>

    <title>How to safely break links in Powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laserray7  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to safely break links in Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>I have a powerpoint presentation in which I have copied (not linked) some visio objects. For some reason, powerpoint has created links to the original visio file for those objects. I have since deleted the objects from the visio file. Furthermore, I applied
 some animations to the powerpoint objects.</p>
<p>Now when I open the powerpoint, it asks if I want to update links. If I say update, the powerpoint slides are all messed up and don't contain the objects any more. If I say cancel, the powerpoint works fine.</p>
<p>If I try to break the links from the Links edit window, the animations I applied to the objects are lost.</p>
<p>For now, i just have changed them all to manually updated links and everything works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem is, I just hate the idea that powerpoint is linking to something that doesn't even exist anymore. Isn't there someway to remove the link without effecting anything else in the powerpoint?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            As far as I know breaking the link will always zap animation.<br />
<br />
Possible workaround is to select the animated shape, <span style="font-weight: bold">
double</span> click the animation painter, break the link and paint the animation back. Not ideal but it should work.<br />

    <title>tiny dots around the letters displayed in Internet Explorer 11 makes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            tiny dots around the letters displayed in Internet Explorer 11 makes text difficult to read</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Any web pages displayed by Internet Explorer 11 has tiny colored or black dots interspersed through the text letters, making it fuzzy and difficult to read. This issue doesn't occur in Chrome or when I'm in safe mode. I deselected the compatibility mode
 in IE 11 but it didn't help. If I&nbsp;magnify the text to ~775%&nbsp;the dots disappear and the text is clear. Pictures and logos do not show any distortion. How do I find out what is causing this issue and why would it&nbsp;only occur with IE 11?</p>
<p>
</p><p>below is an image of what text appears like in IE 11</p>

            <p>Hi Zamek, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The optional updates offered to you are design specially for your computer model and should not install anything irrelevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the driver installation was not very smooth and was causing this issue. A simple solution would have been to reinstall the driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as you were facing additional performance issues, there were chances of multiple Operating System files being corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope your new computer doesn't trouble you. If it does, we are here to help you.</p>

<h3> san_james  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Edit Form&#34; Greyed out when Form is a Copy</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am using excel forms in OneDrive for Business on Win 10. I have copied a form that I plan to use several times with just minor edits. However, when I used the "copy to" function and copy the form into a OneDrive folder the edit form function is greyed
 out. I&nbsp; don't know if it is all relevant but I can't actually see the "edit form" function on the ribbon anywhere so always have to search for it in the "tell me what to do box".</p>
<p>I can edit the original form no problem. I did notice that when I open the copied form it sometimes notifies me that Sharepoint App is currently editing this form. I have SharePoint on my smartphone but wasn't even logged into the account on it. I logged
 in then logged out and that seems to have got rid of that. Sometimes it says that I am editig the document, i.e. my name appears in the top right corner as if I was someone else, but that usually disapperas after a few seconds and then it's just me editing
 it.</p>
<p>I logged in on a different device (win 10, tablet) when logged off allother devices but still have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can give</p>
<p>

<p>Hi&nbsp; San_James,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>If you want to reuse the form template, you can go to Forms app in App Launcher &gt; find the form and hover your mouce on it &gt; click "..." &gt; Copy. You will then find an Excel created in your OneDrive for Business library.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>If you directly copy that excel file of the form, only the excel file itself gets copied but not the connected form. Therefore, you will find it not working as expected.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><br />
Thanks,<br />
Ryan<br />

<h2>            Exporting graphs in Reports from Access to Word</h2>
                    
<p>Being able to export reports to Word in Access 2007 is fantastic!&nbsp; Well done!&nbsp; But after generating some great graphs to illustrate my summary data I can't seem to get the graphs into Word (or Powerpoint).&nbsp; I have tried copy and paste with no luck!&nbsp; I need
 to do this regularly, and with a number of graphs in each report - so would prefer it automated if it's possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone know another way?</p>

<p>Sadly, you it cannot be done.</p>
<p>As Hans has pointed out, you could generate a PDF of your report and the cut sections out of the PDF and paste that into your Word reports.</p>
<p>A better alternative, IMHO, is to push to raw data into Excel and generate the charts from there.&nbsp; Then they can easily be copied.&nbsp; You can quite easily automate the whole process so everything is done at the click of a button.</p>
<p>A third option would be to check out Lebans Report Utilities (see: <a href="http://www.lebans.com/ReportUtilities.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.lebans.com/ReportUtilities.htm</a>) I have never used it yet myself, but if Stephen says it exports everything including graphics then it does!</p>

            Sad news, tho' there is ray of hope!&nbsp; Daniel, could you give me a steer in the right direction to look at automating the Excel export process.&nbsp; Is that by using macro's?&nbsp; I'll have a look at Lebans Report Utilities as well.&nbsp; Thanks again. Malcolm
