            Adobe Flash is not available for mobile phones. Not for Windows Phones. Not for iPhones. It used to be available for Android phones, but not any more. Adobe have stopped developing/delivering Flash for phones.

    <title>Grid lines missing when opening a blank worksheet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Grid lines missing  when opening a blank worksheet</h2>
                    <p>I have Excel 2010.</p>
<p>In the past, I opened a new worksheet and the grid lines for all the sheets ( 3 have been set up ), had the grid lines.</p>
<p>Recently, every time that I open a new worksheet the sheets are without grid lines, I have to go to options - advance &nbsp;and select grid line, but this works only for the sheet number where I am on, I can also do it with the &nbsp;View tool bar that has this option
 .</p>
<p>In advance options there is no way ( i cannot find it), to tell Excel that for any new worksheet and all its sheets the grid line box is selected, therefore , no need to do it every time a new worksheet is open and for each sheet.</p>
<p>How can I tell excel that grid lines must be on for any worksheet that is created?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I understand how much you want to uninstall your Outlook app. However, this issue is out of our expertise. Please contact your mobile manufacturer. They may have the best solution for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you have other clarifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Every other "normal" app simply has a remove option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone manufacturer suggests I contact the app supplier - MICROSOFT!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have written the coding for it, NOT the phone people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the inconvenience it caused you.&nbsp;If the Outlook.com app isn't visible from the list of apps installed on your device, I advise that you perform a hard reset. If you don't want to perform this action, please tap the app for about 3 seconds
 and see&nbsp;if an <strong>Uninstall</strong> option will appear. If yes, drag the app onto that option and it will be deleted from your phone. Otherwise, please provide the
<strong>make and model of your device</strong> so we can determine the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi CarrotMuseum,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back. Please confirm if the process provided by the previous moderator worked. It is by long pressing the application (not in installed apps) to where it's located in your phone (e.g your home screen) for about two or three seconds and
 see if there's an option that will show which will allow you to uninstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the application is not showing up in the installed apps, then it's possible that it's not installed or you don't have the Outlook.com application at all. You can confirm it by installing a new Outlook.com application from Google play. If you managed to
 install it, then it's possible that you don't have one installed before. You can then go to your phone's settings and under applications, search for the Outlook.com app and uninstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please post back with your findings.
</span><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We appreciate your cooperation.</span></font></p>

            To uninstall Outlook, first tap and hold it for a few seconds. A remove button will appear. Drag the icon to the remove button.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Then go into your "Apps" by pressing the center menu button on your home screen. Scroll until you see the "Outlook" icon. Hold it again for a few seconds and an "Uninstall" notification will appear. Drag it on the "Uninstall" icon. That should do it. It
 did for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can't leave this with commenting on the miserable experience that Outlook.com has been. First of all, when I deleted a message from the App, it deleted it from the server. Then any message that went to the App stopped going to my Outlook inbox on the
 computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, the sync process was erratic and the settings confusing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When will MS finally provide an easy way to sync Outlook on the computer, outlook on the outlook.com site, and on other devices such as tablets and androids. The process is mind-boggling now and for the time being, I've completely abandoned it. It even
 discouraged me from purchasing the Surface because of the lack of easy calendar, e-mail and contact synchronicity.</div>

That didn't work as the app does not appear in the Apps listing!&nbsp; Finally I totally wiped the phone which maybe a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but this just proves to me how crappy Outlook for Android is.</p>

<p>Like you, I have abandoned Outlook also on the computer.nice one Microsoft!!</p>

            <p>Outlook for Android is HORRID. I have been using it for the last 6-7 months. My issues began right off the bat with "Outlook has stopped responding errors occurring at least 5-6 times daily. The phone freezes for 5 seconds then that damn alert message comes
 up. Messed up thing is it happens even when not using outlook whatsoever. I decided to battle on and ignore these issues since at least i could keep an updated calendar on my phone syncing up all my meetings, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then last month, a shocker. I joined a new company and added a new outlook activesync account (new exchange server) Now my problem is that: I cannot remove my previous account/s.
</p>
<p>When i mark it from the accounts section and tap DELETE ACCOUNT (with all emails, etc and remove sync) nothing happens at all...I even get the message Account Removed. But it is not removed, instead it creates dupe accounts of the same one that i tried to
 delete. As it stands I now have 9 accounts which replicated themselves and i cannot remove any of them. To top it all off, the Exchange errors are way more frequent.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst coded piece of software ever created. I am left with no choice but to hard reset now.</p>

            No, not really.&nbsp; PST files are non-volatile local storage files suitable for making backups, OST files are volatile, they are tied to the email account and Outlook profile that created them, and they become orphaned and unusable if the account or Outlook
 profile are removed or damaged.&nbsp; They cannot be used for any sort of backup scheme.&nbsp; I'm curious as to your&nbsp;interest in such a conversion? Are you looking to share old PST files across multiple devices?&nbsp;

            What do you think you'd accomplish by converting a PST to an OST? If you want the data in the PST to appear in the folders the OST represents, just copy the data in the PST to the online folders.

            <p>Hal / Brian</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest. In reply to your question. Pls note that I am computer novice so look at my problem from this point of view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My service provider has changed my POP account into IMAC account. &nbsp;In the process, they wipe out half of my file reducing it from 10GB to 5GB and changing it from .pst into .ost. I have had a back up copy of the large .pst file (10GB) on my spare hard drive
 as every day I was backing my Outlook file to my outside hard drive. So you say - what is the problem ? Just copy your pst file onto online OST file in you IMAC account. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now computer novice way of thinking kicks in. pst file has .pst at the end of the name of the file. IMAC file has .ost at the end of the file. I thought that these are two completly different types of files. Therefore .pst cannot be copied into .ost file.
 My way of thinking followed the understanding from workings of other programs. One does not copy .doc ending file into say .jpg ending file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Silly but I did not try copying pst into .ost for the fear of making damage to my .ost file. Believe me, I looked on the web and there is no explanation that you can just copy .pst into .ost. Brian's answer below was the one that I was missing worrying that
 when I try to copy .pst into .ost I will damage .ost file on provider's server and end up in a total mess. Unfortunately provider's technical staff was not able to help me - perhaps because my question was so basic and somewhat unusual in &nbsp;nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still not sure if I fully understand the difference between .pst and .ost file. It seems to me that the only difference is that .pst is stored locally and .ost is stored on the provider's server. This is somewhat different to say my .doc file which
 have the same ending regardless if they are on my lap top or in a dropbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if my confirmation is clear enough. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you both for your response. I copied my .pst file into .ost file and all is OK. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Jan &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>As the other thread states, you can import (You can also copy data across)<br />
But if your provider has reduced the size allowance for the IMAP data file you obviously cannot import 10gb into 5gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can open your backup pst data file in MS Outlook, by first copying from your external to your</p>
<p>\My Documents\Outlook Files\ location on the local PC</p>
<p>You can then deal with its contents, just like any other data file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note if your provider has reduced the size allowance you are going to need to copy data from the IMAP data file set to your pst data file set, and then purge the IMAP data file to remove old deleted data

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">IMAP, not IMAC.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your service provider cannot touch anything you might have in a PST. As Hal said, the folders in a PST are local to your PC. And you can't really copy a PST to an OST, as what I said may seem to imply.
 What you can do is open the PST in Outlook so you can see its folders and the folders in the IMAP account and move messages around as you see fit so that they're in the IMAP folders or the local folders; whatever works best for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PSTs and OSTs are essentially the same type of file, but they're used for different purposes. PSTs contrain Outlook folders that reside only on your PC. OSTs contain folders that are copies of what's
 in your mailbox on the mail server. Neither PST nor OST is of any value except when opened in Outlook. hey're not human-readable files. The folders in the OST will always reflect what's on the mail service. PSTs can contain any messages you want them to contain,
 regardless of whether or not they're on the server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Listen to Palcouk about the size of your mailbox. Clearly you can't copy more into the IMAP folders that your mail provider allows. You can keep much more in PST-based folders. Keep in mind, though, if
 you lose the PST because you haven't made any copies of it, the messages in it are gone for good. If you were to lose the OST, that's no big deal because Outlook will simply create it again when it accesses the mail server.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">That's not what I said. The different file types mean that they're for different purposes. OSTs are used for account types that leave messages on the server by design (IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync, and Exchange).
 PSTs are used for local storage of items and for holding messages for POP accounts. You certainly can have OSTs and PSTs in the same Windows folder, although it's not necessary.</span></p>

</p><p>There are several fields that are used on both forms: EnrollmentStatus, ProgramType, LastName, FirstName, Advisor, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I'm having is that we use EnrollmentStatus and Advisor to filter very often. And up until a few weeks ago everything was working fine. Now, when I try to filter by EnrollmentStatus in the App Review Form I don't see the "quick filter" check boxes
 - only the text filter options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I'm seeing in the <strong>Main form</strong> when I click in the field and use "Filter" in the tool bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69917ce6-8b40-4411-9310-0cc8f1510d5b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69917ce6-8b40-4411-9310-0cc8f1510d5b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is what I see when I click in the same field on the <strong>Application Review form</strong> and hit "Filter" in the tool bar.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/217cc0fc-7ef0-4e51-90c5-092c6a8c1001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/217cc0fc-7ef0-4e51-90c5-092c6a8c1001" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is that there was no difference between the two up until, maybe, two weeks ago. Now there is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filtering on text still works but its cumbersome given the values (EnrollmentStatus is a value list field). I'd like to have the "quick filters" back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there differences in the record sources of the two forms?</p>
<p>Are there differences at the <strong>Data </strong>tab of the form properties sheets?</p>
<p>Did you try some of the checks I supposed in the previous post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you can't toggle to datasheet view in a form may just be that its property
<strong>Allow Datasheet View</strong> is set to No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sequence of creation should not matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As already suggested: If you can't find the cause of the problem you could try to create a small sample download file.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender KB2267602</h2>
                    Windows 10 pro insider. All updates have installed OK up to Windows Defender. We have made 25 attempts and all have failed. We have used trouble shooter to no avail. I think I<em> get a complete install although I can't be sure because when it finishes
 it swings right into an uninstall. Leaving a message "an update is ready for your computer". I give up. Unless someone can give me a way of installing this update besides something that is 2 years old and for WIN8., you will have to exclude me from this program.
 Trying the same thing over and over again will be a waste of time.</em>

<p>The KB2267602 is always the same for Windows Defender definitions.&nbsp; It is the numbers after it that tells you which update it is.</p>
<p>The updates are always new and there is never a Windows Defender that is 2 years old.</p>
<p>Windows Defender definitions are updated many times and can be more than once a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you doing the update?&nbsp; Usually when you check for updates in Windows Update it will automatically install and finish.</p>

    <title>Office 365, requires two logins after timeout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff alberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365, requires two logins after timeout</h2>
                    <p>After a session timeout, Office 365 Web reverts back to the login screen. When I try to login, I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(226, 41, 16, 1)">Sorry, your sign-in timed out. Please sign in again."</span></p>
<p>Another post states this is due to a cookie timeout, which is fine, I've got no problem with
 that. What I do have a problem with is having to login twice after a timeout. The app ends up at the login screen after a timeout, seems like it should allow you to login right away, and not make you login twice.</p>

            The actual login screen has a timeout, which is very low (few minutes), so it seems that both are triggering in your case.

            Hi Jeff,<br />
<br />
It is an expected behavior. <br />
<br />
I do understand it is more convenient that it is just needed to sign into for one time after it is signed out (timeout). Given the situation, we suggest you
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit feedback</a> to our related team. Customers’ valuable comments will help better our products and services.<br />

We appreciate your effort and understanding.<br />

            I'm always getting caught out by this. It's not the world's #1 problem, but it can be pretty annoying. My suggestion here would be a clientside timeout detection also, so that if, as it claims, the login screen times out it automatically shows a 'This
 login screen has timed out, please click here to refresh' message &amp; button so at least you wouldn't have to go through the rigmarole of entering your username and password for no reason.

            OK, that was somewhat helpful.&nbsp; As I understand it, when you open activesync there are NO partnerships established.<br />
<br />
Lets try and see what happens if we turn off Advanced Network Functionality.<br />
<br />
Open START/SETTINGS/Connections Tab and click on USB to PC icon<br />
<br />
Uncheck advanced Network Functionality, clickk ok the soft reset your device.<br />
<br />
Now connect and lets see if activesync starts and lets you connect

<h2>            Merging Data from Multiple Excel Forms to Master Form</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I would greatly appreciate assistance on below:</p>
<p>I have an excel form that has questions in Column A and answers in Column C. These forms will be saved individually and when saving, I would like to create a macro to pull the answers in column C and transfer to a new master spreadsheet which will&nbsp;store
 the answers from all the respective forms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more specific, the answers are in the following cells: C16:C35, C37:C45, C48:C49. Some of the answers may be blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to transfer the data to a master workbook, transposing the data starting in cell A2, B2, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I run the macro on a second form, (same cells), I would like to transfer to the master workbook in cell A3, B3, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>

    <title>Unable to save files and photos - outlook app on android device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to save files and photos - outlook app on android device</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly my outlook app won't let me save attachments to my android device (Samsung Galaxy S7)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to save a file, jpeg or pdf or other, I get a notification saying "Unable to save files and photos - Outlook needs access to storage on your device to save attachments. You can grant this permission in Settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing is, I gave the app permission to access storage on this device ages ago, and permission was still granted when I looked. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled the app and renewed it's permissions to no avail. I also restarted my device. I
 was downloading attachments just fine earlier this month.<br />
</p>
<p>Phone OS Android 7.0 (Nougat)</p>
<p>Outlook Version 2.2.88 (Updated on Jan 14, 2018)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really think it's a problem with this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: upgrading to the now available version 2.2.91 fixed it. Google Play says it was updated Jan 18 but I just got it today (Jan 22).</p>

<p>My Samsung Galaxy S8 experienced the same problem after doing upgrade of the Outlook App.&nbsp; So I suggest the problem is NOT the security settings of the phone but a problem with the Outlook upgrade.</p>

</p><p>I'm sorry but, no. I stated in my original post: I gave the app permission when I first downloaded it and everything was fine until the app updated. Nothing about my phone changed. I'm aware of how to give apps permissions on my phone, and outlook has, and
 has always had, permission to access storage.</p>

            Sadly I haven't found any yet. I did contact the support people from inside the outlook app, settings -&gt; help and feedback -&gt; contact support. Its a chat thing in the app. They couldn't help either but said they would foward the ticket. Maybe if more people
 contacted that way they would do something? Either way they were more helpful than the customer support on the forums.

            I always do repair first. I choose online repair because it says it is more indepth. I did this, this morning, still didn't work. Needed to uninstall and reinstall. I was able to get it to work. But again, this usually works for a werw or two. This has
 been happening since around Oct/Nov 2017.&nbsp;

    <title>Nokia 2730 Classic strange issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 2730 Classic strange issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a nokia 2730 classic fone that I bought in february 2011. Till yesterday morning it was working fine. In the afternoon I noticed that the fone was not responding, so I took out the battery and reinserted it to restart the fone. After that my fone
 did not show any signal for my Vodafone sim. I went to Vodafone store and got my SIM replaced. The new SIM also did not work (I could access contacts etc., but could not find a network). Manual selection of network also failed. I then tried some other network
 SIM with my phone and it worked. Also my Vodafone sim works with other fones.</p>
<p>The crux of my problem is - Vodafones SIMs (even other people's SIMs) do not show any network connectivity on my fone while all other network SIMs work fine.</p>
<p>Also since the incident I have noticed that my battery usage has increased significantly. The battery drains by itself in a matter of hours even when no SIM has been inserted in the fone but the fone is On.</p>
<p>I suspect there may have been firmware corruption but can't find the link to 2730 classic updates.</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated</p>

<p>Have you confirmed with Vodafone whether they have any issues with their Service in that particular area where you checked the signal?&nbsp;The battery MAY drain faster when the Network signal strength is poor and the phone keeps on trying to search for it..</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. I think I should clear up a few things-</p>
<p>1. Vodafone SIMs work fine with other phones in the same area (same place too). Its just my phone that does not get the network.</p>
<p>2. Other SIMs work fine with my phone.</p>
<p>3. Battery drains out irrespective of whether there is a SIM inserted or not. (I haven't checked the battery usage completely in foll. scenarios yet - i) Vodafone SIM ii) Other SIM iii) No SIM)</p>
<p>If you could provide the link to software updates for 2730classic, I would be grateful (I can't seem to find it on the site).</p>

<p>Well there's another strange thing that has happened.</p>
<p>The battery drains out even when the phone is OFF. Last night I charged the battery and switched off the phone. This morning I switched it on and it said 'Low Battery'. The battery works fine in other phones. I guess I may be looking at&nbsp; a major hardware
 and/or software problem that has cropped up from nowhere (I didn't drop the phone, didn't wet it).</p>
<p>I guess I will need to visit Nokia Care and get it sorted. Hopefully they will not dismiss it as a SIM issue.</p>
<p>But just curious if any other users have had similar troubles with their phones (irrespective of the model)</p>

 to see you here in the Nokia Support Discussions. To clarify, this issue has been happening even before installing the Lumia Cyan SW, is that right? After the last update, have you also checked if there are updates for the phone's system apps? To verify, go
 to <strong>Settings</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> swipe to <strong>applications &gt; store &gt; check for updates</strong>. BTW, you can also try doing the suggestions shown in this page:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA141396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ

            <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing the same issue. I recently purchased a Plantronics Voyager headset and it pairs with the phone fine. However, after I initiate a call, after about 30 seconds into the call, the Bluetooth disconnects. I paired my headset with other
 phone and it works well so I can eliminate the headset as being faulty. My phone is set for automatic updates. Is there anything else I can do to resolve this? Thank you in advance for any assistance that can be provided.</p>

</p>
<p>for some time I seems to not get any emails from gmail users. I have email forwarding from my own domain to my outlook.com email and it worked fine until now, when it seems to work only for non-gmail users. I think it stopped working for them when you changed
 policy for private domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>I just send couple of test emails to myself using gmail, it has been an half of hour and I don't have any errors from gmail<br />
</li><li>My outlook.com junk box is clean<br />
</li><li>I'm checking in both web client and Thunderbird</li><li>I don't have any address in my "Blocked senders" list</li><li>Also I can't add any aliases with my domain - I receive the following error "This email is part of a reserved domain. Please enter a different email address." - is that somehow connected to the problem?</li></ul>
<p>Please advise.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting back. I understand that you are still experiencing issues receiving forwarded emails from your custom domain. Let me assist
 you with your concern. We've sent a test email and we verified that your Outlook.com account is working fine. The issue only occurs when email was sent to your custom domain.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After a thorough investigation, we are looking into a possibility that the domain is not properly configured. Please contact your domain administrator
 for further assistance.</span></p>
<p>

            Hi Pathy,<br />
<br />
We need to isolate this issue so that we could identify why you can't open files saved from your NAS drive in your computer. Can you tell us the error message that appears when trying to open your files?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we recommend that you perform a clean boot on your computer to eliminate software conflicts. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the steps. Once done, kindly

<br />
Let look forward to your reply.

<p>Hi Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; I have been working with Microsoft Office Support on this intermittent problem since August.&nbsp; They have checked my file systems and done an uninstall and reinstall of Office 2016 four times now.&nbsp; Each time the problem goes
 away upon reinstall but seems to reappear in a week or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office programs are simply unable to see my NAS drive when they get into this mode.&nbsp; However, Windows Explorer and all other apps like Acrobat, Photoshop, Lightroom etc have no problem accessing files on this NAS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Windows Explorer to find one of these files and click on them, the Excel (or Word) splash screen comes on briefly and then disappears.&nbsp; There is no error message and these apps are not running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today Microsoft reinstalled Office and things are working again.&nbsp; I will be happy to try out what you suggested when this problem happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pathy</p>
<p>
