            <p>Hello Teokute,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>unfortunately you can not back up your SMS if there is no Microsoft account on the phone and you cannot back up the contacts either. If the contacts are not on your SIM card it's better to write them down&nbsp;somewhere before resetting the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

    <title>Word 2016 taking MINUTES to save a file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richh67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 taking MINUTES to save a file</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have grown exceedingly tired of Word (and if I remember right, Excel, which I don't use often) taking MINUTES to save a document. For example, I am trying to save a document that has nothing but text. Less than one page of text. There are two fonts used.
 Text, three bullets (of standard format), and that's it. Text. It literally (and I'm not one of those people who uses the word literally when I actually mean figuratively) took more than two minutes to save the document.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I'm saving the document to a folder that is always offline, on my local PC, synced to OneDrive. I grew tired of having to reenter my credentials into Word to get it to save, and having that repeatedly fail, so I went into Word settings, and unchecked "Show
 additional places for saving..." and checked "Save to Computer by default." It is saving to my OneDrive folder, in a subfolder. It should not take MINUTES to save - a file of this size shouldn't take a second to save.</div>

<p>First, safe mode. I started from the run dialog, created a new document using normal.dot, typed "test document" in the document, and saved it to the root of the local OneDrive folder. It took two minutes and 17 second for the save dialog box to close, and
 another minute and 24 seconds before the application went back to the home tab from the file tab, so I could see the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I did a repair of my Office 365 home installation. I used the full repair option, not the quick repair. Then I created a similar new document. Saving it to desktop was instant (I hadn't thought of trying this before). I then did a save-as with the
 same document, and saved it to the root of OneDrive. It took about a minute and a half before the save file dialog window disappeared, and another 45 seconds before the display went back to the document (from the File tab). As for the updates, my Office installation
 is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it makes any difference, I uninstalled and reinstalled the OneDrive desktop application (not the Metro (I know...) app). It has been weeks since I reinstalled Windows on my Surface Book, and OneDrive still wasn't working right. I uninstalled OneDrive,
 moved files to another folder, in case anything was missed in the sync to the cloud, and reinstalled OneDrive. I have it set to show all folders locally, but to keep files in the cloud unless needed (I'll selectively set some files to always be local once
 I get this straightened out). I would say that somehow, now, it seems that OneDrive may be the culprit. Office has been giving me trouble for the last several Insider builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, in Word, I have it set to save locally, without offering me remote locations. In OneDrive, Files On Demand is on, and all folders are set to show. Saving even to the root OneDrive folder causes this problem. Also, in OneDrive, on the Auto Save
 tab, I have it set to OneDrive for documents, and local for pictures. On the Office tab, I have Use Office 2016 to sync.... Unchecked (but that seems to make no difference).</p>

            I was starting to think that this might be a OneDrive problem, but I think that's wrong. I exported a page from OneNote to pdf using the Microsoft PDF from OneNote, and it saved to a OneDrive folder instantly. Then later, I was in Word. I saved the Word
 file, and while waiting for it to save, I opened Outlook. Outlook opened, but the UI would not respond to anything until the Word window became responsive. This issue seems to only affect applications in the Office 2016 suite. Somehow, it has to do with how
 Office applications save to OneDrive folder locally, but also blocks the UI from other Office apps (at least it does in Outlook 2016).

            I didn't end up running the analyzer tool, as the last several documents that I've created have saved in under a second or two, so the problem seems to have resolved itself.

                    <p>Outlook is not retaining font effects in personal stationery.</p>

</p><p>If I deselect 'Strikethrough' &amp; 'Double Strikethrough', changes are NOT retained when I click 'OK' &amp; then 'OK' on the main 'Options' window.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Empty folder but properties show 66 emails &#63;</h2>
                    Hi, my PC is running Windows 7 and Office 2010. Outlook 2010 was configured to auto archive. I have found that all my folders are being displayed except 1 particular folder shows as empty but properties shows 66 emails. Thearchive of this folder is empty.
 On the same PC, I have a XP virtual machine, this runs Outlook 2007 and connects to the same exchange server. Again all my folders are present and the 1 folder in 2010 I mentioned has all the emails in it in Outlook 2007. Can anyone advise ?

<p>That's correct for office documents. For other types of documents, you may need to check if other apps let you see the downloaded attachments, such as PDF reader for PDF files, music player for audio files and etc.etc.</p>

            we are not getting emailed updates to your replies, so didn't know you replied until I went through all the spam on the board. :/<br />
<br />
anycase, open the word document on your phone, then you can tap (...)/save as/choose phone/save<br />
<br />
then you can connect your phone to your pc/open the folder documents/your file is there. (just tried it again to be sure.)<br />
<br />
if it is a picture and you save it to phone, it will be in the pictures/saved pictures folder on you phone.<br />
<br />
if it is a ppt file, it will end up in the documents folder once you save it to your phone<br />
<br />
pdf files don't seem to be stored in a files location that is accessable by cable. only able to get to them with a pdf application<br />

<h2>            Samsung Jack I637 sync&#47;conflict issues</h2>
                    I had a Palm Treo before, and it alerted me as to when a change was made to both the device and the computer so I could decide which entry to keep.&nbsp; It appears that Windows Mobile allows for this, but the only options I see are to keep the data on the
 device or keepo the data on the computer.&nbsp; How can I keep both and do a manual resolution?&nbsp; I have Windows Vista 32 bit.

            Select "Do Nothing"&nbsp; Then manually address the issue on each device.&nbsp; Doing nothing will do exactly that...leave things just they way they are so you can go figure out how you wish to proceed.<br />
<br />
To avoid conflicts, I tend to only make changes on one device at a time...For instance, I do not make changes to the same contact/task/appointment on both my computer and my windows mobile device.&nbsp; Changes made to the same item on both the computer and the
 windows mobile device do not get combined automatically and having to go back and figure out what I did is too confusing for me.

            Do nothing is not an option - I have to select either keep the record from the phone or keep the record from the computer.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; Otherwise, I may look at returning the phone!&nbsp; I cannot risk losing data.

            If you've made a change only on the computer, the changed record will be synced to your windows mobile device (overwriting the record that had previously been there); if you've made a change to a record only on the windows mobile device the changed record
 will be synced to your computer (overwriting the record that had previously been there).&nbsp; You will only encounter a syncing conflict when you've made changes to the same record on both your computer and your device.&nbsp; For instance, if you add a phone number
 to John Doe's contact record on the windows mobile device and then add a fax number to John Doe's record on the computer.&nbsp; Because the same record was changed on both devices, WMDC will experience a conflict and that's when it will either replace the item
 on the device or on the computer based on how you set up the option with WMDC.&nbsp; This really shouldn't happen very much.
<br />
<br />
I went back and reviewed and compared the syncing options between ActiveSync (used with XP computers) and WMDC (used with Vista computers) and ActiveSync includes an option to "Do Nothing," along with the "Replace on Computer" &amp; "Replace on Device" options,
 but WMDC does not include the "Do Nothing" option.<br />

            If you made changes on both devices, were the changes made to the same record on both devices?&nbsp; You changed the date for the same appointment on both devices?&nbsp; Did you look at the record on both the computer and the devcie after the sync to see what happened?&nbsp;
 How did you set WMDC up to handle these types of conflicts?&nbsp; If you set it up to replace the data on the handheld with the data from the computer, then that's what should have happened (or vice versa).&nbsp; You probably won't be notified when that happens.&nbsp; I
 am notified because I use ActiveSync and I've got that option set up to "Do Nothing."&nbsp; But like I told you before, as a habit I make a point to not change the same record on both devices.

<h2>            Unable to set up e-mail on HTC Touch Diamond &#40;Gmail&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ik recently got a HTC Touch Diamond in combination with my Vodafone subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set up my gmail accounts on my phone but when i tried to download my messages from gmail i got an error on my phone and i haven't been able to find the source of this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error is as follows: (translated from Dutch to English)</p>
<p>"Unable to set up a connection with current connection settings. Go to connection settings to change the settings."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the settings but i don't know what could be wrong there because everything else on the phone that uses the data connections works fine.</p>
<p>I also activated the "always use HTTPS" setting in the setting section of my gmail account, it was indicated there that activating this setting resolves some problems that are experienced whilest using mobile data connections and other unsecured
 wireless connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally i think the problem lies somewhere in my phone itself but if someone has any idea about this i would very much like to hear about it.</p>

<p>Yes it was, when i passed the checklist and reset the account on my phone i noticed that i had missed an advanced settings tab on one of the screens where i had that tick the use SSL boxes but most importantly this was also the place where i could select
 the connection that my e-mail should use and that drop down menu had selected the wrong connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had selected "Internet Connection" in stead of "Vodafone Live!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After changing this everything worked fine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for you help!</p>

<p><span>Regarding code-based sandboxed solutions being deprecated, you may received Message ID MC73347 in your Admin Center which means the code-based sandbox solutions are

                    <p>I have a pdf file, generated by Latex, which contains hyperlinks to open an excel file (excel 2003).<br />

</p><p>&nbsp;so that I can make each link opens the excel file on a specific cell; but no one could give me the answer.<br />
<br />
I found an answer by &nbsp; brettdj<br />

</p><p>which uses a vbs file to open a specif cell in the excel file.<br />
The problem is that the file location (in strFileName =) is an absolute, so when I take the vbs and excel file to another folder&nbsp;or to another computer, the link does not work; and a message "file not found" is displayed.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Is there a way to do this, or to make the path to the excel file relative to where the vbs file is located; so that when the vbs&nbsp;and excel files are moved to another location the file can still be opened.</strong></span><br />

            <span>Hi Ashishsrkhan,<br />
<br />
The answer to your first question ‘does that mean in Initial sync it will migrate max 20 mailboxes and thereafter once every 24 hours it will pick up other 10’ is no. Your understanding about initial sync and incremental sync in IMAP migration is not correct.
 By default, initial synchronization is performed on 20 mailboxes at a time until all mailboxes in the migration batch have been migrated. There is no 24 hours’ time span between the first 20 mailboxes and the second 20 mailboxes in the initial synchronization.
<br />
<br />
Until all the mailboxes are migrated into Office 365, the incremental sync starts. By default, incremental synchronization is performed on 10 mailboxes at a time until all mailboxes in the migration batch are synchronized. And the incremental sync process will
 repeat every 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Then about the second question ‘what speed does it upload the data on Microsoft Exchange online’, since there multiple factors that will affect the IMAP migration such as the network, the mailbox size, there is no exact uploading speed for IMAP migration.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

<p class="contentStandard">I'm starting up a program (in this case it is a game) and the same message pops up each time I start the game. It says the following message "The instruction on 0xac5c4cd7 refers to memory on 0x0000002c. A read- or write operation
 on the memory failed: read. Click OK if you want to close the program"&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I've checked for viruses and other junk and deleted it all. But I still got the same error, so I checked my logs and I saw that there were many logs with the 'file missing' message. So I 'fixed checked' but it didn't change anything.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So now is my question, how can I delete or repair the 'missing files' in my logs?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">And does anyone see some other poblems in my logs ?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Information ;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have windows 8</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Malwarebytes (that already scanned my computer)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Avast antivirus the free edition (that already scanned my computer)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">-&gt; First I had Norton but that is the cause of all my problems now because it didn't protect my pc at all like you can see..&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">And here are my logs</p>

    <title>Windows 10 build 10071&#58; Start Menu problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hector mcdonald  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 build 10071&#58; Start Menu problem</h2>
                    <p>I am part of an amateur group who program Microprose European Air War, and release updates free of charge to the EAW community.</p>
<p>As we need to test the software on different versions of Windows I have set my PC up to be able to run EAW on XP, Vista, Windows7, Windows 8.1 and the Windows 10 Enterprise Insider Preview.</p>
<p>There have been no major problems running EAW (which runs in full screen mode) on any of the operating systems or previous builds of Windows 10 that I have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, with my current build when I launch the game it is minimised, with an icon on the taskbar and the Start menu visible in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>If I do manage to get the game running by clicking on the icon and elsewhere at some stage
<strong>the start menu will re-appear, and it cannot be closed</strong>. I have deliberately reduced the size of my start menu to the minimum possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here I got as far as flying:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60531a37-50c7-4867-9e6e-f2ccb8499a49" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a lobbied launch at GameRanger:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b7a5dd8-2fd2-45af-9ed5-7b0eebdf27e9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is worse in the sense that the inactive start menu is covering up important selection hotspot areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-iterate that this has not happened with any previous operating system, or previous build that I have installed before 10074.</p>

<br />
In Nokia Maps &gt; Options &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Internet &gt; Go online at start up &gt; Options &gt; Change - Choice of Yes, No or Always ask.<br />
<br />
Did you use Nokia Maploader v1.3.5 to download new regional maps and did you delete "old map data"?

            Thanks Scoobyman, I have it set to : go online at startup = yes.<br />
I have not used maploader ( i dont have a pc) and have never loaded map data -- i was operating on the assumption that it is using the internet to complete the search.

    <title>Deleting Middle Initials in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleting Middle Initials in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to clean up an excel file in preparation for a Mail Merge. I delineated the names of couples into 2 columns - example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DAVID L. &amp; CYNTHIA W.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GREEN</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I need to delete the middle initials (so the names will fit better on my labels). I see info online about deleting initials for one person, but what about couples? Please note that some of the names don't have middle initials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>You really should add the ability to edit a post - &nbsp;other blogs allow you to do this. Usually you have a couple of minutes after you post to do the edit and only the author is allowed to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with Yammer in this respect that I find very annoying....<br />
There is a behavior that either ENTER or SHIFT-ENTER makes it post and then you can edit it....<br />
so it makes it impossible to enter a return and go to next line... and if you try then it posts.. and you cant edit it, so you have to delete it. &nbsp;The problem is that I am so used to how all the other online sites work properly, that when I use Yammer and it
 is different, I end up making mistakes and having to delete my posts. &nbsp;So annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get around this I have typed my post up in a text editor with the new lines where I want them and then I paste it into the Yammer post.... Its really annoying to have to do this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive seen other online tools that allow you to override the ENTER action for this exact reason (eg LinkedIn).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The standard practice in a web form is that when you are in a form element then a ENTER key or SHIFT-ENTER key goes to the next line in the form element. &nbsp;To escape the form element you use your TAB key or the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I consider the way Yammer does it to be pretty poor UI design. &nbsp;Please change it and make Yammer like the typical web standard.</p>

            This is typical poor ux from Msft/yammer. Of course you should be able to edit and use the return key. Why does it take them so long to fix an obvious defect that other companies would take care of immediately?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To edit a post in a yammer is still in development. However we do not have any fixed date for that.</p>

            It's been in development for over a year which is absurd. Just be honest and tell users it's not going to happen and yammer will soon be dumped.&nbsp;

</p><p><span><span>I think this is really an urgent evolution for Yammer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is insane that isn't possible to edit posts !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to implement this fonctionnality fastly !</p>

</p><p><span><span>It is very difficult to explain to our collaborators that we will deploy a new application (Yammer) and say that it is performing with such failures ...</span></span></p>
