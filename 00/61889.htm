            Hi Bernardo,<br />
<br />
Install.WIM that is occupying space on your Recovery disk contains the recovery image for your Windows. If you would delete it, then you will also delete the ISO for your Recovery Image that you can use if ever that you need to restore your operating system.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hey 1884 thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an effort to shed some clarity onto this issue, when you buy anything on the Microsoft store the product is added directly onto the account, the only way to see said purchase would be through the Order History on the

<p>
</p><p>Short answer, unfortunately yes, like we said before check the order history to verify. If that is the case we suggest simply filling out our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Request a Refund</a> page and processing the purchase on the correct account. Give it a shot and let us know how it went!</p>

<p>They did that for a reason. They wanted to try to keep the intensity and suspense as best as they could with adding co-op. So to do that they added Carver (who suffers from dementia) to the equation. With that, they have him hallucinate and can see things
 that Isaac can't see which adds some of those Dead Space elements to co-op rather than take away from it. If you play split screen then it defeats the purpose since you both will see it. I think it makes sense and I'm not saying your opinion is wrong but either
 way that is their reaaon for not having a split screen option.</p>

<p>It does defeat the purpose (to them) for what they were going for and no you were not cheated. You could have easily looked it up on the Internet about co-op, it wasn't a secret. They stated it in interviews and gave the reason for not adding split screen.
 You could even tell by playing the demo there was no split screen.</p>

<p>I couldn't look up on the net as I've been busy with college work and elbow surgery. And the Demo was too memory for me to download as I'm using 2 14 GB hard drives on an Arcade Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Well unfortunately that is not Viscerals fault. There are plenty of ways to research a game before purchasing and you didn't take advantage of any of them. Again, I'm not saying you can't be upset but you can't be mad at anyone but yourself. It would be
 different if they promoted Dead Space as split screen but they did not.</p>

<p>There are a lot of free 48 hour codes or even 14 day codes out there if you ask around. A lot of ways to get xboxlive free for a few days. If you want to play with your nephews it shouldnt be a problem. &nbsp; I think I have at least 14-16 of those 48 hour codes
 at home. They come with almost every single game I buy now. I still have all of them. &nbsp;I am sure many other people do too. &nbsp;You might even have some if you look in some of your games. Then you could let your nephew have the code and play together.&nbsp;Plus I thought
 xboxlive allows a free 30 day trial if you sign up for xboxlive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They neglected split screen to be CHEAP. It costs more time and effort to include split screen so they left it out. STUPID DECISION. CO-OP should have MANDATORY SPLIT SCREEN. I dont have any friends with DS3.</p>

            <p>Might be worth asking over at <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winservergen/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winservergen/threads</a>&nbsp;as you may get more responses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said I'd say it very much depends on what you're intending to do with the server, and of course how much space you have available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For&nbsp;a general server I'd probably go with two volumes, the C:\ drive for the system files, and a second volume for your data, for instance E:\. I'd recommend at LEAST 30GB for the C:\, preferably 40-50GB, since updates, patches etc will burn through that
 over time, and it's far easier to start big than try expanding later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're running Terminal Services then you'll likely need a much bigger C:\ since much of the user profile data gets stored on there so you can run out of space quite easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said, it all depends on what you're doing with it, what space and disks you have available etc, there's not really a one size fits all answer.</p>

<p>I'd start with deleting your profile from the console. <br />
<br />
Go to Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Remove Accounts. <br />
<br />
Then select your Gamertag. After that, try adding your profile back. <br />
<br />
https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one<br />
<br />
It might also help to change your password, and set up two-step verification (to rule out anyone else signing in as you on another console.)<br />

<br />
https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/turn-off-two-step-verification<br />
</p>
<p>After that, try restart the console by opening the guide going to settings, and then choosing "Restart console."<br />
<br />
If you are still having problems connecting to Xbox Live, then go into the Settings -&gt; Network and re-set up your connection.

<h2>            A clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium will not install SP 1.</h2>
                    <p>I recently went back to Windows 7 (64 bit) on my homebuilt computer (an MSI mainboard, 3gHz AMD processor, and 16G of memory) and I cannot get Service Pack 1 to install.&nbsp; Windows Update keeps telling me that I need to download and install it, but a history
 of my downloads shows that SP 1 was installed on August 31.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50b77fe6-191a-4c74-8220-626224a96df2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50b77fe6-191a-4c74-8220-626224a96df2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>As if that's not confusing enough, if you look at the System window, it does not list SP 1 as having been installed.&nbsp; On my Windows 7 laptop, it says "Service Pack 1" underneath the version of Windows I have.&nbsp; Not so on my desktop:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23054918-494a-4b88-b3a0-105d72f8f277?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23054918-494a-4b88-b3a0-105d72f8f277?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So is it installed or not? I can't tell.&nbsp; All I can say for certain is that when I try to d/l and install SP 1 now, I get an "update failed" message and this time, the error message is 800F0A12. When installing windows6.1-KB976932-X64, I get the same message.&nbsp;
 I can't find a reason for the error message when I search online for it, but I do see a lot of people having trouble with it. What's the deal, anyway?</p>

            I cannot say I have the answer to your question.&nbsp; However, I have done many (well over 100) installs and never once had an SP1 issue.&nbsp; The mistake many make is to install things BEFORE all Windows updating is completed.&nbsp; My advice, go back and re-install.&nbsp;
 This time, install absolutely nothing, not even antivirus, until all Windows Updating is completed.

<p>That's what I did when I installed Windows. I figured I'd want to get Windows and its updates and problems out of the way before any conflicts appeared, and once I saw that it had installed, I thought it was good to go. Then I started getting warnings from
 Windows Update that I had to install it again for some reason.</p>

<p>Why don't you create some new installation media with SP1 already included?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get an ISO file from my Google drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1TZa6m_mLPclJCeR3hZGcsLE4qgPGtqM2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1TZa6m_mLPclJCeR3hZGcsLE4qgPGtqM2</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>That will be good for now and later if you ever need to do a repair or something else requiring SP1 media.</p>

            I tried to follow this advice but the computer said it still could not find the driver even though I told it to look in Downloads, where it was. I've bought another webcam now, thank you, which works.

    <title>Can the Xbox One be used in an upright position&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msidude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the Xbox One be used in an upright position&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>All the pictures on the internet show&nbsp;the Xbox One&nbsp;laying flat. I also asked several of my old co-workers at MS and they didn't know. So does anyone know if it can be set upright and used? The pictures appear to show venting on the sides so I am not 100%
 sure it can be like the 360 without (partially) restricting air flow.</p>

<p>I don't think it can. It does not seem to have the aesthetic that it can either if you understand what I'm saying. The 360 looks like it should stand straight up while the Xbox One does not.</p>

<p>No, it has been designed to be like TV box . The machine has air vents on side. So that would rrod it, if you even tried to. IMO it would look stupid even if it could.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone. I was just curious for a couple of reasons. The area around my TV is jammed with electronics. I am not sure where I would set something that needs to lay flat (but I will figure out something). I was also curious because I live in Japan
 part of the year and the space there is even more of a premium. </p>

<p>Hi, <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Is your bluetooth device installed on your laptop?<br />
Are you able to detect the bluetooth device on your laptop? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please refer this steps, and check whether you are able to detect the bluetooth device.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To add a wireless or network device <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Open Control Panel by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel.
<br />
2. Under Hardware and Sound, click Add a device, and then follow the instructions.<br />
If you don't see the wireless or network device you want to add, see the instructions below.</p>
<p>To find a wireless device</p>
<p>Windows might not be able to detect your Bluetooth device and let you add it to your computer. To check if your Bluetooth software came from Microsoft, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Open Control Panel by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel.
<br />
2. In the Control Panel search box, type Bluetooth, and then click Change Bluetooth settings.
<br />
3. In the Bluetooth Settings dialog box, click the Hardware tab and look for Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator. If you don't see this, then your Bluetooth software didn't come from Microsoft.<br />

            <p>Hi Rajesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Do you have any other admin account in the system?</p>
<p>b) Has the issue started to occur recently?</p>
<p>c) When exactly do you get the 400 error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you delete the administrator account, you lose administrative privileges on your system. If you have another admin account then you can transfer the data to this account and make this as your primary account. To share you files and folders to other account,
 refer to the following article:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If, however, your issue has occurred recently and you have not made any significant&nbsp;changes to the system, you can try restoring your system to an image created prior to when issue occurred. To perform System Restore, refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To restore your PC to an earlier point in time </strong></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span><strong>Search</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span><strong>Search</strong></span>.)</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong> in the search box, and tap or click
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span><strong>Recovery</strong></span> in the Control Panel search box, and then tap or click
<span><strong>Recovery</strong></span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <strong><span>Open System Restore</span></strong>, and then follow the instructions.

<h2>            Rotation doesn&#39;t work after Windows update</h2>
                    <p><span>After updating Windows 10 in my Asus Transformer Book T100ha screen rotation doesn’t work at all. Rotation button disappeared from action centre and there is no switch for autorotation in display
 settings. I’ve already updated graphics drivers using device manager but when I wanted to do it using Intel Driver Update Utility there is information that it is not able to install drivers. When I want to change rotation by Intel settings or by display settings
 it also doesn’t work&nbsp;because when I change it, it goes to landscape in few seconds but when&nbsp;I turn my device on&nbsp; display is on portrait mode&nbsp;until I log in.&nbsp;How can I fix it?

            <p>I have exactly the same issue with the 2 Asus T100HA of my kids after Windows 10 Anniversary Update:</p>
<p>- rotation doesn't happen anymore. on both machines&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The button to activate/desactivate the rotation is absent in notification center on both machines.
</p>
<p>- For both machines, it was working before Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>- Invsense Sensor Collection is not present, but the same as the one displayed in the pic 2 posts before this one are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to apply the steps proposed, but it is without any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After trying reapplying drivers (which did not changed anything), I found that reinstalling Windows Anniversary Update from an ISO with the machine undocked and oriented in portrait mode made the sensor reappearing. This last thing worked on both machine.</p>

<h2>            Avira AntiVirus Update or Scan progress display shows on another running profile instead of my personal open profile on same computer.</h2>
                    My wife and I have 2 different profiles. We just leave running and walk away since it goes into stand by itself. I get on and just log into my own profile but the other is still logged on with no programs running. Whenever I update or scan it shows on
 the processes of windows task manager but not on my open profile. I have to switch users to see the percentage completed. Whenever she is logged off, or I log her off through windows task manager it will show on my open profile. Well hopefully this may be
 enough to get situated, thank you

<p>When you want to scan, make sure you have logged out of all but one user account. Having two profiles logged in the way you are doing is incorrect. The scan will cover the entire computer, not just one account. For further information:</p>

<h2>            tower will not connect to any screen - HDMI or PC monitor</h2>
                    <p>I just moved the our computer tower and TV&nbsp;which we normally keep connected through HDMI for gaming at all times, Once I moved it and put it back the pc will not recognize the tv/hdmi. I tried to connect my other work computer's monitor to our normal pc/tv
 and this also wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come I can't get a screen on anything! The tower appears to be working fine - lights are on, fan is going etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify - I am not techy at all - hopefully this makes sense even!</p>

<p><span>This error occurs when setup was unable to find or could not read the language specific setup resource .dll.<br />
<br />
If you are using a CD, then clean the CD or DVD. To do this, use a disc-cleaning kit. Or, gently wipe the silver side of the disc by using a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper cloth that can scratch the plastic, and leave streaks. When you clean
 the disc, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion. If the problem continues to occur, clean the disc by using a damp cloth or a commercial CD or DVD cleaning solution. Dry the disc thoroughly before you insert the disc in the
 drive.<br />
<br />
If the problem continues to occur, follow all the steps in the below link to resolve the issue<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I try to access the computer normally it first takes we to a screen that say the following:</p>
<p>"We apologize for the inconvenience, but Windows did not start successfully.&nbsp; A recent hardware or software change might have caused this.&nbsp; If your computer stopped responding, restarted unexpectedly, or was automatically shut down to protect your files
 and folders, choose Last Known Good Configuration to revert to the most recent settings that worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a previous startup attempt was interrupted due to a power failure or because the Power or Reset button ws pressed, or if you aren't sure what caused the problem, choose Start Windows Normally.</p>
<p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>Safe Mode with Networking</p>
<p>Safe Mode with Command Prompt</p>
<p>Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)</p>
<p>Start Windows Normally</p>
<p>Use the up and down arrow keys to move the highlight to your choice.&nbsp; Seconds until Windows starts:&nbsp; "</p>
<p>Then it takes me to the Microsoft&nbsp;Windows XP screen and then sends me back to the original screen that has the statement above.</p>
<p>As I was typing this it finally gave me an option to restore from a previous date.&nbsp; Not sure how that happened, but I am restoring back to July 5th.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it does look like Norton 360 has corrupted something affecting booting up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your restore should restore you back to when Norton 360 was'nt installed and remove all links to it, thus making your PC boot up properly again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know</p>
