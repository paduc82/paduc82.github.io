            Hi Mio, since the SD Card is physically a different drive, you cannot Extend your C Drive into it . . .
<br />
<br />What you can do is run Disk Cleanup on your C Drive and use that to delete all files that are safe to delete:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your C drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete       
        </p>

    <title>How long should Windows 10 take to install on a NextBook tablet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markstoddard  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long should Windows 10 take to install on a NextBook tablet&#63;</h2>
                    I began the process of upgrading from 8.1 to 10 yesterday, and since sometime last evening my screen has been stuck at "Upgrading Windows," with the pulsing circle showing 44% and "Installing features and drivers 33%."<br />
<br />
When I began, the setup process gave me no warnings about available disk space or anything else that might cause problems, so I'm wondering if it's just that this tablet will take incredibly long to upgrade or that something is wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

I tried what you suggested and rebooted (during which it reinstalled Win 8.1). I then logged in as admin and got a low memory warning in the middle of a black screen that told me to shut down all applications to free up memory. I clicked "ok," and waited. After
 nothing happened for a very long time, I shut down again and waited. Finally after another very long time during which nothing happened except the IR sensor on the mouse continuing to glow, I tried another shut down (as before, holding down the power button
 for a several seconds) and walked away. looking back at the screen I saw that it was rebooting again.<br />
<br />
I once again logged in and the system appears appears to be working normally under Win 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
Frankly, now that I'm back to Square One, I'm afraid to retry installing Win 10 and am thinking of leaving things as they are. This tablet only has 1 gig of memory and 32 gigs of storage and I'm thinking it may not be able to handle the new OS, unless you can
 suggest a way around it.</p>

<p>I believe this design feature, if you type and move mouse around it might type in other area and it has been happened that while you are typing , your hand accidently touch the touchpad and mouse move other side and it type in other place and to avoid it,
 you couldn't type and move mouse simultaneously.</p>
<p>Do you have any reason to do that?</p>
<p>As work around you may use USB mouse.</p>

            Hello samuelmurie, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />
<br />Do you have a Sypnatics keyboard??
<br />
<br />If you do then:
<br />Press the Windows key on your keyboard and type Control Panel in the search box.
<br />Click on Mouse and go to Device Settings tab.
<br />Go to Settings.
<br />Under the Synaptic Settings, go to Pointing, then select Sensitivity.
<br />Select Palmcheck and set it to Minimum.
<br />Test the game.
<br />
<br />
<br />As also suggested to try:
<br />Press the Windows key on your keyboard and type Control Panel in the search box.
<br />Go to control panel and Go to Hardware and Sound
<br />Go to Touchpad
<br />Go all the way to the additional tap of the new window that opened up on touch pad settings
<br />Scroll all the way down to TP Rejections and disable it
<br />
<br />Refer to: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/cant-use-my-keyboard-and-touchpad-at-the-same-time/184b98c2-7486-4eea-97e8-c04d212617fc?page=1&amp;auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Disabling PalmCheck or other similarly-named settings removes the delay between being able to use the touchpad after using the keyboard, allowing you to use touchpad and keyboard at the same time. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps.
<br />
<br />1. Click Start.   
<br />2. Start typing Control Panel, and click on Control Panel from the results.
<br />3. If you are in Category view, click on Hardware and Sound.
<br />4. Under Devices and Printers, click on Mouse.
<br />5. In mouse and touchpad software window, Look for any settings related to palm tracking, touchpad sensitivity, or SmartSense. 
<br />(If yours in Synaptics Touchpad, under the Synaptic Settings, go to Pointing, then select Sensitivity and Select Palmcheck and set it to Minimum) 
<br />
<br />6. These settings vary by manufacturer because Windows has limited ability in controlling touchpad options.
<br />
<br />Also try in Control panel: 
<br />- In Hardware and Sound
<br />- open Touchpad
<br />- In additional tap of the new window that opened up on touch pad settings
<br />- Scroll to TP Rejections and disable it

Get something clear for us first before we run into wild goose chase.<br />
Windows <strong>Vista</strong> has <strong>Windows Mail</strong>.<br />
Windows <strong>XP </strong>has <strong>Outlook Express</strong>.<br />
Which one are you having ?<br />
I have a feeling you meant Windows Mail.<br />
Open your e-mail program ( Outlook Express or Windows Mail ) &gt; look up to the top left hand side. What does it say ?

If <strong><em>you</em></strong> send <em><strong>yourself</strong></em> a message with an attachment, can you open it? ______<br />

E-mail scanning may be the culprit. Uninstall AVG and then do a custom installation, opting out of e-mail scanning when the option is offered.

Why you don't need your anti-virus to scan your email<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ive been a loyal xbox user since the begining. Spent thoudands and thousands od dollars on games, peripherals, and other accessories for these consoles. I recieved email from xbox stating im in the top 5%
 in all catagories and what prize do I get another useless arcade game that was out for the 360! Lol this is a insult! Games with gold promised free full games and were still receiving arcade games! This is ridiculous especially after xbox decides to drop price
 on console to reward those who didn't buy a day one edition lol I paid 600.00 for my console now there 350.00 with a game! When I initially recieved the email stating xbox was going to reward it most loyal, I thought its about time, and then I recieve this
 crappy little arcade game(LIMBO) and a poster!!!! Im not a little kid im 39 years old, even my kids wont want to play this. I left playstation when xbox original came out and have been a loyal customer since then and I feel very under appreciated and if not
 rectified looks like ill be going back to playstation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Everyone received limbo. You can keep poster! Like I said games with gold is a joke and so is this. Ive seen people post that they received halo mcc and others received cod aw and they didn't even purchase a xbox one on release or own a 360. Just find it
 insulting I receive a poster. I didn't expect microsoft to care they already have my money.</p>
<p>I guess ill go back to playstayion and see how they treat loyal customers.</p>

<p>I hear ya about people not receiving limbo but there not missing much. &nbsp;Javier I hear ya I think its ridiculous the way this was handled. &nbsp;I bought xbox one on day one for a hefty 600.00 and then they drop price to 339.00 with a game. So for those loyal
 xbox fans who purchased on day one gets *** and to add insult to injury they send me a poster. Look I hate to sound like a complainer but when you spend thousands of dollars on a game system and have bought every xbox console and hundreds of games and peripherals,
 &nbsp;its just insulting to receive a poster. </p>

<p>Personally, I think that Microsoft should just stop these promotions. Every time they give free stuff to customers, people start coming out of the woodwork to say how greedy Microsoft is for not giving them the free stuff that they want. Microsoft is not
 required to do promotions like these nor do they need to give you anything that you haven't paid for, yet people seem to expect it. I don't know when the consumer public acquired what seems to me to be such a sense of entitlement.</p>

<p>I thought the downloadable poster was a total joke. Especially after the stats email hyped the gift. It felt like a slap in the face and I would have honestly rather never been promised any sort of gift.</p>
<p>However, free Limbo was a really nice gesture for day one owners. Its a great game! Thanks for that, MS.</p>

<h2>            Linking Android&#47;iOS Phone to Windows 10, Build 1709</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 (1709) Laptop is Azure AD joined only and I log into it using my Azure AD account only, no local accounts and no Microsoft (consumer) accounts. When I got to add my iOS device to Windows (Settings - Phone), The 'Add a phone' button is greyed
 out, stating that I must sign in with Microsoft. So I click the button, which takes me to the Email and App Accounts Settings page. This page shows me that I have my company (Azure AD) account signed in, but for Email, Calendar and Contacts, there is no account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to add my company Azure AD account to Email and App Accounts, which now shows that account listed under Email, Calendar and Contacts, but when I go back to Settings - Phone, the button is still greyed out - I still need to sign in with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it safe to assume I need to use a Microsoft CONSUMER account to make this feature work?</p>
<p>I am not keen on having both my personal (Microsoft Account) and business (Azure AD Account) linked to the same device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone from Microsoft can confirm this limitation? Can't find any documentation on this feature on docs.microsoft.com to backup this assumption yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Stefano</p>

                    I purchased a new Dell 8300 XPS in December 2011 and I am just now trying to add a printer. I bought a Brother but couldn't get through the install cd without error. So I bought a Canon and same thing happened. I have Windows &nbsp;7 Home Premium x64. I have
 tried everyting I can think of. I have disabled all startup programs, virus protection, and created a seperate Admin login. Of course Dell was no help and wanted to charge me another $100. I have only dowloaded updates to this computer and do not "surf" the
 net with it. HELP!

<h2>            Community Cartographers And YOU&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Not many forger know there are groups dedicated to helping members get their maps into matchmaking, and I'm here to tell you how to do just
<strong>that. </strong>There are about 15 Cartographers currently active for the matchmaking team right now between 343i and Bungie, of course 343i will be handling the system after the switch. These cartographers are the stepping stones before ultimate enlightenment
 in Halo: Reach, the decide if the Matchmaking Engineer gets to see your creation or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Here is a step by step process to guide you to get a map into matchmaking.</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find a community group with a Cartographer, (I suggest Satyros at halocharts.com, or Blueprint at Bungie.net.)</strong>
</li><li><strong>Post your map, have a clean forum post that is easy to read and provides adequate screen-shots or videos of your map.</strong>
</li><li><strong>Test with other members of that group as often as possible, (Make sure to add that groups community Gamer-tag for invites.)</strong>
</li><li><strong>Learn to accept criticism and use it constructively to better your map. Criticism is the KEY.</strong>
</li><li><strong>If you have what it takes, the cartographer will submit your map for further review by the Matchmaking team. (You may not always get it in.)</strong>
</li><li><strong>If you've made it this far then congratulations.</strong> </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These simple steps will help you find your way, but remember not everyone is a great map designer, it takes time, work and consistency to make it, and sometimes it's not for everyone. You have to be friendly, sociable and well known to have the best of chances.
 So get known with the big leagues and get their opinions, their help and their time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you say this would never work, it did for me. This month July 12th 2011, my map Eden Minor, will be going into Team Slayer and Arena. I had much help from WolfPackDragon, GodlyPerfection, Obi Wan Stevobi, and many others, and if a regular Joe like
 me can be successful I know you can too.</p>

            Microsoft store only accepts credit cards currently.
<br />The way I have gotten around this is go to best buy and buy a MS gift card because Best Buy accepts PayPal.
<br />Then you can use the gift card at the store to purchase Maps Pro.
<br />I know annoying, but it's the only way to do it if you want to use PayPal.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend putting in feedback to Microsoft to ask for PayPal as a payment method, i have done it.
<br />

<p>
</p><p>I'm &nbsp;a member of software developers team. &nbsp;We are creating enterprise application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use some <em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee719654%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Imaging Component (WIC)</a></em> features in our application.</p>
<p>After applying latest updates of Windows 8.1, parts of application relying on <em>
WIC </em>framework begun to throw exceptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We found out that the issue was caused by&nbsp;<strong>MS Windows Update KB3000850.</strong></p>
<p>Issue is reproducible on all our developers' workstations.</p>
<p>We rolled back this update manually and now everything is working for us. But I worry about our clients who are using Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Please check this issue and let me know when it will be fixed.</p>

            Another way to reactivate your key is to do the automated phone method. Just push activate windows by phone then follow the
<span>
prompts</span> from the automated system. This usally takes about 6 mins but when your done your windows will be reactivated.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

<h2>            My HP Deskjet 3050 is not recognized by my Windows XP system</h2>
                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I am starting to get dessesperate with my Windows XP computer, my old Cannon IP1800i worked really fine on this computer and now when I bought a new one I cannot install it. "USB Not Recognized", is the message I keep reading whenever I plug it in since
 yesterday.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried it all, installing and uninstalling the driver (It has nothing to do with the problem)</p>
<p>Pluging and unpluging the printer, &nbsp;(won't work at all)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But it seems to be a Windows XP problem, I have installed this same printer finely on my Windows Vista laptop, and it worked fine, but for a weird reason, it won't work on this computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is not a problem of the usb ports, I have my keyboard and my mouse plugged in and also I've tried connecting in all my USB ports of these computer, but it keeps going the same message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I go back to the driver, it gets me a message like this: </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"How are you going to connect the printer to your computer"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. USB - Connect the printer to this computer using a USB cable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Obviously this is the opting I clicked on, however, it gets me a message telling me my printer is not connected (it is), and it is not because its turned off or turned on (it is turned on), it won't work anyways.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Network (Ethernet/Wireless): Connect the printer to the same network as this computer.</p>
<p>For the same reason, this option won't work again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>None of the options will work ON THIS PARTICULLARY COMPUTER because NO USB IS RECOGNIZED.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone help me to install it? I am getting crazy and keep trying and trying.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PD: I also tried changing the USB cable of the printer, NOT working anyways.</p>

            <p>I have my 3050 hooked up wirelessly through my Netgear router. I use it on both my XP PC and Win7 laptop with no problem. IIRC, the installation was pretty straight-forward.<br />When you installed it to your Vista laptop, was that wireless or USB?</p><p>When you uninstalled it from the XP PC, did you delete the ports associated with it, then reboot before starting the driver installation again?</p><hr /><p>SC Tom</p>

            <p>I installed my printer in my Vista laptop without any problem in the wireless mode, however, you need to plug the printer first to the computer the first time so it can recognized it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried to do it both ways in my Windows XP, however, computer won't recognize the printer, a message appearing telling me my USB is not been recognized by the PC keeps going every time I turn the printer on, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It not seems to be a problem with the printer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Whilst I have&nbsp;no experience with your particular model, my experience of every other HP printer that I have installed is to

<ol>
<li>Disconnect your HP 3050.</li><li>Uninstall all unnecessary printer software from your XP machine, this includes all printers not in use any more

There appear to be 3 possibilities listed at

<h2>            Will increasing RAM on a Windows XP Pro from 512 MB to 2 GB improve performance&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning &amp; <strong>Happy Holidays</strong> to everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> FIrst, some system info for your reference</strong>.&nbsp; (Computer was purchased USED&nbsp;in late 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell Dimension 3000 Desktop (cable modem Internet connection)</p>
<p>Windows XP Pro, SP3</p>
<p>Intel Pentium 4, 3.00 gHz CPU</p>
<p>512 MB RAM (256 MB x 2)</p>
<p>40 GB HD (60% freespace)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noted my computer is becoming <strong>slower...</strong>in cold boots/restarts, Internet connecting, email loading, and even just opening a Word or Excel file while offline.&nbsp; On a number of occasions, (using a stopwatch), I've checked how long it takes
 to do just a <strong><em>restart</em></strong>.&nbsp; Beginning from the moment I press the &lt;<strong>ENTER</strong>&gt; key after inputting my password, it has taken as long as
<strong>23 minutes</strong> for the system to display the 5 <strong>Taskbar</strong> items, etc,
<strong><u>and the hard drive light to go out</u></strong> before I can even begin to do anything on the computer.&nbsp; (All the
<strong>Desktop icons</strong> willl display within 10 seconds of a restart).&nbsp; AV &amp; anti-malware scans reveal no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>My question is this</u></strong>:&nbsp; Would upgrading the RAM from 512 MB to the 2 GB [<strong>1GB x 2</strong>]&nbsp;(acceptable according to Dell specs), provide significant improvement in my computer's speed &amp; efficiency, or&nbsp;would I just be wasting
 money &amp;&nbsp;end up&nbsp;having to go and try to find another used computer with more memory?&nbsp; Living on a fixed, retirement disability income doesn't leave me with many options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you for your time and any suggestions!</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Increasing the RAM from 512 mb to 1gb would be worthwhile given your commit charge figures. Reducing demand as suggested by others &nbsp;is equally right but most Windows XP systems will&nbsp;benefit from the more modest increase in RAM because otherwise the computer
 inevitably makes over much use of the pagefile.</p>
<p><span>I would be interested in seeing a Disk Defragmenter report. Open Disk Defragmenter and click on Analyse. Select View Report and click on Save As
 and Save. Now find VolumeC.txt in your My Documents Folder. Open the file, and place the cursor anywhere in the file, select Edit, Select All to highlight all text and copy and paste into the body of your message. Do this before running Disk Defragmenter as
 it is more informative.</span></p>

            Significantly improve performance? No.
<div><br />
<div>All you need to do is determine which process is hogging memory and/or resources. To do this, open Task Manager and make sure the Processes tab is selected. Click on CPU. Then click on CPU again. This will cause the most resource-hungry processes to show
 at the top of the list. You can do the same with Mem Usage. In your next post, tell us what the worst offenders of both are.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding memory, here is an effective way to determine if there is enough (that is, whether or not your system is overly relying on the pagefile):</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>
Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and click the Performance tab. Then note the three values under Commit Charge (K): in the lower left-hand corner: Total, Limit, and Peak.</p>
<p>
The Total figure represents the amount of memory you are using at that very moment. The Peak figure represents the highest amount of memory you used since last bootup. If both these figures are below the value of Physical Memory (K) Total, then you probably
 have plenty of RAM. In case you want to explore this further, you may run Page File Monitor for Windows XP:</p>

            Hi Donty
<br />
<br />Windows 10, supports zip files natively without the need to download an app!
<br />
<br />Right click a zip file and choose 'Extract All'
<br />
<br />Then provide a location for the unzipped files
<br />
<br />If that does not work for you, right click one of those zip files, choose properties
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

<h2>            Cannot Install Windows 10 Due to Compatibility issues</h2>
                    <p>It seems that my old on-board graphics unit is over riding the dedicated one, and it wont allow me to upgrade to the new windows 10. I have heard that windows 7 will not be supporting Direct X 12 and was looking to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded to the Radeon XFX R7 260X graphics card and it seems that windows does not recognize that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see it is countering each other. &nbsp;I would really like upgrading to windows 10 seeing that DX 12 will have much improved performance on gaming, which I need xD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas ?</p>
<p>And my on-board graphics card drivers are updated as well as my dedicated. Win 7 Pro x64.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is occurring to dual graphic drivers in the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to uninstall the dedicated graphic driver and keep the default graphic driver. Next try to upgrade that graphic driver and then try to upgrade to Windows 10 and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to update the graphics card drivers/display drivers and check if it resolves the issue.</span><span>&nbsp;

<h2>            can&#39;t sign in to account on new laptop</h2>
                    I bought a new windows 8 laptop and set up my account the first time I turned on the laptop. Shut down, and turned on again. Its asking for account password and its not accepting the password that I've used and any other password that could possibly work.
 I cant pass this stage to sign in to my computer and can't do anything! I already reset my account password on another computer but didnt help. Help!

            Hi, I used a Microsoft account, but ending with @hotmail.com.tr instead of @hotmail.com because only that was allowed. I dont have a recovery disc nor can restore the laptop because I can't sign in anyway. I think my only option is to restore the laptop
 to factory settings?

<p>You could try using a Friends Windows 8 machine to create the "Recovery Drive" (don't add the Friends Recovery Partition to it though).&nbsp; You should be able to use that "Recovery Drive" for Startup Troubleshooting on any Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; See Control Panel\All
 Control Panel Items\Recovery<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Have a look at this location too, Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Windows 7 File Recovery.&nbsp; Look at Create a System Image and see if that is useful for you.&nbsp; Also look at&nbsp; Create A System Repair Disc, see if that might work for you as it seems similar
 but a bit different to the original "Recovery Drive" we are talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A Retail type DVD will offer you similar (to a Recovery Drive) options at boot.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if the following link helps: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/getting-started/get-to-know-your-surface-with-windows-8-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/getting-started/get-to-know-your-surface-with-windows-8-pro</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike many products, these are coming out so fast (and with so little advanced information) that the truly exceptional tutorials commonly available for many other products simply aren't created yet because those who commonly create them haven't had access
 to the information or the product long enough to "do their thing" yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the user guide mentioned previously may help in terms of detailed information, it is really for Surface in general and not specifically Surface Pro - and it is not formatted as a tutorial.&nbsp; The above is not really a tutorial either, but does specifically
 target Surface Pro and if you follow the segments in order, I think it comes closer to what we both think of as a tutorial (which is, in all honesty, just not available anywhere yet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps starting with the User Guide to get the basics of Surface followed by the Getting Started article above to get more of a tutorial start for Surface Pro specifically is the best way to learn as much as is currently available even if not as convenient
 as we're used to for products where there has been enough lead time for such things to be written in the more commonly and easily assimilated fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 7 from another Language</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I have currently a Vista Home Premium in German installed. Now I've got&nbsp;my Windows 7 Professional in English. I don't want to do a "clean" update. Is there any way to upgrade my system?<br />
<br />
I have other Vista versions available (e.g. Vista Enterprise and Vista Professional&nbsp;in English). Is it possible to update my German Version to let's say Enterprise English, and then to Win7 Pro English?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated

    <title>Soundmax audio conflicts with video performance, XP Pro 32 bit, P4 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Soundmax audio conflicts with video performance,  XP Pro 32 bit, P4 dual processors.</h2>
                    I use Windows XP Pro 32 bit on a Pentium 4 dual processor system with integrated audio and graphics on an Intel motherboard, only 1 gig of RAM.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I have the latest upgrade I can find to the Soundmax audio Software and driver needed by my Intel motherboard, but when installed, video playback both online and offline becomes choppy.<br />
<br />
When Soundmax is uninstalled, video performance is improved, but I can't seem to use any of the other audio codecs or legacy audio available on the system, thus no sound.&nbsp; I would be happy to abandon SoundMax if I could do this.<br />

            <p>If everything appears to be in working order, lets take a look at the volume mixer and make sure nothing is muted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do so, right click on the little speaker in the lower right hand corner and choose "Open Volume Control"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify that nothing is muted or turned down in here.</p>
