<h2>            Dell E6500, screen went black after logging in, upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell E6500 here. It was running Windows 7 Ultimate before. I upgraded my Dell to Windows 10 over a week ago. As far as I am concerned the installation process was completed successfully. I saw a log in screen and logged in with my password as usual.
 After I logged in, the screen went black with a white cursor, nothing else happened. I tried to log out and log back in, restarted the laptop, etc, but the screen still went black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't remember how, but I managed to find an option to reverse my laptop back to previous version of Windows (I thought it would normally say 'reverse back to Windows 7'). So I did a reverse, managed to roll back to Windows 7, everything was fine except
 I could not connect to the internet via IE, Chrome and an email programme. I checked the internet connection, it was up and running, I had no problem to download any updates via Windows Update or pinged a website via cmd but not accessing to the internet via
 browsers. I spent the whole week trying to work out why my Windows 7 would not allow IE to access to the internet. I had no luck at all, in the end (today) I just gave up and tried to re-install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I had no problem to install Windows 10, but the black screen came back again. I have already tried several methods that I could find on the internet about resolving this black screen issue, but I have no luck at all. So now, my questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In my case, how can I resolve this black screen issue after logging in please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I cannot resolve this black screen issue on Windows 10 and want to roll back to Windows 7 again, how can I resolve the internet connection issue for IE, Chrome and an email programme?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to me and offering me some help to resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the method that you suggested here. First of all, pressing <strong>Windows key + X</strong> doesn't open Device Manager on my computer. I can only get a purple screen with
<strong>Task Manager</strong> on it by pressing <strong>CTRL + ALT + DELETE keys</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I have the Task Manager running, I go to <strong>FILE</strong> then choose&nbsp;<strong>RUN NEW TASK</strong> then type in
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> to run the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have the Device Manager running. So I follow your advice expanding <strong>
Display Adaptor</strong>, then right click on the <strong>video driver</strong> (NIVDIA Quadro NVS 160M) and select
<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>. A pop up window comes up asking me <strong>
'How do you want to search for driver software?'</strong>, I choose <strong>'Search automatically for updated driver software'</strong>. Then the computer is searching online for the driver. Less than a few seconds, the computer now says
<strong>'The best driver software for your device is already installed' 'Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date.' 'NIVDIA Quadro NVS 160M'</strong> in 3 lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I close the Device Manager, re-pressing <strong>CTRL + ALT + DELETE keys</strong> so that I can restart my computer by going to the
<strong>Power icon</strong> on the bottom right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has now restarted, but the black screen is still happening, therefore this method has not fixed my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this attempt, I feel that the video card cannot be causing this black screen issue, because the computer managed to load a Welcome screen which is a scenic image of a beach with time and date on bottom left corner. Then after I click on this Welcome
 screen, I am diverted to a log in screen where I can see a Windows logo background image, a profile photo roundel, my name and a text field for password. The black screen only happens after I entered my password to log in. Therefore I cannot see this black
 screen is related to the video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, Windows 10 has already confirmed that the video card driver is up-to-date with below info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver provide: NVIDIA</p>
<p>Driver date: 29/06/2015</p>
<p>Driver version: 9.10.13.4174</p>
<p>Digital signer: Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please tell me what other solutions I can have to fix this black screen problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>After a quick search on the internet, some people suggested a temporary fix by reloading explorer.exe in the Task Manager. I have now got the Task Manager running, I scroll through the Processes list, but there is no explorer.exe running at all. Then I go
 to <strong>FILE</strong> and choose <strong>RUN NEW TASK</strong>, type in <strong>
explorer.exe </strong>and click OK. The explorer.exe doesn't run at all. Does that mean my copy of explorer.exe is corrupted or missing?</p>
<p>

            <p>Still have no answer or solution for this Windows 10 upgrade issue. I am not impressed at all. I don't understand why Microsoft would offer something which is not working properly obviously and is causing users lot of problem, what is the aim, eh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No surprise, I have now reversed back to Windows 7. What a disappointing product, why bother to create Windows 10 in the first place honestly?</p>

<h2>            Windows vista started windows memory diagnostics tool, without me prompting it</h2>
                    Ok my sister is a computer not, she wont listen to needing virus protection, she thinks just because she visits certain sites she is safe, i have tried and tried to let her know how important it all is, but deaf ears. &nbsp;She has three computers, a hd desktop,
 a work related dell, and mom's old dell with windows vista.
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing that she doesn't clean nor work the computer like she should, I think lots of places for problems to happen. but this is a new one, tonight, her vista (she &nbsp;said) started the windows memory diagnostics tool, her friend said yes to it, doesn't
 sound right, but the computer has been going thru the motions for the last hour, i didnt want to close it, so I am waiting, &nbsp;any advice would be helpful. thanks</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
How do I know if my computer has a memory problem?
<p>Usually, <span>Windows</span> automatically detects possible problems with your computer‚Äôs memory and displays a notification that asks if you want to run the Memory Diagnostics Tool.</p>
<div>
Running the Memory Diagnostics Tool
<p>When you receive a notification about a possible memory problem, click the notification so you can choose between two options for when to run the Memory Diagnostics Tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can restart your computer and run the tool immediately.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can restart your computer and run the tool later.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you choose to restart your computer and run the tool immediately, make sure that you save your work and close all of your running programs. The Memory Diagnostics Tool will run automatically when you restart
<span>Windows</span>. While the Memory Diagnostics Tool runs, you will see a progress bar indicating the status of the test. Once the test is done,
<span>Windows</span> will again restart automatically.</p>
<div>
Getting the results of the memory test
<p>If the Memory Diagnostics Tool does not find any errors, you'll get a message that no errors were found.</p>
<p>If the Memory Diagnostics Tool detects errors, contact your computer or memory manufacturer for more information.</p>
<div>
What do I do if the Memory Diagnostics Tool finds errors
<p>If the Memory Diagnostics Tool detects problems with your computer's memory, contact your computer or memory manufacturer for information about fixing the problem.</p>
<div>
Advanced options for running the Memory Diagnostics Tool
<p>We recommend that you let the Memory Diagnostics Tool run automatically. However, advanced users might want to adjust the tool's settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the Memory Diagnostics Tool starts, press F1.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can adjust the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Test mix.</span> Choose what type of test you want to run. These options are listed when you run the Memory Diagnostics Tool</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Cache.</span> Choose the cache setting you want for each test.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Pass count.</span> Type the number of times you want to repeat the tests.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Press F10 to start the test.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
How do I schedule the memory test manually?
<p>If the <span>Windows</span> Memory Diagnostics tool does not run automatically, you can run it manually.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click to open Memory Diagnostics Tool.‚Äå
<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose between the two options for when to run the Memory Diagnostics Tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can restart your computer and run the tool immediately.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can restart your computer and run the tool later.</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<h2>            Store student discount eligibiltiy</h2>
                    Hi, my wife is looking at purchasing a surface pro 3 and noticed the student discount price. She is a Primary School teacher in the UK and would be hoping to use the surface as a delivery tool. Is she eligible? I cant quite determine from the elgibility
 criteria if its exclusive to universities.

            <p><span>Hi Zack thanks for the response.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I had intended to post an update but just didn't get round to it yet!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I did indeed contact the support team who confirmed they would be able to verify my wife over the phone by her sending an email with her documentation. Unfortunately they can then only then process the order over the phone, so presuming she was eligible
 the student discount would be applied but the ¬£100 cashback would be lost. They did offer a ¬£70 voucher for future purchases which I thought was nice but this still left the surface a tad more expensive than I could get it elsewhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have since bought one elsewhere and whilst we are still awaiting verification there is no immediate rush now and we are happy to wait for the email confirmation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As as a final update and in response to my initial enquiry. My wife received her verification today so uk primary teachers are eligible. 12 hours too late unfortunately!</span></p>

            I wish it did.&nbsp; Yeah, I've tried all that before I asked.&nbsp; I got a new computer and installed Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; This is all from an external hard drive.&nbsp; I have gone back to the old computer to see if it would allow me to have permissions (like it used
 to) and now the old computer won't give me permissions.&nbsp; It won't let me copy/paste them or view... I'm talking thousands of music/picture/docs..etc<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn‚Äôt get a notification? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
‚Ä¢Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each update and click Uninstall. </p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Other reasons why you might not be seeing it:</em></strong></p>
<p>Why don‚Äôt I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don‚Äôt see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn‚Äôt up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You‚Äôve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we‚Äôll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC‚Äôs compatibility if you

<h2>            Perfect Dark &#40;Rare Replay&#41; signed in but cannot connect to xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>When trying to run Perfect Dark in backwards compatibility, my profile is logged in but I cannot connect to xbox live (despite being connected on Xbox one).&nbsp; I get error code 80151906, which the xbox 360 support page says may be due to a corrupted profile.&nbsp;
 My Xbox one account is the same as my Xbox 360 account, and other backwards compatible games (Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Deus Ex HR) and the other 360 Rare Replay games I've tried (BK, Kameo, PD Zero) all have connected to Xbox Live fine.&nbsp; I am currently connected
 via wireless, and cannot via ethernet cable due to the layout of my house and entertainment system setup. My MTSU is set to 1480 but I cannot change it through my router settings.</p>
<p><br />
I have tried the following with no success:</p>
<p>-Connecting to XBL through the 360 dashboard</p>
<p>-Power cycling the Xbox one</p>
<p>-Disconnecting and reconnecting with manual IPs/DNS to my wireless router on Xbox one</p>
<p>-Uninstalling/reinstalling PD/RR</p>
<p>-Deleting my 360 profile on my xbox 360 and redownloading it per the error code 80151906 instructions</p>
<p>-Resetting my router</p>

<p>Please help</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Darren17,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Have you checked if you are installing the right version of driver (32-bit)?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>What is the source from where you are trying to install the driver?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should try to download the driver from the ‚ÄòATI website‚Äô and try to load the drivers. Here is a link I found on the ATI website to download and
 install the drivers. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=&amp;lang=us&amp;rev=10.2&amp;ostype=Windows 7 - 32-Bit Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=&amp;lang=us&amp;rev=10.2&amp;ostype=Windows
 7 - 32-Bit Edition &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also make sure that you disable the onboard graphics from the BIOS(Not device manager)
<span>&nbsp;</span>and then go about installing the drivers. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also make sure that you have the PCI Plug and play devices enabled from the BIOS.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer
 from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can e solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.

            I followed instructions from the motherboard's manual to disable the onboard video and install a new video card. The onboard video does not show up in device manager when I use safe mode. I downloaded those drivers and also tried the drivers that came
 with the video card.<br />

            Hi Valagnar,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Devices - Touchpad
<br />
<br />Is the Taps option not available at the top of that settings page?
<br />
<br />If not, check to see that the device driver for your touchpad is loaded correctly
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<h2>            Unable to use PaperPort 14 on windows 7 - Error shows up as an incompatible program</h2>
                    <p>Original title - PaperPort (Nuance) 14</p>
<p>PaperPort 14&nbsp;shows up as an incompatible program in Windows 7 (after working for many months). How do I get PaperPort to install and work?
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have used PaperPort for over a decade with various Windows programs and machines. About three months ago, it started crashing every time I tried to use it. I uninstalled and tried to reinstall. All that installed is the installer. When I try to run it,
 it closes almost immediately after I grant permission to make changes on my hard drive. I ran Windows Compatibility program and got a&nbsp;message&nbsp;that this is an incompatible program. (I know it works with Windows 7, because it works on y Windows 7 laptop.)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Windows has done several other strange things. When I plug in an exterior drive or insert a CD, it does not offer to open it. I did not knowingly change any settings.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I reopen Chrome after an abnormal shutdown, it does not offer to reopen closed tabs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What do I need to do to fix this computer? It is handicapping my work.</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the exact/complete error message you receive while you run
<b>Paper Port (Nuance) 14</b>?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any hardware or software changes made on the computer prior to this issue?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1 ‚Äì </span></b><span>Uninstall Paper Port (Nuance) 14 and reinstall it after performing method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the link to </span><strong><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></strong><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2 ‚Äì </span></b><span>Clean boot</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Clean boot </span></b><span>- <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original
 behavior.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Follow <b>step 7</b> to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.
</span></p>
<p><span>Now try to reinstall Paper Port and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Paper Port 14 is compatible to Windows 7</span></p>

<h2>            Changing the properties of multiple songs and multiple albums in Media Player, including genre</h2>
                    
<p><span>I would like to make Windows Media Player my music player of choice on the PC, rather than iTunes.&nbsp; However, the deal breaker right now is the ability to easily select multiple songs or multiple albums and change their properties
 (or info) all together - including genre.&nbsp; I love to organize music by genre, and I love to choose the genre titles, rather than being stuck with the dozens of similar genres chosen by an online music site.&nbsp; Does Windows Media Player offer that level of control
 over our media?&nbsp; If not, will it in the future?</span></p>

<h2>            Dualboot win 10 with win 7 problem with SSD</h2>
                    <p>I can‚Äôt install win 7 as the second OS with win 10 (dual boot). I already made it three times for different PCs. I bought new SSD, I installed win 10. I couldn‚Äôt install win 7, by all ways. The message received says ‚ÄúThe selected disk is of
<strong>GPT </strong>partition style" Is there any problem with the SSD structure made by win 7, and there are any solutions?</p>

<h2>            cant start windows xp-- &#34;Disk boot failure. Insert system disk and press enter&#34;</h2>
                    hey i turn off my computer at night because its in my room<br />
<br />
so i turned it off a week ago and in the morning it says <br />
"Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\vgaoem.fon<br />
<br />
You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM<br />
Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair"<br />
<br />
so i googled this, and it sent me here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/vgafon-missing-or-corrupt/429d33a4-ef04-470d-9c6a-a4faaf214cd1<br />
<br />
that page said to make a bootable xp recovery console cd (i didnt get one with computer) so i made it. it said to go into bios and change boot order to cd-rom first, so i disabled hard drive boot and made cd rom the only enabled one.
<br />
<br />
then when i put the cd in the drive, i turned computer on booting from cd rom and i go the message<br />
"Disk boot failure. Insert system disk and press enter"<br />
<br />
how can i fix my computer? i put the disk in it and it says disk boot failure. can someone please give me a step by step way to fix computer, i dont know that much about bios and this kind of stuff.<br />

            <p>Hello rohat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that the article was probably indicating that you should move the CD-ROM to boot before the hard disk and not to completely disable the hard disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any doubt whatsoever in regards to the BIOS, it would be best to get your computer's manufacturer on the line to help out with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things I would try then </p>
<p>first note that I believe if you wait a bit of time and try again you should be able to connect. However you can try to
</p>
<p>A) clean out your system cache</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2293053_clear-cache-windows-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.ehow.com/how_2293053_clear-cache-windows-xp.html</a></p>
<p>B) Softreset all network devices your xbox is connected to (turning off your modem, then router, then xbox, waiting 30 seconds then turning your modem, then router, and finally your xbox back on)</p>

<h2>            Mobile HotSpot over VPN to Ethernet connection not possible &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to select a VPN connection as a target for Mobile HotSpot setting in Windows 10 (1703) ?</p>
<p>Currently it only offers Network (my default ethernet cable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why such a mess?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC is connected via Ethernet to a network, to get Internet access we have to establish a VPN network.</p>
<p>So any outgoing traffic has to go through the VPN channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi gadget -&gt; WiFi HotSpot -&gt; VPN -&gt; Ethernet Network</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently it does something like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi gadget -&gt; WiFi HotSpot -&gt; Ethernet Network &lt;- VPN</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which results in a completely not working network.</p>

            <p>The free upgrade requires a Windows 8 or Windows 7 license in order to qualify. If he needs Windows Media Center, its not supported in Windows 10. If he can get a Windows 7 license, that would probably be a better fit since a system running Windows XP might
 be too old to run Windows 10 effectively.</p>

<h2>            Top keys are no longer working</h2>
                    I did a factory reset on my computer where I kept some of my files. I had to do this as it was taking 10 mins or longer to start up. That helped the start up issue but now my top row of keys on my Toshiba Satellite keyboard are no longer working. I have
 windows 10 installed if that helps. By top row of keys I mean the brightness, volume, play/pause, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Jasmine, 
<br />
<br />What‚Äôs the exact model of your satellite? I can look up drivers for your model to see if we have the latest and greatest.
<br />
<br />It could also be a function key being toggled off. You should see a ‚Äúfn‚Äù key on the bottom of your keyboard. Click that button and see if the keys works. Try Fn+ctrl, fn+shift, fn+windows key etc and see if the keys turn on.
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>Thank you for responding so quickly. I have the Toshiba Satellite S55-C5247. Model Number PSPTJU-006005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I actually tried your suggestion and I was able to make the keys work but I have to press the fn key to do so. Before I reset the laptop I did not have to do that.&nbsp;</p>

            Give it a reboot and see if they stay on(they should) - they could of just turned off during the reset. It‚Äôs a toggle on or off deal. You should be good now! <br />- C
