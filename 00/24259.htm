    <title>Word 2010 header spacing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claytoncramer_884  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 header spacing</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word 2010, and the headers have one line in them. &nbsp;I turned on display formatting marks to be sure. &nbsp;Somewhat randomly, there is 48 to 100 extra points of spacing in the header section. &nbsp;Most headers are correct. I have verified that all sections
 have the same header position, margins, and header size. &nbsp;I have deleted the bad headers and told it Link to Previous Header. &nbsp;I have Saved and reopened the file. &nbsp;What should I try next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I next opened the file in Word 2013; no change.</p>

            Unless a license for Office 365 was included with your purchase, you need to actually subscribe. Many new computers include a trial version of Office 365 but not an actual permanent license.
<br />
<br />If a license is included, here are instructions on how to use that to activate your Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activate-an-office-purchase-or-free-offer-on-a-new-pc-89881633-0b26-4ca8-816b-93f347bd92c0?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activa...</a>
<br />
<br />You should be aware that different subscriptions have different applications and number of installations.
<br /><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-m...</a>
<br />Some include installation on up to five different computers and other devices.
<br />
<br />If it is a trial version on your computer and you want features other than those in the trial version, you need to uninstall the trial version and then install the one you want. 
<br />
<br />For online purchases product keys are not provided. To download and install Office 365 or 2016, you may login to the My Account page on Office.com with the Microsoft account you used to register or purchase.

<br />
<br />If you have purchased Office 365 or 2016 from a retail store (Product Key Package), then you may register the purchased product key with the Microsoft Account and then download and install Office. Refer to the following link to sign in or create a Microsoft account to download and install Office 365.

            Hi laram. 
<br />
<br />On the community we do not have any tools to assist you with activation, because it is related to checking your licence. For this reason you were referred to phone/chat support, because they can assist with this.
<br />
<br />If you have any issue to contact other support let us know.

    <title>APPCRASH&#47;AppHang&#47;Bluescreen frequency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ignivix  say:</h3>
<h2>            APPCRASH&#47;AppHang&#47;Bluescreen frequency</h2>
                    <p>Hello windows community, I have finally decided to post about these problems I've been encountering, not just on Insider but on windows as a whole.</p>
<p>I have talked to numerous Microsoft support employee's all of which have reverted to telling me they cannot fix my problem as it is with third party applications and do not coincide with Microsoft in anyway.</p>
<p>Pretty much what I'm being told by majority of the Tech support employee's is I should 'F off with my problem because it's not windows that is at fault'.</p>
<p>And so I come to the community/developer section hoping someone in this community is diligent enough to UNDERSTAND what kind of problems I have been having for the past year already.</p>
<p>I have battled with it, stuck with it and just plain out endured it because there was nothing I can do. Re-installed my windows on 3 different SSD's, 2 different HDD's all of which still had problems.</p>
<p>Each install was from a USB bootable, each time I had to re-install I used a new version of the bootable in case the bootable could have been corrupted. Who knows it could have been, but either way it does not explain why I am having such major issues.</p>
<p>This does not exclude the live/stable version of windows as the problems still EXIST on both insider and live/stable.</p>
<p>I came to Insider in hopes of escaping. It relieved a lot of stress knowing that the frequency of blue screen did lower, however application problems, app hangs and crashing frequency sky rocketed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let's go over the first example(s):</p>
<p>AppHangB1:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c78f5f6-5607-466b-9e4a-535a2123ba19?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c78f5f6-5607-466b-9e4a-535a2123ba19?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>This little problem has been working it's way through every single application I have installed onto this computer. Now, some applications are more optimized and haven't had problems, but those that do not get APPHANG's do sometimes cause blue screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am not sure if this is intentional for windows, god do I hope not, but I have not found a single fix to these AppHang's AT ALL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every where I looked kept refering me to corrupt drivers, corrupt windows files, scanning my windows system installation, and upon doing so the windows scan detects corrupted/missing files and then tells me it cannot fix the problem and then just leaves
 me sitting there with the error still persisting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is another example:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/648fb9c7-542e-43c3-8431-eb1e93a3028b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/648fb9c7-542e-43c3-8431-eb1e93a3028b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs on almost any game that I have installed, it does not matter which game it may be it happens on everything I play/do.</p>
<p>I am on my computer for at least 10~12 hours a day so getting this problem every 2 hours is quite infuriating, and sometimes the frequency ramps up.</p>
<p>No Man's sky is notorious for crashing, however that does not exclude this from the batch as I have more similar crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a89c9cc3-a58e-47f0-9e0b-d23b19b6c182?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a89c9cc3-a58e-47f0-9e0b-d23b19b6c182?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>See even on a windows system application this happens.</p>
<p>I've search the error codes, nothing seems to come up, why is that? Because this problem apparently doesn't happen often and when it does it problem fixes itself somewhere down the line or the person with this problem just ignores it any time it comes up
 and it stopped happening.</p>
<p>For my case, this problem HAS NOT STOPPED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as for Blue screens:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba3f15c-6bff-4ead-a2c7-e404fceb38e6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba3f15c-6bff-4ead-a2c7-e404fceb38e6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I get at least 4 blue screens/green screens per day out my usage times.</p>
<p>I have narrowed these crashes down to some service drivers and onto google chrome.</p>
<p>Thus I am then thrown back to third party programs causing problems, however this does not exclude Windows from potentially being at fault.</p>
<p>I am attempted to contact Microsoft support about this, but because the employee's who man the technical support desk do not actually know a single god damned thing about their own OS they just simply are told to waive away the problem and send it off to
 someone else or get you to say an application may be at fault to say: 'I am sorry but if this problem is caused by an application then it is not in my jurisdiction to help you'</p>
<p>I can only but laugh at this, the #1 operating service has technical support employee's who are not trained properly, who are out sourced and who cannot actually fix problems the correct way. Doesn't windows have a special thing called system analysis? Can't
 you just analyse the system and determine the root cause of the problem because something somewhere **** up.</p>
<p>Oh wait, Windows doesn't have that... Why? because GDPR 'General Data Protection Regulation' and windows isn't allowed to have any system analytics that may impede on user privacy, even if it means finding a potential blue screening bug or corrupted file
 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a complete Windows out there somewhere that you can match system data files with and determine if a Windows system is missing files in their installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also notice that there are services called Mellanox and what these driver services do is allow any applications that want to edit the OS edit it to their own liking because some programmers are so lazy they would rather edit the OS than work with the OS.
 Thus causing problems if they program used isn't programmed right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now let's take a look at my event viewer, as on the reliability monitor not everything is shown in it's true form.</p>

</p><p>This same log was tracked for the next hour and was logged into the even viewer at least 21 or more times every minute.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell you what this may be, but it's to do with windows updates, and what ever the screenshot may be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This single error report went on and on about 4 times during that day as I scroll down, this was the last error report pile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this post is getting a bit long, so I might as well speed things up a bit.</p>
<p>I am tired of having problems with windows because somewhere down the line the developers are not talking to each other and are pushing out versions of windows that have not been tested thoroughly enough to be stable for use.</p>
<p>Now if applications are having problems with running on windows, then something is up.</p>
<p>If windows is having a hard time staying up because some kind of memory problem, or driver related issue, then SOMETHING IS UP!</p>
<p>There is no excuse to be had, did windows 7 have this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO IT DID NOT.</p>
<p>Now why is windows 10 so horribly designed? Because it was pushed out with the updating times. I'm not going to hate on Windows 10 too much as it is a massive improvement from windows 7, but windows 7 is the most stable version of Windows there is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe we should go back to windows 7 and just improve upon that rather than starting from scratch, because apparently things can't be done right in Microsoft's vision of OS'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a WINDOWS developer want's my complete event files then ask for them and you shall receive it. Please for the love of this community find the cause to these problems and you will then learn how to make Windows better.</p>

    <title>Drop down list from query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjmhi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop down list from query</h2>
                    <p>I have a form -- frmStaffWorkload --&nbsp;that allows&nbsp;staff to list the projects they're&nbsp;currently working on. The entries from the form are&nbsp;added to a table -- tblStaffWorkload. The&nbsp;form&nbsp;includes a list of projects from a&nbsp;drop down list. The list is based on
 a query of a simple master table -- "tblProjects"&nbsp;that includes the fields "ProjectName" and "Status". The query limits the drop down list to display only projects whose status is&nbsp;"Current". Everything works fine until the project is complete. When the project
 is complete, staff will update "tblProjects" and change the status from "Current" to "Complete" (via another form). The drop down list removes the "Complete" project from the list -- as I want.</p>
<p>My problem is any previous entries in the form that had the newly-completed project entered, is now blank. The table, tblProjects, still has the entry -- it's just not showing up in the form anymore. Any help?</p>

            It sounds as if the form's RecordSource is restricting the rows returned to those where status = "Current".&nbsp; If so change the RecordSource property of the form to a query which restricts the rows returned to those which are "Current" OR "Complete".&nbsp; The
 query would be something like this:<br />
<br />
SELECT tblStaffWorkload.*<br />
FROM tblStaffWorkload INNER JOIN tblProjects<br />
ON tblStaffWorkload.ProjectID = tblProjects.ProjectID<br />
WHERE Status = "Current" OR Status = "Complete";<br />
<br />
I imagine the query is also restricted to rows from tblStaffWorkload where the employee is the current user, but I've not included this in the above as you've not given any information on how this is done.<br />
<br />
If you have problems amending the query definition post back with the current SQL of the form's current RecordSource query.<br />

            Sounds like I need to show both the "Complete" and "Current" project names. I was hoping I could just show the "Current" projects in the drop down list. I took your advice and have the next best thing. Thank you!

I see no reason why not.&nbsp; The RowSource of the combo box and the RecordSource of the form can act independently of each other.<br />

            <p>It sounds to me that you are using the Form in ContinuousFormView?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem you observed is consistent with the Filtered ListRows in that&nbsp;the Projects that have been completed are no longer in the List and records linked to the completed Projects shown on the ContinuousForm will show blank in the Text component of the
 ComboBox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the usual techniques to solve this is to use <strong>two </strong>ComboBoxes, 1 with the unfiltered RowSource and 1 with the filtered RowSource. Let's call them cboUnfiltered and cboFiltered.</p>
<p>Bind both ComboBoxes to the same Field. Size the 2 ComboBoxes to be exactly the same and place them also at exactly the same position on your Form so that it looks like you have only 1 ComboBox. Click on the ComboBox and check the Properties pane to see
 which one was selected.&nbsp; If it is cboUnfiltered,&nbsp;Bring it to the Front (the comand should be somewhere on the&nbsp;Ribbon). If it is cboFiltered, Send it to the Back (again, the command should be somewhere on the Ribbon).&nbsp; After this, cboUnfiltered should be&nbsp;in
 front/on top of cboFiltered in the design of the Form.</p>
<p>The final step is to use Macro or code in the cboUnfiltered_GotFocus Event to send the Focus to the cboFiltered.</p>
<p>This way, all the rows in your Form in ContinuousFormView will show the&nbsp;correct Project in the Text component of the ComboBox (cboUnfiltered).&nbsp; The exception is on the current row (CurrentRecord buffer where user does the data entry/data update). If&nbsp;he/she
 clicks on the cboUnfiltered, the Focus will be sent to the cboFiltered&nbsp;which moves the cboFiltered to the top (of cboUnfiltered) and the&nbsp;DropDown list will only show the "current" Pjojects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use a TextBox&nbsp;instead of the cboUnfiltered and the cboFiltered.&nbsp; You need to modify the RecordSource of the Form to include the ProjectName Field.&nbsp; Bind the TextBox to ProjectName Field.&nbsp; Size the TextBox to be the same as the Text
 component of the ComboBox, i.e. the rectangle to the left of the down arrowhead.&nbsp;Similarly to the first method, make sure the TextBox is in front of cboFiltered in the design of the Form.</p>
<p>The final step is to use&nbsp;&nbsp;Macro or code in the TextBox_GotFocus Event to send the Focus to cboFiltered.</p>
<p>The appearance/behaviour of the second method&nbsp;is exactly the same as the first method.</p>

            The behaviour which Van Dinh describes would be the case if the projects combo box has as its BoundColumn a hidden surrogate key column such as ProjectID, but displays the project name text value.&nbsp; If this is the case it can be overcome by using a hybrid
 control made up of a text box superimposed on a combo box to give the appearance of a single combo box control.&nbsp; This is usually done in the case of correlated combo boxes, where the list of a second combo box is restricted by the selection made in another
 combo box.&nbsp; You'll find an example as ComboDemo2k.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
To do this in your case the form should be based on a query which joins the tblStaffWorkload and tblProjects tables, with the combo box being bound to the foreign key column in the former (as now) and the text box to the Project Name column in the latter.&nbsp;
 The Enabled property of the text box should be set to False (No) and its Locked property to True (Yes) to make it read only.<br />
<br />
When you select an item in the combo box the text box will show the corresponding text value from tblProjects.&nbsp; Unlike the combo box, however, this will remain visible when the corresponding foreign key value is no longer present in the combo box's list.&nbsp; To
 the user it will appear as though they are using a single combo box control.<br />

            <p>I had the exact same problem last month. My activity log showed unsuccessful syncs from all over the world. I have no idea how my account was hacked, especially considering my extremely strong password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn on 2 step verification to ensure your account is as safe as possible and keep an eye on your activity log just to be sure. The fact that you're now seeing unsuccessful syncs just means that someone is still trying to access your account (with your old
 credentials) and failing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a lot of people, on various websites, complaining of this exact issue but Microsoft themselves haven't confirmed any sort of breach that would explain how so many passwords have got in to the hands of people other than the account owners. Something
 fishy is definitely going on.</p>

<h2>            can I keep a style while I am typing in Microsoft word&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using Styles while preparing a report. What I found is that when I was using a specific style, for instance "Heading1" and press Enter, and then the the style of the new line, in which I would start to type, became "Normal". Is there any way
 that I can keep the previous style? For example, it is possible for me to do when I use PowerPoint (in which I use "tab" or "alt+tab" to change the level.

            Yes, although it is rare to want to have the style of a paragraph following a Heading style be the same style it is certainly possible. You need to modify the style's setting for "Style for following paragraph."
<br />
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Understanding Styles in Microsoft Word</a>
<br />
<br />
The built-in heading styles have all sorts of properties which make them less than suitable for all of your text if you want to use the navigation pane or cross-references or a table of contents.<br />
<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/usebuiltinheadingstyles.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why use Microsoft Word’s built-in heading styles?</a>
<br />
<br />
Long-term, you probably want to create a custom style that has the font and spacing you are currently using but is a body style rather than a heading style.<br />

            <p>To add to what Stefan and Charles&nbsp;have said, if you are wanting to create the outline of a document by entering all the headings first, you can do this in Outline view. There, when you press Enter at the end of a Heading 1 paragraph, you get another Heading
 1 paragraph. You can use the Demote/Promote buttons to change heading levels or insert Body Text (you can also use the Tab/Shift+Tab shortcuts if you have enabled them in AutoFormat As You Type).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW, I usually change the "Style for following paragraph" of all headings to Body Text or Body Text First Indent instead of Normal, since that is what I will generally be using.

            <p>Here is a long list of things you can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, go to email + accounts. Is Facebook added here? if it already added, then tap and hold on that, and you will get an option to REMOVE the account. Go ahead and remove&nbsp; the account. Then restart the phone. Go back to email + accounts and add it back.
 Then,&nbsp;go to settings &gt; applications &gt; &nbsp;MESSAGING. Here ensure that FACEBOOK CHAT&nbsp;is on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if you can chat now. If you cannot chat even now, then visit outlook.com and login to your Microsoft&nbsp;account. Here there is a way to connect your Microsoft account (live.com, Hotmail.com, outlook.com email address that you use on your phone) with Facebook.
 Do that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have&nbsp;successfully added your FB&nbsp;in outlook.com, come back to the phone, try the settings &gt; applications&nbsp;&gt; MESSAGING again.&nbsp;are you able to chat now? do you at least get an option to see FB in the primary MESSAGING app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all the above fails, you will need to reset your phone. go to settings&nbsp;&gt; about &gt;&nbsp;RESET.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you have followed the above steps to the dot, then here is what you can do next. The following steps will take a long time. So be patient and we will get to a solution for this. Before you do any of this, if you go to facebook.com, please confirm that
 FB chat is working fine. So, we know that it is not a issue with your FB account. Also, please keep facebook.com open on your computer and ask one or two of your friends to stay online as you fix this problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Since nothing has worked so far, I would suggest doing a phone reset. You can do this by going to settings &gt; about &gt; reset.</li><li>While the phone is resetting and you are waiting, on your computer, go to outlook.com and login with your main Microsoft account you use on your windows phone. On the top right corner, there is a messaging logo. Click on it and you will see you a blank
 box below the word MESSAGING.&nbsp;Click that box and you should see all your chat friends who are online on FB.COM.
</li><li>If you see your friends on FB.COM but not in outlook.com, that means your Microsoft account is not connected to your FB.COM. To connect your Microsoft account to FB.COM, click on your name on the top right corner and you will get ACCOUNT SETTINGS.
</li><li>This will open a new page and on the left side, you have four options, go to the one which says PERMISSIONS. Here, again you will have four options and you must select the last one which says MANAGE. Here FB should be listed as a connected service. if it
 is not, select ADD ACCOUNTS on the top left corner and you can add FB.</li><li>Now come back to OUTLOOK.COM and see if you can chat with your FB friends.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try all this. It will take a lot of time and you cannot skip any step. Let me know how it goes.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using a gpo setting to set the lock screen to a company picture. We have computers with OEM professional licenses.</p>
<p>With Windows 10 Anniversary update it is no longer possible to control the lock screen image with a gpo as this preference is now prohibited for Enterprise and Education editions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, don't force us to buy (expensive) Enterprise licenses just for this feature, please add the professional license again to the editions affected by this gpo setting so we can continue to work our way&nbsp;and I don't have to search the internet for
 a work around or hold the Anniversary update.</p>

            <p>I'm referring to the release build of the Anniversary update and the accompanying GPO Templates. The GPO now states the lock screen picture setting applies only to Enterprise and Education edition.</p>
<p>I don't have crashes on the settings app. The possibility to set the picture is greyed out but the picture itself is not shown.</p>
<p>I have a Windows 10 Enterprise evaluation edition for testing purposes which shows the background picture perfectly the way it should.</p>

            I'm using Pro build 14931 and I have the capability of setting a specific lock screen picture via Group Policy but it doesn't actually put the picture on the Lock screen.&nbsp;If I then&nbsp;try to specify a specific picture through the settings app it crashes.
 If the GPO is not configured I can set a specific picture through Settings and it does work.&nbsp;I can't see them removing the GPO setting and still allowing it manually through Settings though. I'll check the next build when it comes out and let you know if things
 change.

            1. CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; Under Startup, look whether Word is listed or not. If listed, remove it.
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general) 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Office &amp; click &gt; Modify &gt; Quick repair / Online repair

<p>
</p><p>I had already checked startup programs - no MS Word. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how the installation could have gotten corrupted, but I will try the repair option. In fact my Office setup is totally vanilla. I suppose I could uninstall and reinstall Office altogether if need be.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Does this happen when you close all documents before shutting down/restarting your computer or is it happening when there are open documents at the time you tell the computer to shut down / restart?
<br />
<br />When Word is starting automatically, at startup, what are you seeing? A screenshot may be helpful.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

            A similar problem occurred a few months ago and it was fixed in an update. Is your Office installation up to date? To find out, click File | Options | Account | Update Options | Update Now.<br />

<p>I made sure all documents were closed and closed Word before shutting off or restarting my computer. Word still opened when I booted up.</p>

<p>Thanks. This got my looking more closely at my installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have two version of Office on my computer - an English version and a Vietnamese version. I live in Vietnam and show a Vietnamese IP address, but I certainly never asked for or knowingly installed a Vietnamese version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I asked for updates I got a Vietnamese language window telling me to wait while the system looked for updates. For the record, my setting is for automatic updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try to repair my installation, which a moderator suggested earlier that I try.</p>

            If you have language support installed for more than one language, Office 365 usually displays two entries in the list of installed programs. This is normal for recent versions of Office (and won't cause any trouble).

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>The issue I am having is that when trying to send an email via Outlook to another Outlook user, I received a message prompting me to sign in to my account, to validate it. When logging in, I am sent to a page telling me to enter my phone number to receive
 a code, but when doing so nothing happens other than the message turns red telling me to enter the code. Obviously either this requires a smart phone (which I do not have), or the error is on Microsoft's end.</p>
<p>I have a activated Windows 10 PC, so why isn't my Outlook account connected to that? It uses the same password (as all Microsoft accounts appear to do).</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Thanks, J</p>

            I have Windows 7 x64. I checked my program files and (x86) program files and have IE in both&nbsp;, yet I cannot find the 64-bit version in my All Programs or Start menu. I only have one IE 10 icon anywhere and when I open it and click on "About" in Help, it
 says nothing about being 64-bit.

<p><br />
You can't rely on About Help for&nbsp;determining that in IE10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Task Manager instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. in Processes tab, if iexplore.exe has *32 beside it, it is not 64-bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; To double check look at the Command line field (may need to be added).&nbsp;&nbsp; If the path contains&nbsp;
 (x86)&nbsp;&nbsp; your OS is 64-bit but you are running a 32-bit instance of the browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in the Command-line field look for a SCODEF:&nbsp; parameter. &nbsp;That is an indication that that iexplore.exe task is a tab task.&nbsp;&nbsp; The number refers to the PID of the "chrome"
 task which is more likely to be 64-bit.</p>

            Well, my issue was that I couldn't use the 64-bit version of IE. It was nowhere in my start menu or all programs. The only version that I could execute, or even locate, was the 32-bit version. Checked task manager and yes, the 32-bit IE was the one running.
 &nbsp;I initially installed it from the link stated above in a previous post. When I tried to re-install it, I got the "already have a more recent version" message.

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see this non-technical explanation of Enhance Protected Mode in IE10....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/enhanced-protected-mode-internet-explorer-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/enhanced-protected-mode-internet-explorer-10</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, to use IE10 x64 (as your default IE browser) select</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, check "Enable Enhanced Protected Mode"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(at this stage I highly recommend that you also uncheck "Enable third-party browser extensions" also)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>!important</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>REBOOT your computer for the changes to take FULL affect....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after reboot the next time you click on the IE desktop/start menu icon, you will be prompted/told which 32bit IE Addons are incompatible with the x64 version... only x64 capable Addons and plugins will work in EPM IE10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at the Help&gt;About Internet Explorer dialog... there is no change from the x86 dialog...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the only way to determine the bitness of a webpage (at this stage) is to type</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>javascript:alert(navigator.platform);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the IE Address bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you encounter a web page that uses x86 Active X controls IE will Prompt you to turn off EPM for that website.... turning off EPM for that website will also enable x86 addons for that website in those tabs... (that is why I recommend unchecking "Enable
 third-party browser extensions"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            I tried all this - I dont want internet explorer 10 64-bit to be the default but I do want to be able to run it for some things - I have a VPN tunnel that seems to require it.
<div><br />
<div>I have the exe file in both the 64-bit and 32-bit directories but no matter which one I run, it says it is 32-bit. &nbsp;It wont let me uninstall any internet explorer stuff and the link above to the knowledge base article on that goes to unknown page.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know that I *used* to have a link for both 64-bit and 32-bit and now there is only one and it points to the 64-bit one but it is 32-bit. &nbsp;It wont let me re-install since it says I already have a newer version.</div>

<p>Please read the link I gave you....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>EPM will automatically switch browser bitness on a per-site basis.....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no user interface to change which sites will use which frame bitness...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can remove sites from this registry key to re-initiate the process of bitness determination for a web site....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TabProcConfig</p>

            <p>I seem to be unable to load the 64 bit version of Internet Explorer on my 64 bit Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; I have tried the "clean boot" and the uninstalling of Internet Explorer 10.&nbsp; When I run the 64 bit installation file I still end with a 32 bit Internet
 Explorer.&nbsp; I see no indication that the 64 bit version exists anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I start Internet Explorer from C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe I don't have any indication that the 64 bit version is running.&nbsp; The version information says "10.0.9200.16721".&nbsp; Nothing follows this.&nbsp; If the 64 bit version were running
 I am lead to believe that the version number would have been followed&nbsp;by "64 bit".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How the heck do I get the 64 bit version installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>

            Unfortunately, the default voicemail greeting for Skype can’t be changed. <br /><br />You could provide feedback to the Skype engineers to let them know you would like that. They may add that ability. <br /><br /> You can see how to provide feedback on issues you experience here:<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>

            Why can't I record a custom greeting with Skype voice messaging?
<br />
<br />Custom outgoing voice messages are no longer supported. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.

</p><p>When I installed the latest build (10574 I believe), it caused a lot of problems for my system.&nbsp; I lost my start menu apps (the app troubleshooter couldn't find anything), my system wouldn't boot, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got the previous build (10532) restored but now there's no option to download any higher builds.&nbsp; I'm wondering,what's the latest current build and how do I get it?&nbsp; I'm set on the fast ring and to install new builds.</p>

    <title>Problems with Paste Special in MSPowerPoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lb_redhorse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Paste Special in MSPowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>In PowerPoint Office 365 running on Windows 10, the Paste Special options for Windows Metafile and Enhanced Metafile no longer remains at 100% of the graphic being copied. Other paste/special options work correctly with the pasted image at 100% of the graphic
 being copied, however, those formats don't provide the resolution needed. This problem didn't exist in previous versions of Windows or Office.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As you described,
</span><span>the Paste Special options for Windows Metafile and Enhanced Metafile</span><span> is not available for all coplied graphics. Based on my test, when I copy inserted graphics from PowerPoint 2016, these two options are always
 available from my side when I choose Paste Special.&nbsp; </span></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to suggest you help confirm the following, so that we can better understand your situation and help you:
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Ensure you have updated your Office to the latest version. Please go to File&gt; Account&gt; Product Information, capture a screenshot about the product information
 with related Office version.</span></li><li><span>As for "</span><span>the Paste Special options for Windows Metafile and Enhanced Metafile no longer remains at 100%
 of the graphic being copied</span><span>", could you please help provide a specific example about it? Please provide detailed steps and related screenshots about how you get the situation.</span></li><li><span>Do other Office applications encounter the same situation, such as Word or Excel?</span></li></ol>

            Hi Redhorse,<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing the information and apologize for the late reply.<br />
<br />
I have copied a picture and choose the two Paste Special options Windows Metafile and Enhanced Metafile in PowerPoint 2016 in latest version of four different channels (Monthly Channel (Targeted); Monthly Channel; Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted); Semi-Annual
 Channel), while I cannot get the same situation as you encountered. I would like to suggest you update your Office to the latest version and check if it helps.&nbsp;<br />

<p>It definitely repros here</p>
<p>
</p><p>This what I see in W7 with the latest version (1806) of 365. On other PCs with W10 I see something different the emf is smaller than the original but it is never exactly the same size for me</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing the repo video in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the video you provided, I can see the pasted </span><span>Enhanced Metafile</span><span> format shape is larger than the original shape in Windows 7. However, based on my test, when I copy a picture or a shape, then choose
 the two Paste Special options </span><span>Windows Metafile and Enhanced Metafile</span><span> in PowerPoint 2016 in a Windows 10 computer, I still cannot get the same situation. Here is my environment and test result:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Environment:</span></p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Enterprise Version 1803 (Build 17134.1)</p>
<p><span>Office version: Latest version of four different channels (</span><span>Monthly Channel</span><span>
</span><span>(Targeted)</span><span>; </span><span>Monthly Channel</span><span>; </span>
<span>Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)</span><span>; </span><span>Semi-Annual Channel</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Test result:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Shapes:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, I would like to collect more information to understand the situation better so that we can better help users who are encountering the same situation. Could you please help confirm if you can get the same situation
 when you use PowerPoint 2016 in a Windows 10 computer? If so, could you please share with us the detailed Windows 10 OS and Office version? We will do more further tests in the same version to check if we can repro it from our side .</p>
<p>

<p>I am on the road but we have both 365 Pro and 365 Home both updated to the latest Monthly channel and both on W7 ultimate. The EMF is 25% larger when pasted.</p>
<p>We also have 2016 MSI 1806 10228.20104 on W10 pro&nbsp; latest updates. Here the pasted EMF is nearly correct but a tiny bit smaller original 3.31 cm x 4.98 cm&nbsp; -EMF is 3.21 x 4.86 cm</p>
<p>
</p><p>however I have seen this exact problem for over a year with several different versions of 2016</p>

                    <p>This update is preventing Windows Defender from starting. &nbsp;I do not have any other Virus/Malware protection on the computer nor has this computer ever had anything but Windows Defender. &nbsp;The update tab and history tab are both grayed out in my Defender UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Getting the latest definitions manually.</p>
<p>2. Running the Microsoft Fix it program.</p>
<p>3. Rebooted the computer.</p>
<p>4. Restarting Windows Update Service.</p>
<p>5. I have tried the "Signature Update" fix</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried these and a couple others.</p>

            I spent 2.5 hours in chat with Microsoft Tech support last night and they did some troubleshooting and reinstalled Windows 10. &nbsp;Still no fix for the Windows defender not starting issue. &nbsp;I'm back in chat with them today, but every time they reboot my system
 I have to get a new support rep which is aggravating. &nbsp;Last night the rep was able to reboot and reconnect.
