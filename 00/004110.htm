    <title>Add to my OneDrive option missing in OneDrive for Business - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Add to my OneDrive option missing in OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    <p>In personal version, when people share file/folder with you, you are able to see them in the "<strong>shared with me</strong>" tab, and there is a option call "<strong>add to my OneDrive</strong>". This allow user to organize shared file/folder with their
 own preference. This function is missing in the OneDrive Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only place I can see file/folder that shared with me is in the&nbsp;"<strong>shared with me</strong>" tab. I can't add those shared files/folders to my OneDrive in order to organize them. I read the comment from @AllanLu_MSFT on another related post (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/office365-for-business-add-to-my-onedrive-option/dae13d2f-3832-42f5-aa10-be6716cd7d4d)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)"><em>"As in OneDrive for Business, the 'Shared with Me' folder is just a view not a real folder, it is used to view the files or folders which other users in the same organization have shared with us.
 And the shared files or folders are still stored in other users' libraries." &nbsp;</em></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)"><em>--</em></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">AllanLu_MSFT</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that the ownership of the file/folder is still within the people who shared the file/folder with me, but having the ability to "add to my OneDrive" to reorganize them with my preference is supper helpful. As a business version of OneDrive, I think
 this is a very import function that somehow missing. It will be very helpful to have this function especially when you are working on multiple projects and different people are sharing files/folders with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Powerpont 2013 audio plays too quickly on slides - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rocky298  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpont 2013 audio plays too quickly on slides</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a weird issue using PPT 2013.&nbsp; I am creating a slide show with audio.&nbsp; I record from the beginning and then play back the audio on each slide.&nbsp; On some slides (slide #2 in particular) the playback&nbsp;starts normal but then speeds up at a furious
 pace producing a totally garbled effect.&nbsp; This happens on other slides too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using all of the default settings for slide show recordings.&nbsp; And I have successfully recorded a presentation with audio in the past without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing that is different about this presentation is that I created all of my slides in one&nbsp;master presentation, and then created several distinct presentations from the master.&nbsp; I don't see why this would make a difference but I mention it here in case
 it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested my headset by recording into sound recorder and everything&nbsp;there is working properly.&nbsp; I would hate to record&nbsp;the&nbsp;audio for each slide separately as I use animations&nbsp;on some of the slides and PPT keeps the timing in sync when it does the recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrated, and appreciative of any help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update #2:</p>
<p>I don't think the problem is due to how the individual presentations were created from the master presentation.&nbsp; It seems intrinsic to Powerpoint 2013.&nbsp; On some kind of random basis, the audio doesn't record correctly.&nbsp; My workaround is to review the narration
 (audio) on each slide.&nbsp; If it is garbled, then re-record.&nbsp; Sometimes the audio control is present, but there is no playback as if only silence was recorded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update #1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a brand new presentation and recorded audio.&nbsp; It worked as designed.&nbsp; Seems that copying out the slides did produce this weird side-effect.&nbsp; Still don't have a workaround for creating separate presentations from my master presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try clearing all timings and recordings from the presentations where the audio problem appears.&nbsp; Same audio problem.&nbsp; Very, very weird.</p>

            <p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>1. Created a "master" presentation with approx. 30 slides.&nbsp; Since I planned to produce separate presentations, some of the slides were title slides, the rest were standard (bullet point) slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Opened a separate file for an individual presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. With both presentations open in PPT, I copied slides from the master, and pasted them into the individual presentation.&nbsp; Repeated this for 5 separate presentations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Opened each individual slide and recorded a narration from the beginning.&nbsp; The audio here never played correctly.&nbsp; I tried it on the first presentation and the second presentation.&nbsp; No matter what I did the audio did not play correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------</p>
<p>Since my copies are suspect, I tried this as a workaround.&nbsp; Now I create a brand new presentation, and the use the "New Slide =&gt; Reuse slides" menu option.&nbsp; This works better but it still f***s up the audio on the second slide.&nbsp; Now the narration on the
 first presentation, second slide is quite long.&nbsp; Maybe that's the culprit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a limitation on the length of a slide's audio?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------</p>
<p>I shortened the narration (narration == audio) on the second slide and it sounds okay on playback.</p>
<p>My new theory is that "long" audios ~1.5 minutes overflow some internal buffer.&nbsp; My Windows hardware has 2 Gb of memory and AMD64 Athlon&nbsp;processor.&nbsp; Not the newest PC but I'm recorded using Camtasia just fine on this machine.&nbsp; I wish a Microsoft technician
 would read this post and respond.</p>

            <p>At this point I would like to exonerate the cut/paste movement of slides from the master presentation to the individual presentations.&nbsp; I think the most likely cause is lack of resources on my machine, specifically memory as I only have 2Gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I record I close all other applications (esp. all browser windows) and disable all unneeded services.&nbsp; This increases the success rate for the audio for each slide to about 80%.&nbsp; To put this another way, when I record audio for 10 slides, about
 2 need to be re-recorded.&nbsp; The re-records always seem to work.</p>

<p>thank you for post on Windows Phone Forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see the file on the phone when it's not synced with your pc? Can you see them on the pc?</p>
<p>Did the sd card come with the phone? Can you see it using File Explorer and not the app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May be you need to convert the file format to one suported by your Windows Phone (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/music/music-and-videos-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/music/music-and-videos-faq</a> ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to remove the sd card, restart your phone and your pc and try again.</p>

<h2>            Speeding up a PivotTable refresh when connected through SQL Server</h2>
                    I have a large set of data connected to a PivotTable through a SQL Server connection that takes a very long time to refresh. There are three steps, (1) Connecting to Datasource - this happens quickly and is, as I understand it, where the query is running,
 (2) Reading Data, the speed of which is based on the number of records and connection quality, and (3) Updating Fields - what is happening here? It often takes a very long time? Is there something in the structure of the pivottable that I can change to improve
 this?

<p><br />
How big about your data?</p>
<p>Is this problem for random or always?</p>
<p>Have you troubleshoot Network?</p>
<p><br />
You can follow this method to troublshoot database.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check that the query is selecting the right data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>For reports based on external data, review the query in Microsoft Query to make sure it is retrieving the data you want.</li><li><br />
<strong>Check the availability of the source database</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you can still connect to the external database and view data.</li><li><br />
<strong>Check available memory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>If a report is not valid when you open a workbook, close any files and quit any programs you don't need so that more memory is available, and then try to open the workbook again.</li></ul>

</p>
<p>i do not have more work cells to use,&nbsp; after a certain column i will place the cursor, so the start point will vary,&nbsp; and i do not want the selection vb to go past the 40th column,&nbsp; no matter where i select.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Headset BH-108 unable to use for music on Lumia 710</h2>
                    
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have this new lumia 710 and BH-108 Bluetooth headset. Now I have paired those two devices successfully and using Bluetooth headset for receiving calls with no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However whenever I play any music or Video (while headset is connected) it plays through the phone speaker and not through the headset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want music to play through bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know any settings for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atul</p>

<p>I think it just depends on the Profiles supported by the devices and how it's configured to work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lumias are probably set so that any video/Music audio is only works with a device that supports A2DP (stereo bluetooth)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereas audio during a phone call&nbsp; will work with a device supporting HFP/HSP Profiles (Handsfree/Headset Profiles)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your laptop probably works differently and sends audio to your headset regardless of what profile it supports</p>

<p>I've been uning OneNote for a while now.&nbsp; I recently installed a second drive and&nbsp;am running&nbsp;Win 7 on it,&nbsp;and wish to copy data to&nbsp;this drive,&nbsp;in the location where&nbsp;Windows 7 would store OneNote data.&nbsp; I found the data on the drive where it was created,
 under XP Pro, but where exactly on the Win 7 parttion (a whole different physical drive) does OneNote store data that users create?&nbsp; I want to copy my old data, from that other drive, to the proper place so that when I open OneNote (under Win 7) all those
 files that I previously created with OneNote will appear.&nbsp; TIA.</p>

<p>The default location is in the "OneNote Notebooks" folder under the My Documents folder in the user profile.&nbsp; There should be a folder with the same name as each Notebook in OneNote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look under</p>
<p>C:\Users\{your_username}\Documents\OneNote Notebooks</p>
<p>to start.&nbsp; You can verify the location of each Notebook by right-clicking each Notebook in OneNote and selecting "Properties".&nbsp;</p>
<p>You didn't mention if you're going to keep both operating systems or if this is a migration to W7 - If you're going to be using the original partition you should move the Notebooks to a central location accessible by each of your user accounts under both
 operating systems.&nbsp; If you're migrating away from WXP, copy the folders from C:\Documents and Settings\{yourname}\My Documents\OneNote Notebooks"&nbsp;in WXP to the path above under W7.</p>
<p>OneNote won't automatically pick up the Notebooks in this location you will need to open each one.&nbsp; I find this easier to do in Explorer.&nbsp; Right-click on each folder that you want to reopen as a Notebook in ON and select "Open as Notebook in OneNote" from
 the context menu.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word 2010 clash between different first page header and odd even - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruceofficer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 clash between different first page header and odd even footers</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a manual which will be printed double sided. The page numbers are to be in the footers and mirrored to be on the outside of the facing pages when the book is opened i.e. on the left on even pages and on the right on odd pages. In the
 footer, against the centre margin, goes the document reference number. I've set this up using the 'different odd and even pages' option for headers and footers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have to have the chapter title as a running header on all pages EXCEPT the first page of each chapter (I've set each chapter up as a different section). This chapter header will left aligned regardless of whether it appears on an odd or even numbered
 page. The only way I could find to do this was to check the 'different first page' box in the headers and footers tab of the ribbon bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM: how can I deal with the fact that new chapters (sections) can begin on odd or even pages, and therefore I can't determine whether the page number should go on the right in the first-page-of-section footer (as it would for a section beginning
 on an odd page number) or on the left. Many documents I've seen get round this by specifying that new chapters can ONLY begin on an odd (right) page, but for this document that would incur an unacceptable number of blank pages as there many short chapters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't work out how to resolve this apparant clash between the format I want pointing me towards&nbsp;an odd / even page scheme for the footers but a first-page-of-section / subsequent-page-of-section scheme for the headers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I need is either:</p>
<p>1. some way to suppress the running chapter title in the header on the first page of every chapter (section) WITHOUT having to create a different-first page footer</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2. some way to force the first-page footer to know whether it is an odd or even page and have the page number on the right or left respectively (and the document number on the opposite side)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>3. some way to specify separate odd / even footers to be used in the footers only, while the headers use a quite separate and independent scheme of first / subsequent page headers</p>
<p>WITHOUT</p>
<p>giving in and having every new chapter begin&nbsp;on an odd-numbered page!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping someone can help with this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
{ IF { = INT({ PAGE } / 2) * 2 } = { PAGE } { PAGE } "" }<br />

    <title>Making 1 row in Excel duplicate based on a cell value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dreacula  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making 1 row in Excel duplicate based on a cell value</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to make a row in a worksheet in excel duplicate into several rows in another worksheet in the same workbook based on a cell value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to enter the number of aliquots derived from a sample and carry all the information over to another worksheet but duplicate the row's information based on the value I put in the 'aliquots' column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See pic - So for line 2 I would like for this in the 2nd worksheet to turn into 4 rows (based on the value in column R) instead of just one. And for line 3 I would like for this to become 2 rows instead of just one. And for line 4 I would like this to stay
 as only 1 row.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f088045c-f7bb-4adb-a315-efa1f7ac0824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f088045c-f7bb-4adb-a315-efa1f7ac0824" /></a></p>

<p>I am assuming that you want to copy all over in one operation and not row by row as data is entered in the source data sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is always good policy to&nbsp;back up your workbook first in case the code does not perform as you expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Following guidelines to install the VBA code in case you require them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alt and F11 to open the VBA editor window</li><li>In the VBA editor select menu item Insert -&gt; Module</li><li>Copy the VBA code below and paste into the VBA editor.</li><li>Edit the code where indicated with the comments in the code (Comments will be green when pasted into the VBA editor.
<em><strong>Only 2 lines with comments require editing by you</strong></em>.)</li><li>Close the VBA editor (Cross very top right of VBA editor window)</li><li>Save the workbook as Macro enabled.</li><li>Ensure macros are enabled. See help for how to do this. (Option to "Disable all macros with notification" should be OK.)</li><li>If Developer ribbon not displaying then right click anywhere in one of the ribbons and select "Customize the ribbon". On the right side of the dialog check the box against "Developer" and click OK.</li><li>To run the macro, on the Developer ribbon select Macro icon (towards left in Code block) and then select the macro name (CopyData) and click Run.</li><li>You can also insert a button on the worksheet to run the code and if you require guidelines to do so then please get back to me.</li></ol>

    <title>Mail Merge Word Documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ceels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge Word Documents</h2>
                    <p>Using Office 2010, I do alot of mail merge letters using Word and&nbsp;Excel.&nbsp; Normally I&nbsp;use the same&nbsp;main Word document which I merge with various Excel files.&nbsp; In one case the main document is a dotx file, in another case it's a docx file.&nbsp; At the end of the
 mail merge I save each letter as an individual Word file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I later go to open a saved letter, I get a prompt stating Opening this document will run the following SQL command, then gives the data source and asking if you want to continue.&nbsp; If you answer yes, the file opens.&nbsp; With&nbsp;some letters, it then says it
 cannot find the data source, then gives a Select Data Source dialog box - eventually when you click cancel the letter opens.&nbsp; This is because the letter thinks it is linked to a previously used&nbsp;data source, not the one used to create the letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I want to be able to email the letters to various managers for signing.&nbsp; I used to send pdf files but some&nbsp;of the managers like to use an electronic signature so I need to send the Word file.&nbsp; I think these messages will confuse them -
 especially the second example where they get 3 messages before the file will open.</p>
<p>

            <p>Your mailmerge main documents should indeed give the SQL prompts. You mentioned having one of them saved as a dotx file; don't do that - use doc or docx files only. All you get with a dotx file is a template (that issues an SQL prompt) from which you create
 a new mailmerge main document - which generates its own SQL prompt. In other words, using a template merely results in two SQL prompts to get you to the same point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you Finish the merge, all you're ever working with is a mailmerge main document, which will generate an SQL prompt next time you open it. There is a way around this, but it's not one I'd advise due to the risk of error:</p>
<p>1. Open the mailmerge main document</p>
<p>2. Preview the desired record</p>
<p>3. Save as a new document&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Choose Start Mail Merge &gt; Normal Word document</p>
<p>5. Press Ctrl-A then Ctrl-Shift-F9 to unlink the mergefields</p>
<p>6. Re-save the document</p>
<p>You should now have a document containing the merged output but no mergefields and no SQL prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the data source that changes each month, one way of handling this is to:</p>
<p>1. Copy one of those data sources to a new file with a generic name like 'MergeSource.xls'</p>
<p>2. Point your mailmerge main document to the 'MergeSource.xls' file.</p>
<p>3. Whenever you need to use a new source, simply copy/rename it to 'MergeSource.xls', then open the Word mailmerge main document.</p>
<p>With this approach, you never need to re-connect the mailmerge main document to a new data source.</p>

            <p>Update:&nbsp; I followed Paul's steps above and found that when I followed Step 4 (Start Mail Merge &gt; Normal Word document) on my main document, everything worked find from there on.&nbsp; I didn't need to unlink the merge fields - could have just been my particular
 document.</p>
<p>Again, many thanks to Paul for this, and also the advice of not using a .dotx file as my main.</p>

<h2>            E51 and Quickoffice</h2>
                    Hi all.<br />
I bought my Nokia E51 today, and loaded all the updated software on my PC. I also transferred a few Word doc files. However, trying to open them with Qucikoffice, I got the error message "unable to open file". It was only a small file to test things. Maybe
 I have a faulty program installed? Is there anywhere you can download and reinstall the Quickoffice software (not the Premier version)?<br />
Thanks,<br />

            You mean you've bought and installed the Premier version of Quickoffice and it gives you this error when you want to open your document for editing?<br />
I've read somewhere that only few models have enough free RAM to handle editing 100% properly so maybe it's because of this.<br />
As for reinstalling the preinstalled version - do a hard reset to your phone or if it doesn't work try the Nokia Software Updater and when it asks you to reinstall with same version choose "yes".

            OK... dumb question now. How do you do a hard reset? I've selected "restore factory defaults". Is a hard reset something different?<br />
I can't even VIEW items on my phone!<br />

Does the issue occur only with university website?<br />
<br />
</span><span>This problem occurs because Internet Explorer 11 switches Protected Mode settings when certain Web pages are configured in the
<strong><span>Trusted Sites</span></strong> area of the
<strong><span>Security</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong> dialog box. By default, Protected Mode is set to Off for Web sites that are configured in the
<strong><span>Trusted Sites</span></strong> area.<br />
<br />
b. Tap or click Tools, and then tap or click Internet options.<br />
c. On the Advanced tab, click to clear the Enable Enhanced Protected Mode check box under Security.<br />
d. Tap or click OK.<br />

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee_sign</a> you can hold down the Alt key and press 8377 on the number pad (not the numbers at the top of your keyboard).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note the Wikipedia article also says:</span></p>
<p><span>“<i>On 18 May 2011, Microsoft released an update to Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems to include support for this new Indian rupee symbol. This update includes font support, locale changes, and
 keyboard support.[30] With the Windows update, it is now possible to use alt code text entry to obtain the Indian Rupee symbol - Alt 8377.</i>”</span></p>
<p><span>therefore you may need to make sure all the latest updates are applied to your version of Windows and Office via Windows Update (<a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</a>).</span></p>

            Rich, I see this in both 2010 and 2013. No 2007 here at the moment but I see no reason why it should not be available on that version.
<div><br />

<p>In the preview build10130 I keep getting a download which I haven`t asked for. It`s called Cyota.swf I can find plenty of stuff sounding a lot like it but not quite the same. Any ideas what it is? it has downloaded itself half a dozen times now. It`s sitting
 in my downloads folder. Scanning it doesn`t reveal anything suspicious</p>

            Just manually copy your documents. Office 2007 reads all previous Office files in&nbsp;general.

    <title>Is there a way to find the Product Key serial code for previously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> proditor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to find the Product Key serial code for previously purchased Microsoft Office products&#63;</h2>
                    


A year ago I bought a Notebook PC and a Product Key for Microsoft Office 2010. I redeemed the Product Key online and was able to use the programs; all was fine until recently. A short while ago, my PC crashed and I had to reset it. All my files were gone, every program I'd downloaded onto this hunk of **** was gone, as per usual - which means that all my Microsoft Office software was gone as well.  



I had predicted an event like this, which is why I recorded my Product Key serial code into a Notepad file...that was on my computer...before it crashed...and I didn't back it up to an online/outside source. In a last effort, I scoured all my files strung about the house and I couldn't find the original, material Product Key (I think I may have thrown it out).  



I obviously don't want to go out and buy it again as I'd rather not throw money away, but without the Product Key, I don't think I'll be able to download Microsoft Office software. Is there any way for me to access these previo

I understand your concern and will assist you with this situation.<br />

A quick question before proceeding:<br />
<br />
How did you purchase the Office suite? Is it online or from a retailer?<br />
<br />
If you had purchased the Office suite online, look for order confirmation email which would have been sent to the linked email account.<br />

Check the following link for instructions on how to replace a lost or damaged Microsoft Office product key and see if it helps:<br />

            Correct, even if you are able to download an installation file, you won't be able to run it for very long without your product key.<br />
<br />
You say you "redeemed" your key online. Does that mean you had a 27 character PIN that you had to submit online to get your actual 25 character Product Key?&nbsp; If that is the case MS has no record of the Product Key that you can access.<br />
<br />
If you bought an online download, then you can return to the online store site, use your email address to log in to your "online account". The history of your purchases will be in there, including your product key and installation file download link.<br />

<br />
OK, that closes that door. If you had bought an online download, there was a chance that the information would have been saved in an "online account". Boxed CD's from retailers don't have that backup.<br />
<br />
If you bought just a Product Key Card and don't have any backups of your old system it appears to me that you have lost your copy of office.<br />
<br />
Losing the 25 character product key is effectively the same as dropping a $100 bill on the street.&nbsp; It is gone. The bank (or MS) will not replace it without very strong proof it has been destroyed (ie the paper ashes or shredded remains for the bank, strong
 proof of purchase for MS) so you will have to replace it by "spending" another $100 at the bank (buy another copy of Office from MS).&nbsp; sorry.

            <p>Hi Allen, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>You can try to follow these methods, in order to fix this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><u>Method 1</u>: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try using Internet Explorer (No add-ons) to make sure that page isn’t rendering incorrectly because of an incompatible add-on. You can do this by:<br />
<div>1. Click on <strong>Start</strong>.<br />
2. Click on <strong>All Programs</strong><br />
3. Click on <strong>Accessories</strong><br />
4. Click on <strong>System Tools</strong></div>
<div>5. Click on <strong>Internet Explorer (No add-ons)<br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><u>Method 2</u>: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Delete the browser cache and check. Follow these steps to do so.<br />
<div>a. Start Internet Explorer 11.<br />
b. On the <strong>Tools </strong>menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>. If you can't see the Tools menu, press Alt to display the menus.<br />
c. Click the <strong>General</strong> tab.<br />
d. Under <strong>Browsing History</strong>, click <strong>Delete</strong>.<br />
e. In the <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong> dialog box, click to select the following check boxes, and then click
<strong>Delete:<br />
Temporary Internet Files , Cookies , History</strong><br />
f. Click <strong>Close</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong> to close the <strong>
Internet Options</strong> dialog box.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><u>Method 3</u>: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also try to reset Internet Explorer settings and check.<br />
Refer to the link :&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11-win-7</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong><em>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.
</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><u>Method 4:</u> </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may need to reset the location of your Favorites to the default location. This can be done by:<br />
<br />
· Click <strong>Start</strong><br />
<br />
· Click <strong>Computer</strong><br />
<br />
· In the address bar, paste this location: <strong>%userprofile%<br />
</strong><br />
· Press <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard<br />
<br />
· Make sure you have a <strong>Favorites </strong>folder listed in the <strong>%userprofile%</strong> folder<br />
<br />
· If there isn’t a <strong>Favorites</strong> folder listed, create a <strong>new folder</strong> and name it Favorites<br />
<br />
· Right click <strong>Favorites</strong><br />
<br />
· Click <strong>Properties</strong><br />
<br />
· Click the <strong>Location tab</strong><br />
<br />
· Click <strong>Restore Default</strong><br />
<br />
· Click <strong>OK</strong><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><u>Method 5</u>: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn’t help, you can edit the registry to direct the Shell:Favorites location to the location of your Favorites folder. You can do this by:<br />
<br />
<br />
· Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the run dialog<br />
<br />
· In the Open:field, type <strong>regedit</strong><br />
<br />
· Click <strong>OK</strong><br />
<br />
· Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> (if prompted)<br />
<br />
· Navigate to <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders<br />
</strong><br />
· Right click <strong>Favorites</strong><br />
<br />
· Click <strong>Modify</strong>…<br />
<br />
· In the Value data: field, paste <strong>%userprofile%\Favorites<br />
</strong><br />
· Click <strong>OK</strong><br />
<br />
· <strong>Exit</strong> Registry Editor<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: <em>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a similar problem with my favorites. I click the star, and nothing appears.

<p>
</p><p>Feeds and history work. I tried all troubleshooting methods above. I also tried re-importing my bookmarks, but get stuck on the stage "Select a destination folder for your favorites." No Folders ever appear and clicking "Import" does nothing.&nbsp;</p>
