            Camera with new firmware is still a bit grainy, though I havent tried all features much since its new. Havent tried the old firmware. I also realized the secret is lighting, if you know how to adjust too, then end result is good.

            Well I can't speak for other countries but the Nokia Service Point in Plymouth (carphone Warehouse) don't have it.<br />
<br />
Why is it that there is so much confusion/mystery about firmware updates? There are so many different ideas going around about how firmware gets approved, who is involved and where and when it is available.<br />
<br />
Why doesn't someone from Nokia clear this all up once and for all? All I want to know is why the N93 firmware update isn't on the website and why is it some people have it and others don't...and it doesn't seem to be an operator/country thing that determines
 this.<br />
<br />
Nokia...can we PLEASE have some clarity? We are your customers. We pay your salaries.

            Hi<br />
<br />
I can only tell you what I was told by a very nice woman on the UK call centre line. My questioning was similar to yours (but without the salaries comment :)) Okay this is not an exact quote but here it goes:<br />
<br />
a) The sw is released and the non branded versions are avialable very quickly. They are released into the service network (where the service companies must uploaded it) and now into this Nokia Software updater.<br />
<br />
b) Then some countries have Country managers (Nokia managers) that must approve the new sw ( for local variant reasons). This usually happens quite fast however it could be up to a week after the initial release above. These tend to be more in APAC and India
 than europe<br />
<br />
c) Finally for branded phone then the Operators must approve their variant sw. This can happen relatively fast with the smaller operators. It can be fast with the Mega operators but sometimes can take a long time depending on the time of year (eg during christmas
 season they are testing and approving newly released phones and sw and cannot approve an upgrade right away etc.<br />
<br />
So in short it takes a few weeks for the rollout. For N91 the sw is 2.10 and it only seemed to start last week so it may be this week and possibly another before everyones sw is there.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Sorry I answered this thinking it was an N91 thread. I suspect the same system is there for N91 however the sw versions etc and recent timing I just stated should be ignored<br />

<h3> fdigital01  say:</h3>
<h2>            why is the install of windows 10 so frustrating</h2>
                    <p>it is pretty clear Microsoft don't want feedback as it is so difficult to actually find somewhere to give it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, with the recent install of windows 10 - the screen messages are misleading and it is unclear whether something is happening in the background or whether the process is hanging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall my experience with windows 10 is mediocre.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to think a bit more carefully about the user experience instead of trying to force their products down our throats.</p>

            I've done over 75 upgrades for friends and customers and have had no real problems, and following this forum and reading problems that people are having&nbsp; I see most are due to systems that have so many 3rd party programs installed (virus/malware/speed
 boost) or have outdated sound/video cards, I give MS a lot of credit for making an Operating System that works across many different platforms I always wonder about the fruit company who has total control of design and building of the systems...Think about.

                    <p>I can enter a new contact (or modify and existing one) on my Nokia phone and almost immediately it appears on outlook.com account (as seen on Outlook 2016 on my PC).&nbsp; However if I do the same on the PC, the contacts on the phone do not sync.&nbsp; This problem
 arose a few months ago - it did not seem to be directly attributable to any other actions.</p>

<p>Hmm, it should show as long as you are using the same Live ID on your device and on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a question, on the PC, are you adding you adding the contact using the People app (i'm assuming you are using Windows 10) or are you adding it via Edge or I.E. via the web?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the People app, try it via the outlook.com web page just to see if it works (or visa versa if you are doing it that way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you are using the People app on your PC, are you adding the contact to your Live account?</p>

    <title>Office keeps asking me to enter the product key over and over&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisvanroekel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office keeps asking me to enter the product key over and over&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased the hard copy of Office Home &amp; Student 2010 a couple years ago and it has been working great. I never installed Access on the original install. Tonight, I put in the disk and made the changes to activate Access as well. It had me put in the
 product code and it successfully started configuring. When I open Access it asks for the product key again, so I enter it and it successfully starts configuring again. It then says to close Access and open again. So I do, and it asks me for the product code
 again! It keeps going in this cycle over and over.<br />
<br />
It is saying that the product code is valid, so that is not an issue.<br />
<br />
And now none of Office will work, like Excel or Word. I get the error message "Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010 cannot verify the license for this product. You should repair the Office program by using Control Panel." I have tried this and it does the
 exact same thing.<br />
<br />
Any advice? I literally can't get any office program to open now all of a sudden!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Chris<br />

            <p>Firstly, if you had LOOKED at the specification for Office Home and Student you would have seen that IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A FULL VERSION OF ACCESS. What you have is a TRIAL version, which cannot be activated with your H&amp;S key.</p>

            Well, I've done a system restore back to two days ago and the other Office programs still won't work. I can't believe just me trying to activate Access has caused this much trouble! I will now try to completely uninstall Office and reinstall, unless there
 are another ideas? What a nightmare over something so small...<br />

<h2>            How do I lower the baseline of a picture bullet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a picture bullet that takes up more than one vertical text line and would like to align the top of the bullet with the top of the text, or at least the middle, but have been unable to figure out a way. I've tried adding white space above the picture,
 but it only lowers the entire line of text where the bullet is located. Here's an example of how it looks now:</p>

            <p>Okay, I think your Word version was reported incorrectly. If you have the Developer tab, then you definitely don't have Word Starter. I'm away from the computer where I created this, but I'll try to remember the steps I used:</p>
<ol>
<li>I inserted a picture, sized it to "bullet size," and set the text wrapping to In Line With Text.</li><li>With the picture selected, I inserted a frame.&nbsp;I have an <strong>Insert Frame</strong> button on the QAT, but you can use the button in the
<strong>Legacy Forms</strong> palette of the <strong>Legacy Tools</strong> in the
<strong>Controls</strong> group on the <strong>Developer</strong> tab.</li><li>You'll need to remove the border from the frame, so select the frame (not the graphic in it) by clicking on the hashed border. You'll then be able to use the
<strong>No Border</strong> button on the <strong>Borders</strong> dropdown in the
<strong>Paragraph</strong> group on the <strong>Home</strong> tab.</li><li>I found that the graphic in the frame (which is now in its own paragraph) had the same formatting as the paragraph in which I'd inserted it. That happened to be Normal, so it had 1.15 line spacing and 10 pts Spacing After. I had to set it to Single with
 no spacing to make the text wrap correctly around the frame. You can also adjust the "Distance from Text" in the
<strong>Format Frame</strong> dialog (double-click on the frame border to access that).</li><li>Once you've got the framed graphic sized and placed to your satisfaction, select it and press
<strong>Alt+F3</strong>. This will open the <strong>Create New Building Block</strong> dialog with AutoText selected as the default. Type a name for the entry (you can also change the gallery if desired) and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>You should be able to insert your bullet by typing the first four letters of the entry name and pressing
<strong>Enter</strong> when you get the AutoComplete suggestion, but if that doesn't work, you can type a few letters and press
<strong>F3</strong> or use <strong>Insert | Text | Quick Parts | AutoText</strong>. The second bullet in my screen shot was inserted this way.</li></ol>
<p>My example was just a rough-and-ready trial, but you should be able to duplicate it using your graphic. It's nowhere near as convenient as a true bulleted style, but at least it's a workaround.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Office 365 Problem with AutoRecovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancy3243  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Office 365 Problem with AutoRecovery</h2>
                    <p>Does this work in Windows 10 Office 365.&nbsp; Specifically I'm testing on an Excel file.&nbsp; Closing without saving changed but no Auto Recovery file found.&nbsp; I believe under Options the location I have entered is incorrect.&nbsp; How can this be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>Although no one at Microsoft knows this, and I am stubborn I think the following is the answer:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>New Info tested and this worked although Microsoft Support doesn’t seem to be aware and simply will not check out the options available:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Save AutoRecovery files every 1 minute</span></p>

<p><span>Keep the last unsaved version if I close without saving.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Excel<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>C:\Users\NANCY\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel</span></p>

<p><span>Word<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>C:\Users\NANCY\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word</span></p>

<p><span>PowerPoint<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>C:\Users\NANCY\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\PowerPoint</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><em>Following the above info, Unsaved file
<strong>WILL NOT</strong> appear in Excel ‘Recovered Unsaved Workbooks’ This is only if you have a crash.</em></span></p>
<p>

</p><p><span>A Search *.xlsb will locate the Excel UnsavedFiles</span></p>

<p><span>A Search *.asd will locate the Word UnsavedFiles</span></p>

<p><span>A Search *.ppt will locate the PowerPoint Excel UnsavedFiles</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this works for Unsaved files (Not AutoRecovery).&nbsp;
</span></p>

            <p>Just above the section that Harsha described, look for the "Save Autorecovery information every ...."</p>
<p>Make sure that option is set, and make note of the time interval on that option.&nbsp; Default is usually 10 minutes, I like to bump it down to 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For autorecover to work you have make some sort of change (anything) in the file AND the time interval has passed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I like to set the AutoRecover location to the same place as my "default local file location".&nbsp; That way, when there are "orphan" recovery files I see them and can delete them if they are not required.&nbsp; Myself, I spend most of my time in Word,
 and since I have a chronic problem with Word crashing I tend to have LOTS of these orphan files that I have to periodically clean up. Otherwise, I eventually found that I had a LOT of wasted space used by these orphan recovery files.</p>

            Your question is somewhat ambiguous. If you're looking for how to teach the underlying theory of regression analysis, you're better off going here: &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression</a>.
<div><br />
<div>If you're just interested in teaching the mechanics of placing a trend line on an Excel Chart, Excel Help has some information - the basics are to select the series, right- or control-click and choose Add Trendline from the pop-up menu. Choose the regression
 type you're looking for, and select/modify the options you wish.</div>

    <title>how to export a certificate from a signed message&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d_watson  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to export a certificate from a signed message&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just received a new email certificate form an existing OL Contact. I want to save the new certificate in the existing Contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OL10, I would R-click the sender, add to Outlook Contacts and from the proposed Contact form, Certificates, Export the cert ot he Desktop, Cancel saving the new Contact. Then I'd import&nbsp;the cert from the Desktop&nbsp;into the existing Contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OL13, there is no way I can find to open an Outlook Contact style contact for the sender of an email. I just get the pseudo-Modern style minimalist People from that knows nothing of certificates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions how to save&nbsp;a newly received signing&nbsp;certificate into an existing Outlook Contact?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(and a corollary question) Does ANYBODY at Microsoft actually use Outlook to send and receive X.509 email? This is just an example of the kind of gyrations involved.</p>

<p>double click the signing ribbon icon<br />
click Details…<br />
click the signing layer<br />
click View Details…<br />
click View Certificate…<br />
click Details tab<br />
click Copy to file…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can save it to the Desktop to Import it into an Outlook Contact.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business needs credentials, but can&#39;t remember my password</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having issues with my OneDrive for Business application. It will not sync anymore because my PC with Windows 8.1&nbsp;will not take&nbsp;my password any longer for some months now. I&nbsp;can't use my credentials from the windows credential manager anymore, even not
 in my browser. I am trying to use our SharePoint environment which is hosted externally and uses Windows authentication. I used to save my credentials locally in the credential cache of Windows which worked very well for quite some time. No need for entering
 my password.</p>
<p>However, since a few months, and some updates of MS, my browser (and OneDrive) will not pick up my password any longer. This causes problems with my browser as well as my clients applications (Office 2013 and OneDrive). How can I finally resolve this ?</p>
<p>I have already tried to uninstall OneDrive, resync everything, tried to install Windows 10, but everything remains the same. As I am not using Office 365 for this but, let's say, a hybrid solution, I cannot use the "default" Office connector to SharePoint,
 as this is only limited to Office 365.</p>
<p>But how can I start working with Office to connect to our SharePoint environment without logging on each time ?</p>
<p>Please help me as this is starting to be frustrating. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Home - Synch with iPhone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noelo&#39;kelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Home - Synch with iPhone</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if I appear to be posting a duplicate question!&nbsp; But there is a LOT of confusion regarding the difference between Office 365 Home and Office products.</p>
<p>I am trying out the Office 365 Home (5 user) edition, and have successfully installed that on my Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>I have a number of email addresses connected with different businesses and activities I am involved with.&nbsp; At the moment, all these addresses are set up as POP addresses within my desktop Outlook 2013 system - all working well!</p>
<p>But having major difficulties getting my iPhone to synch my Calender and Contacts.</p>
<p>I actually don't care if my email messages don't synch.</p>
<p>So - to get Calender and Contacts to live synch, what do I need to do?</p>
<p>Should I create a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address, and have that as the default email address for desktop and for iPhone?</p>
<p>Or should I try and convert all the POP accounts to IMAP and duplicate them all on both devices?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>Thanks for reply.&nbsp; I'm a bit confused though.&nbsp; There are dozens of references on MS help sites mentioning&nbsp; Office 365 and iPhone synchronization.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>https://products.office.com/en-us/office-365-home</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/mseea/en_IE/pdp/Office-365-Home/productID.289161200</p>
<p>Both clearly indicating the integration of iPhone and PC Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what EAS is, but Exchange accounts are surely more likely to be in a business setting than a Home system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it does sound like you - and your MVP status would support your opinion on this! - are saying that this is simply not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this was the main reason I was considering O365, I guess I am out of luck!!&nbsp; A real pity because I love the functionality of Outlook, and it would be so convenient to have it's data synched with my mobile devices!!</p>

            <p>I think you misunderstood; Synching the content between Outlook and your iPhone is possible, but it is not Outlook that does the magic. It is either the mail protocol itself (account type) or a 3rd party sync application by Apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With IMAP, you can only sync email and you can't sync anything with POP3. To sync content from these account types with an iPhone, you'll need to use iCloud or iTunes from Apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best solution would be to sync directly with the mail server as you'd always be up-to-date as long as you have an Internet connection. EAS stands for Exchange ActiveSync which is&nbsp;a synching protocol targeted towards mobile devices. You don't necessarily
 need a corporate&nbsp;Exchange server account for this; Outlook.com also offers support for this protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com allows you to configure it with your current POP3 or IMAP address so you can use it without needing to change your address.</p>

<p>It's actually not that bad, it only looks that way because it also contains quite some additional information dealing with some exceptions which you can probably skip over when it doesn't concern you. However, it was important enough for the ones who does
 concern it that I couldn't leave it out or just add some reference. The data migration process&nbsp;is also different between Outlook versions so that is basically documented twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, currently in Outlook you can't select one of your aliases or other connected addresses. This will change however when
<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/news/outlookcom-is-moving-to-office-365-exchange-online.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com starts its migration to Exchange Online</a>&nbsp;(this makes data migration to the cloud a whole lot easier for Outlook 2013 users as well). You can then simply specify one of your aliases or connected addresses in the From field and send out the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, you'd need to create a send-only account in Outlook connected via POP3 to be able to send out as an alias. See:
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Permanent Link to Exclude account from receiving (send only account)">
<p>
</p><p>I don't know when they will open up the Outlook.com Exchange Online Preview to the public; It would save you quite some steps (and require me to rewrite quite a lot&nbsp;of the guide&nbsp;:-D )</p>

<p>Personally, I would not consolidate all your addresses into a single mailbox on the Outlook.com server. That server sometimes has difficulty accessing other mailboxes and it is not well suited for sending mail using other addresses, in my opinion. Instead,
 I'd connect Outlook 2013 directly to each of your mailboxes and let it gather them into separate folder sets. When you reply, you'll be replying through the corresponding mail provider and the sender will always look correct to the recipient. Moreover there
 are scads of limitations to an Outlook.com mailbox, like how many messages you can send each day and how many recipients you can include on any individual message.</p>

<p>Thanks for that. The ongoing difficulty of sync between desktop and mobile with MS Outlook is approaching break point for me!!&nbsp; I've been experimenting using iCloud as a possibility, but cant get Outlook (2013) to sync with that.&nbsp; Lots of comments on the
 web from people having difficulties there.</p>
<p>I think if it's time to look at an Outlook alternative?&nbsp; Problem is, I really like the Contact Categories feature - essential really for me!</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Would there be any benefits associated with that approach versus the iCloud one?</p>

    <title>Smart Tags don&#39;t work Excel 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janbattin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smart Tags don&#39;t work Excel 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Smart Tags don't work for me, at least trying to get the smart tag for Stocks doesn't seem to work.&nbsp; I have MSFT keyed in at A1 - when I click off of it and back on it I never see the purple info.&nbsp; If I go to Excel Options-&gt;Proofing-&gt;AutoCorrect Options-&gt;Smart
 Tags - both Label data with Smart tags and Embed Smart Tags in this Workbook are checked, Show Smart Tags as Indicator and Button is selected.&nbsp; There is nothing under Recognizers.&nbsp; I have another spreadsheet that contains all of my stock info and smart tags
 doesn't work on it either.</p>
<p>Any help and insight is appreciated.</p>

<p>I forgot about the smarttaginstall.&nbsp; Whenever I click on it, nothing happens.&nbsp; I can tell that I've clicked on it because the blue circle becomes active for a second.&nbsp; I've tried troubleshoot compatibility but nothing comes up there either.&nbsp; There's no task
 with that name running, but something must be keeping it from running.&nbsp; Or it is running and I just can't tell it and Smart Tag just doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely I'm not the only one that has had this problem.&nbsp; There's nothing unique about my installation, it was a clean one.</p>

<p>Right now I want Smart Tags just to handle the stock quotes - it used to be an add-in in 2002 and before - but I don't think that works in 2007.&nbsp; Any suggestions of what to use instead?</p>

                    <p>Fairly new to creating my own VBA Macros, and I’m trying to figure out how to reference the value of a cell in my main sheet to specify which sheet to move info to.</p>

 I can change the value on the worksheet instead.</p>

    <title>Is there any way to track&#47;lock&#47;ring&#47;erase a nokia lumia - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there any way to track&#47;lock&#47;ring&#47;erase a nokia lumia 800 with a cambodian sim card using the find my phone service&#63;</h2>
                    My phone was stolen a few days ago and although the service tracked my phone automatically a few days prior to the theft in Cambodia, i cant appear to put a Cambodian number to track the phone again.&nbsp;There is no Cambodian option on the drop down list to
 enter numbers from, and so the prefix +855 cannot be entered. We know the phone is still in use as pictures have been taken from it and automatically uploaded to Skydrive. Any help would be much appreciated.

            <p>Hello Frank:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your Find My Phone question.&nbsp; As you will see on this page from
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windowsphone.com</a>, Cambodia is not a supported&nbsp;country for Windows 7 services.&nbsp; This will prevent you from using the feature in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you contact both the local authorities and your mobile operator in regards to the missing phone.&nbsp; You may be able to supply the local police with the uploaded photos to help with their investigation.&nbsp; The mobile operator should have processes
 in place that allow them to locate the phone or at least determine what area the phone was last used in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>
        </p>
