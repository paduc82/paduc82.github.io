    <title>Windows 10 Compulsory Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> solrosin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Compulsory Updates</h2>
                    <p>There are times in every I.T. person's life when all they want to do is restart a computer or shut it down QUICKLY.&nbsp; The compulsory updates make that impossible without using the power switch.&nbsp; I understand the standpoint of the average user being remiss
 in their duty to update their operating system for security patches, however, this compulsory update mechanism is annoying to those who are just trying to get a job done.&nbsp; I don't want to be doing multiple reboots while working on a system only to have it
 delay me with updates.&nbsp; It makes my job take longer, and frankly, I'm sick to the teeth of it.&nbsp; I'm sure there are many out there who feel this way, as well.&nbsp; Please remove this extremely annoying "feature".</p>

            I'm not an IT professional rather one in training just started a few months ago but acquiring more knowledge on top of the basic knowledge that I already have of Windows systems; I understand your pain though and this is me coming from the standpoint of
 a standard user in fact I just create a post that probably won't be replied to by one of their sleazy representatives but I did it to voice my frustration with what Microsoft has become now: a problem. I've said this to every single rep I've spoken to-"when
 I call Microsoft it's usually every other month concerning a windows update" and when I think of the past I don't remember calling them at all with a problem about windows update. I have threatened again of course to take this court if I even can if it's even
 worth it, or make the appropriate offices aware of how Microsoft is conducting their business currently, making it harder for standard user and IT user alike.

<p>I really didn't like Mail under Windows 10 and could only get it to work with four e-mail accounts and even then it was clunky. The April 2018 download completely disabled Mail and I've been without any e-mail function on my (Windows) laptop for weeks now.&nbsp;</p>

            There's something I'm clearly missing. If you're rebuilding someone's OS from scratch, why do you need to be connected to the internet in the first place? Do the clean install, setup the OS as you like, install whatever applications. Once everything is
 the way you like it, make an image.&nbsp;<em>Then</em> connect to the internet and let the computer go crazy with updates. (Although it shouldn't get too crazy since the ISO has been updated to 1803.)

<p>Well, that's just one instance.&nbsp; It's usually disconnected from the Internet at that point.&nbsp; Loading things that need to be online to load, however, and having the OS want to do an update when you need to do a simple reboot is what's annoying.&nbsp; It has to
 be connected to the network in order to change it to a domain machine. I've had it hold me up during that process if I haven't done it within a short span of time after connecting to the network.&nbsp; There have been remote support incidents where I needed to
 reboot to add/remove software.&nbsp; Seeing "Update and Restart" only when I need a "Restart" option during that process annoys me.&nbsp; That means I'm sitting there waiting for updates before the machine comes back online for me to get back in and continue my work.&nbsp;
 They need to put something in group policy or some such thing so that I can toggle to enable bypassing updates for a reboot or shut down.&nbsp; There's another instance where it's annoying:&nbsp; I'm leaving a job and want to shut down my laptop which has been online
 the whole time.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; UPDATES!&nbsp; Now, I'm sitting there delayed while Windows goes through its update gyrations and I can't power the laptop off and leave.&nbsp; It's a real nuisance.&nbsp; Again, active hours don't count when "Update and..." is the only option
 shown for shutting down or rebooting.&nbsp; Basically, Windows 10's aggressive compulsory update mechanism causes a gigantic hassle for anyone trying to get work done that involves&nbsp;frequently rebooting or shutting down.</p>

    <title>Hearts is three against one&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erreed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hearts is three against one&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Since when is Hearts a game of "three against one"?? Microsoft, next time you get the idea of creating a game, at least go to the trouble of understanding how the game is played! Hearts is each player for themselves, except in your version. All you did
 is create the game where it tries to make the human player lose, using all three of the computer "players" against them. The only way you could make this fair is if the cards of all three computer "players" were displayed as well. The computer "knows" what
 cards I have, so why shouldn't I know what cards my opponents have? You created a game that cheats, and made your own rules in the process.<br />

            Instead of just moving this from a question to a discussion thread, why don't you answer the question?? Explain how Microsoft got the idea that Hearts is played in that manner!! What's the matter, someone asks a question you don't have an answer for so
 you just move it to a discussion? This forum has THOUSANDS of questions where a "Community Star" or "Microsoft MVP" posts what's considered an "ANSWER" yet when the original person responds with another question about the "ANSWER", they are never responded
 to. This forum seems to be just a place for worthless dweebs to boost their ego by getting someone, probably their family, to click their "Found This Helpful" button. Look through the forum, most that say "ANSWER" have further questions which have never been
 addressed. All these pansies are doing is sticking up for Microsoft and defending them, irregardless of how stupid Microsoft's actions are. Hope you got your ego boosted when you moved this to a discussion, instead of being a man and addressing the issue.

    <title>Can a 20GB Hard Drive for the XBox360 Play Original XBox Games&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruggedwig852534  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can a 20GB Hard Drive for the XBox360 Play Original XBox Games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've basically&nbsp;read&nbsp;multiple answers&nbsp;to this question. I've read:</p>
<p>Yes, 95% of original XBox games can play on the 360, if you have a hard drive (and a data transfer connector).</p>
<p>It can't be on the 4GB hard drive, it has to be at least the 20GB external hard drive or better.</p>
<p>It can't be any XBox360, it can only be the XBox360S with the 320GB hard drive.</p>
<p>You have to download an emulation program and than load that into the console as a disk.</p>
<p>You don't have to download an emulation program; you only have to login to XBox Live and the emulation program will later be updated into your system.</p>
<p>The hard drive has to be certified Microsoft XBox360 or the XBox games will not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just went through a chat session with a support tech on here, and he thinks the used 20GB hard drive I have is not authentic Microsoft (even though it has Microsoft and XBox360 written and stamped all over it with labels that don't peel off). So you can
 judge that conclusion for yourself. He also said that when you go to Settings, then Memory, the 20GB hard drive should read "Microsoft" on the screen, otherwise it's not genuine. Mine didn't read that, it just read 6.1 GB (remaining).</p>
<p>Here's the deal. I've spent $50 on XBox games that can't be played on my 360 right now. I could buy a new 20GB hard drive for under $40 and try that one instead, or I could fork out $45 and simply get a used XBox and be done with all of this.&nbsp;However, it&nbsp;would
 be nice to keep everything on one console instead of two.</p>
<p>For the people on here with 20GB hard drives: does it say Microsoft on the screen in the settings for this hard drive, and if so, can you play original XBox games on a non-S 360? This will help my future decisions...thanks.</p>

<p>yes you can play Xbox games on ANY 360 as long as the system has a authentic and not a knock off hard drive attached (old style) or inserted (new style) it does not matter what size drive it just has to be a real and not a fake. &nbsp;I do not recall if it ever
 said Microsoft on the screen of my 360 slim with the internal 250 or not but I know it is a real drive as I can play a few of my old games on it. &nbsp;FYI it is not 95% of all games can play but its a good number as long as the game you are playing is on the 'backwards
 compatibility' list: </p>

<p>you should be fine as long as the drive is real and not fake.</p>

<p>I have an XBox360S; supposedly no hard drive besides the 250GB or 320GB will play original XBox games. On top of that, the 20GB hard drive I have won't even play XBox360 games (it can transfer data to and from the console, but it will not directly play the
 game from the hard drive). So, for all XBox360S buyers, you have to buy at least the 250GB hard drive that fits into the slim itself to play original XBox games; no external hard drive (that I know of) is 100% compatible with the slim version for any kind
 of XBox game, 360 or original. The 4GB flash drive that comes with the "base" slim is OK for most games but it can crash or slow down during intense moments.

<p>The only official hard drives created for the 360S are the 250 gb and 320 gb (which is why only those hard drives are recommended for playing Xbox games on that model). Using any other hard drives means they have been modified in some way to work on the
 360S &nbsp; and does put you at risk for having your console banned.</p>

<p>My problem is solved! So I guess this reply could be entitled: How to play original XBox games on a 360 for dummies. This site only advertises the 320 GB internal HD for the 360S. When someone types in "XBox360 HD" on an Amazon.com search, it lists many
 360 HD's from 20GB up to 320GB. Unfortunately, it does not list a diamond in the rough: the 20GB XBox360S internal HD. It only lists the external 20GB HD for the White 360, that cannot play/save games on the slim version. So, as a last-ditch effort, I went
 to Amazon.com again and typed in "XBox360S HD" (key letter is S), and voila, the very first item listed was exactly what I was looking for, the internal 20GB HD for the slim, and it's brand new, authentic, and only for about $25 including shipping. Now I can
 finally play original XBox games. And by the way, if you are wondering, the 20GB HD does say "Microsoft" on the right-hand side of the screen when you are on the storage device list. Case closed, question answered! Just remember to login with your live ID
 to download the emulation program.</p>

<p>Just to re-clarify, Microsoft no longer make the 20gb hd anymore. &nbsp;The drive you bought was not an official drive. &nbsp;Microsoft have never made the 20gb hd for the Xbox 360S. &nbsp;The only official drives you can buy for the Xbox 360S is the 250gb and the 320gb.</p>

<p>Yes, you are right, it's not an official drive. But it does work, and it does say Microsoft on the right-hand side of the screen in the settings - memory - device window. The drive I have is made by the company "Brainy Deal", and not Microsoft. But it's
 cheap and it works perfectly, and I (and most others on here) do not need 320GB of HD space to play a few games at a time. The "official" Microsoft external 20GB HD didn't work, and this internal one does, so in this case the end justifies the means. &nbsp; &nbsp;

    <title>BSoD error code 0x9f - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toxicworm  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSoD error code 0x9f</h2>
                    
<p>Since a few weeks ago, my computer has started to show a BSoD, titled Driver Power&nbsp;State Failure,&nbsp;every time I shut down and sometimes when I restart.&nbsp; The computer would hang on the shutting down screen for at least ten minutes until the BSoD appears, resulting
 me in doing a forced shut down.&nbsp; After extensively searching through&nbsp;Microsoft' forums and support topics I still haven't found a solution.&nbsp; I ran Debugging Tools for Windows to open a dump file and it revealed a 0x9f error code with an image name of ntoskrnl.exe.&nbsp;
 It has led to me to believe that my ntoskrnl.exe is either corrupt or out of date, but I know that it is not recommended to replace this program unless if loaded off of a Microsoft OS disc.&nbsp; I purchased my PC from Future Shop, so it doesn't have an OS disc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On some of the related solutions to this error message, it indicated that the problem was possibly related to the USB devices connected.&nbsp; The only&nbsp;USB device that I have connected is a OCZ Eclipse Laser&nbsp;Mouse.<br />
<br />
The BSoD has a side effect that if it&nbsp;interrupts a system restart&nbsp;that is required to complete a system configuration,&nbsp;it leaves the configurations unaltered.<br />
<br />
My PC specs are the following:<br />
Manufacturer:&nbsp;Gateway<br />
Model:&nbsp;FX6800-03h<br />
OS: Windows Vista Home Premium&nbsp;64-bit<br />
SP: Service Pack 2<br />
Processor: Intel Core i7 920<br />
<br />
Below is the dump report.&nbsp; I am completely unfamiliar with this program so please let me know what I can do to provide more information if needed.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is a bad driver most likely. Have you added any other new devices or updated drivers just before this<br />
started? Look in Windows Updates too to see if any new drivers were added at that time. Use the utility
<br />
below to read the minidump.<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />
<span><span><br />
</span></span><br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your
<br />
system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party keyboard and<br />
mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Hi jack briscoe,</p>
<p>a. What happens when you try to install PageMaker? Do you get any error message?</p>

</p><p>Is there any way to find the exact contents of an EULA by searching its EULAID? I have tried using Microsoft's EULA search tool, but it doesn't provide the EULAID of what I am searching for. The useterms page also provides a link to Microsoft Volume Licensing,
 where it's probably where I have to search for this EULAID, but I can't seem to find the exact place to retrieve this information.</p>

<h2>            Iphone Hotspot Connectivity</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently been using my Iphone (vodafone) to create a personal hotspot to connect to XBL as my wifi is very poor in my home (thick walls etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been using it fine for 5 days now, with no issues. Was playing a game earlier and got kicked from XBL, looked in the settings and my NAT type has switched from Open to Strict &amp; am also receiving the UPNP not successful message. As you can't change any of
 the settings on the Iphone is there anyway to get this working again? Seems to be lots of conflicting information online.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. When it comes to connecting to Xbox Live via your console with its internet source being a wifi hotspot from a mobile phone, that isn't something that is really recommended. Its a great way to test
 your connection, but over the long term you may find there are some issues, especially when it comes to NAT type, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally speaking, when dealing with Apple products, you would need to be able to log into a router (ex. like with the
<a href="https://www.apple.com/support/airport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apple AirPort</a>) in order to be able to get it functioning normally. In this case since its a hotspot from a mobile, you may need to
<a href="https://support.apple.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Apple support</a> for further information on how to utilize the hotspot for gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to your current internet situation, if possible, would you be able to get the console connected via Ethernet cable? This would actually give you the best experience while doing any multiplayer gaming and has practically no lag at all. If you do
 need help with your connection after that, then you can refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Multiplayer Connection Error Solution</a> for help with
 your NAT type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your Computer to
 put it back to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

<p><strong>Lately I have been having problems with my files&nbsp;disappearing and then reappearing. I'll type up a word document and save it in a specific folder. When i go back to look for it in said folder it is not there. I try to search for it and it is no where
 in the library. I also try to&nbsp;rearrange the folder in a different ways to find the file. Alas, it still does not show up. The way I have to find it is to go into word and hope that the document is in the recently opened documents. If not, I am screwed and
 have to wait for it to&nbsp;magically&nbsp;show up again.</strong></p>
<p>Does any one know what my problem is and how to fix it?</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>kaw003,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen only with Word Documents?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this issue specific to the folder you are referring to?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Boot the computer in safe mode, to do this, follow the steps below,</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Access the advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the
<strong>F8 key</strong> before <span>Windows</span> starts. On the advanced boot options menu select
</span><strong><span>safe mode</span></strong></p>

</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists in safe mode and let me know
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Save the Word Document to a different folder and check if the issue
 persists </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Run an online scan for any threat

<h2>            started 2 accounts can I merge them</h2>
                    Okay I was setting up Windows 8 which hasn't been very easy plus had to restore from carbonite. At 1st it asked for acct name and I accidentally set up 2. Then did all kinds of setting up with one then realized after 3 days of restoring that all my stuff
 was going to the other account. Can I eliminate one of the accounts but also send all the perferences and stuff on that acct over the other one first before I close it?

<p>You would need to source a legal version on a third party selling site, try amazon.com</p>
<p>I assume your netbook supports win7, check that makers site that they provide win7 drivers</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0x40b on Xbox and 0x80072EFD on Store</h2>
                    As you can tell by the title, I am having trouble connecting to everything on Windows 10. Xbox, Cortana can search stuff, but can't connect to the internet herself. I can't even change my password to my computer because it can't connect, yet, Steam, Google
 Chrome, and any other thing that isn't pre-installed on Windows can connect just fine. I have no clue how to fix this and I will appreciate any help I can get. Thanks.

</li><li>Once opened, please click onto 'Hardware and sound'</li><li>Once the page has loaded, click onto 'Devices and Printers'</li><li>You should then see all of the devices that are connected to your device. Is your camera one of them?</li></ol>
<p>If you can locate your camera there, this means that the device has registered with the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then open the file explorer and try and locate the device through the 'This PC' option. Once you have found it, you will be able see the photos and videos you have saved/taken on your device.

<p>
</p><p>This is a camera we are talking about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use the file explorer to access the camera's contents (Photos), you should see new ones as well as&nbsp;old ones.&nbsp;If your trying to find new pictures, that you have taken, you can sort by date. To do this, simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your camera, through the file explorer</li><li>Go into your pictures</li><li>Click onto 'View'</li><li>Click onto 'Date created'</li><li>Then click back onto view</li><li>Then click onto 'Ascending'&nbsp;(If not already selected)</li></ol>
<p>Does this show you the newest pictures you have taken?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does, you can move them across by selecting them and right clicking on the pictures.

            <p>Hey there, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/69801d60-442a-41b7-9bfa-4419330133a9" title="1peacie">
<p>
</p><p>Can you see any new pictures you have taken on the camera, without connecting it to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wanting to see if this could be something with the camera or the computer. Which leaves me one quick question, when you plug your camera into another computer, do any of the new pictures show?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also looking into this to see if I can bring up any other information about this issue.
</p>
<p>Regards, </p>

            <p>No pics and I do not have another computer to try this on.</p>
<p>It was so simple before windows 10 I just plugged camera in and every pic I took was there.</p>
<p>I am not finding new pics anywhere. The Camera is a few months old and a Cannon.</p>
<p>Sure hope you can help me out. Why do they have to&nbsp;take away the ease of&nbsp;working apps to make something</p>
<p>showy. I want to like 10 but slowly losing interest.</p>
<p>Thanks 1Peace</p>

            <p>Hi again.</p>
<p>I have searched and searched, I found 2 new pics..but I had to go to file explorer and click my camera, that was listed.</p>
<p>It came up as a pic and I clicked it and the letters DCIM come up. I clicked DCIM and 2 pics came up.</p>
<p>How do I get them from DCIM to my pic file?</p>
<p>I really don't think the new Windows 10 pic program works at all.</p>
<p>Not happy with it and 2 days of searching and this is all I could find.</p>
<p>Why Why Why do you have to take the ease away just to prove something.</p>
<p>No instructions I have to write you for help...anybody else really dissatisfied with windows 10?</p>
<p>1Peace</p>

            <p>Hey there, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/69801d60-442a-41b7-9bfa-4419330133a9" title="1peacie">
<p>
</p><p>Glad you found where your pictures were. To move them out of the folder, you can right click on them and use the 'send to' option to send them to the appropriate location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also select them all, by holding Ctrl while right clicking onto them. Once you have selected the ones you wanted, you can drag them into the quick access folders. If you hold the photos over the quick access folder, they should display sub folders
 underneath. You can then select the correct sub folder you wish to save them into.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third method, which is the method I use a lot, is to open the another file explorer in the location you wish to send the photos to. Then select the photos you wish to move, and drag them into the other window. This will copy them over to the new location.
 If you wanted them removing from the camera, you could then delete them from the DCIM and empty your recycling bin.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering, were you talking about the&nbsp;AutoPlay&nbsp;when you plugged in your camera?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did, you can turn it on by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Going to Cortana - Next to the start icon on the task bar</li><li>Click into Cortana, and search for '<strong>AutoPlay settings</strong>' - using keyboard</li><li>Click onto '<strong>AutoPlay Settings</strong>' which should open the settings in the settings app</li><li>You can then change your settings from there. </li></ol>
<p>There is also a video here, that I have created for you. </p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After you have done this, please see if the camera photos automatically upload. The bottom option is for photos etc...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, </p>
<p>Regards, </p>

<h2>            Surface Hub &#40;Original&#41; - Slowness using Miracast</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Hub I've been working on the past few weeks, essentially when not a user is not connected to our enterprise wireless and utilizing 1:1 Miracast it seems to be abhorrently slow (Video won't play smoothly, etc.). When it's an internal user
 connected to the same wireless, works flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically my experiences with Miracast haven't been this poor (Utilizing a microsoft dongle for Miracasting to a projector for example)...Is there something I need to configure or change I'm not aware of?</p>
