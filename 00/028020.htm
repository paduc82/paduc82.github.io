<h2>            The calendar in Outlook 2016 is blinking&#47;flickering.</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10 and Outlook 2016 on a PC.&nbsp; I have both an Exchange account and IMAP (gmail) email account on Outlook.&nbsp; After the Windows update last week, my email started blinking.&nbsp; Nothing else is blinking - not even my emails or any other apps.&nbsp;
 I've run outlook / safe and the calendar still blinks.&nbsp; I've disabled all the ad ins and it still blinks.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            As I mentioned, no other apps are blinking.&nbsp; It only happens in the calendar of Outlook is open, and only the calendar blinks.<br />
I'm also&nbsp; noticing that when I'm typing an email (or reply to an email), the typing sometimes stops and then catches up.&nbsp; There's a lag every few seconds.&nbsp; It almost feels like something is trying to "refresh" constantly, stopping the programs from running
 properly.

            <p>After working on this for hours, I figured it out (with NO help from Microsoft I might add).&nbsp; The problem was with the Anniversary update to Windows 10 (as i feared).&nbsp; Specifically the update to Cortana.&nbsp; Once I disabled Cortana, the flickering was gone.&nbsp;
 I was also having issues with my scroll bar in file explorer - it was jumping to the top while I was trying to scroll down.&nbsp; This was also fixed once I diabled Cortana.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn't make it easy to get rid of Cortana.&nbsp; apparently there used to be a way to turn it off which was removed with the anniversary update.&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed the directions on this site and it worked great!&nbsp; http://www.howtogeek.com/265027/how-to-disable-cortana-in-windows-10/&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, I never used Cortana so don't miss it at all.&nbsp; Of course, it would be nice if Microsoft had a fix for the problems they created with this update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

            Good find! I disabled Cortana by going into the Cortana settings. When it asked if I wanted to enable, I said "no" and now the text box that used to say "I'm Cortana, ask me anything" just says "Search the web and Windows." And the flickering/flashing
 is gone!

            Have you gone to the Run command (or command prompt) and typed GPUpdate and run it? &nbsp;That seems to create the flickering for me in Outlook 2016.

<h2>            Error in calculations of &#34;late start&#34; and &#34;late finish&#34; dates</h2>
                    My project is showing errors in calculations of late start and late finish, that are years before the project start date or any tasks (2000 and 2001), causing slack to be calculated wrong. I have two large WBSs combined into one WBS as subtasks, not using
 the master project option for these. The indivduals WBSs don't ahve this problem, but it happens when I add the second one as a subtask. Has this been reported by anyone else?

            <p>John,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I am using MS Project 2010, and I assume we have updated with the latest service pack, but I've asked for a confirmation on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With reference to the structure of the project, what I was trying to say was that rather than creating two subprojects and combining them in a master, which I've done before, I chose to create a single project with two very large summary tasks, all in one
 WBS sequence, like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall Project Summary task</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Large summary task 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Large summary task 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did this because I found that the Visual Reports&nbsp;were buggy when using sub and masters, and I wanted to produce Visual Reports of various kinds from the two projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps to clarify. thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            Patricia,
<div>In a corporate environment it's probably not a good idea to assume all updates are applied so it is good that you are checking but you can actually check yourself by looking at File/Help. Click on Additional version and copyright information on the right
 side middle. At the top of About Microsoft Project window that appears you will see the version number. If SP2 is installed it will be listed. If SP2 isn't shown, then you need to install or have it installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Okay now back to your issue. Thanks for the clarification on your file structure, but now please explain the next to last sentence in your original post ("The individual WBSs don't ahve this problem, but it happens when I add the second one as a subtask").
 What does that mean?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Further questions. Do you have any links on summary lines? Are you in manual or auto scheduling mode? Do any of the tasks have constraints? Are you forward scheduling or reverse scheduling?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I'm able to confirm that SP2 shows, so that's good.</p>
<p>What I mean by "the individual WBSs" is that we developed two WBSs, separately. They represent tasks within a single project. We originally combined the two as subprojects of a master project. They are each at the same point in the hierarchy under the overall
 project summary task, as I noted before.</p>
<p>I do not believe we have links on any summary lines, but will verify that.</p>
<p>There is a mixture of manual and auto scheduling task mode. The first occurring large subtask is&nbsp;manually scheduled, and the second occurring is auto-scheduled except for a small number of manually scheduled tasks.</p>
<p>The only task constraints we use are "start no earlier than".</p>
<p>We are forward scheduled.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Patricia,
<div>If your two WBS files were originally inserted into a master file and then removed, there is a possibility that in the linking process the files developed some corruption and that corruption may be germane to the current problem you are having. I don't
 know that, but it could be a possibility.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Personally I wouldn't use a combination of manual and auto-scheduled tasks. Generally manual scheduling is for initial planning. Once the schedule is figured out, then everything should be auto-scheduled to take advantage of Project's scheduling capabilities.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Normally there should be no constraints on any tasks except for a selected few that are truly independent of any other tasks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Links on summary tasks should only be used for very high level schedules, not for detail working schedules.</div>
<div><br />

 white rectangles labeled with the file name and "XLSX" instead of a normal green "X" cover over a page of black &amp; green cells. Assigned file names appear normally below the generic&nbsp;icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icon display problem can&nbsp;be fixed one-at-a-time by going individually into each file's&nbsp;INFO sheet and pasting in a normal icon graphic copied from the Word app INFO sheet, but obviously, that's not&nbsp;a practical solution.&nbsp; (Oddly, each file with a generic
 icon seems to have a normal-looking icon in its INFO sheet.&nbsp; But when you do the paste, the desktop icon flips to normal.)&nbsp; No satisfactory answers from Microsoft yet, except to advise me to update&nbsp;all my software, and to insist that Office 2016 "is fully
 supported" in Mac OS High Sierra.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have an idea why this icon&nbsp;display problem is happening, and what might be done to fix it, short of waiting&nbsp;for an Apple or Microsoft update?</p>

<p>Hi, Phillip. Thanks for pointing out what I hadn't realized: that the Word and Excel and Adobe PDF "white rectangles" displaying on my desktop are actually
<strong>the files' icon previews</strong>, not "generic icons" as I'd been thinking.&nbsp; Unclicking the "show icon preview" option in the View&nbsp;Options window restored them to the app graphic I'd been looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>Rob</p>

 I was testing...it helps to comment on hardware, BIOS version etc....from my own limited experience (1982) I find graphics to be the starting point in most cases...give it another wack...put the ISO on a bootable external?</p>

    <title>E90 WiFi Pre-Shared-Key With AES - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredcrunger  say:</h3>
<h2>            E90 WiFi Pre-Shared-Key With AES</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia E90 with, according to the Nokia website, the latest version of the Nokia software installed on it. I can connect to wifi access points via WEP (with hidden or broadcast SSIDs) without problems. However I need to connect to an access point, with
 an SSID that is not broadcast, with WPA-PSK using AES. I can't find a setting to allow AES to be used. I have carried a few tests out and the access point can see the mac address of the nokia and provides an ip address for it occasionally but I can't transfer
 any data. My pre-shared key is correct btw!<br />
<br />
I have searched these forums and the manual but I can't find out if the E90 can use AES with WPA-PSK. The access point I'm trying to use works fine with XP and other clients.<br />
<br />
Can you help?<br />
<br />
Thanks
                </div>

            I also have an E90 that does not work with Wifi wpa/wpa2.<br />
(of course a windows machine works), there is no report on E90 on why things do not work, the net is found, it asks for password and then say that it could not connect (I rellay believe that I am typing the preshared password correctly)<br />
Can anybody suggest a reliable way to report this to Nokia ?<br />
I did report it using a way that has no feedback whatsoever (basically Nokia says that they will look into it but they will not contact back).... I am not trusting Nokia anymore...<br />
<br />
Anybody knows anything ?

            had the same trouble with an e90 trying to connect it to sky which is wpa/wpa2.i got it from o2 and went into meticulous detail as to what id be using the phone for.i only had it for 24hours and took it back.i was really disappointed cos i was looking
 forward to having this handset.as mentioned above the laptop works on the sky network along with 2 nokia n80 s i own and again nobody can shed any light on why the e90 wont work.<br />
i mentioned this to my mate and despite my love of nokia handsets he talked me into getting a tytn2 which is just amazing.<br />
so come on nokia get wifi working on this e90 and il be tempted back.

            Me too. It says the WPA key is not correct. I tried with keys from 8 to 24 chars. The E90 is accepted by the access point (no machine restriction) and without WPA I'm able to log in.<br />
<br />
Any solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!<br />

            I tried short and long passwords, only numbers, only chars, nothing.<br />
<br />
... Then I did<br />
- cancel my Access Point from the Settings<br />
- call my WLAN from the start screen (active standby)<br />
- insert my WPA-PSK using the QUERTY keyboard<br />
...<br />
and the connection was established :-) :-)

            Hmmm, it must be your lucky day :-)<br />
Obviously there is something fishy going on, and you have hit the right combination of "parameters".<br />
I did try what you did, but no, it does not work for me.<br />
<br />
P.S. Why do "moderm" devices assume that all users are "incompetent" and cannot make sense of error messages ? Let's have a switch "I know what I am doing, let me know what happens", it would make life easier !

            Since a machine restriction can cause the problem, I'd like to point point out that I had clearly the error message: "WPA-PSK not valid". I. e. the E90 always was accepted by my router.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
WPA-PSK with AES is the "WPA2 only mode" in the phone's security settings. Have you tried that? Also try disabling power save feature to see if that helps.

As far as I can see the options are<br />
<br />
Open network<br />
WEP<br />
802.1x<br />
WPA/WPA2

<br />
need to have WPA/WPA2 in that menu item, then goto next menu item below that one. One of the three available settings there should be for controlling this "WPA2 only". I am sorry, I don't have English as my phone's language so I don't know the exact menu item
 names.

                    I am having lumia 640XL with windows phone 10 installed. I am not able to install latest windows update due to low storage space. OS occupies 5.6GB space and i have moved most of the apps to SD card except few system apps which cannot be moved. Mail and
 messaging app occupies 600MB. I deleted all SMS and removed all mail account but there is no increase in space. 751MB is being shown under temporary files as update and preview builds. I dont see any option to clear it. Overall i am left with around 200MB
 space and windows update needs another 430MB to finish downloading. I am struck now. What to do? Anybody facing this issue. Looks like device with 8GB internal memory is useless with windows. Any work around using SD card to come out this issue?&nbsp;

<h2>            How do I reinstall a one care back up since One Care is no longer supported</h2>
                    I have a Windows One Care back up on a portable hard drive. I want to acess my files. I have an expired version&nbsp; of One Care on my computer running windows XP? When I hit restore on Windows One Care , it says subscription expired and will not do the restore?
 Since Microsoft no longer supports One Care is there anyway to retrieve files?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, WinZip and many 3rd party Zip programs can open and extract files from the OneCare backup zip files. it can be tedious, but you can unzip the files to get to the ones you need. If a file was split across multiple .zip files, you'll need to
 give the parts extensions of .000, .001, .002 etc. and then use a rejoin utility (free) to put the parts together again:</p>

    <title>How to forward to the hidden Outlook.com email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratbaty  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to forward to the hidden Outlook.com email address</h2>
                    <p>You can create a Microsoft ID where the user name is on some other company’s domain (*** Email address is removed for privacy *** for example). You then setup the outlook.com to go get the emails on the btinternet.com POP servers. That all
 works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it can be slow. The outlook.com settings do not allow me to change how often outlook.com goes and gets the emails from btinternet.com, it can seem like forever when you are waiting and you can see the email sitting in the que.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No problem, I thought. Such Microsoft IDs have a hidden email address that you see when you send from them. In a format like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I tried to do an automatic forward from the btinternet account to this hidden address. Unfortunately that comes back with “mailbox unavailable”. Which is a shame, as instead of waiting for outlook.com to drop by and collect emails, they would be forwarded
 instantly they come in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the question is, is there another way of doing this? Perhaps a different form of hidden email address that we could forward to?</p>

<h2>            Migrate existing Power BI license to O365&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We recently migrated our organization's Exchange email service to be hosted by Office 365. Prior to this migration, we also used Power BI and had many licensed users. Can (should) the Power BI applications also be brought into the Office 365 environment
 for administration without having to procure new licenses?</p>

            <p>Hi Mojo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have the "Power BI Pro" version which is the same as the Power BI Pro license in
<a href="https://products.office.com/en/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 E5 subscription</a>, if you are going to use Office 365 E5 subscription, you can quit the independent Power BI Pro service and use Office 365 E5. For more information about this, I would suggest you go to our
<a href="http://community.powerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Power BI forum</a> for expert help. This is a dedicated support channel for Power BI related queries. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are going to use other Office 365 subscription which doesn't have Power BI Pro service, you can use the two service independently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jared </p>

<h3> habanagold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint O365 - Content video type not always displaying a custom thumbnail</h2>
                    <p>I have training videos I have uploaded to my SharePoint site. After they upload, instead of the generic icon\thumbnail being displayed, I go to the properties button and change the thumbnail by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Change Thumbnail</li><li>Capture thumbnail from video</li><li>Start the video and click the Camera Icon</li><li>Save and exit.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Lately, some videos have changed to the thumbnail, but many time now, I am getting a Folder icon instead as shown below. Why is this happening and how to I correct it?</p>

<p>Rena,</p>
<p>By "browser cookies" I assume you mean browser cache as cookies wouldn't affect what gets rendered. The default thumbnail for a video though is not a folder icon so that won't fix this.
</p>
<p>Habanagold - I'd avoid the video content type as it has known issues which render it pretty worthless. Uploading videos with the document content type seems the most reliable method.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel intermittent issue</h2>
                    Heres an odd one. Excel 2010. Highlight a collum and copy. Then go to another collum and use the "Insert copied Cells" option. Well my customer tells me it does only half the time. When it doesn't, he exits Excel, Restarts it, opens the file back up and
 tries the same operation again and it works.&nbsp; Any thoughts? System is Win 7 Enterprise running Office 2010 Professional plus

            He only had one instance running when I saw the failure. He would take for example collum C and right click and copy. Then he would go to say collum F, right click on colllum header and the option would be available in the dropdown, he would select it
 and it just blinked and nothing would change. He closed Excel, reopened his workbook, try the operation again exaclty only this time when he right clicked on the Insert option , it did paste it in there.&nbsp;

<h2>            The Print Preview panel in Word does not show an accurate preview of multiple-pages-per-sheet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to print a very large (many pages) landscape-oriented document. To save on paper, I want to print 4-pages-per-sheet. When I select this option from the bottom of the Print dialog, the print preview area shows the same as it did with 1-page-per-sheet,
 instead of a preview of the actual sheet with 4 pages on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating! I have no idea how this is going to look when I print... what's the point of having a preview at all, if it doesn't show what's going to be on the sheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, when I print -- it puts the 4 landscape pages very small on a portrait sheet, instead of larger on a landscape sheet. Printing 2-pages-per-sheet put two landscape pages side by side on a landscape sheet. Either option is the worst possible choice...
 and I have no idea how to change this, because I can't tell what changes are happening when I make them, because the preview doesn't work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this</p>
<p>

<p>Word is not going to show you what 4 pages on 1 looks like, no matter what magnification you use (sorry Doug). Word's idea is to show you what each page in and of itself looks like, so that you can see that the content is in the&nbsp;right position _on that page_.
 It's not a big leap of the imagination to visualise all four pages on one, so you should get by.</p>
<p>Then, for your problem with the actual printout, it's actually best to let Word just print page-by-page, and then set the printer to handle the four-on-one. Go to your printer properties, and on most modern printers you will see a setting on one of the available
 tabs that allows you to specify the number of pages per sheet, as well as whether the sheet should be portrait or landscape. That will solve your more important problem, I think.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is not what I "visualized". Is it what you visualized? It's counter to what every other app I've ever used has done. And I have no way to know if changing any of the options will make it come out right, because it won't show me an actual Preview of
 my Print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I finally got it to work by going into the PRINTER DRIVER settings and forcing the printer to do it how I wanted. That settings app was written 5 years ago, and yet it DOES manage to have a tiny little pre-visualization of what the page will look like.
 And it by default prints a 4-up landscape page in the way you'd expect, making efficient use of the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting tired of seeing responses to people's legitimate complaints as "you're doing it wrong." I am NOT doing it wrong. My expectations are NOT unreasonable. This particular Word feature is broken. This is version 15 of Word. The Print Preview page
 has had extensive revisions to make it "friendlier"... but doesn't do its basic function, which is to preview the print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I have two issues: </p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-page landscape prints come out in a counter-intuitive orientation, without a way to adjust it.
</li><li>The Print Preview doesn't actually give me a preview of my print.</li></ul>
<p>Both of these need to be fixed. They are bugs, not user error. If they can't be fixed, they should be removed entirely so people know they have to go somewhere else to do it. And hopefully everyone's printer driver has a multi-pane feature.<br />

            <p>Hi Seth</p>
<p>
</p><p>First up, let me apologise. I did not at all mean to sound condescending. So sorry that that came out wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next up, yes, I am also very frustrated with Word's "Print Preview and Print" feature which Microsoft introduced into Office in 2010, and persisted with in 2013. It's the "Jack of all trades, master of none"--it does both print and preview, but previews
 worse than the old preview, and handles printing commands worse than the old print dialog. You can actually still access both of those old tools, I discuss this in my book on Word, and I still tend to use them in preference to the&nbsp;"Print Preview and Print"
 tool. Having said that, even the old preview still gives you a page-by-page preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain a bit more. I wasn't trying to say "you're doing it wrong" but rather something like "you're not thinking about this the way the Microsoft programmers have thought about this" which requires two explanatory notes: 1. I am assuming I understand
 how the MS programmers did think about this, which could be entirely wrong, 2. Even if I did understand correctly, it's not to say that the MS programmers' approach is correct (we all make mistakes, after all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>but first up, in the nasty old days of DOS computers, printer drivers were not handled by the OS, but by the program. So Word, for example, might have drivers installed for a printer, but another program could not have drivers installed for that printer.
 Granted, the printers in those days were also not that great (we're taking dot matrix printers, here!). Windows changed that, allowing printer drivers to be installed to the OS, and all programs could then access those. But note that it is the printer driver
 that determines what the printer can and cannot do, not the program. The best way to access that is via the printer properties.</p>
<p>Next, remember that Word is showing you, in the preview, its pages, not the printer's pages. Fine distinction, and as you have pointed out, not what you needed. I suppose I have just gotten used to this, kind of like a family member with halitosis--you learn
 to live with it and after a while you find that you've forgotten how much you wished they would get it sorted out!</p>
<p>One point though. Print Layout view is not a 100% reflection of what will be printed on every page (more like 99.99%). I have found that with fiddly things like looooong footnotes, you may find print layout view showing one thing, and print preview showing
 something else. In those instances, Print Preview wins--that is what will be printed out.</p>
<p>In other words, what Word's aim is, with print preview (as I understand it) is to show you what it is sending through to the printer, not what the printer is going to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to put it all together. Yes, Word could definitely do a better job of integrating the print settings into the preview. Why not show us what the printer is supposed to do with it? Of course, the one challenge is the plethora of printers out there, all
 with their own settings. You've at least got to sympathise with them on this score.</p>
<p>But as I say, I have learned to live with it. For standard printing tasks, print preview is fine, but the minute I need to do something out of the ordinary (multiple pages per sheet like your task, or booklet creation, etc.) I rather go to the printer options
 than Word's own settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm glad that I could at least have given you a workable solution, even if, as you have said, Word's ability to provide a solution is broken.</p>

            <p>Jaques,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your thoughtful response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that the Microsoft engineers definitely seem to live in their own world. And I'm sure they have lots of issues to consider when designing the app. But on the other hand, Microsoft has deep pockets, and their Office products are critical to their
 continued success, so they should be able to spend some money on User Experience analysis of the app, instead of relying on the engineers to decide how something should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some User Experience design under my belt... and the first thing you need to tell yourself when designing an experience is "assume nothing". Approach the experience as a naive person would. What parts are missing? What parts are too complex? Making
 buttons bigger or adding redundant explanatory text isn't necessarily an improvement if the person using the app isn't really clear on what to expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That all aside, I can understand what you mean about having to account for any number of crazy printer configurations and drivers. But... on the other hand... these have largely standardized. Print with PostScript and WYSIWYG (mostly).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I dispute the assertion that Word isn't capable of giving an accurate preview of a multi-page layout. I mean, it can PRINT the multi-page layout, and it's definitely not using a printer driver feature to do so. It's constructing the layout prior to sending
 it to the printer, the printer's just placing whatever it receives on the paper without further processing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my view, it should be the highest priority of the engineer and UX team to make sure that important features like Print Preview work as they're intended to work. If multi-page preview was actually REMOVED in 2013, that's definitely not acceptable. Perhaps
 they removed it because it was giving an inaccurate representation of the page? If so... the multi-page feature shouldn't even be available. That's another basic UX tenet -- if you can't make a feature work as intended, you should leave that feature out entirely
 rather than make it partially functional. Better to not offer a function rather than offer something that doesn't work right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this is all a rant and I'm pretty sure no one who has any influence on the design will see this... I'll put it in a feedback instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the confirmation that I'm not missing anything or doing it wrong... it's just not there. :)</p>

            <p>Sounds like you may have turned on power saving, either inadvertently or unwittingly unaware of the effects (which probably includes reduced ringer volume). Try turning the power saving off and see if that fixes the problem. There may be a more moderate
 power saver setting you can use which might still save some power but not lower the volume of the ringer. I can't be more specific than that as I don't have a 930 and it may be a little different from my Lumia.</p>

    <title>Microsoft security info replacement - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft security info replacement</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems updating my security information, as I no longer use the telephone number linked to my Hotmail account. I was able to open a request to change the security information by sending an e-mail to my recovery (secondary) address. I got an
 e-mail from Microsoft with a link to update the info. However after following the link and inserting my e-mail address I get the message that the session has expired. Now I am in a position where the link that I have doesn't work and I no longer can ask for
 a new e-mail (that option doesn't appear anymore. How should I proceed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>Rodrigo</p>

    <title>black rectangle on logo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alisonstewart  say:</h3>
<h2>            black rectangle on logo</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Word document which was created in Word 2003 with the company logo graphic in the header.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open the document in Word 2010 the logo graphic has a black filled rectangle box over the logo.&nbsp; It can be fixed by deleting the logo and inserting again.&nbsp; I would like to know why this is happening? is there a fix? as i have a lot of documents to
 work through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Alison</p>

            <p>Use the compatibility checker available in Word 2010 and verify if these documents have any compatibility issue.</p>
<p>If yes, then it must be compatibility issue. Then you must re-insert these logos manually.</p>
<p>Open the Word document &gt; Click on file &gt; Info &gt; Check for Issues &gt; Check compatibility.</p>
