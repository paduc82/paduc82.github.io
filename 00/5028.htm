            Hello. What model phone do you have? If it is running Windows Mobile, the Marketplace for that operating system was closed down by Microsoft a couple of months ago:

<div>So that coincides well with when your problem started. There are many other sites and developers from which you can get apps.&nbsp;</div>

                    while the latest update added a battery saving mode for gps tracking i've noticed that the battery does not last the full two days it used to last. I used to put in about 1hr of exersice and still be able to get around 2days. Now it appears like i get
 around 24hrs.

    <title>Saving downloaded .rtf files as .docx files by default - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Saving downloaded .rtf files as .docx files by default</h2>
                    I'm running Word 2016 on Windows 7 on a PC. I often download files from legal databases that come to me as .rtf files. When I try to save such a file, Word saves it as an .rtf file unless, in the process of saving the file, I choose .docx in the "save
 as type" box. (In Options | Save, I have asked Word to save files as .docx files.) Is there any way to ask Word to save these downloaded .rtf files as .docx files automatically--i.e., without manually choosing .docx file type while saving?

    <title>multiple instances of iexplore.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alina1  say:</h3>
<h2>            multiple instances of iexplore.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem with multiple instances of iexplore.exe running in task manager which causes the ie9 nto to shut down, even when ending all the "process tree". More iexpore.exe pop up. I have called Microsoft support as this happened right after a MSE update
 and IE9 update. They have not help - in fact they tell me that only if I pay they will look into it. Interestingly MSE is their own product and supposedly it protects our systems, right? Well, obviously not so because why would Microsofr create something to
 protect our system sicne they charge money to tell you if it is protected or not and to help you with virus, etc infections?
</p>
<p>Anyway, I am desperate and very disappointed in the fact that Microsoft is doing nothing to address the issue and from what I see there many people reporting similar issues even with Windows 7 and 8.
</p>
<p>I have found that I have this file iexplore.exe.mui in my program files.. When I searched Isaw something about Iminent Toolbar for IE9? Is this a Microsoft toolbar? Is it legitimate? Is this file iexplore.exe.mui part of IE9 or the system or Windows or is
 it malware?</p>
<p>What happens if I simply remove / delete it from my program files where I found it whenI searched for iexplore.exe. It then popped up as iexplore.exe.mui. What is mui anyway?
</p>
<p>Why isn't Microsoft once and for all addressing the issue of "multiple instances of iexplore.exe running in task manager" which causes the system to use tons of resources and overheat (laptop). Perhaps they pass problems with the updates to legacy programs
 ie. vista so that we can run to get their newer programs. By the way their MSE and safety scanners, malicious software removal tool, and all the bells and whistles as shown on their own safety website have not caught any malware yet they say it is more likely
 malware and I better pay for it to be removed. Perhaps, I made a huge mistake to trust MSE...and Microsoft the customer service of which and help desk is not what it used to be. They afre rude and obnoxious and get easily ticked off if you ask them to explain
 what they are doing to your pc while they attempt top supposedly fix your pc remotely. Not saying that they have to explain technical jargon but it would be nice to at least hear them say, "now, I would like to do xyz".
</p>
<p>Would someone here please help me, as Malwarebites.org also did not catch anything, in other words Istill keep getting the multiple instances of iexplore.exe and a bunch of applications changing names on task manager even long after I shut down the ie9 -
 not tabs open in other words. Those iexplore.exe keep popping up even when I "end process tree".</p>
<p>Thank you very much for all you help.</p>

            <p>ryanthetech, this is NOT normal behavior as alina1 has described it. I am experiencing the same issue. You should&nbsp;have a parent process of iexplore.exe plus 1 for each tab open, so 2 if IE is running with just 1 tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue began a couple of days ago, about the time WU installed the latest batch of updates. IE is crashing repeatedly and just now I found 4 instances of iexplore.exe when there should have been 2. As I ended each process, it began again, and spawned others
 as well. Soon, I had 7 of them but eventually got the one that killed them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't intend to troubleshoot this any further as there are other options available. I'll be using Google Chrome until Microsoft gets this resolved.</p>

            <p>According to that article, the only time you should see more iexplore processes than tabs is when you have a low number of instances. For example, only have 1 instance of the browser open with it's only tab. Then you'd have 2. They didn't give a magic number,
 but at some point they start grouping tabs in a process for better performance, so you'd see fewer processes than tabs you have open (20 processes for 60 tabs in their example.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With lots more instances than tabs, something's wrong. I cleaned up some malware and no longer have that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome doesn't use the same practice. I always have several more instances of the chrome process than tabs open. Right now I have 5 tabs and 8 instances of it.</p>

 the signature seems to have a space after every line that is a table.</span></p>

 there is a body. In that body, there are a series of rows, some of which have tables, some of which do not. So for instance, at the head of the signature, there are two rows without tables, which appear the same in the reply/forward as when sending for the
 first time.</span></p>

<h2>            Query to filter datasheet using field value from subdatasheet</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking to create a query to filter "parent datasheet" records using filter criteria that is based on a subdatasheet field value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below a picture of my datasheet and subdatasheet.</p>
<p>I want to filter&nbsp;out parent datasheeet records that have a "ReviewerName" as <em>
BEC. </em>The BEC value resides in the subdatasheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The desired query would show CCW and not ACX based on the fact that a value of BEC exists in the subdatasheet for that "parent datasheet"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I setup a query to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> jon80  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to adapt an existing document with multilevel numbering&#63;</h2>
                    My academic thesis had headings, however, my supervisor has asked me to revise them against university standards which require roman numbering to be introduced e.g.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Chapter 1</div>
<div>2. Chapter 2</div>
<div>2.1 Chapter 2 Topic 1</div>
<div>2..2 Chapter 2 Topic 2</div>
<div>etc</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried fiddling with Word 2007, however it does not seem to have all the features available which enable me to introduce this heading style.</div>

I still have not understood how to make a heading as a sub-heading of a heading using Word 2007, after having tinkered within the Home ribbon and styles e.g.
<div>Chapter 1 - Objectives</div>
<div>Chapter 1.1 Objectives for George</div>
<div>Chapter 1.2 Objectives for Jason</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you be more specific?</div>

            Hi Jon,<br />
<br />
It may seem like people are brushing you off. They are not. The article on Shauna Kelly's site is thorough, step-by-step, and definitive. It would make no sense to repeat it all here.
<br />
<br />
Start with a blank document or copy of your thesis and set up your numbering. Go through all of the steps (otherwise you may need to redo it later).<br />

            I would prefer to convert my headings rather than starting over since this is an academic thesis that has about 10000 words, re-starting seems un-doable in terms of time management.

            When you mention <strong>headings</strong>, does that mean you have formatted those with Word's built-in heading styles?<br />
<br />
Note that if you haven't used styles, one for each numbering level, a fair amount of manual "intervention" must be done to (re-)format the document. There is no way around it. Apply numbering to the heading styles, modify their font etc. as required and apply
 styles to the text paragraphs that should be numbered.

<h2>            powerpoint sbsx stcx conversion</h2>
                    <p>Hi PowerPoint pros. In previous versions of PowerPoint, storyboarding shapes were stored as *.STCX files. PowerPoint 2013 does not recognize that file format, and is looking for *.SBSX files for Storyboarding Shapes. Has anybody out there written a reliable
 converter, or know a workaround to get STCX files loading in as PowerPoint 2013 shapes?</p>

            The format was created by the Visual Studio Team Foundation Server team. It allows for a library of shapes to be distributed. It is included with Visual Studio 2010 and 2013. I'll post in the IT Pro forum to see what happens.

            Yep. I don't know why, but it isn't possible to remove numbering styles while modifying a style. You have to do it from the Numbering button on the Home (not File) tab of the ribbon.

                    <p>Hi fellow insiders, I have been trying to update my pc to build 17074 for 5 times but each time it gets stuck at configuring updates -54%. Then I hold the power button and turn it off. On next boot it restores my previous version (build 17063). I am on fast
 ring. Tried sfc and dism commands but no violations found. Tried turning off virtualization from BIOS but still no use. Would really appreciate assistance on this issue. Below is a pic of settings:</p>

            A lot are getting that same error number. It is a fairly generic code that may indicate an issue with a driver is preventing the upgrade. A clean boot, where you first disable all startup items found in Task Manager and all non-Microsoft services found
 in msconfig may help get past this.&nbsp; Also, disconnect everything that you can, besides the keyboard and mouse.

<p>Yes, do a clean boot after disabling all startup items and non-Microsoft Services. Disconnect everything that you can and remove SD cards, etc.&nbsp; Then do the upgrade via Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes networking has issues, so occasionally one has to disable all network adapters, but it is hard to know when it has completed downloading everything, as the downloading is done in stages during the upgrade. If you wait until it shows ready for a
 Restart, you could try disabling all network adapters at that point, but this may not be necessary.</p>

            <p>Word really has no concept of pages as discrete objects since it continually repaginates documents based on text flow (see
<span><a href="http://daiya.mvps.org/wordpages.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://daiya.mvps.org/wordpages.htm</a>).</span></p>
<p><span>If each page begins with a heading at a certain level, you can use Outline view to rearrange them. Display only the relevant headings; you can move them and the content
 associated with them will move with them; see <span>

<p><span><span>You can also do this in the Navigation pane in Word 2010. You can drag headings to move them and their content.</span></span></p>

            <p>By default, Word will create a mail merge data source this way. If you want a data source over which you have more control, you can create it manually as a Word table (in a document that you save where you choose) or in an Excel sheet. The article at
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MailMerge/CreateADataSource.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MailMerge/CreateADataSource.htm</a>&nbsp;is useful up to a point, but note that Section 2 is no longer correct since, as you have observed, Word no longer saves your data
 source as a table but as an .mdb file, which is similar to an Access database.</p>
<p>Having avoided using Word to create an "address&nbsp;list" in this way, I don't have any data sources that are .mdb files, but I would guess that you can access it as follows: When you create a new mail merge main document, after selecting the type of merge you
 want (Letters, Envelopes, Labels, etc.) using Start Mail Merge, you would click Select Recipients and choose Use Existing List. Word then displays the Select Data Source dialog, and I would imagine that your address list will be listed there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm coaching a student whose native language is Spanish, and who wants to improve their written English.&nbsp; What I'd love would be a simple add-on to either Word or Edge that would allow the user to hover over a word, any word, and get its meaning displayed
 in a pop-up.&nbsp; This way, if they're not sure they are using the right word... presto, the machine can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<h2>            Prevent user input in an Excel userform combobox</h2>
                    <p>have a combobox on an excel user form. how can i prevent user from entering data?</p>
<p>i.e. select only from list provided.</p>
<p>i know in visual basic there is a dropdownstyle property that can be changed to accomplish this. is there something similar in vba.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

</p><p>For a combobox, you can set the Style property to 2 - fmStyleDropDownList.</p>
