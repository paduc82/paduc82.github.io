<h2>            Modeless form - ControlTipText not showing</h2>
                    I am having a problem with&nbsp;theControlTipText not showing on a modeless form. The form can have 'focus' or the application can have focus. And When I am working on the sheet in Excel (the app has focus), if I hover over a button, the ControlTipText doesn't
 show. I have to click the background of the form first then hover over the button before it works. Bit&nbsp;I want the tip to display without having to click the form first.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any workaround to make the ControlTipText (or something similar) display whether the form has focus or not?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks</div>
                </div>

            A short test shows that the MouseMove event is fired even if the forms hasn't the focus.<br />
<br />
We can use it to show a label with the tip text similar as the original tip text.<br />
<br />
Create a new class module, name it "MyControlTipTextHandler" and paste in this code:<br />

&nbsp; 'Let it shrink<br />
&nbsp; ControlTipTextControl.AutoSize = True<br />
&nbsp; 'Move it to the control<br />
&nbsp; ControlTipTextControl.Left = C.Left + 5<br />
&nbsp; ControlTipTextControl.Top = C.Top + C.Height + 5<br />
&nbsp; 'Show it<br />

<h2>            Backup Contact list from Nokia 820 to somewhere &#63;&#63;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Cannot find any way to Backup my contact list on my new Nokia 820</p>
<p>Have a Microsoft account, have logged into regular account, Skydrive account, people.live.com, contacts.live.com etc..these last two seem the same and both say I have 'no contacts'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is Settings/Backup I have set 'backup on' against 'app list+settings' and 'text messages' but cannot see a place where I set backup 'on' for contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup and restore of contacts to Skydrive&nbsp;is something that is mentioned in all promotional material I have seen, so I guess it must be possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have looked at every help and forum I can find but cannot find any answer, including this forum where I can see many similar questions, but none I have looked at provided an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the contacts on my phone to be available from a backup, don't care if its on Skydrive or elsewhere (though would prefer it was somewhere that I could keep a personal copy of myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help ?</p>

            <p>OK, believe I sort of understand&nbsp;the solution to this, but although satisfactory, it really needed to be explained by Nokia or Microsoft, as it is really not obvious to a newcomer to this Microsoft strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read all this before taking any action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the Windows8 phone fully, you need a Microsoft Account, make sure you set this up first, and check that it works by logging into some Microsoft Accounts like
<a href="http://www.skydrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skydrive.com</a> or <a href="http://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox.com</a>&nbsp;or (<a href="http://www.active.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.active.live.com</a>)&nbsp; etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically when you create this Microsoft Account,it appears you automatically get an 'outlook' mail account, whether you want one or not (<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a>). The reason for this is that&nbsp;a Windows8 phone will only upload
 contacts to an outlook.com account automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although you can create a Microsoft Account at&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.active.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.active.live.com</a>),&nbsp;as the Microsoft account name needs to be an existing mail account&nbsp;its probably wise to go straight to
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> and create it there and get an Outlook.com account as the phone will need this to save contacts to.
</p>
<p>Make sure that you use only lowercase letters in the account name, as although all Microsoft accounts accessed via computer accept upper or lower case, whatever you enter in the phone is not transposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you set up the Microsoft Account in the Windows phone (Settings/email+accounts) your phone is then in a position to upload the contact details stored in the phone to this Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like it tries to&nbsp;do this when phone is connected to a WiFi service, though will do this via mobile internet after one week if no WiFi link connected during that period.
</p>
<p>I'm sure you can overule this, but not sure how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also seems that it can take a day or more before these contacts are uploaded, so be patient
</p>
<p>(I wasn't !)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To view the contacts login to <a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> using the Micosoft Account you created; you are presented with the Inbox and associated screen design.</p>
<p>Top Left you will see 'Outlook' click on down arrow to the right and you have 4 choices; select People.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where the contacts should be listed, if they have been uploaded.&nbsp; You have options here to add contacts from other sources too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haven't tried it, but presume that anything added whilst in the Outlook.com account will be synchronized back to the phone during some later WiFi activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other useful things to know:- </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have entered the Microsoft Account in the phone you CANNOT change it without a phone RESET (which loses all new setup, contacts, apps, etc, etc); so really, really make sure you choose the one you want to use, and enter it correctly. Would recommend
 doing this before you load up the phone with anything, and test it uploads to Outlook.com with a single contact before proceeding. This is a major flaw in the Microsoft strategy (from a user perspective) and I imagine they may well have a fix in place at some
 future point in time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot put contact details onto the SIM card and transfer to another phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although you can transfer contact details from other old phones via blu-tooth to your new Nokia Windows8 phone, you cannot transfer them outwards from the Windows8 phone (or at least I couldn't)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Suite does not link to Windows8 Nokias</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can Export the contact list created in Outlook.com/People to a .csv file; note that for some strange reason the names appear on left, but numbers appear very many columns to the right, off screen !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with receiving up to 50 emails a day from various domains and sender, but all with the same text. I have tried creating a rule to move these to the deleted folder, but nothing is happening so maybe you can help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the messages I receive are signed 'Online Success Strategies' in the message body.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I create a rule that keywords 'online' AND 'success' are move to the deleted folder.</p>

            <p>After some testing it appears that the 'rules' only work with mail that arrives in the inbox. Anything that arrives in the junk box does not appear to be subject to the 'rules'. This is quite frustrating as it I could divert 90% of the junk mail straight
 to the bin with the ability to use the rule function. That would mean I would only have to sift through 10% of what I currently do to make sure I do not bin anything important.

<p>Unfortunately, from your question, it sounds like you are asking about your website showing in the organic listings of Google. Bing Ads Support will not be able to help you this as that is a different search engine and we support advertisers on Bing.com.
 However, Google does have a tool like Bing’s Webmaster Tools (<a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.bing.com/toolbox</a>) in regards to helping your website show in organic listings of a search engine. I hope this helps!

 didn't urgently need access to the account I wouldn't normally bother, but I have something ongoing relating to my ex wife and need access to the account, but one of the largest companies in the world is telling me they have no physical way to remove the two
 step verification to allow me access, why this is funny is because I have read posts of google granting access to some of its account holders when similar things have happened. I am wanting to know if there is any other way I can get access to the account.</p>

<h2>            Micro SD card</h2>
                    OK so I am trying to transfer my 95 gigs of music to my 256 gig micro SD card to play on my phone (galaxy s9+) I have tried copying the whole folder and only a small amount copies. I have tried folder by folder only to get half way through and realize
 none are playable on this device. I know they are all mp3s. The ones that claim wont play on device have before. I have tried copying directly to phone and then transfer to micro SD&nbsp; (that way everything worked for a day and now they don't) I am losing my
 mind trying to make this work. I have formatted numerous times as well.

<p>So with that much, if it were mine, I would copy the files to a folder on my PC (probably copy to a new folder on my desktop). Then I would insert the SD in my PC either directly or via an SD adapter and copy the folder to it from the desktop to SD card.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you get this error immediately when you send? It sounds like it might be your ISP that has an issue, rather than you.

            It is not my ISP. &nbsp;I have checked with them and it is not coming from their end. &nbsp;It happens almost immediately so I suspect it is coming from inside Outlook. &nbsp;It is sent from System Administrator with no header or identifying information about the sender.
 &nbsp;I was getting this sporadically. &nbsp;It has now started happening with every reply and new message as well. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I suspected a virus so I ran an Avast scan at boot time and found nothing. &nbsp;Any help on this issue would be much appreciated as I can no longer send emails through Outlook.</div>

            <p>What if you open Outlook in safe mode? Does the behaviour continue? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think in Windows 8, all you have to do is press the Windows key, then start typing:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>outlook.exe /safe</p>
<p>(note the space between outlook.exe and /safe)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This opens Outlook without any 3rd party integration. If Outlook behaves the way it should, then you know there is an Add In that interferes with its normal function.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you do then is close Outlook, open it normally, and find your Add Ins and disable them all. Then reopen Outlook. Enable one Add In and test your email. Repeat until you find the culprit.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not the case, please let me know. </p>

            If Outlook runs properly in safe mode, it means that there is a third party application integrating with Outlook that interferes with it's normal function. Common culprits are sync software (for use with a handheld), antivirus, FAX software, etc.
<br />
<br />
If you determine that safe mode makes Outlook work, close Outlook and open it normally. Go into your Add Ins (where they are located depends on what version of Outlook you're using and you didn't say). Disable them all, close and restart Outlook. Then add each
 Add In back, one at a time, and test each one. When you find the Add In that breaks Outlook, you find the one you know needs to be disabled or even uninstalled.

            <p>Hi Kathleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem. &nbsp;If I send an email from my Charter web server, it goes though no problem. &nbsp;If I send through Outlook I get the message below. &nbsp;However, I have called the gal I was sending the emails to for testing and she did get them on her
 end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the subject. &nbsp;I have already opened it up in safe mode and I'm still getting the same System admin message. &nbsp;Can you please advise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You!</p>

<p>I would say that they implemented stricter XML validation in 2010, looking for more errors and/or rating them higher.</p>
<p>Therer are a couple of intersting threads in the Word side where lots of people have had problems with XML errors related to the equation editor and some with corrupt file structures. This one had over 5500 reads:<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wordcreate/thread/581159d0-9ebc-4522-b30c-53e33e8268e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wordcreate/thread/581159d0-9ebc-4522-b30c-53e33e8268e1</a></p>

    <title>Weird symbols replace user names in Track Changes comments - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Weird symbols replace user names in Track Changes comments</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I use Microsoft Word's Track Changes feature, including the comment function, nearly every day. Sometimes I receive docs that have been edited using Track Changes, sometimes I use Word's Compare function, and sometimes I edit using Track Changes. The
 following problem does NOT seem occur to occur in the latter scenario (unless the problem has already occurred, in which case it continues). This problem started occurring out of the blue...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I receive an edited document or perform a comparison, the user names are replaced by wacky symbols that remind me of the Wingdings font. The comments themselves, the original text, and the in-text edits appear unchanged. This also appears to happen
 regardless of where the documents originated or of who worked on the documents before me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took a screen shot of the problem and posted on an ancient blog of mine, here: http://the17pointscaleappendix.blogspot.com/2011/01/microsoft-word-is-evil.html.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<div>It would appear that the font for this element of the markup has been </div>
<div>changed to something weird. Check the formatting of the Balloon Text style </div>
<div>(though it appears to be okay) and also of the Comment Text style. Since the</div>
<div>problem occurs only in the part of the markup that is bold, it's possible </div>
<div>that there is a problem with the bold variant of whatever font is being used</div>
<div>(hard to say, but it looks like CJK). </div>

<h2>            Will Windows 10 for phones continue to be developed&#63;</h2>

            <p>For the main question i have the answer. Besides the news that they sell Nokia and the usage of Windows Phone with it i read that besides Microsoft stops publishing new phones, they will continue to updaate Windows Phone.</p>
<p>But my part of the question is. I read that "the new" Nokia said that they leave Windows Phone and will use Android too. So without them, it means no reliable phone brand will use Windows Phone? But if nobody will use it for their phones, will Microsoft
 decide to not put anymore money in it or to still support those who buy a Lumia and update them? And other question, i would love to buy a Lumia but if there will not be any brand left who sells it's mobile with Windows Phone, then what will motivate developers
 to still update their apps? Today's Lumia could live for few/several more years at least if not more, but if developers stops updating the apps because why would they update it if there are no more new phones coming with that software, then apps will be in
 today's version forever?</p>

            <p>Microsoft are only selling the "feature phone" business (i.e. those small phones with keyboards and tiny screens). Not the "smartphone" business (i.e. Lumia).</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are continuing to develop Windows 10 Mobile. New versions are being tested now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are encouraging other companies to make phones running Windows 10 Mobile.</p>

<p>Microsoft isn't selling Nokia, because Microsoft never owned Nokia.</p>

            Thank you for your response! That was unclear to me. Windows phone is a great OS and I was worried that they were going to cut it.&nbsp;UWP is a great opportunity for up and coming developers to have their ideas featured in an app store that isn't over saturated

<p>If you notice it is shown as recommended in Settings, Accounts, Sign-in options.</p>
<p>You also notice that Fingerprint is also recommended.</p>
<p>I have a laptop that has the Fingerprint setting and I set it up and used it to log on.</p>
<p>I then restarted and it asked for the Fingerprint swipe to log on.</p>
<p>I found no way to change what it asks for.</p>
<p>EDIT;</p>
<p>After log on with fingerprint I restarted and picked Sign-in options under the request for fingerprint and picked PIN and after the log on I restarted again and it requested the PIN.

    <title>Undo&#47;Redo drop-down list not working on newest Office update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander zerin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undo&#47;Redo drop-down list not working on newest Office update March&#47;April 2017&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else noticed that since the last update pushed out for MS Office that the Undo &amp; Redo buttons in the quick access toolbar no longer offer the drop down menu option to select multiple actions? Previous you could click on "undo" and see your last
 5/10/etc actions in Excel/Word/etc and you could select exactly how many to revert on. This is hugely helpful when building out metrics and I often need to revert to many actions prior. Currently I can only click to undo/redo 1 action at a time so I have to
 sit and watch what changes and hope I went far enough (previously the list would show the action taken specifically).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed with coworkers who are on the most current Office version that they all have this issue now and that my coworkers who are on an earlier version still have the working drop down menu's for both undo/redo. My version of office is set to deferred
 updates as well so I'm surprised a feature as commonly used as this is seeing issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else found a workaround? Does Microsoft have any statement on when this feature will be fixed? If it will be a while, can someone please direct me to where I can find a ~January 2017 release before this issue came on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on a few related threads, it seems like Office disables the drop-down option when you are using
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17210/windows-10-use-your-pc-like-a-tablet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Tablet mode</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure that Tablet Mode is turned off in the Action Center and see if the drop-down for Undo/Redo shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel with Tablet Mode on:</p>

            <p>Hi Mrbeauds,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reset your internet explorer settings and run it. You can do this by following the steps given below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem is caused by damaged or incompatible Internet Explorer settings or add-ons, you can usually resolve the problem by resetting Internet Explorer settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature from Control Panel, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Exit all programs, including Internet Explorer (if it is running).
</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>Start</b>, and then click
<b>Run</b>. Type the following command in the Open box, and then press <b>ENTER</b>:</p>
<p><b>inetcpl.cpl</b></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The <b>Internet Options</b> dialog box appears.
</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the <b>Advanced</b> tab. </p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under <b>Reset Internet Explorer settings</b>, click
<b>Reset</b>. Then click Reset again. </p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When Internet Explorer finishes resetting the settings, click
<b>Close</b> in the Reset Internet Explorer Settings dialog box.</p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Start Internet Explorer again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>
<p><br />
Please note that resetting Internet Explorer (IE) settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear
 browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already filtered the data of the Column that you have put in the Filters area of the Pivot Table, and selected the required entries from the Filter, and then you double click on the Grand Total Value, you should get details of the filtered data
 only.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Else on the analyze tab of Pivot Table Tools, on the left side there is an Option Button, click on the Drop Down arrow next to it, and select show report filter pages, and select the fields and click OK..</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will generate a separate Worksheet for each Item from the Pivot Table Filter..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi, the thing you refer to as "Value Filter" are not actually "Value Filter". I don't see Pivot Table value filters used anywhere on the sheet I am afraid.. Besides, you're requirement, I don't think that is possible with Pivot Tables right off the bat..
 Maybe VBA can help, but I am still very unclear on what you exactly need.. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"When I click the Grand Total 300, it will shows details of 1000 in a new worksheet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that should happen.. When you double click on a value, Excel spits out only those records that make up that value.. Its called drilling down..

<h2>            Outlook 2013 unstable connection after adding new Exchange 2013 Client Access Server</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I've added a second client access server to my Exchange 2013 cluster and ever since I've added it several clients of mine running all different versions of Outlook would start Outlook and get the "Enter your username and password" prompt. Upon entering
 their credentials the message would pop up again as if rejecting their credentials!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most frustrating part of this is that restarting the application a number of times or just waiting for a bit will fix this issue.. but that surely can't be the ultimate answer. I've tried everything from looking over the IIS Permissions for the Virutal
 Directories to reviewing the Receive Connectors to make sure that all the authentication methods we use were enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't necessarily a super sophisticated implementation, which leaves me baffled how sometimes it works and other times it'll just fall flat on it's face...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can say for certain right now is that OWA on the new server won't accept Active Directory credentials either or in many cases will just forward to a blank screen after the credentials are entered. This is running Exchange 2013 SP1 + CU8
 fully patched and updated on Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is appreciated! Thank you so much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

<h2>            My Phone Sync Issues</h2>
                    
<p>This evening i did a complete wipe of my phone due to some processor issues.&nbsp; I have an HTC Touch Pro 2 on the Sprint network.&nbsp; The Sync kept saying "0x85010001: Synchronization failed because the phone could not connect to the My Phone service.&nbsp; Check your
 internet connection settings and try again."&nbsp; I checked all my settings and reattempted connection about 5 times with no success.&nbsp; I then went into my login settings and retyped my password in the log in, with some success; the phone began syncing everything
 over, but got through only about 7% of the text message syncing and came up witht the error message again.&nbsp; I have tried again approximatley 10 times with the phone not even able to get past the "Autenticating user..." screen.&nbsp; So why will my phone not connect
 and/orfinish the sync?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Same problem for me... and it's driving me crazy too !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The right aligned elements do not appear as they should with embedded Excel sheets into Word documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encounter this issue since the first release of Office for Mac 2016 (current version : 15.31) on both my Macbook and iMac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a brand new Word document with a brand new embedded Excel sheet does not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening the document with Word for Mac 2011 and then opening the embedded sheet with Excel for Mac 2011 seems to rebuild correctly the document, at least until reopening it with Office for Mac 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only workaround I found so far... although a not very convenient one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><span>Resizing with Preserve.</span>&nbsp;If you use&nbsp;<span>Preserve</span>, you can resize only the last dimension
 of the array, and for every other dimension you must specify the same bound it already has in the existing array.</p>
<p>For example, if your array has only one dimension, you can resize that dimension and still preserve all the contents of the array, because you are changing the last and only dimension. However,
 if your array has two or more dimensions, you can change the size of only the last dimension if you use&nbsp;<span>Preserve</span>.</p>

            <p>When you specify the keyword <strong>Reserve</strong>, you can only change the

<p><br />
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ReDim Preserve a(0 To 3, 0 To 5)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But the following will cause an error:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ReDim Preserve a(0 To 2, 0 To 3)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ReDim Preserve a(0 To 5, 0 To 3)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ReDim Preserve a(0 To 4, 0 To 4)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>since you try to change the first dimension in each of these.</p>

 there is list box to select multiple values. When i select multiple values it is not taking ID. Can anyone let me know how can i make it work? (The idea behind this is that for single source i want to select multiple Country and Region)&nbsp;</span><br />

            Instead of multi-select list boxes, use combo boxes, and create a new record for each combination of values. You may want to make the subform a continuous form, so that the user can view multiple records at once.

            You might like to take a look at StudentCoures.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates various interfaces for a many-to-many relationship type, including a multi=select list box, but that using a conventional form/subform is recommended, being code-free and very easy to set up.&nbsp; Note also that, unlike the others
 or the use of a multi-select field, it allows the relationship to have non-key attributes, such as Status in my demo.<br />
