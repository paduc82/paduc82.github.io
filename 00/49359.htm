<h2>            Remote Desktop error&#58; Your password may have expired or the remote pc might not accept blank passwords</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
When connecting from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro using the RD app, I get a message "Your password may have expired or the remote PC might not accept blank passwords". My password has not expired (I tried changing it and using the new password), and I
 am definitely not sending a blank password (the credentials are not saved, and I type them in every time).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Using the desktop app works, but it cuts off after a few seconds, but that's a different issue. When connected, the connection is shown as 'Excellent', so I am not having Internet connection issues.</p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Using the Android RD app from my phone works perfectly.</span>

            Hi Jadegem!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like there are network issues that are affecting the connection.  Remote Desktop Connection info showing Excellent is not a guarantee there are no network problems.  Some suggestions:
<br />
<br />- Try updating network card driver on the client PC
<br />
<br />- If client PC is using WiFi, switch to using hard-wired network connection instead
<br />
<br />- Try using a different Internet connection.  For example, if you have WiFi hotspot on your Android phone test by connecting your home PC through your phone's hotspot instead of your regular home Internet.
<br />
<br />- Test using a different client PC
<br />
<br />- Update firmware on your home router/modem
<br />

<p>I am having exactly the same problem. Windows 7 desktop at my office , a windows 10 laptop, and a windows 7 laptop. All machines are current via my company IT push. THe win10 laptop delivers this message when I try to RDP to my office but the win7 laptop
 works just fine. The only difference I see is that the win10 laptop does not request a password when trying to connect. all other behavior is fine with both win10 and win7 laptops. I can access network shares, even the shared hard drive of the office machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked through the win10 RDP client settings and can find no indication of how to force it to request and use my password. How can I get this to work?</p>

I was using my own Comodo certificate. Switching back to the default one fixed it, even though it's less secure since the common name is wrong. Seems like a bug with RD.

<p>I am also having the same issue. A couple of things to add though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I am attempting to log into a Windows 2012 Server over VPN from a Windows 10 Home Surface Pro 6.</p>
<p>2. I am able to successfully connect/login using Remote Desktop Connection (in the accessories) using the user credentials</p>
<p>3. When I use the remote desktop APP to log into the Windows 2012 Server using user credentials I get the error mention in this thread.</p>
<p>4. When I use the remote desktop APP to log into the Windows 2012 Server using "Administrator" credentials, the connection login succeeds.</p>
<p>5. I am able to connect/login successfully to other Windows 7 Pro PCs in my local network using Remote Desktop App and of course Remote desktop connection (found in accessories).</p>
<p>6. There are no domains being used, credentials are simple username/password combination.</p>
<p>7. I've tried using "\username" but still failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I've determined the credentials are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Remote Desktop uses the resolution of the client, the text/icons in the remote session is tiny (doesn't scale correctly). Remote Desktop APP allows the user to set the resolution of the remote client yet scale correctly (makes things large enough to
 see).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround for me on this issue is to use the administrator credentials, however, that is not optimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ironic Microsoft products do not work correctly together (Surface Pro and Windows Server/PC via remote desktop)</p>

<h2>            Cannot Import Photos from Camere&#40;Nikon D90&#41; after upgrading to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help will be much appreciated. I have successfully upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrade, I am unable to import photos from Camera(Nikon D90 and Canon). I have performed below actions to resolve the problem but no luck so far.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When Nikon Camera is turned on,&nbsp; I can see the camera in Device Manager under other Devices with Exclamation mark. I have tried various options of updating the drivers(Automatic search and Manual&nbsp;Scan)&nbsp;for this device but no luck so far. The same behaviour
 with my other camera(Canon)</li><li>I have installed a Nikon software called ViewNX2 that supports Photo transfer&nbsp;on windows 8, but this software cannot find the Nikon Camera as source even after the camera is turned on.</li><li>Tried with Different USB cables and ports on the Computer</li><li>I was able to transfer photos onto my older laptop, running XP, using same cameras and USB cable, this rules out issues with USB Cable or Cameras</li><li>I was able to plug in general USB stick(Imation 8gb) on to PC and perform various tasks like copy, paste, format. Windows 8.1 was able to recognise USB device and allowed me to perform various functions.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

</p><p>Is this a PC or a surface RT?</p>
<p>When you update drivers for this device, select Browse...., Let me pick...., Portable Devices, MTP USB Device. If install still fails, there should be details in %windir%\inf\setupapi.dev.log.</p>

    <title>Surface Laptop keyboard backlight. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okrane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Laptop keyboard backlight.</h2>
                    Hey guys. I never messed with the setting for my Surface laptop's keyboard's backlight. When I would start typing, the keyboard's backlight would turn on, stay on for a few seconds, then turn off. I loved that setting. Now it seems I accidentally touched
 the F7 key and messed with that setting. Now I can only turn it completely off or completely on (with different brightness settings) by pressing F7 again. How do I revert it back to its original setting?

<p>OK. It sounds as if you set up Outlook.com to collect your non-Microsoft-Email. If you want your mail to arrive in Windows Live Mail in the normal way, you have to do two things:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Stop Outlook.com from collecting your mail. How to do this depends on whether your Outlook.com account has been&nbsp;upgraded to Outlook Mail or not.&nbsp;To see the difference, sign in at
<a href="http://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">mail.live.com</a>:&nbsp;<br />

Which do you see?<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Add your non-Microsoft Email account in Windows Live Mail. Press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the Add your email accounts wizard and follow the prompts. Check the Email Service Provider's website to find the right IMAP or POP3 settings to use; if they're not the
 standard ones (incoming: port 110, not secured; outgoing: port 25 not secured, not authenticated), you should select
<em>Manually configure server settings</em> on the first page of the wizard.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Post back if you need help with either of these, or if I've misunderstood <em>
my emails are still coming to Outlook</em>.</p>

<p>That explains a lot, but not where Outlook comes into the equation. Where are you seeing Outlook? Mail is a completely separate program that can operate side-by-side with Windows Live Mail, although I can't see any reason to do so.</p>

<p>So <em>my emails are still coming to Outlook </em>wasn't entirely accurate, or is there something else you haven't told us yet?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>Signing in only determines which contacts list and calendar to load. It has nothing to do with sending and receiving mail. To do that, you have to add your email account.

<p>Just ride around, start a bunch of trouble by shooting regular Stag guys. I did that last night. All the back up (tanks, planes, helicopters, etc) will come out and you just blow them up. The Stag Commanders are usually in the Stag Helicopters. Atleast for
 me they were. I would kill I think 2 per chopper. If you have unlimited everything then it should be easy.</p>

            Hi Hamza
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Hamza
<br />
<br />You should uninstall the Skype App from Windows 10
<br />
<br />Then download and install the full Skype for Windows application instead, it is more reliable and has more features
<br />
<br />On this page, click the drop down and choose the bottom option:

<p>If you are talking about Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) the Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" is talking about Windows Essentials which is not the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the updates to MSE fail (silently) but it should always catch up eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSE should update just fine as you can see from Windows Update View update history:</p>

                    <p>I'm not sure this is the place to ask, but I'll try. Today I got a pop up window from Norton telling me that it is ready to protect on Windows 10, but not for the newest browser EDGE?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this an issue that will be addressed by Microsoft?&nbsp; Are all the other
 companies such as McAfee, etc. reporting the same issue with the new browser, Edge?</p>
<p>Note: I have not downloaded Windows 10 as of yet. Still using Windows 7 Pro.</p>

            <p>Norton can still protect you on Windows 10, and will continue to protect you while you're using Edge.&nbsp; Microsoft is building the ability for partners to build plugins and toolbars into the browser, but even without those, your antivirus program will still
 be able to monitor the URL's you access and information transmitted and received so that it can protect you.</p>

            <p>Shawn .. They showed a pull down menu of browsers to select with Windows 10 and Edge was not one of them. I don't know why you would call that a "smear". I call it it safety. That's why I asked if it was only Norton ....
</p>
<p>I'm sure it will be worked out at some point.... All these companies want to be Microsoft's friend.</p>

            <p>Your wrong Shawn.&nbsp; I'm a fan of both Microsoft and Norton.&nbsp; I was extremely disappointed that Microsoft snubbed Norton in this update.&nbsp; I was one of the few people left using Internet Explorer.&nbsp; I also use Norton to protect while venture out on the internet
 along with their vault application to store my 400 plus passwords.&nbsp; I've now switched to Firefox because I had it with companies like Microsoft throwing their weight, and in the process, us customers are the one's who suffer.&nbsp; I want to use Norton and their
 vault and would also like to use Microsoft Edge, but that's not possible.&nbsp; I may even start reviewing whether to keep my Enterprise Microsoft Office Account or lose my mind and buy an Apple computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Understand that I don't trust Microsoft to provide my security any more than I would trust Norton to be my browser.&nbsp; If you push me to choose, then Firefox and Norton it is.&nbsp; For now, I have switched to Firefox, so Microsoft needs to fix this before I figure
 out that Firefox is the better product.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That's false.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Norton protects your network traffric regardless of which browser (or any other program on the entire universe) happens to be hosting that traffic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, how could it protect you from a hijacked program or virus?&nbsp; Norton doesn't care what the program's name is, it watches all network traffic for threats (you can test this if you'd try).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the toolbar does is add a nice icon for you to see and feel special about yourself or use as a shortcut to launch part of the program. That's fine, and support for it is coming soon if you
<em>really really </em>need that icon. But it doesn't impact your actual security in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Norton has ALL the same comaptibilty in Windows 10 that it had before, because the entire IE11 is still there.&nbsp; So you haven't
<em>lost anything or any capabilities. Nothing was taken away from you, and Norton still install and runs fine in all the same browsers it did a month ago.&nbsp; Nothing has changed.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, I can't stress this enough:&nbsp; you can use any browser you darn well please.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if it's...</p>
<p>Edge</p>
<p>or Chrome</p>
<p>or Firefox</p>
<p>or Opera</p>
<p>or Safari</p>
<p>or Internet Explorer</p>
<p>or Avant</p>
<p>or Maxton</p>
<p>or anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dislike Norton, but that doesn't matter:&nbsp; Norton protects all of them, even those that haven't been invented yet.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 DxDiag Failing To Detect Correct Amount Of Video Memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lazarus187  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 DxDiag Failing To Detect Correct Amount Of Video Memory</h2>
                    <p>I just installed a new graphics card ( EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 SuperClocked ) and along with the latest driver for the device.&nbsp; According to the manufacturer, this graphics card comes with 8 GB ( 8192 MB ) of dedicated video memory.&nbsp; However, when I run Windows
 DxDiag, it indicates that I have only 4 GB ( 4095 MB ) of "Approx. Total Memory." Furthermore, when I run 64-bit DxDiag, it shows that the card only has 3702 MB of "Approx. Total Memory."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The graphics card appeared to be functioning correctly, so I ran two other utilities to see if there might be a problem; Nvidia Control Panel and GPU-Z.&nbsp; Both programs indicated that the card indeed has 8192 MB of GDDR5 dedicated video memory.&nbsp; Is there
 an issue with some element of Windows, or do I potentially have a defective graphics card?&nbsp; If this is a Windows issue, is there a fix?&nbsp; Below are the rest of my system's specs in case it's relevant:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_ldr.160408-2045)</p>
<p><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz</p>
<p><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Corsair Vengeance Pro 32 GB ( 4 x 8 GB ) DDR3 DRAM 1866 MHz</p>
<p><strong>MOBO:&nbsp; </strong>Asus Z87 Deluxe ( BIOS version 2103 )</p>

<p>It's a custom-built system with the aforementioned components.&nbsp; The only other change I've made was a BIOS update for my motherboard ( now running v2103 ).

                    <p>My Windows desktop will not print to my Wirelessly connected HP Envy 5644. The problem started when the Win10 1709 update was installed last year. I had hoped that subsequent updates would cure the problem but they have not.

<p>
</p><p>What happens is that when I send to the printer, the job appears in the printer queue, but is removed after a few seconds with no printing. There is no warning from the HP drivers that there was a problem but a Windows event is generated with the folowing
 details:</p>

<p><span>I have tried numerous driver re-installs with all the variations I can find sugested in multiple forums and nothing helps. I have stopped and restarted the print spooler service and various other things
 I have seen suggested but again nothing works.</span></p>
<p><span>The same driver on my laptop works fine and I cannot see any significant variations in the properties between laptop and desktop.
</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally I have the driver installed on WinXP running in Oracle Virtualbox on my desktop and that sends prints with no problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>There is no problem in the comms between desktop and printer as I can scan with no problem and perform maintenance.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only thing that does not work is printing.</span></p>
<p>Has anyone got any suggestions of what else I might try please?<br />

<h2>            GAMERS BEWARE - SCAMMER ALERT</h2>
                    
<p>I dont often post on the forums but tonight my wife &amp; I uncovered a scammer who goes by the GT of
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>He typically targets female gamers (although I added him after he popped up on my wifes profile having never played with her historically)<br />
He'll say hi and then send you his mobile number&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> and ask you to txt him. This will begin a reverse charge txt scam.</p>
<p>I filed a complaint and after discussing the matter with Cinderella on the xbox chat support she said i should create a thread advising others to take care if receiving a message from him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats it from me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take care and Happy Gaming</p>

<p>Don't you have to accept the charges ?????</p>
<p>Anyway, this is NOT how to report such things. &nbsp; How exactly is you sending a text a scam.... You pay for the text silly.</p>
<p>What did Cinderella tell you to do again????</p>
<p>PLEASE, &nbsp; &nbsp;Block communications, Avoid and Report any unwanted behaviour...... &nbsp; That should solve your problem. &nbsp;

<p>In the future please DO NOT name others for any reason or give personal information out in a public space. &nbsp; GOOD LUCK!!!!</p>

<p>Bong,</p>
<p>You don't need to accept the charges. What he described is a real scam.</p>
<p>I think Daft Badger cleared the whole "this is not how you do it etc" already.</p>
<p>Backseat modding is also against the ToS which is essentially what you have done given the previous posters advice.</p>
<p>You need to edit 'public space' to 'the xbox forums' as the ToS doesn't cover the www.</p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!!!</p>

<p>OK cool I understand. &nbsp; YOU have to first send a text to the number given right???...... You accept the charges by making the first call/text. &nbsp;That's the scam</p>
<p>Don't send a message in the first place..... &nbsp; Avoid, Block communications, and rate/report &nbsp;(You can never say that too many times as people still don't do it)</p>
<p>Backseat modding???? &nbsp; I don't understand. &nbsp; If indeed you feel I have broken the Tos/Coc Please, by all means go ahead and follow the above advice, &nbsp;file a report.
</p>
<p>I will stand by "Public Space" my friend. &nbsp; &nbsp;The internet is public space just like a local park. &nbsp; You wouldn't go outside and start giving random strangers personal info so, why do it on-line in a Public forum..??</p>
<p>FYI- as a general life rule- never start a comment with "I Think" &nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, &nbsp; I Thank the OP for providing Awareness of this issue. &nbsp;The more poeple that know how to avoid a scam the better.</p>

<p>Hello TarsasPI</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you tried using a different TV and see if they still show up. As this is two different consoles doing it, it might be possible its the tv itself. Also try different HDMI cord.</p>
<p>Try this out and let me know what happens.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 search displays windows store apps with broken image icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zachbeauchamp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 search displays windows store apps with broken image icons</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10, when using the search app, all windows store apps display the same generic image file icon rather than their actual icon. In any other part of Windows( start menu, task bar, task manager, etc) they are fine including if it is a search result
 including nondownloaded apps. I have already tried rebuilding icon caches and the windows store cache. I even did a clean reinstall. I have seen others have their icons as normal so I know this is not how it is meant to be.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33a02ec5-4616-4a37-9d1f-d385f357ab45" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I have discovered that this problem only occurs once an account is switched to using the Microsoft account, but even once it is switched back to local the error persists. The only way I have found to "remedy" it thus far is to
 create a new local account and never login to the Microsoft account. Any help?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update 2: </strong>I have narrowed it down to the "Other Windows Setting" sync option. If you turn that off before it has a chance to sync then you will be fine. I have cleared out all sync options and backups, but this still causes problems.</p>

            So I fixed this by making a new user and immediately turning off the syncing. Something about the windows 8 back up sync was messing with it so I had to go to one driveable have it remove them and wait like 30 minutes to actually clear.

<p>Same problem here. The issue occurs with all user accounts, even with a newly created local account so is not related to icon cache or user profile. Issue impacts store apps icons only and only in the search box (icons are fine in start menu, taskbar an
 everywhere else, desktop app icons are fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is reported on the internet in several places but there is no solution that works.</p>
