<p>The only way a mouse &amp; keyboard would work &amp; be fair is if it was put in the box along with the console. It isn't however, so it wouldn't be fair as not everyone would have one... Sure it would be good for many of the games similar to the ones you mentioned,
 but for games like Call of Duty, it wouldn't work because players with controllers would be at an extreme disadvantage. In any case, a controller is easier to handle for most people &amp; takes up far less space. In regards to CoD being in 3rd person, many of
 them have had the option in multiplayer to play the game from a 3rd-person perspective. To say that it was an unpopular feature is an understatement. Lastly, although you're entitled to your opinion, the method you're using to make it known to the public isn't
 exactly what I (or anyone else for that matter) would consider appropriate or polite.</p>

<p>OP please understand your views are your views and may or may not be shared by many other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is not common sense to use a console for PC games. This is just another example of someone who does not understand what console gaming is. You cannot have champagne on a beer budget.</p>

<p>I'll give you&nbsp;two good reasons why most games/consoles dont support keyboard/mouse for their games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unification&nbsp;&amp; fairness</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment all of the developers know how a game will be controled, its standard, developers dont have to think about "should we put in keyboard/mouse controls?" especially asalot of gamers wouldnt even use them because either they wouldnt know it was
 available, or because its just easier to sit on your couch with a controller than a keyboard/mouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then their is the matter of fairness, everybody who plays on consoles will be using a controller, so its a level playing field.&nbsp; If however you started getting some people with keyboard/mouse and some with only controller, those with a controller would get
 slaughtered.&nbsp; They tried mixing controller &amp; keyboard/mouse players on a first person shooter a few years ago, nobody liked it.&nbsp; The controller players said they thought the keyboard/mouse players were overpowered, and the keyboard/mouse players said it wasnt
 fair that the controller players had a little bit of "auto lock" (or whatever its called)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said, its a bit of a mine field thats best left alone.</p>

<h2>            Intel DPTF Driver for Windows 10 &#40;64-bit&#41; - Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro - says incompatible</h2>
                    I am trying to resolve a battery will-not-charge problem. The energy manager driver from Lenovo that says it is for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 is NOT for Windows 10. I tried installing and it said "system does not meet minimum requirements". I tried installing
 with troubleshooting and the highest OS option it gave was Windows 8, then reported "incompatible operating system". Duh! What am I supposed to do? Microsoft's ACPI may be the problem, but if I uninstall that, then I have no battery management driver.

            <p>I had this problem, too, with Windows 7, trying to use Windows Backup to two new Western Digitial 3TB drives, pre-formatted with NTFS for Windows. It's very frustrating because each attempt takes many hours before the error occurs so you don't know until
 it succeeds whether it will.</p>
<p>I found what worked for me here:</p>
<p><a href="http://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6618/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6618/</a></p>
<p>You can download WD Quick Formatter from that site. However, don't follow the instructions on that page for formatting a HD under Windows 7, because it tells you how to use MS Disk Management, which will make a 2TB partition and not recognize the remainder
 of the drive. You must use WD Quick Formatter as described here:</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>[I think it's unconscionable that MS hasn't fixed this with their built-in tools.]</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and LYNC</h2>
                    I used LYNC a lot with windows 7 (as a guest; I don't have a corporate account, but my clients use it). When I upgraded to Windows 10, I had to install the LYNC app, and now I cannot get into LYNC. It keeps referring me back to the sign in page. I tried
 uploading an older LYNC app, but Windows 10 won't let me use that one.

<br />Microsoft Silverlight is a powerful development tool for creating engaging, interactive user experiences for Web and mobile applications.  Microsoft Silverlight is important to deliver a new generation of high-quality audio and video, engaging media experiences, and interactive applications for the Web.
<br />For instance, such apps as Netflix require Microsoft Silverlight to work. If Microsoft Silverlight is not preinstalled on your device, you will be asked to download and install the plug in for your web browser or the application to work.
<br />Follow the link to get further information about Microsoft Silverlight <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/</a>
<br />However if you want to remove Microsoft Silverlight plug-in from your device, run the Fix it for me tool from the following link and the plug-in will be uninstalled automatically.
<br />Follow the link to get further information on how to remove Silverlight installation from your computer

            Hi Jessica
<br />
<br />Silverlight has been deprecated by Microsoft and is no longer supported
<br />
<br />Some websites still require Silverlight to display correctly. If you use Internet Explorer or Firefox, those browsers still support Silverlight. 
<br />
<br />The updates provided by Microsoft for Silverlight are just security updates, there is currently no more development of the Silverlight platform . . .

            Hello JessicaButler1 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />Its not a requirement to have it installed, but, some web pages utilize it for streaming multimedia content. 
<br />
<br />Silverlight is Microsoft's competitive answer to Adobe's Flash, the long-standing dominant standard for multimedia Web applications. 
<br />
<br />Silverlight integrates animations, video, and interactivity (the ability to click on an animated item and trigger a response).
<br />
<br />So, In Windows Updates this program always receive constantly Upgrades to improve your experience into Web page or Web applications.
<br />
<br />I hope this information has been useful, please let me know if you still need assistance.

            Hi Jessica,
<br />Seems it is not Microsoft's requirement but some site's or software's one.
<br />Silverlight was used for development some years ago, so you may look for later app version without Silverlight requirement.

<p>
</p><p>You need to install (at least) the chipset drivers for your motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should first look for drivers at the web site of your computer manufacturer using your Dell Service Tag (if you have a Dell), serial number, or other specific identifier for your particular computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if this is a custom-build, go to the web site of your motherboard manufacturer with the specific model identification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you provide the above identification, someone here can help you figure out which driver you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the SM Bus Controller is concerned, if you can't find anything at the computer manufacturer or motherboard manufacturer web sites, you probably can get it from Intel ... but you'll need the four characters immediately after PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_</p>

    <title>Windows Defender not working after April 1803 version installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender not working after April 1803 version installation</h2>
                    <p>My computers recently updated to the 1803 build and everything works fine, except for Windows Defender on one system.&nbsp; I had previously used Norton on all, but decided to change to Windows Defender.&nbsp; I uninstalled Norton on all my computers (laptop, 2 desktops)
 after the upgrade and Windows Defender worked fine on two of them.&nbsp; One desktop however, would not start WD.&nbsp; I did numerous Norton Uninstalls, but no help.&nbsp; I finally noticed using the Services App that the WD antivirus programs were pointing to the wrong
 file location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Windows build (1803) changed the file location, but in the registry all WD entries still referred to the old location.&nbsp; So I edited the entries to reflect the new location and it shows correctly in the Services App, but WD still doesn't start.&nbsp; Must
 be other references that I didn't see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New location for .exe files - ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\4.16.17656.18052-0\</p>
<p>Old location = Program Files\Windows Defender\</p>
<p>Drivers were also relocated to System32\Drivers\WD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there was no entry to rollback to a previous version, or any restore points prior to that install.&nbsp; Tried SFC, DISM (all versions) and nothing seems to help.&nbsp; Tried to download virus updates, but will not install.&nbsp; Will I need to do an ISO reinstall,
 or is there something else to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro 64 bit build 1803 install 5/19</p>
<p>No other Antivirus running</p>
<p>RAM 16GB</p>

<p>Yes is did, i tried to redeem it on the xbox, on the website, i even tried redeeming it at my brothers house to test if it was the connection, asked a friend to try it by himself and nothing of all these fixed the problem...</p>
<p>I'm from luxembourg so i tried out with germany, france and luxembourg as region and nothing worked</p>
<p>I bought the code 14 days ago but i didnt use it, that means that shouldn't be the problem either ...</p>
<p>i'm have no clue what to try next...</p>

            <p>Ok, there are a few reasons that the code will not work then.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;You are accidentally typing in a different code - be sure that you are typing it in correctly. &nbsp;Sometimes O can be mistaken for 0 and B for 8</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Gold codes are region locked - If your gamertag is not set for the same region that the code was meant for it will not work. &nbsp;Where did you purchase it from and which region (country) is your tag set for?</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The code was not properly activated at the point of purchase - You'll need to contact the seller.</p>

<p>1. I'm pretty sure i'm typing it in correctly because it recognizes that it is a 3 months code and i have to click confirm, and at this point the message that something went wrong and to try again later comes.</p>
<p>2. Well i purchased it in Saturn in Luxembourg and i've tried already Luxembourg (and this is the actual region i have it set up now) as a region and it still doesnt work
</p>
<p>3. that might be the only possibilty of the 3 above i didn't try yet </p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks there could be some third party conflicts. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's compare the minimum requirements for the game to run properly: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>OS: Windows XP or above<br />
CPU: 1GHz Intel<br />
RAM: 512MB<br />
VIDEO: Geforce 2 Equivalent (or better)<br />
DISK: 5 GB Free<br />
NET: Internet Connection Required<br />
Administrator/Power User rights required to install and patch the game.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you are having trouble connecting to Pirate101, there could be a few things that could cause this.
</span></p>
<p><span>To troubleshoot follow the below steps:<br />
<br />
a. Check your Internet Connection. If it isn't working, neither will the game!<br />
b. Make sure the Game is online. Sometimes we need to bring Pirate101 down to make repairs. Announcements about these downtimes can be found on the window that appears when you run Pirate101.<br />
c. Make sure that your anti-virus/internet security programs are not blocking Pirate101. If they are add Pirate101 to the allowed list or lower the access settings.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to duplicate one monitor and extend another in a multiple monitor configuration</h2>
                    <p>original title: Desktop Extention</p>
<p>I have 2 acer P166HQL monitors and have it connected to a video splitter which is connected to my laptop via a VGA cable. The screens are currently being recognized as 1 screen not as 2. I want 1 screen to duplicate my laptop's display and the other to extend
 it. How do I do this?</p>

            The VGA output on your laptop can only send one video signal - if you use a splitter both monitors will show the same image. Your laptop wont recognize both monitors with a video splitter, just one.<br />
<br />
Some laptops have both VGA and HDMI out - if yours does then you can use the HDMI port for a different image then the VGA.

<h2>            Error Window.Net Framework 1.11.4322 must be install first</h2>
                    When attempoting to install a pre-Windows 7 product, it says .NET Framework 1.1.4322 must be installed first. I have gone to the relevant download page and tried to install it, and it appears to have been installed, but the program still says I need to
 install it. I am guessing that this version is not compatible with Windows 7. What is the equivalent framework? Is there any equivalent way I can run the program without using NET framework? I ahve this same question...I am trying to insatall Quick Books 2011
 on a Vista machine

    <title>Can&#39;t activate windows on windows surface RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerstec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate windows on windows surface RT</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; So I have a surface RT and when i got it, it was great. &nbsp;A few months ago I noticed I no longer have the ability to connect to the internet. &nbsp;I did some digging and according to the tablet it says windows needs to be activated. &nbsp;I've tried all the SLUI
 04 and entered the key given by Microsoft and every time i enter the key it gives me an error saying the key is incorrect. &nbsp;Up to a few months ago the tablet worked fine. &nbsp;It had internet and all. &nbsp;Now I have no internet access. &nbsp;I went to the menu where it
 says to activate windows and i went trough that process. &nbsp;needless to say it is still not working and is telling me the activation key is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Am I missing something? &nbsp;I've read online the RT's do not need to be activated because they come with it. &nbsp;Can someone please help me get on the right track so I can fix this issue? I use the RT for work so its very important I am able to connect to the
 internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you so much in advance for any advice! &nbsp;I greatly appreciate it!</p>
