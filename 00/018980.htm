<h2>            Searching multiple site collections</h2>
                    
<p>I can't seem to find out whether SharePoint 365 search is limited to a single site collection or you can search several site collections from one search.</p>
<p>Can someone clarify?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>No, you can search from any site collection you have permissions to. In the search box, make sure you choose: Everything. to be able to search everything in the site.</p>
<p>Also that's why the content search web part was introduced in Office 365, for you to be able to search multiple site collections in the cloud from within one site collection which is not possible in other previous web parts. Hope that helps!</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 Professional - Icon Pictures Gone and Setup won&#39;t run</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have a fresh Win 7 Ultimate machine and installed the RTM version of Office 2010 sometime ago.&nbsp; All has worked fine until last night when I installed Windows Live tools from Windows Update.</p>
<p>Since then, I noticed that all my Office Icons have been lost (shows a generic unknown file type for Excel, Word, etc.).&nbsp; I thought, I'll run the repair utility, however when I try and run the original setup programme, I see an intro screen, then it dissappears
 with an error messagbox box ....</p>
<strong><span><span>
<p>Description:</p>
</span></span></strong><span>
<ul>
<li>Setup did not complete successfully. We are sorry for the inconvenience. </li></ul>
</span>
<ul>
<strong><span><span>
<p>Problem signature:</p>
</span></span></strong><span>
<li>Problem Event Name: Office12Setup </li><li>Problem Signature 01: {10140000-0F00-0000-0000--0000000FF1CE} </li><li>Problem Signature 02: 14.0.4755.1000 </li><li>Problem Signature 03: X </li><li>Problem Signature 04: MsiAPICallFailure </li><li>Problem Signature 05: PROPLUSR\ProPlusrWW.xml </li><li>Problem Signature 06: X </li><li>Problem Signature 07: X </li><li>OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1 </li><li>Locale ID: 3081
<p>To be fair, Office still works fine - just no icons on any of the files (which is bit inconvenient)&nbsp;however I'm worried that if I ever need to run setup, etc. I'll be faced with a problem.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
</li></span></ul>
<ul>
</ul>

<p>Fixed the problem.&nbsp; My system had automatically installed&nbsp;2 xOffice Updates (Definition Update for Microsoft Office 2010 suites (KB982726), 32-Bit Edition, and Update for Outlook Social Connector (KB983403), 32-Bit Edition) that were listed as important.&nbsp;
 When I uninstalled these, I was able to run the 'Change' option for&nbsp;Microsoft Office 2010&nbsp;within the 'Programs and Features' control panel.</p>
<p>I managed to run&nbsp;the Repair option, and hey presto, all was returned to normal (Whew!).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if others have had similar problems after installing these updates, or if I was just lucky.</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion, and I hopse this is useful for others.</p>
<p>.... but I'm not sure I want install those 'Important' updates.</p>

<p>Tried to install&nbsp;VLC media player and everything went to hell. Installed with no problem but when I attempted to play a DVD it locked up the system. Eventually it flashed into the sad face blue screen and no amount of fiddling would work. It refused to boot
 into Win 10. Reinstalled from ISO DVD&nbsp; and reloaded everything up to that point. I'll just let it sit and do updates for a while. I do like the appearance of the OS but it will take sometime to adjust. Beats hell&nbsp;out of Win 8.1 for sure.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I have a couple questions about windows 10 for when it is released.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a couple questions for when Winbdows 10 comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I herd that it will be a free upgrade from windows 7, 8, and 8.1. I also herd that it was only free for a year, is that true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Will I lose anything when I upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How will I upgrade? I know its kind of early to tell, but I would like a general idea on how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The upgrade will come in the form of a "Windows Update", and there is some chance that hardware in your computer will not have a fully functioning (or functioning at all) driver for Windows 10. &nbsp;In that case, you may lose networking, display, sound, or anything
 that relies on a driver. &nbsp;Please browse the forums to see the numerous issues people are having with drivers from AMD, Intel, Nvidia, VIA, Realtek, Synaptics to name a few. &nbsp;This does not mean that all people are having problems with these drivers, just some.
 &nbsp;Do you feel lucky?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Windows will attempt to preserve all of your programs and files, there are some programs that are noted to have problems with Windows 10, and an update may or may not be forthcoming. &nbsp;Examples include certain games, antivirus, etc. &nbsp;Again, browse the
 forums to see what issues people are having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final version should be more stable, however I'm certain that they won't have 100% compatibility with the vast array of hardware and devices from Windows 7 and 8/8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you currently use Windows Media Center, since Windows 10 will not support it, you will lose Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you currently use Windows 7 and enjoy a powerful start menu, you will lose that, because Windows 10 does not have one, or you could use a third party program to restore that functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you currently use Windows 8/8.1 and enjoy a touch-centric interface, you will lose that, because Windows 10 does not have full support for gestures, charms are missing, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade is free if you upgrade within one year of Windows 10's release, and Microsoft says that it will continue to be supported for the lifetime of that device, so most people interpret that to mean that you will never have to pay anything for Windows
 10 to be continually updated with whatever revisions come out, for the lifetime of that device. &nbsp;Generally, the device means the motherboard of your computer or laptop, so you should be able to change graphics cards, hard drives, or whatever, however Microsoft
 has not been 100% clear on this, so take this with a grain of salt.</p>

<h2>            Choosing client for incoming calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm frequently running Skype on desktop and mobile, sometimes simultaneously, and when there's an incoming call, it's the desktop that
</p>
<p>rings first - always, without exception... whereas, I'd like to have calls sent to mobile as a primary client.
</p>
<p>Clearly, the problem is that the caller usually hangs up by the time my mobile client starts ringing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make one of the simultaneously registered clients a "primary" destination for incoming calls?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi G,</p>
<p>Sorry about that.... the article references JET when we should be looking at the ACE registry keys... I just tested this by modifying the keys below and it allowed me to export with an SLL extension....</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\Text</p>
<p>Under "Disabled Extensions" add SLL to the list.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\ISAM Formats\Text</p>
<p>Under "Export Filters" add *.SLL to the list.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Kathy</p>

            read somewhere here in other threads that Nokia wellness diary has got something to do with front camera error. If you've installed it, try uninstalling it. If you've any beta versions of apps, try uninstalling them as well.

            This is a known issue posted many, many times since yesterday including posts from Jason @ Microsoft. Please read the forum prior to postings. The easiest way to shutdown for now is to press the Windows key on your keyboard and "x" at the same time. You
 can also right click on the Windows logo at the left of the task bar and shut down from there. All Insiders should read the Feedback Hub and Windows blogs that are published with the release of each build that lists the issues in each build.&nbsp;

            If all else fails you have a power button key that you use to start your computer.&nbsp; It will also act as a power off button.&nbsp; This is called a hard shut down.<br />

            You can click on Tools (the gear icon), then Manage Add-ons. From there, select Search Providers from the left side panel. To add new providers, click<em>Find more search providers...</em> found down at the bottom left of the window. To remove a provider,
 highlight it, then click the remove button.

<h2>            Error 0xc1900101 - 0x40017 when installing 10041</h2>
                    <p>I just attempted to install build 10041 and all was going well, up to 41% about and it restarted. It said it was doing a system update (Surface Pro 3) and after a few attempts it rolled back to 9926 with this error code 0xc1900101 - 0x40017.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can look for to show what the problem may be?</p>
<p>Also, when I check for updates again it doesn't find the new build and says I'm up to date.</p>

<p>No luck for me on either of those links.</p>
<p>I'm thinking the best course of action might be a clean install of 9926 then check for updates and hopefully find 10041 again.</p>

<p>I tried that and it still failed when trying to install from the .iso. Did you need to do anything special? I'm back to 8.1 right now and couldn't do the update from Windows Update either.</p>
<p>This morning I figured, maybe its because I have the drive BitLocker encrypted. I'll try again after work tonight.

<p>The try I did after disabling BitLocker didn't work.</p>
<p>After doing that, I had a BCD error also and really couldn't do anything. I went back to 8.1 again, with nothing at all connected to the Surface, run the commands to rebuild the BCD and fix boot, then tried again to get to 9926 still with nothing connected.
 That was successful so I'm doing updates on 9926 now in hopes of getting 10041 once it's ready.</p>

    <title>Using Save As from Word within SharePoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark nixey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Save As from Word within SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>i have tested this in two different tenants with both windows 8.1 and windows 10 and office 2013 and 2016 - the behaviour described below happens in both environments - so my question is whether this is the expected behaviour or a known issue.</p>
<p>the issue occurs when i upload a document into an out of the box shared documents library and then try to use save as to save the document to another library in the same site. the second library has a mandatory choice column. when i choose save as, i navigate
 to library 2 and give the file a new name. at this point i get the expected 'properties required' box (the filename in the title bar still shows the original filename, not the name i just typed into the save as dialog).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/491f6758-82e7-4370-b40e-15a10de5ab3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/491f6758-82e7-4370-b40e-15a10de5ab3e" /></a></p>
<p>i add the document property and save (using ctrl s) and the save appears successful but the file still displays the original filename and the backstage still shows the original file location (and the file does not appear in library 2). i can then use the
 save as command a second time, give the file a new name and navigate to library 2 and successfully save.</p>
<p>if i get as far as adding the document property and save using the retry save message bar in word then i get the following error message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/692224f8-3034-4fc5-94eb-41ad6ac78949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/692224f8-3034-4fc5-94eb-41ad6ac78949" /></a></p>
<p>when i click ok and save again, the save as dialog box appears with the new filename and i can click save to successfully save.</p>
<p>i would be grateful if someone is able to shed some light on the above and if there are any settings i can change so that a save as just works as expected.</p>
<p>cheers,</p>
<p>mark</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>After clicking Save As and choosing another library which contains a choice column, the file name in the title bar should changes just as we typed in the Save As dialog.</p>
<p>Then we are required to added the property, after pressing Ctrl+S:<br />
1. The Upload Failed notification bar should disappears, but the Document Properties options bar remains.<br />
2. The newly named document should then appears in the new library.</p>
<p>To better investigate the behavior, please confirm the following information:<br />
1. For "The second library has a mandatory choice column", could you share a screenshot about the settings for this column?
<br />
2. If it is convenient, please let us know if the issue happen to a newly created library which has added&nbsp;the same column.</p>

                    The current Publisher document I am designing gets fouled up when I Save As or Export as either XPS or PDF.&nbsp;The left and right sides of the pages are sliced off and it looks&nbsp;truncated into 8-1/2 X 8-1/2 instead of 11 X 8-1/2. I have successfully converted
 other Publisher documents into PDFs so the problem has to be with this document, and not with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC or XPS. Is there a setting in my document that needs to be changed?

    <title>Word table summing negative numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cpnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word table summing negative numbers</h2>
                    <p>I have a Word 2007 mail merge document that contains a table.&nbsp; Some of the merge fields are in the right most column of the table.&nbsp; Once the merge has been done and the numbers are in the table, one of the table cells is supposed to contain a SUM() of all
 the numbers above it in the column.&nbsp; This works fine when all the numbers are positive.&nbsp; BUT if any of the numbers are negative, they are ignored and the SUM() calculation is only a sum of the positive numbers.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure this happens because "Word does
 not handle negative numbers correctly in calculated fields, because Word apparently makes the comparison between such items as alpha-numeric character groups rather than negative numbers." (<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/negative_numbers_in_calculations.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/negative_numbers_in_calculations.htm</a>).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The format of the column that contains the merged data looks like this:<br />
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong><span><span>Purchase Price: </span></span></strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$<span>¬´AggregatePurchasePri¬ª</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;and the underlying merge formatting is this:&nbsp; ${ MERGEFILED \##,# :AggregatePurchasePri"}</p>
<p>The summed figure&nbsp;looks like this:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong><span><span>Total Estimated Project Costs:</span></span></strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>$<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>and the underlying formatting is this:&nbsp; ${=B1+B2+B3+B4+B5+b6+b7+b8 \# "##,#"}&nbsp; (I can't use SUM(ABOVE) because there is a blank like in the column)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I add&nbsp;positive and negative&nbsp;numbers that I type into a table column, the {=B1+b2+b3} type of calculation works correctly so I'm stuck.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to fix this?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.&nbsp; Carol</p>

            If you remove the dollar signs and use the correct syntax for your merge fields i.e.
<br />
{ MERGEFIELD "AggregatePurchasePri" \# ",0.00"}<br />
then<br />
{ =B1 + B2 + B3 + B4 + B5 + B6 + B7 + B8 \# "$,0.00"} should work<br />
You can't add text i.e. Dollar signs. This is not Excel :)<br />

                    How can I change the "RAD" setting of Excel to "DEG"? I am trying ro calculate the cosine of an angle and it is giving me the value in radian and not on degree.

<p>Excel always uses radians for trigonometric functions. Unlike a calculator, it does not have a setting to use degrees by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the RADIANS function to convert degrees to radians.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: enter an angle in degrees in B1.</p>
<p>The cosine is returned by the formula =COS(RADIANS(B1))</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let suppose that your data is in cell A1 then you can use this formula in cell B1:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>=COS(RADIANS(A1))</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>or this formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>=COS(A1*PI()/180)</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can use function RADIANS or you can multiply your data with PI()/180 to convert result from RAD to DEG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Unable to perform Windows Update, Internet Explorer 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to perform Windows Update, Internet Explorer 8</h2>
                    Original title : Problems with Add Ons<br />
<br />
I have a problem with Internet explorer and windows update. Recently my IE8 stopped running add-ons and as a result, I get thrown out by Windows update. I cannot make it run updates and I have confirmed that there are no viruses. Nothing daunted, I uninstalled
 IE8 and then restarted and reinstalled it. No difference. Then I uninstalled IE8 again and this time installed IE7, no difference I use firefox as default, but I need IE to access Microsoft and simply cannot do that,. All of the standard tests show that nothing
 is out of the ordinary, but I am thinking that this problem may be a windows kink, so I reinstalled windows on a newly formatted drive and internet explorer&nbsp; still runs with no add-ons. I am getting ultra frustrated. and cannot see why this is happening. I
 have 20 or so add-ons in my Explorer and they are all enabled except for one which is a speedbit add-on which I neither want nor need. Can anybody suggest why this is happening and how to fix it ?

            Hello, Thank you for your reply. I regret to advise that I have followed each piece of advice that you offered, with no changes being made to my system. Everything looks totally fine, but I get this message ( below ) whenever I try to open Internet Explorer
 7 or 8. If I go to Manage Add-ons, it tells me that ALL of my add-ons are enabled ( except Speedbit ) and a review of the registry indicates nothing out of the ordinary. This is the message I get, every time that I try to open Internet explorer. My Firefox
 browser is working fine, but unfortunately Windows demands that ONLY Internet Explorer can be used to access any Microsoft site which means that I cannot perform any updates. This whole problem happened when I installed " Download Accelerator Plus from SPEEDBIT&nbsp;
 and unfortunately it automatically installed 2 other programs, the first called SPEEDBIT VIDEO DOWNLOADER which I did not want and did not ask for, so I promptly uninstalled it. The second was called "Internet Search powered by BOSS" This problem occurred
 immediately after. I contacted SPEEDBIT and received a completely flat reply along the lines of " Why did you uninstall our program ?. You have to expect trouble with your machine if you do that, please re-install it immediately and set it as your default
 downloader with Speedbit.com set as your home page and seach engine. I think that this is a new virus, but I cannot find it and none of my anti-virus software has been able to pin it down. Registry Mechanic also reports no registry errors and Trend Micro also
 tells me that my machine is clean. Why should a company be ale to blackmail a user like this ? The copy of IE that I am trying to use is 7 at the moment, but I have experienced this same problem with 6 and 8. There does not appear to be any way of getting
 any version of IE to work at all unless, I am totally prepared to surrender control of my machine to Speedbit. This I will never do, but I suspect that what they are doing, somehow avoids detection as a virus. One change has occurred since performing all of
 these tests though, the option to manage add-ons has disappeared from my IE. I can no longer even view them and re-installing IE will not now give me this option back. I do not like IE and would never use it by choice because it is over complicated and too
 prone to miscellaneous errors, but unfortunately, you MUST have it in order to use Windows efficiently. Please let me know if you can think of any other way of getting to the bottom of this.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />

            Hello, <br />
<br />
I am sorry that I did not include this earlier, but this is what happens if I try to update :-<br />
<br />
<b>Thank you for your interest in obtaining updates from our site.
</b><br />
<br />
To use this site, you must be running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or later.

To upgrade to the latest version of the browser, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkID=24748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Internet Explorer Downloads</a> website. <br />
<br />
If you prefer to use a different web browser, you can obtain updates from the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=10678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Download Center</a> or you can stay up to date with the latest critical and security updates by using Automatic Updates. To turn on Automatic Updates:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Control Panel</b>.</li><li>Depending on which Control Panel view you use, Classic or Category, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Click <b>System</b>, and then click the <b>Automatic Updates</b> tab.</li><li>Click <b>Performance and Maintenance</b>, click <b>System</b>, and then click the
<b>Automatic Updates</b> tab.</li></ul>
</li><li>Click the option that you want. Make sure Automatic Updates is not turned off.</li></ol>
<p>I am using Firefox, but because I recently re-installed Windows XP from my original disk, I need to perform about 300 updates to get all of my software operational and, even with IE6, I cannot do this. Auto-update does nothing because, it depends on Add-Ons
 in order to work and it will not even give me a search-engine homepage.</p>

Hello again, <br />
<br />
I thank you very much for your troubles and efforts. I have just discovered that this is a common fault in Windows Internet Explorer 8. The reason is that the Screen Icon<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9643462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">,
</a>which is automatically installed by windows, will repeat itself on subsequent installs and never be installed freshly. This Icon develops a kink which causes it to set up I.E. 8 in NO ADD ONS mode. This problem is one of the better kept secrets, but this
 morning I was given this Microsoft . Fix link for this problem by a member of a different group here in Australia. I cannot explain just how much trouble this lack of any feedback from Microsoft has caused me or why they have allowed a problem to occur in
 Windows without an update to fix it, but I am going to spend the rest of the day here, updating this new install and trying to reinstall all of my software. Please look at this link and you will see that it's basic function is only to uninstall and delete
 the screen Icon and then to install a replacement icon from somewhere else. I have written to Microsoft explaining all of this, but I am very disappointed by it all.<br />
<br />
Thank you sir,<br />
<br />
Kevin<br />
<br />

            <p>&nbsp;No, really?&nbsp; Everytime I logged on using Internet Explorer it would take me to another Microsoft location to upgrade my out-dated browser!&nbsp; I have hit that stupid thing at least 5 times and still do not have it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If Microsoft is trying to get me back to MSN, forget it.&nbsp; Why pay for internet access on a system that is too damn slow, keeps freezing up and then closes down?&nbsp; And it's the same company that is suppose to be the BEST!&nbsp; At what, getting its customers
 mad enough to start buying OS computers and products?&nbsp; If you cannot make it without charging for the internet and actually making it work maybe you should get out of the business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I don't want windows 10 free or not!&nbsp; I have a cell phone to make calls not surf the damn web or constantly text people.&nbsp; If I wanted that I would just stay home.&nbsp; Why not fix your damn phones or browsers or I-Phone tags so that it registers that you are
 in a MOVING CAR and blocks all text and calls untill the car has been stopped for at least 15-minutes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I had an accident in August, 4 vehicles and I was in the front.&nbsp; The **** that hit everyone else NEVER EVEN HIT his brakes bse he was too damn busy with his cell phone!&nbsp; Why doesn't Microsoft set the stage by making the first safety device for all phones,
 no matter who makes the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even took Google out to see if it was the problem and still cannot download upgrade to Internet Explorer?</p>

<p>Hi Gunny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you're getting this concern is due to account configured in Outlook. We'd like to ask a few questions or us to better assist you. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To clarify, are you using Outlook 2016 or others?</li><li>Which domain are you using?</li><li>Are you getting any specific error messages when logging in or when changing your password?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you open Outlook in safe mode, then configure the email account and check if Outlook will work as expected. To open Outlook in safe mode, press
<strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>R</strong> keys, type<strong> excel /safe</strong>, then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check your account on the Outlook web app &gt; <strong>Account settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>Security and privacy</strong> &gt; <strong>More security settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Create a new app password</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response. </p>

hello ken, im trying to recover a emailadres that has a @live.nl emailadres setup as its recovery mail. but that @live.nl emailadres has been removed for some reason. it doesnt excist anymore and i cant make it again because of microsoft no longer allowing
 you to make a @live.nl email. the other recovery option asks for recently send email topics and recievers. but i never really send any emails on that account. i just recieved them. what do i do?

<p>certainly, you can do a full install - but, you will need to pay - !</p>
<p>
</p><p>the so called 'free' offer is limited to an existing qualifying product - without that - you are screwed.</p>
<p>NO 'free' update..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have been testing on and old OEM machine or VM to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>HELP MS and the insider program</strong></em></span> - then you are also screwed as you will not get a license for install on anything but the old cra99y pc you installed it on to test it.</p>

            <p>I installed W 10 on a separate SSD&nbsp; and change between W8.1 and W 10 by rebooting and choosing the other drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeps OS's isolated from each other ( not that that's necessary just a precaution in case W 10 went wonky ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm using the same computer for both, just separate drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just saw another place where it says there are iso files for the latest releases too so there should be one when the final release comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might stay with W 8.1 for a year or so anyway cause I think there is no chance everything about W 10 will be ready by the given release date.</p>

<h2>            Got 0xc000021a every certain time</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am having a problem recently with my Windows 10 TP build 9926. I often get BSOD with 0xc000021a problem. Usually after playing FSX or other heavy games. What can I do to fix this?<br />
<br />
So before the BSOD starts to occur, I experienced an event like when explorer.exe crashes (taskbar and wallpaper missing).<br />
<br />
Here is a link to my dump files&nbsp;<br />
http://1drv.ms/1yGQ9kP<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.

            <span>Hi,<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community Forums. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
</span><span>The error code that you mentioned occurs when the file responsible for Windows logon called Winlogon.exe or Csrss.exe fails.
</span><span>Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications. If the error occurred after the installation
 of a new or updated device driver, system service, or third-party application, the new software should be removed or disabled. Contact the manufacturer of the software about a possible update.</span><span><br />
<br />
Also refer to the link: Resolving Blue Screen errors in Windows<br />
