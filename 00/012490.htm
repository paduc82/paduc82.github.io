<h2>            1 TB with office 365 home</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have never used OneDrive before and one of the reasons for getting Office 365 Home was to use the 1TB of OneDrive. Installed office yesterday and I have now got the 1TB. Great all is good in the world:-).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have today now installed Office on a second computer of my daughters. This is new laptop and she has never used anything other than outlook in the past. Again, all good (still need to find a way of getting her old outlook folders transferred across to
 the new laptop but that will be another story). </p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I check the OneDrive account on this PC, it is 15gb in size only.</p>
<p>How do I get this to be 1TB as the software states? Is there a time delay in this or should it be instant?</p>

<h2>            Outlook Safelinks Protection and Facebook Logins from email messages</h2>
                    <p>Facebook has twice locked my account from a suspicious login when I clicked on a link in a Facebook email from my Outlook account.&nbsp; The link is a modified link from Outlook Safelinks Protection.&nbsp; Facebook reports a login from IP address 40.107.217.14 which
 is somewhere in Texas. The link opens in my Kindle Fire Silk Browser.&nbsp; Is this suspicious login due to the redirection of the Facebook link through the safelinks.protection.outlook.com website?&nbsp; This is really annoying.</p>

<p>I use the same email address for Outlook and Facebook, password is different.</p>
<p>After my Facebook account was locked and I changed my password, I was able to log in to Facebook using different devices.&nbsp; Both times my Facebook account was locked, it happened after clicking the email link from my Kindle device.</p>
<p>No one else has access to my account.</p>
<p>I checked my Microsoft account for recent activity over the past few weeks.&nbsp; Other than a couple of unsuccessful syncs, everything looks normal.</p>
<p>Can you confirm whether the Texas IP address is associated with Outlook Safelinks Protection?</p>
<p>If I know the problem is a result of the protected link, then I will avoid using Facebook email links in the future.</p>
<p>The Facebook reported suspicious activity that triggers the locked account shows that the activity happened right at the time I clicked the link, so it seems like that action is triggering the suspicious activity.</p>
<p>I am unsure if the trigger is associated with a "Like this post" type of link or just any Facebook link.&nbsp; Some of the Facebook email links just give you quick access to someone's status.</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. If you were able to log out from your Facebook account using different devices, if no one has access to your account other than you and if everything looks normal on the recent activity page, then it means that your account
 should be safe and all good. Plus the fact that you already changed your password which is a good move. Now since you mentioned that you are being locked out after clicking the link from your email, would it be possible if you can send us a brief description
 of the message about the protected link. We will try to validate and check it on our end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>Well it happened again.&nbsp; I have been avoiding clicking any links from Facebook emails, but since you asked, I tried it again and got the same problem with a locked account.&nbsp; This time I did it from my PC.&nbsp; I had to change my password again.&nbsp; Facebook regularly
 sends emails notifying people that their friends have updated their status or added a photo along with a link to the friends Facebook page and a link to the status/photo.&nbsp; In this case I received an email notifying me that a friend added a photo.&nbsp; I clicked
 on the photo link.&nbsp; It opened a window with the photo page.&nbsp; A few seconds later, the window changed from the photo to a message from Facebook telling me about a suspicious login from Texas IP address 40.107.217.50 and required me to change my password again.</p>
<p>Here is the link from the email.&nbsp; I have changed the link to remove references to my email address for privacy reasons, and would appreciate it if you could remove the link from this message after you have seen it. Or remove this message entirely.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phishing and spoof come in different forms online. Another way of identifying a phishing email is by hovering the mouse on the URL (Uniform Source Locator) of the email. If it shows an unknown URL, then it's a confirmed scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided, we encourage you to report it by following the steps provided
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/phishing-scams.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. We also suggest that you contact the support team of Facebook to check if there's additional protection that can
 be added to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you need any assistance, feel free to share your thoughts with us. </p>

<p>So are you saying that the link I provided would be Phishing or Spoofing? With the new Outlook Safelinks it is incredibly difficult to even read a URL&nbsp;now when you hover over it&nbsp;because of the added information added to the link.&nbsp; Examining the link itself
 we see </p>

            Thank you Brian for the IP information.&nbsp; It looks pretty clear since the IP belongs to Microsoft that the Safelinks Protection is the cause for Facebook flagging suspicious activity and locking my account.&nbsp; Thank you Joan for requesting help from the Answer
 Desk Team. There are no proxies on my devices and Facebook is flagging activity from the Microsoft IP.&nbsp; I did report the problem to Facebook.&nbsp; If I hear back from them, I will reply again.&nbsp; Thank you for your support.

<p>I haven't done it yet.......but I would try first opening Excel, and then turning on the Macro Recorder, and then doing a Data &gt; GetExternalData and then following the menus to try and bring in your Saved Query.....if successful, then turn off the Macro
 Recorder and hopefully you will have a macro to do it for you next time.</p>

            Well, that is the next delemma, for some reason, it won't allow me to do that. I right click on the tab in the new workbook, select Move or Copy, and when I click the drop down to choose my existing workbook, it does not show in the choices.

<h3> .朱  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 - Cell Multiple Selection</h2>
                    <p>Normally, in Microsoft products, [Ctrl+MouseClick] means multiple selection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in Excel 2013 (Office 365), when using&nbsp;[Ctrl+MouseClick], if a cell is selected several times, it will be rendered darker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>===Environment===</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 Chinese Language</p>
<p>Office: Office 365 ProPlus, Version 15.0.4727.1003</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>===Reproduce===</p>
<p>1. Select an area in Excel</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe1f6a3b-9211-45e1-a233-402b73aad130" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Ctrl + Click to select several cells in the area. The more you click, the darker the cells present.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed3c35b1-68f3-4656-818f-bfcf8d7402f2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;Ctrl + Click to select random cells, same behavior.</p>

<p>
</p><p>

You can download the My Phone application from http://myphone.microsoft.com/install and then use the service that way, once the application is installed.<br />

<h2>            How to change Timeline scale in Project 2016</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have MS Project Standard 2016. &nbsp;Previously the scale in the timeline view and gantt view matched just fine. &nbsp;even when zooming in or out. &nbsp;I open my project file today and the "Timeline" scale is
 completely off showing days of week (SMTWTFS, etc.) and I can find no way to adjust it or resync it with the Gantt view scale below. &nbsp;I have tried everything suggested by others. &nbsp;There is nothing in the View ribbon that allows me to change the timeline scale,
 right-clicking offers no options for adjusting the scale. &nbsp;HELP!</span>

<p>
</p><p>If you select the option "Pan and Zoom" on the Timeline Tools Format ribbon, make sure the timeline view is active, you can then use the zoom magnification in the lower right portion of the Project window to zoom the timeline in and out.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 build 9860 crashes... a lot&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have updated to the latest build and Im getting a lot of crashes. Im using a Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>It's mostly when im watching a movie on the Netflix App or a video from youtube.</p>
<p>The only&nbsp;way to get out of this is to kill the machine. When it restarts it stops responding right after the Surface logo is gone. It just goes black. Still alive but the screen is black. I then kill it again and it starts up with the "Dignosing your pc"
 process. I then go through the menues and choose to restart the pc using in Safe mode. Once it has restarted and I have logged in, I restart the pc again and then it (often) works.</p>
<p>This happens every day.</p>
<p>There are no updates for the system, but im wondering if something is wrong because I have not recieved any updates since I installed the latest build. The first build recieved many updates but so far I have not had any with this build.</p>

    <title>HTML formatting in Outlook.com not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lex joseph  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTML formatting in Outlook.com not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For quite a while I have used HTML format to send emails instead of Rich text. There are too many non-MS email clients that have problems with rich text and you risk that your emails look messed up if you send them to external parties. No problem: as outlook
 supports this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having switched to office 365, I am using the online Outlook more and more. But the problem is: when you switch to HTML there, your message formatting is lost upon sending. I attached a before and after screenshot of the email and how it looks (for starters,
 all CR/LF's are gone, making the email look like it was sent by some kid that doesn't use proper spacing and interpunction). And I confirmed that it looks the same on the side of the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using outlook.com on a Windows 10 desktop machine, running Internet explorer 11.212.10586.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already contacted the helpdesk via chat, but they told me that HTML is only there in case you want to send actual scripts and that you should not use it otherwise. But I don't get that. Why would you include it as a default option in that case? And if
 your are going to remove all CR/LFs, why not warn the user before sending that his formatting will be lost? Now&nbsp; I look like a total idiot to my customers.... :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions in short:</p>
<p>- Is this really the intended behaviour?</p>
<p>- If so, is it not an idea to warn the user instead of just sending the email out this way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before pressing send:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0ac9957-57ac-4396-ba20-751c37675fa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0ac9957-57ac-4396-ba20-751c37675fa7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then how it looks after sending, both on my and the receivers side: a single line of text:</p>

            <p>Hi Amrita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply. So I did some tests and found the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I tried on a different machine: a desktop also running Windows 10 fully updated (not much choice of OS anymore, I went full 10 across all my devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When sending via Internet Explorer: same problem</p>
<p>When sending via Opera: same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I had an idea. I realised that I am sending my emails via another account that I have set up in my Outlook.com. I have my own domain but consolidated all my email in my Office 365 Outlook.com account for easier management. So I have this extra email
 account set up using POP3/SMTP and usually send out via that account. So then I tried a HTML message via the original Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it was fine and the email layout was not lost! So it only happens if I send out HTML formatted emails via SMTP via the added email account. Now that I know I can deal with it, but if there is any way to circumvent or even solve this problem, I'd love
 to hear it. I am also curious to hear if this is a problem that occurs in general or if it is some freak thing that is maybe caused by the mail server that runs my external email account.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lex</p>

<h2>            can i add gpedit.msc to windows 10&#63; &#40;to fix defender group policy problem&#41;</h2>
                    <p>windows 10 says windows defender is off by group policy</p>
<p>
</p><p>from research, this can be fixed by running gpedit.msc</p>
<p>
</p><p>but, windows 10 as loaded does not have gpedit.msc</p>
<p>
</p><p>so, windows defender will never be able to run</p>
<p>
</p><p>no virus protection present</p>
<p>
</p><p>real-time protection under update and security/windows defender&nbsp;is on, but not accessible to turn off</p>

            <p>windows 10</p>
<p>how to get defender running when it is blocked by&nbsp;group policy:</p>
<p>windows key with&nbsp;r&nbsp;</p>
<p>regedit</p>
<p>move to</p>
<p>hkey_local_machine\software\policies\Microsoft\windowsdefender</p>
<p>in registry delete: disable antispyware</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a Trojan called win32/Patched.AP which might have disabled the Microsoft protection and made it unable to activate.</p>
<p>This was removed once I got defender working again.</p>
<p>Slowly, after a few tries, the scan started working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the solution came from a site: quora and some nice person whose name I did not record</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is more effective then the gpedit.msc approach because gpedit is not available on home installs (and I don't know if it would have worked)</p>

    <title>OneNote Windows 10 - Export selected pages to PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanfriedman  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Windows 10 - Export selected pages to PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently tried migrating from OneNote 2016 to the OneNote app. I have been using various OneNote versions for the past five years extensively in school for both note taking and homeworks, however the OneNote app appears to be lacking essential features
 that OneNote 2016 has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most critical aspect of using OneNote for homework assignments as a student is being able to submit assignments from OneNote. I need to be able to export a selected range of pages to a PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the limitations of file organization in the notebook-&gt;subject-&gt;page-&gt;subpage format, here is the organization I have to adopt as a student:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notebook = Class</p>
<p>Section = Unit</p>
<p>Page = A day of notes, a homework assignment, or recitation notes</p>
<p>SubPage = Used to group pages of a homework assignment together that are all formatted on 8.5*11 page size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While sharing a OneNote notebook is the best way to share OneNote notes, teachers require either a printed copy or PDF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached some screenshots of both OneNote 2016 and OneNote App to show how this feature is missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I export selected pages?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/824075ca-0e30-4135-ad6b-ff46638d79e8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/824075ca-0e30-4135-ad6b-ff46638d79e8?upload=true" /></a>ages
 in the OneNote App?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excellent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's great to see Microsoft really cares about helping its consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who has seen all the features they released recently that do not help students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's ****. Whoever is product manager for OneNote should be fired. </p>
<p>Why do they decide to remove important features and instead have their developers spend time on useless features?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since retired my Surface - it has gotten incredibly slow with terrible battery life. Without OneNote being useful, it serves no purpose to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            ik kan mijn WOrd documenten niet meer saven behalve in Compatibility mode</h2>
                    <p>ondanks het feit dat het document gemaakt is in een template Word 2013, is het onmogelijk om mijn bestand op te slaan. Telkens weer kom ik op het scherm van 'save as'. Ook al geef ik het document een andere naam, zelfs op een andere locatie opslaan... hij
 stuurt me telkens terug naar dit scherm met als suggestie de bestaande documentnaam. Ook de melding 'you already have file named...' werkt niet. Als ik op 'yes' klik kom ik opnieuw in het 'save as' scherm. Ook het document sluiten via de sluitknop geeft hetzelfde
 resultaat. Als ik ergens op 'no' klik, ben ik gewoon alles kwijt want blijkbaar werkt de autosave ook niet.</p>
<p>

            <p>problem solved meanwhile. Apparently, the original document was made in Mac and then copied into a wordfile instead of following the normal procedure to export Mac to Word.</p>

<h2>            How do I set the position of a mailmerge field based on the value of that field &#40;0 goes on the left of the page, 100 on the right&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I have a mail merge spreadsheet with a "Score" column that is 0-100. &nbsp;I would like the position of this field in my word document to be based on the value of the field. &nbsp;A 0 would be on the left side of the page, and a 100 would be on the right side. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried adding whitespace to the spreadsheet, storing " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10" instead of "10." Unfortunately the mailmerge robot strips off this whitespace as it imports the field into word. Any ideas?</div>

            <p>I have a similar question. I am using outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an address book imported (using CSV) from both Linkedin and Gmail, as well as some Outlook contacts. It is basically a mess. I simply want to start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of my contacts are duplicated, merged incorrectly. I have over 1000 entries. I think I can do this by uploading a single CSV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use this with other apps such as Outlook and T-Bird. I need a cleaner address book. It seems each effort I make in having a single solid address book takes me two steps backward into a bigger mess.</p>

<h2>            Location of Address Block</h2>
                    I'm newly using MS Word 2010 with Windows 7.&nbsp; In doing a mail merge with envelopes, the address block locates in the sender address space instead of the typical recipient address location and I can't seem to get around this except to click on the recipient
 location, insert another address block, and delete the one in the sender location.&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?

<p>Probably best not to use the Address Block and just insert the individual merge fields in the configuration that YOU want them.</p>
<p>However, I would guess that what is happening is that when you are initially inserting the Address Block, the selection must be in the return address area of the envelope rather than in the address area itself.</p>
<p>If you click on the Show/Hide ¶ button, it will be easier to see when you must place the selection when inserting the merge fields.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            I am trying to use Dashlane password manager with IE10.</h2>
                    <p>Dashlane free works in Firefox but I cannot get it to work with IE10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dashlane aren't much help. Maybe they would be more help if I was a paying customer, but I would not want to pay unless I could be sure it would work in the end.</p>
<p>Does anyone use Sashlane and have you any tips to get it to work with IE</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back.</p>
<p>I eventually got Dashlane to work in IE .</p>
<p>I am not sure whether the key step was Restore Advanced Settings in Internet Options or going into IE&nbsp; downloads and clicking something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used computers for over a decade, assembled two of them and installed all the software myself so I am moderately experienced, but&nbsp;I found getting Dashlane to work was quite along haul</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be good if&nbsp;Dashlane's installer could check the IE settings and tell you which to change before installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most software these days needs little input from the user and that is what I like!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it is working Dashlane is really useful and I will recommend to to friends, but I reckon many will get stuck getting it to work.</p>
