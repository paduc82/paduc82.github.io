<h2>            Excel alert not enough memory</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I've recently encountered a strange issue with Excel for Mac from Microsoft's 2016 package. On certain spreadsheets it displays an message saying:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
'Alert Not Enough Memory.' As per the screenshot below.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
There is plenty of space on the hard drive and plenty of available RAM. I tried running it in Safe mode, repaired disk permissions and tried converting the document to .xlsx all with no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!</p>

            I suddenly started having this exact same problem on a MacBook Pro with a lot of free RAM and hard disk space. I found the cause of the problem was that I had changed the colour of the gridlines in my workbook (Excel&gt;Preferences&gt;View&gt;Gridlines), when I
 set it back to automatic the problem disappeared. This was reproducible on every workbook I tried, change the colour of gridlines, out of memory alert pops up when trying to save, set it back to automatic, no alert. Obviously a bug, this was with Excel 15.20
 on OS X 10.11.4., MacBook Pro 8GB RAM, 240GB SSD (200GB free).

<h2>            Epress website not working correctly in Internet Explorer after lumia cyan update</h2>
                    
<p>I have been reading newspapers at <a href="http://www.epress.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.epress.fi</a> for some time without a problem on my lumia 1020.</p>
<p>After I installed the Lumia Cyan update reading is not possible anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually read: Vasabladet and Hufvudstadsbladet.</p>
<p>After the update it does open the newspapers first page but after that is extremely slow to zoom or change page. It can take upp to 15 seconds between screen refresches. One can simply read there anymore with the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there were no problems before the update I can only guess that some update to Internet Explorer har rendered it incompatible with that website.</p>

            hi mate, yes there were changes in the browser for Windows Phone 8.1, and then again for Update for WP8.1 (for those using dev preview, its not on the official channel yet). in this case, check that u are up to date with the latest firmware along with
 the latest Nokia system app updates from the Store, and try performing a soft rese.t

<p>Not sure about the firmware version. If it is the Lumia Cyan Core Build ID it is: 3051.50009.1424.1362.</p>
<p>All apps have been updated from the store.</p>
<p>If a soft reset is simply a phone reboot then that has been done to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll guess its best to wait for the update för WP8.1 and see if the problem is resolved after that.</p>

            you perform a soft reset by pressing and holding the volume down and power keys until the phone turns off and vibrates. the date and time will be reset too once the phone powers up again.<br />
<br />
you can either wait for the WP8.1 Update to come in a few months, or you can grab it now by enrolling in the Preview for Developers program. there were extensive changes to the web browsing experience in the Update i have referred to above so that may help
 you out.

            Download nokia updater connect your phone to computer with CA-53 cable and download the latest firmware for your N73, for this you have to be connected to the internet. It will solve the problem.

            I just want to share this,,,,,,There are some cases similar w/ your problem here in the Phil.,,, the reason here is this,,,some people here are using more than one sim card (of different netwok providers). And because only one sim card is configured (GPRS
 and MMS) w/ the unit, and if you change the simcard w/ another simcard,,there will be a problem in the configuration. That was what happenened to my friend,,he has an openline cellphone so he can switch to different networks),,he had same problem. he learned
 it, when he called the customer service of the network provider. The customer service personnel asked him if he is using more than one simcard. and my friend replied yes, and that was the cause of the problem w/ his cellphone according to the customer service
 of the service provider. He reformatted his cellphone and stop using more than one simcard,, and the problem is solved. It happened not only to my friend, but to some other people that i've talked to. And in my opinion,, to stop the s

<p>SMS Accelerator won't solve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most probably the phone stops responding because of issues with the network. Sending SMS involves using the network, and hence if ther's something wrong with the signal or the tower changes very quickly, there is a possibility that the phone stops responding.
 Consult the customer care of your network provider and find out if there is a method to refresh your SIM. Vodafone India provides an easy method to "update" the SIM. Though their technical department tells me that it doesn't really "update" the SIM, it has
 worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't solve your problem,&nbsp; then go to the next step, ie., turn off the phone, remove the battery and SIM, wait for 10-15 minutes and then put them back in and restart your phone. If you still face issues, then try resetting your phone to factory
 settings. You can do this by typing *#7870#&nbsp; and pressing the Green call button.</p>

<p>so, there are many with the same problem as mine. my n73me also hangs in the midst of some operation like</p>
<ul>
<li>opening a new sms</li><li>opening the gallery</li><li>opening a new application</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>and even started hanging while a incoming call comes in, without even ringing or displaying the caller name.</li></ul>
<p>and the only way to come out of it is to remove the battery.</p>
<p>sometimes the phone would just hang repeatedly in a couple of mins.</p>
<p>i've also noticed the amount of heat generation during battery charging is high. battery inturn heats up the phone as well.</p>
<p>i'm sure the temperature goes well beyond the normal operating temperature range specified in the manual by many degrees.</p>
<p>here's what i do to overcome the issues for limited period as i don't think there is any other alternative than to get rid of the phone.</p>
<ul>
<li>backup the contents individually so that u dont need to restore the fulll phone memory back..eg: contacts alone</li><li>occasionally reset the phone.....need to do both the soft and hard reset(*#7370# and *#7780#). that solves the issue for some weeks.</li><li>reinstalling the firmware using nokia software updater is the best option if the above option tends to fail. upon reinstalling the firmware the phone tends to work fine for a couple of months.</li><li>remove the battery from the phone for a night once a week...heard it has a good effect.....i believe so</li></ul>
<p>i usually install applications on my phone like dictionary, the google suite, games etc. but once these problems started arising, i dont install any.</p>
<p>i dont know how it works for u guys, but this is what i do to tackle the situation as i haven't found any better options till now.</p>

<p>If you have problem specifically when sending SMS then check that you have Reports set to off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goto Messaging, Options - Settings, Text Message, "Receive Report", and make sure that is set to"no". Some networks don't support this, so unless you know for certain your network does then switch it off, otherwise phone is waiting for reports for every
 message you have ever sent.</p>

</p><p>I'm using Excel 2016. In the pivot table, I've added a few fields to Filters section. The data type of the field is number. However, in the drop down filter at the top of the pivot table, it only give a drop down list to choose. I'd want to be able to choose
 by value range such as greater than 100.&nbsp;</p>

Just select a cell next to pivot in the column next to last column of Excel and then filter will be enabled in Data tab which you can press.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b624c9e-9d5b-4832-8205-8a3b5227d601?upload=true" />

<p>I recently had to debug this very same problem and found that the error is caused by the instant actions setting.</p>
<p>More specifically the error is caused by a corrupted target folder setting and the interpreting JavaScript which isn't able to correctly handle getting the "Instant Actions" images for this non existing folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>- Disable "Show instant actions" on the page/menu: Inbox &gt; Options &gt; <span>Instant actions</span>.</p>
<p>- Optionally re-enable the same setting as it will correct the corrupted setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help.</p>

<p>No phone I've ever had had a one-button press to 911. But they've all had a way to call 911 even from the lock screen. WP7's is hitting emergency call on the lock screen (if it has a PIN)</p>
<p>I guess you COULD make a contact for 911, and then pin it to the start menu.</p>

<h2>            Opening .xml  via excel on Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm unable to open .xml files directly in excel (Via double click). My office version is :&nbsp;Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I already tried setting Excel as the default app via "Open with" . This is not possible as, Excel is not shown in the list of selectable apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I can only open the .xml files from within an open excel sheet. When I double click an .xml file it automatically opens it in WordPad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest how I set excel as the default app for .xml files?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

            Hi Richard,
<br />
<br />Yes that is the default XMl viewer in Office
<br />
<br />Open Excel
<br />
<br />Then open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />Find Excel in the list of processes
<br />
<br />Right click that and choose Open file location
<br />
<br />Note down the location of the Excel execurtable
<br />
<br />Then you can redirect the file association to that executable using the method above . . .

                    I have just been given a (never used) Acer Laptop, it's running Windows 7 and MS Office 2007.

<br />
The problem is the ribbon and menu of Microsoft Office don't show in English. I have tried most support forum advice and none of it works..<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tried so far</span><br />

            Do you recognize the language being used? Can you think of ANY reason why it may have been used. For example when you did the installation did you select a location that uses that language?<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>All I can suggest is a fresh installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>download a new installation file, making sure it is English. <br />
</li><li>Uninstall using method 2 or 3 in the following tip, <br />
</li><li>reboot the computer 2 times <br />
</li><li>install and activate again.</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<b><span>2010 Full Download</span></b>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: if you do not have the installation file on an “official” MS installation disk, download and save it to your HD. Then you should burn it to one or more DVDs for future
 use. And at the same time, write down the product key on the DVD. You need both items for future installations, say after your computer crashes and you have re-installed windows. At that point you won’t be able to extract it from the registry and won’t remember
 where the online account is.</p>

I doubt this will change the menu, but you might want to try it.&nbsp; it will have to be a "braille" approach since you don't understand the interface language.<br />
<ul>
<li>Start Word</li><li>click on the "Office button"</li><li>on the bottom right of the displayed menu, there are 2 buttons. click on the one farther from the RIGHT margin of the dialog. That is the "Word Options" button if you can recognize it in that language. The other is "exit Word"</li><li>The first option in the list should be selected, that is "Popular"</li><li>On the bottom right of the displayed options there is a "Language settings ..." button, click on it</li><li>This displays the "Microsoft Office Language Settings 2007" dialog (similar to regional settings)</li><li>There are 2 tabs: "Editing Languages" and "About Language Settings".</li><li>In the Editing Languages" tab there are 2 input boxes at the top.&nbsp; On the left is the "Available Editing Languages", and on the right is "Enabled Editing Languages". You should see some form of English in the right hand window.&nbsp; If you don't see English
 is that short list, find it in the "Available" list, single click on it<br />
<br />
BETWEEN the 2 input dialog boxes there are 2 buttons, "Add" and "Remove". Initially they are both disabled. When you click on an 'Available...' language, the upper one, "Add", is enabled.
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click on the ADD button.</li><li>Now you can click on the other unwanted languages in the "Enabled Editing..." dialog.</li><li>Click on the Remove button</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Below the 2 big input fields is a drop down to enable the "Primary Editing Language". Select english.</p>
<p>At the bottom right of the "... Language Settings 2007" dialog box are 2 buttons, OK and Cancel. Click on the OK button.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you most propably need to configure the MMS connection and server on your device.</p>
<p>To do this you need fundamental information from your carrrier like MMS connection settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have these you must create a new connection under "Start-Settings-Connections-Connections";</p>
<p>Afterwards, you must open the messaging application and go to the "MMS Options" and add the server and all the settings you carrier must provide, and choose the connection previously created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nuno</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 running on Windows 8.1 won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outllok 2016 on Windows 8.1 won't open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had some Windows updates yesterday which didn't seem to install properly (annoyingly Windows 8.1 doesn't do them automatically like Windows 7 - please tell me why anyone thinks Windows 8.1 is better than Windows 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I found some free download advocated my Microsoft which said some files hadn't downloaded and then I went in the install bit of Windows 8.1 and ensured they were installed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new profile in Outlook that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a whole clean boot and that didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a Change and Repair and that didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did&nbsp;a Change and Repair via the Internet and that didn't work - and you've reinstalled Office 365 - and that didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to see if the AppData is being redirected to a network location - but there isn't a folder called App Data
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to open Outlook in safe mode and that didn't work; I get this message;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The command line argument is not working. Check which switch you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single day of my life there is a problem with Windows 8.1 and Outlook 206 (I never asked for it, when I decided to reinstall Office 365 - because Outlook 2013 wasn't working -&nbsp;computer forced me to have NEW Outlook 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, who can help?</p>

            Hi Edward,<br />
<br />
To narrow down the issue, could you provide the following details?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. About “our work is stored on a PC based network”, could you share with the detailed steps and some screenshots to save the Excel file to the network?&nbsp;<br />
2. Is a new folder created when editing a file with Excel for Mac and saving it in the network? Does the issue occur when creating a new Excel file in the network?&nbsp;<br />
3. The version of Excel 2011 for Mac.&nbsp;<br />
4. A video about the steps to reproduce the issue is also appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You could check and respond to it via

            Hi Randall
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try installing an older version of Skype for Android to see if it works..
<br />
<br />Try below steps and see if the issue still persists:
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.
<br />
<br />Go to APK site, APKMirror <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apkmirror.com/</a>, and download and install Skype for Android 8.25.0.5.

    <title>Office Pro 2013 Reinstall. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don keeley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Pro 2013 Reinstall.</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my desktop running Office Pro 2013 with 2016. I decided to reload the 2013 Pro to my laptop currently running Office Pro 2010. The system won't automatically allow me to upgrade now, and the phone connect is no longer supported according
 to Microsoft. How to I clear the current connection so I can reload the 2013 on my laptop? One more little hook. I had already upgraded the laptop with Outlook 2016; any snags there I will soon be finding?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I appreciate it in advance</p>
<p>

            <p>Office 2013 is allowed to be installed on only one machine at a time (as it appears you already know). It also includes the right to transfer it to a new computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2013 is still activated to the hardware, but there is an option to also associate it to your email account, and manage it through the MyAccount site.&nbsp; If you did that it is easier to manage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are trying to do a phone activation and getting the message that it is no longer supported. That is just MS's clumsy attempt to trick people into "upgrading" to 365.&nbsp; It has been a problem for a long time now, MS has no excuse for not
 fixing it by now ... &lt;sigh&gt;.&nbsp; Here is how to get around that problem</p>
<div>
<strong><span>2017 01 20- "Telephone activation is no longer supported for your product" error when activating Office</span></strong>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MS oops'd, and just hasn't bothered to fix the problem in much too long.&nbsp; A MS staffer provided an "explanation" and a link (in green) to a page with a link to get the phone number for your specific geographic location</span></p>
