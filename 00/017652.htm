<h2>            MS 365 Desktop Setup Tool is failing - when will it be fixed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>365 Desktop Setup Tool </strong>that is required to configure prerequisites for Office 2007 connecting to a 365 account is failing at Microsoft (19th Aug) - I've tried from multiple different locations over &nbsp;the last day and with different accounts
 - its definitely a failing at MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="MS 365 Desktop Setup Tool">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50360</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea when this will be fixed? I have a weekend 365 migration to complete and this will stop the office working until its resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for checking. Maybe you could ask the powers that be - how can MS disable an app that is the ONLY way to enable a migration of Office 2007/2010 connecting to 365? Did they consider the impact on customers? With multi billion resources of MS they disable
 a live app and say - 'well, wait a few days..' ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears there is no way to load the 365 Desktop Tool components separately - is there? I asked via the 365 support link and they were clueless as to what the tool even was. I can load the '365 Sign-in Assistant' manually (one of the tools components)
 but I'm not sure what the other remaining elements are - at least two others if I remember.<br />
</p>
<p>Please update if you have more info..</p>
<p>

<p>The only other way to install Office 365/Office 2016 right now is using an installation disk. Even some other big companies tend to have some problem with its products. Just like the recalling of SUVs that had some issues last January. We're doing it in
 order to serve you better. Why? Because lately, hackers are targeting Microsoft's product, leading to spams on Outlook, Ransomware invasion, etc. So, we decided to do something to prevent further issues with our software. We guarantee you that the setup tool
 will be up and running in no time. Thank you for understanding.</p>

</p><p>Though I think you are confused - an existing link is failing as someone has broken the functionality and MS haven't noticed and don't care- it hasn't been withdrawn, recalled, moved, re-issued, depreciated or eaten by Bill Gates - its just broken. Note
 that this has nothing to do with recalls of a car you may drive.<br />

<p>I reported to MS but they chose to do nothing about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround to get Outlook 2007 to connect to 365 was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run the <strong>Online Services Sign-in Assistant</strong>: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28177</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Run the <strong>Outlook 2007 patch&nbsp;</strong><strong>KB2768023</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39902</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This worked for Outlook 2007 connecting to 365 on Windows XP, 7 &nbsp;and 10. With XP I think I had to manually set the profile information in Outlook but that was just copied from another working Outlook profile on the same 365 domain (i.e so the server name
 is set correctly).</p>

</p><p>... No, it hasn't been fixed - it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spoken to 365 'support' and they refuse to escalate the fault as they don't know what the tool is how it works. &nbsp;One rep said that they can't &nbsp;load software on their PCs so cant test it (?!)</p>

<p>I know you can totally disable Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I want WD to be running, what I don't want is Real Time Protection running all the time, it causes alot of games to crash.
</p>
<p>Civ 6 Dx12 Version crashes continuously until RTP is disabled.&nbsp; Then it only crashes intermittently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here is that, when RTP switches itself back on, it causes an immediate Civ6 No Signal Error, which then forces a hard reset of the computer, which in turn damages my ssd installation, ultimately it can cause corruptions which will then require
 a clean install of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is a knock on effect of Windows Defender Real Time Protection design.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of permanently disabling RTP until I want to re enable it? </p>

            The problem is that the very nature of the real time protection is the conflict.&nbsp; Disabling it is the only way to resolve the issue the problem is with windows defenders design.&nbsp; That said, I have to completely disable Malware Protection to run the same
 games.&nbsp; AV is not needed at all, when playing games.&nbsp; It is only needed when browsing or opening email attachments and clicking on links etc in websites.<br />

<p>I've tried everything I can think of, game modes, exception list, port bypasses etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only surefire way is to completely disable it.&nbsp; However, you need to reenable as well.&nbsp; I like the idea of a system that say, allows it to be disabled until next reboot, but the current system that disables for a period of time, then reenables without
 warning, which in doing so, causes the system to detect false flags and block processes, which then cause the programs affected to crash.&nbsp; In the case of Civ which is a very cpu/gpu intensive game, esp in late game, it has consequences and some of those are
 replacing damaged hardware as a direct consequence of microsofts software. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lately had to replace a psu from a very reputable company, that started to fail within 9 months, it could be argued that the cause of the psu failure was a direct result of the pc crashing due to WD restarting Active Protection mid process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately it was all done under warranty. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to standardise our systems to prevent this kind of auto restart in processes, esp in av/firewall systems.&nbsp; It is simply unacceptable that in 2018 we are still using coding paradigms to create software where basically noone cares how their system
 works with other "3rd party" systems because of the inevitable get out clause of "we can't be held responsible for 3rd party software"&nbsp; When their own software is causing conflicts with software that isn't known to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, Civ 6, does also crash randomly entirely on it's own.&nbsp; This I can attest to as I have access to 3 computer systems with completely different specs and Civ 6 crashes on all 3 systems in similar ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that as yet, noone knows the answer to my question.&nbsp; I expect it will require m/s to actively redesign windows defender so that this kind of issue just can't happen. Until then, I'll just have to completely disable it, either leaving the system
 unprotected or find another av system that does work without causing other issues.&nbsp; Which to date, I haven't actually ever seen any av system that works better than WD.&nbsp; It seems by the nature of these systems that they are and always will complicate matters
 irrevocably.</p>

<h2>            Counting the results from an Access 2007 Query</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a query which filter calls by date and Customer.</p>
<p>I can filter by using &gt;= startdate and &lt;+FinishDate with another Column filtering by Customer.</p>
<p>I am however at a loss as how to count the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can go to Datasheet and use the totals and count via the Sum Button, nut how do I sue this result in a from or other function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot seem to get the count to work through the Query design as all it seems to do is return 1 in every row without a total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please forgive me if I have not provided enough info I basically wan to run a query (via Query Design) that counts the calls for Customer X between the start date and the end date</p>

            <p>If ALL you want is a count, you can change the query to a Totals query using the Greek Sigma icon on the ribbon. Change the default "Group By" on the totals row to Count under the primary key field, leave it Group By under customer ID, and change it to Where
 under the date field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see the individual sales and also a count, it's hard to do in one query; but you can use a Form or Report and put a textbox in the footer to count records. Most finished applications use Forms for onscreen display and Reports for printing;
 query datasheets are pretty limited and I rarely expose them to view.</p>

            <p>Rather than posting a screen shot of (apparently part of) the query grid, please switch to SQL view (using the leftmost icon in the ribbon) and post the SQL text here. It may look like Old Outer Slobbovian at this point but it is the actual language of queries,
 and a lot of us can read it fluently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My GUESS (not seeing the whole query) is that you're Grouping by CallTime, and there's only one call per call time.</p>

    <title>Book fold printing for Word for Mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardkurth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Book fold printing for Word for Mac 2011</h2>
                    <p>When I was a PC user of Microsoft WORD, I was able to take an 8.5 x 14 landscape document, two column, and print it so that it would come out as a book. &nbsp;For example if there were a total of 8 columns on 4 sides of two sheets of paper, it would print the
 columns in the following manner:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Columns 8 - 1</p>
<p>Columns 2 - 7</p>
<p>Columns 6 - 3</p>
<p>Columns 4 - 5</p>
<p>Is it possible to do the same in Microsoft WORD in Microsoft OFFICE for MAC 2011?</p>

            <p>What you're actually asking about is the <strong>Book Fold</strong> option available only in the Windows versions of Word. It is not available in Mac Word, nor is it provided by a "Print Driver"... What Phillip suggested enables only printing multiple pages
 per sheet in consecutive order (i.e., 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8) as well as Duplex printing settings if supported by the printer.</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this issue that Michael is describing. All of a sudden, the menu of emoji for email have all become monochrome. I do not use add-ins and the ones installed by default are turned off. The monochrome emoji just changed two weeks ago, in mid-May.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send an email from my work account to my personal gmail, the emoji appear in the colorful Google versions. When I forward that email back to my work account, the emoji appear in the monochrome MS version, if they match. I get the empty box when there
 isn't a monochrome version (e.g., the <a href="https://emojipedia.org/lion-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
lion face</a>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fssl.gstatic.com%2fmail%2femoji%2fv7%2fpng48%2femoji_u1f981.png" height="24" width="24" />)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do notice that previous email with colorful emoji in-line will still display colorful emoji when I read them. And, when I forward those older email to myself, they still display in colorful emoji. When I copy and paste those older colorful emoji into a
 new email I'm composing, they display in color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it seems that it's the emoji menu that's changed to not use color emoji.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bring color into my life!</p>

            Thanks a lot but I already tried this and if you look at my first post that was the image that came up when I did what you just advised. It wouldn't give me the options to make a selection and this is the problem. All it says is We've set your safe search
 to strict because&nbsp;your browser communicated your preference for a safe web browsing experience. Although I never said anything like this.

<h2>            Nokia 808 - limited connectivity on all Wifi networks</h2>
                    <p>Past week I have not been able to use WiFi networks correctly. I can connect, but WiFi shows "limited connectivity". The only app which works is the webbrowser during this time, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting, deleting the network and restarting, renaming the network, trying other networks (which all worked previously), nothing fixes it.</p>

            <p>There is a sort of workaround that will fix most cases of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Settings &gt; Network Destinations</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. On the menu option on the bottom right, press &amp; select "New Destination"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Give a name to this new destination, any name other than "Internet" or WAP Services" will do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Move your used wifi networks/access points into you new category you have just made along with your mobile AP if needed (or you can just copy them if you want).<br />
<br />
5. Ensure that your new destination is set to be the "Default Connection", which can be chosen in the same menu as that for "New Destination"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should now find that you wifi connection should no longer drop into an uncategorised destination that you need to keep moving back to "Internet". The wifi access point may still come up as having limited activity in your new destination, but it should
 not drop the wifi connection. With some applications, you might have to change in their individual settings its default network destination, but should be fine once this is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be a few apps that might not work with this workaround - it seems these were written to automatically get an internet connection from the "Internet" destination and there is nothing in their options to change that. :(</p>
<p>It seems to be the problem that when a wifi AP is being used for an internet connection, it tries to connect to a Nokia server to check that the connection is working properly. But the web address for this connection seems to have suddenly gone offline and
 because the 808 (and seemingly other Symbian phones with Belle firmware) is dependent on receiving something back from this server, when it doesn't it assumes that the internet connection on your AP is not working properly, hence showing "limited connectivity".</p>

<p>Hello Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recreated your concern here on my end, and I was able to update the file properly. I'd like to ask how are you linking your spreadsheet to the document? In the meantime, try to follow the steps below to link your Excel file to your Word document:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open your Excel file &gt; Open a new document in Word.</li><li>Copy the data in Excel &gt; Paste the data in Word, using <strong>Paste Special</strong>. To perform Paste Special press
<strong>Ctrl + Alt + V</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Paste link&nbsp;</strong>&gt; Choose <strong>Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object</strong> &gt; Hit OK.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After pasting the data in Word, you may start making changes in Excel. <strong>
Make sure to save</strong> the spreadsheet before refreshing document, so that the changes would apply. Changes would apply immediately when both the document and spreadsheet are open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance by replying to this post.</p>

<p>Hi Regile, thanks for the reply. I had already tried what you suggest. It doesn't however allow for the word document to update when the spreadsheet is closed. I think I got round it by making sure that the spreadsheet is macro enabled although it doesn't
 have any macros. Any more advice would be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>I appreciate your response, I'd like to ask if the files are saved locally. Also, I would like to make sure if you're editing the files using the the Office desktop apps. In the meantime, I suggest that you repair Excel and Word. Follow the steps provided
 on this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi there. Files are saved on OneDrive and synced on my PC. The hyperlink is to the file on OneDrive. I've done the repair on the apps.&nbsp;Same issue when I retried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would appear that I'll just have to cut and paste the spreadsheet each time. Frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice anyway.</p>

            Hello again. I've just created a word document with a linked spreadsheet. Both are saved locally, not associated with OneDrive at all. Any updates work fine. Therefore I think the issue is due to the linking through OneDrive. Any thoughts?

<p>Hi&nbsp;Felipe_Farias,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customers must ensure reachability of the URLs and IP addresses that are required for the O365 service. For a complete listing of all IP addresses and URLs for Skype for Business Online, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges</a>.<br />
<br />
Skype for Business clients use a variety of ports and protocols. &nbsp;The direction and flow of network traffic for a Skype for Business session will vary depending on the type of interactions (peer-to-peer vs multiparty) and depending on the use of content sharing
 and voice/video. &nbsp;You must review and open the list of ports and protocols, paying special attention to the source and destination ports. &nbsp;For example, audio traffic uses just 20 ports (50000-50019 TCP/UDP) at the client side, but the destination port could
 be anywhere in a 10K port range (50000-59999 TCP/UDP) at the service side. This also includes opening TCP 443 and UDP 3478 on the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Optimizing-your-network-for-Skype-for-Business-Online-b363bdca-b00d-4150-96c3-ec7eab5a8a43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Optimizing your network for Skype for Business Online</a>.
 If you are using Skype for Business server, see&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398833.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ports and protocols for internal servers</a>.</p>

<h2>            Problems accessing bank account sites using Windows 7 IE 11</h2>
                    Hi. I am having trouble accesing my bank accounts, credit card accounts, PayPal, and sometimes all websites (Windows 7 using I explorer 11). Called Bank and they said I need to be using most updated versions of browser. Either Chrome, Firefox or Explorer.
 Have done that and still can't access these sites. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Amy.

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; Opening through PowerPoint allowed me to open files previously stored on my hard drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, when I tried to download from an email attachment (sent as PowerPoint online), I got a file conversion message.&nbsp; I went ahead and stored the file, but when I tried to open through PowerPoint, I got a message that the folder was empty.&nbsp; I checked
 in my files and it is there, but in what appears as random symbols.</p>

<p>Your phone is dualband only and probably supports the 900/1800 bands while most if not all Canadian networks use the 850/1900 bands. You need a triband or higher phone for higher for it to work.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible in Word 2013 &#40;Office 365&#41; to lock Header and Footer from being edited, whilst keeping Track Changes functionality&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>I am trying to lock down our header and footers for our company templates ( i have used the continuous break, protect document method) but as these are company documents we require track changes to be enabled&nbsp;so multiple users can edit a document efficiently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that Word disables the Track Changes button (and all other means of turning it on) as soon as you start the protection - which I need to do to lock the header and footer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing that when headers and footers are locked - track changes wont work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP:</p>
<p>A - is this true? Does word disable track changes like in my statement above - Because i think this is what i am experiencing</p>
<p>
</p><p>B - is there another way to achieve what I want to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note Macros are not feasible for our work site as they are local to PC's and&nbsp;i want a global fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP</p>

            <p>Hi Pippa, </p>
<p>My guess is that maybe you have forgotten to de-select the Design Mode button on the Developer tab?&nbsp; That's the only thing I can think of that would cause that option to be greyed out.&nbsp; What you want to do is set up the header and footer the way you want,
 then check those 2 boxes to "lock" the header and footer, then de-select the Design Mode button and close out of the header/footer - now you can use track changes.&nbsp; However, the protection on your header/footer will be there regardless of whether or not the
 document is "protected", unless someone goes through all of the steps to uncheck those boxes.&nbsp; Hope this helps!!&nbsp;

            The Yes, Start Enforcing Protection button is only enabled if you have specified formatting or editing restrictions in the Restrict Editing task pane. Also, it is required that the document isn't displaying in Design Mode (there is a button for Design
 Mode on the Developer tab).

    <title>Word 2010&#58; Want to draw an arc to connect random letters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> profitable  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010&#58;  Want to draw an arc to connect random letters</h2>
                    <p>As part of a pronunciation class, I want to create handouts that show a curve connecting two letters.&nbsp; For example, for the following sentence:</p>
<p>
</p><p>He's a nice guy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like a curved line under the sentence that connect the "s" in "He's" to the following "a".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can do this in a slow, painstaking way, by creating tiny two drawing objects just under the two letters, and then selecting a curve autoshape that has the drawing objects as its endpoints.&nbsp; But this is WAY too much work.&nbsp; I need to draw this
 kind of connector many times in a document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any tool in Word (I used Word 2010 in Windows 8) that will let me just, say, select the two letters I want and then click something that will draw an arc between the letters I selected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could use a different product than Word, but I prefer to use Word because I'm familiar with it and because I want to use other features, like numbering the sentences in the document and formatting the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

Michael.K.Dawson</a>. The Bluetooth setting on the phone can't be turn on remotely. May we know why would you like to turn it on? Are you trying to get some files on the phone? If yes, what are those files? We'll wait for your reply.

</blockquote>
If you are upgrading from a ACTIVE OS win7sp1 or win8.1 it requires&nbsp; no key, it will auto activate as long as you are connected to the internet, make sure if it asks for which version make sure it's the same as what you have, such as win7 home 32bit it needs
 to be win10 home 32bit, most of the time it doesn't ask.&nbsp;
