<h2>            Word 2010 list styles, linked paragraph styles and restarting numbering</h2>
                    I have read the existing question "Auto-restart numbering in Word 2010 style definition" and its answer. And the referenced article on Shauna Kelly's (RIP) website. And the Microsoft web pages cited by Shauna's article. Unfortunately, none of these answers
 my specific question.<br />
<br />
<b>Background to my question</b><br />
<br />
I have several software application tutorials, original marked up in DITA (XML), that I have had to convert to Word 2010 documents. These tutorials need to be edited by authors who have Word, but no DITA experience. Each tutorial contains a procedure that consists
 of a series of steps. Each step instructs the user to perform some action. In many cases, a step includes additional information about that action, such as what response to expect from the application. That additional information might be quite "rich"; it
 might include figures and tables with captions. Each step might also contain substeps. In terms of Word formatting, then, each step can consist of multiple paragraphs.<br />
<br />
After reading carefully (although perhaps not carefully enough!) all of the advice I could find on multilevel lists in Word 2010, I created a Numbered Lists list style that links level 1 to the (unnumbered, unindented) Body Text paragraph style (that I use
 for "body text" paragraphs outside of the aforementioned step-by-step procedures), level 2 to the List Number paragraph style, level 3 to List Number 2, and so on (up to List Number 5).<br />
<br />
This has the desired effect of restarting the numbering of List Number (the "first level" of numbered list, although defined as level 2 in the list style) after a Body Text paragraph.<br />
<br />
For the "additional information" paragraphs following each numbered List Number (or List Number 2-5) paragraph, I use List Continue and List Continue 2-5 (and List Bullet and List Bullet 2-5, and a host of others), to match the indenting level (so far, I have
 not defined, say, a list style for the List Continue paragraph styles!). How I miss the nesting (and relative indents) of elements in DITA (or XHTML, for that matter).<br />
<br />
An unintended, and undesirable, effect of linking Body Text to level 1 of my list style is that any paragraph that is based on Body Text also resets List Number (except, curiously, the List Number and List Number 2-5 paragraph styles themselves, which are based
 on Body Text). So, I have had to modify many paragraph styles (the ones that I might want to use inside these multilevel lists) from being based on Body Text to being based on what Body Text is based on, which is Normal.<br />
<br />
I realize that, instead of using Body Text, I could have coined new paragraph style to link to level 1 of my list style (say, "List Number Reset"), and explicitly inserted an instance of this paragraph style to reset the numbering of List Number. I deliberately
 chose not to do that, because I wanted the "common sense" (at least, common sense to me) behavior of "Body Text resets List Number".<br />
<br />
Actually, I did end up creating such a "List Number Reset" paragraph - that is based on Body Text - as a kludge to explicitly restart List Number in the very few cases where a Body Text paragraph - or a paragraph based on Body Text - does not naturally fall
 between two numbered lists.<br />
<br />
All of this is working nicely in one document.<br />
<br />
After tweaking the properties (such as spacing above and below) of some styles, I've used Manage Styles &gt; Import/Export... ("Organizer") to copy all of those styles to another document that was originally a copy of that first document.<br />
<br />
First problem: after copying the styles from the first document, all of the bullets disappeared from the paragraphs of List Bullet (List Bullet 2, etc.) style in that second document. (Interestingly, the Organizer description for the List Bullet style only
 showed the "indent" property - no bullet character - even though the style definition in Modify Style, and also in Reveal Formatting, showed the bullet properties.) So, in the first document, I created a list style ("Bulleted Lists") and linked the List Bullet
 and List Bullet 2-5 paragraph styles to the levels of that list style. Then I recopied all styles to the second document. Now the bullets are back.<br />
<br />
Next problem: after copying styles from the first document, List Number Reset (a paragraph style based on Body Text, as described earlier) no longer resets numbered lists in the second document, even though List Number Reset continues to reset numbered lists
 in the first document. So, that work I did to unhitch paragraph styles from being based on Body Text turns out to be unnecessary; at least, when the styles are copied from one document to another.<br />
<br />
So, Word is exhibiting different behavior in different documents using (what should be) the same style definitions.<br />
<br />
<b>My question(s)</b> (finally, sorry for the long preamble! :-) )<br />
<br />
1. Body Text is linked to level 1 of a list style. The list style specifies that level 1 restarts numbering of level 2. List Number Reset is a paragraph style that is based on Body Text. Should a List Number Reset paragraph restart numbering of level 2?<br />
<br />
2. Effectively the same as question 1, but put slightly differently... Which document is behaving correctly:<br />
<br />
(a) The first document, where List Number Reset (based on Body Text) resets level 2 numbering of the Numbered Lists list style (that is, the numbering of List Number paragraphs).<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
(b) The second document, containing styles copied from the first document, where List Number Reset does not reset level 2 numbering?<br />
<br />
3. If the first document is behaving incorrectly - that is, only Body Text should be restarting numbering of List Number, not List Number Reset and all other paragraph styles that are based on Body Text - then how do I make that document behave correctly? (Er
 - I hope the answer is not: copy the styles from the second document - where List Number Reset does not restart numbering - back on top of the first document!)<br />
<br />
4. Am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
This smells like a bug to me, but the smell might be me.<br />
<br />
<b>Snippet of comparable XHTML</b><br />
<br />
This is a snippet of XHTML demonstrating what I'm attempting to achieve in Word, in case this analogy is of any help to understand my questions (I think it's useful to show the "nesting" that I'm after):<br />
<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Body Text.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;ol&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number. An ol start tag element marks the start of a numbered list. There is no explicit equivalent in Word styles visible to the user. In Word, the user inserts a List Number paragraph, effectively creating the first list item in the numbered
 ("ordered") list.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;List Continue (defined with an indent to match the text of a List Number paragraph, so that it appears as a continuation of a List Number "item"):&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Bullet 2 (List Bullet 2, rather than just List Bullet, because List Bullet 2 has the appropriate indent).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;List Continue 2&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Bullet 2&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number. In the equivalent Word document, this would be the second List Number paragraph.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ol&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number 2 (nested numbered list: in terms of the Numbered List list style described previously, this is level 3).&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number 2&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ol&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;/ol&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Body Text.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;ol&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;/ol&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;List Number Reset (kludge to reset List Number numbering in lieu of a naturally occurring Body Text paragraph. List Number Reset occupies minimal vertical space.<br />
Unlike this example, a List Number Reset paragraph should be blank.)&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;h2&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;ol&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number. Yeah, okay, perhaps not good practice to immediately follow a heading with a numbered list. Perhaps a numbered list should always be preceded by a (Body Text) lead-in - even if the heading text is, say, "Procedure" (in which case, a "kludge"
 style such as List Number Reset is unnecessary).&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;List Number.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;/ol&gt;<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />

            <p>By default, when you base a style on another style, the numbering of the "parent" will be inherited (similar to the way other style properties are inherited).</p>
<p>You can do the following: For each of the styles that are based on Body Text, display the Modify Style dialog box. In the dialog, click Format, and then click Numbering. Click the "None" option, even if it already appears to be selected, and click OK twice.</p>
<p>Also, you are describing a problem with copying numbered styles between documents. This is a known bug with numbered styles in Word.</p>

<p>LC here is your answer:</p>
<p>You need to enter a field; in you document press Ctrl+F9. You will see two brackets like this "{&nbsp; }". Type in " =*5+995 " between the brackets.</p>
<p>{ <strong>=&nbsp;*5+995</strong> }</p>
<p>The place cursor infront of the "*" and press Ctrl+F9 again. In here you will type "SEQ LClist"&nbsp; (LClist is just a name, you can make it something else - no spaces)</p>
<p>&nbsp;{ <strong>=&nbsp;{SEQ&nbsp;LClist}*5+995</strong> }</p>
<p>Now highlight all press F9.</p>
<p>You can now copy and paste this number and it will increase by 5 each time you paste it ie 1000,1005,1010 etc&nbsp;&nbsp;(NOTE: you will need to press F9 to update the field each time - it will automatically update on opening or printing)</p>

<p>Don't try to open Word and load the document at the same time. First get a Word object, leaving the first parameter empty:</p>
<p>Set oWord = GetObject(, "Word.Application")</p>
<p>Then use the Word.Documents.Open method to open the document in that object:</p>
<p>Set oDoc = oWord.Documents.Open(DocumentToWorkOn)</p>
<p>In addition, you should (a) test for the success of the GetObject and use the New command if Word wan't already running, and (b) set the oWord.Visible property, which defaults to False. See<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 w&#47;Office 365 Outlook Problems</h2>
                    <p>Installed Windows 10 on Windows 7 with Office 365.&nbsp; Am now using the Outlook 2016 Preview, which worked fine in Windows 7.&nbsp; After the Windows 10 update, I have the following problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Address Books are empty - no Contacts.&nbsp; Do these need to be imported or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that my Contacts really appear to be in iCloud - if I go to the website I can see them all (as I can on my Windows Phone).&nbsp; The Windows 10 People app shows all the contacts that are in iCloud.&nbsp; If I add an iCloud address book to the Outlook account,
 I get two type choices:&nbsp; LDAP and Additional.&nbsp; If I choose LDAP, I still can't see any contacts in the book.&nbsp; If I choose 'Additional', I have to choose between "Outlook" and "Mobile'.&nbsp; Since I already show an Outlook book, it won't let me choose that option,
 and if I choose Mobile, it apparently has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>2.&nbsp; When composing a new email, text formatting commands (font, paragraph, style) are grayed out.&nbsp; (This also occurs when composing a new email using the Windows 10 Mail app)&nbsp; If I am
<em>replying</em> to an email, however, the ribbon is populated with the normal choices.

 via the OL Address Book facility, as well as local contacts.&nbsp; And if I create an iCloud contact, I can add that to local contacts (but not vice-versa, AFAIK).

    <title>Changing Keyboard Speech - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changing Keyboard Speech</h2>
                    I have a Symbol barcode scanner with Windows mobile 5 on it. Its an english version. When I'm scanning a code its displayed correctly on the screen, but when i use my german barcode software, every "/" is a "-" and every "-" is a ß. I think it's because
 of the english keyboard speech. The signs r correctly on the same buttons on the keyboard one time in german style and one time in german style.<br />
I can't change the keyboard style in the configuration of WM. Maybe I could change it with a console for windows mobile (keyb gr). I just didnt found a way 2 open a console on WM.<br />
<br />
THX for ur help.-<br />

            My guess is that the software needs to be adjusted that is used with the scanner.&nbsp; Have you contacted the software developer?

            The software is just a server connected input tool, not much to configurate. We have allready a newer scanner modell from Symbol with windows me in german speech. This scanner work perfect. this newer one has a german ROM update, but there is no ROM update
 for the english units.<br />
<br />
It would just be nice to change the keyboard style in german. Maybe its also possible to write a script to change all incomming "-" and "/".<br />

<p>The scanner should work, I would expect it to but it is the&nbsp;german barcode software that is the issue IMHO.&nbsp; It is expecting German and is outputting that way .... I think you are going to have to stick with the device that has the German ROM update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess there might be a way to write a program for it to use a German keyboard but that is well beyond me.... sorry about that.</p>

            If you can see your contacts listed in Windows Live from a PC then they will populate to your phone as long as you are using the same Live ID that you used on the PC to see them.

                    Hi I bought this phone last year-2016, for last four months my navigation buttons are not working properly. I have to press two three times to make it function. And now this phone is restarting on its own terms. While using the screen would slide down
 asking to to shut down or it will restart automatically. But today its not switching on, its showing Nokia and restarting and the cycle continuous.

    <title>Link attachment to local disk to solve the problem of Access size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuan pham 1973  say:</h3>
<h2>            Link attachment to local disk to solve the problem of Access size limit</h2>
                    I recently created an Access Database, of which there is a table with an attachment field. I haven't known that the Access file limit is 2 GB until recently when my DB work slowly.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, I google for solution how to reduce the size of DB. Because I am not an advanced user, suggestions in some forum are hard to understand. However, I have an idea of one solution which I think I should apply. I just post the idea here and hope someone
 can explain me more clearly and instruct me step by step. The idea is :</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- DB size largely depend on number of attachment file (That is true in my case). I should think of another way to attach file to DB</div>
<div>- It suggest that I need to actually store file in a folder in PC, and create the path to the attachment field in my DB. So I don't need to attach file to DB, but instead, open the dialog box to lead to such folder whenever I need to view the file.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even the idea sound helpful, I still don't understand what is the ID to match each record with some files in the folder, given lots of file in such folder and lots of record in DB tables.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Pls help me about that issue in details, such as:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- What is the code&nbsp;</div>
<div>- How to call the code</div>
<div>- In my current situation, records in table are already attached with files. If the above solution is possible, how can I convert attached file to the folder &nbsp;programmatically.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I get stuck with my database and hope everyone to help</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks all</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you must change the bold fields (tabe_name, field_name,path).</p>

<div>As said before, I am not an advanced user, so I even don't know how to replace red field in your code below.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If my DB is as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Table' s name: &nbsp;Incident &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Attachment field name: Attachments &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>- I want to save the file to : D:\</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then Pls check my replacement as follows:</div>
<div>- "tbl Interventi" for "Incident"</div>
<div>- "Mn_Allegato" for "Attachments"</div>
<div>- "C:\Temp" for "D:\"</div>
<div>- How about "FileData", "FileName"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your current instruction is very helpful. Pls give me further instructions&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Ok. </p>
<p>We have still a litte problem. The structure of attachments into the origin table is
<strong>1 to n,</strong> we can have more than an attachment per record then we will have more than a paths per record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must create a new table <strong>tbl_Paths</strong>&nbsp;whis this fields:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Id</strong> counter</p>
<p><strong>IncidentId</strong> numeric (we will put here the original record Id)</p>
<p><strong>AttachmentPath</strong> text&nbsp;&nbsp; (to store the path of every attacment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we have this modified code :</p>

            I have found the error myself. That is : The IncidentID in table "Tbl_Paths" is set in Index as "Yes, No Duplicate".
<div><br />
<div>So I switched its Index to "No". Then the Code work well.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, another problems arisen. Not all attachment are copied to "Tbl_Paths" and D:\. &nbsp;There are more than 300 records (Equivalent to 300 ID) with attachments in table "Incident", but only 56 records are copied to "Tbl_Paths" (each record may have more
 than 1 attachment, of course).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also don't know how to turn the path in "Tbl_Paths" to the link, so that I can click on that to open the file stored in D:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Pls help me to solve 2 issues above.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you so much</div>

<h2>            How to copy formatting from one Workbook to another Workbook</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Worksheet in one Workbook with variously formatted cells and need to apply the same group of formats to the corresponding cells in a Worksheet in another Workbook. I've tried using the formatting painter - which works between Worksheets in the
 same Workbook - but I cannot use the painter between two different Workbooks!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What am I doing wrong?!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
                </div>

<p>let's say that both workbooks are open</p>
<p>wb1 name is <u>SourceWB</u> and wb2 is <u>TargetWB</u>,</p>
<p>you want to copy Formats from wb1 (from <u>Sheet1</u>) &nbsp;into wb2 (into <u>Sheet1</u>)</p>
<p>(formatted range say that&nbsp;is A1:C10 and Target Range is A1:C10)</p>
<p>try this..</p>

<p><strong>Save As</strong>, your Workbook (<u>SourceWB</u>) &nbsp;with extension .xlsm (macros enabled)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>step2</u></p>
<p>1) press ALT+F11 to open Visual Basic (on <u>SourceWB</u>)</p>

            Thanks, couldn't get that Macro to work (debugger pointed at "For Each rr In wsSource.Range(Cells(1, 1), Cells(x, y))")&nbsp;but I've come up with the following workaround:&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>1) Copy source worksheet to target workbook</div>
<div>2) Select entire source worksheet (by clicking top left grey rectangle above row "1" box)</div>
<div>3) Click on format painter button</div>
<div>4) Switch to target worksheet and select entire worksheet (also by clicking top left grey rectangle)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Seems to work!</div>

    <title>Offline Portable PowerPoint Viewer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher esbrandt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offline Portable PowerPoint Viewer</h2>
                    <p>Please, before everyone starts telling me Microsoft doesn't support it in 2010+, let me explain WHY I can't get around needing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for a university that provides course materials to remote students with no Internet access or rights to install on their machines. The no Internet access eliminates the ability to use an online viewer and the lack of installation rights prevents installing
 PowerPoint Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've been using PPTVIEW.EXE for 2007 SP3 for years, but recently found an issue with our presentations that we can't easily fix. When we're working with the PPTs in 2007, 2010, or 2013, the presentations look and work great. However, when we launch them
 via the viewer (even installed 2007 instead of portable) a LOT of the content is getting smushed together and overlapping. This didn't occur with anything we developed until ~4 months ago (we just caught it, so we can't be 100% certain of when it first happened).
 In 2010 viewer, the files look right, but 2007 gets all sorts of messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, even if we created a 97-2003 PPT from scratch, we're encountering this issue. It still works fine with opened in the PowerPoint application, but is all wrong in the viewer. My guess is an update to Office messed it all up, but it's not my area
 of expertise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a program with contracts to the US DoD and several other major organizations and we can't even provide the installation file because the users don't have the rights to use it. I've toyed around with replacing the files from our working 2007 SP3 portable
 copy, but the farthest I can get it is to stop calling for dependencies and instead produce the error: The operating system is not presently configured to run this application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent several hours trying various "solutions" I found online, but nothing has worked. Is there ANY method of making PPTVIEW.EXE from 2010 or newer work without installation so that we don't have to find a new solution for providing presentations and
 then convert hundreds of PPTs?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately the newer PPT Viewers all require installation on the end-user's computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they already have an installed viewer, the thing to do might be to attack the text problem; &nbsp;for example, are you using fonts that they don't have installed on their PCs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility: &nbsp;do they have Acrobat Reader? &nbsp;Can they open PDFs? &nbsp;You might consider saving your PPTs as PDF ... File | Save As and choose PDF from PPT 2010 or 2013, or 2007 with, I think it's, SP1 or later.</p>

            <p>I wish it were so simple as the fonts or making them PDFs, but the font appearance remains the same and many of the PPTs are designed with some level of interactivity. Saving as a PDF will lose that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's odd, some items appear exactly as they do in PowerPoint, others will be repositioned, resized, etc. without altering the size or face of the font. So, a 1 line header becomes a 2 line header, or an image loses it's scaling and ends up taking half the
 screen rather than the corner it had been placed in.</p>

            <p>Animation will definitely be lost when saving as PDF, but links between slides and such should be preserved. &nbsp;If your presentation relies on animation, PDF's out, no question. &nbsp;Otherwise, it's worth giving it a try (specifically, PPT's built-in File | Save
 As | Save As Type: &nbsp;PDF, rather than the Adobe Save As PDF item on the main File menu, if you have Acrobat installed). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to check, however improbable it may seem, is that the PCs where this problem occurs have a good printer driver installed and set as the default. &nbsp;Bad or no default printer drivers can cause all sorts of problems unrelated to printing.</p>

            You might want to mention the font(s) you are using in 2010. If you use the default Calibri it's quite likely NOT to be on PC's with no version of Office or an older version. Arial looks similar (and will probably be substituted)&nbsp; but the sizing is different.<br />

            <p>I'm afraid it is animation and complex static content displayed dynamically on a single slide. I'd proposed that we export the PPTs as SWFs, since I can provide a portable Flash player but it was shot down because of a security concern by a sub-contract.
 Basically, the easiest solution to retain full functionality was denied because of politics. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the potential for a bad printer driver, I highly doubt it considering I've already tried for several machines at work, my personal desktop and laptop, as well as several VMs immediately after the OS installation.</p>

            Yeah, that was one of the first things I considered, but it's standard policy to use Arial for all PPTs developed under this program, and I did verify that the content was following that standard. Even if that had been the case, it would've altered the
 appearance in 2007 PowerPoint, too, not just its viewer. :S

            As well as Steve's suggestion for a screen shot - any chance you could post a couple of slides somewhere? Obviously remove anything sensitive. We (and Steve) have most versions of PPT and viewer set up and could maybe test your slides.<br />

    <title>&#34;Outlook has stopped working&#34; error code in Calendar Print - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Outlook has stopped working&#34; error code in Calendar Print  window.  Just started - System Restore did not fix it.  Please help.  thanks.</h2>
                    It gives options to check online for a solution and restart program&nbsp; or to restart program.&nbsp;
<br />
Neither option helps solve the problem. <br />
I can still print from other Outlook items such as Task or Mail - just not from Calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, as soon as I highlight and press the sidebar Print window option, it shuts down before I can press any other options or change any of the settings in the Print
 window.<br />
<br />
Running Outlook 2010 &amp; Windows 7; Have automated updates; I believe its a 64bit system.<br />

            &nbsp;Aloha Daniel and thank you for your response. <br />
<br />
I have both POP3 and IMAP and the error occurs under both of them - only when I try to print calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that I am able to print mail and&nbsp; tasks.<br />
<br />
Followed first suggestion and after disabling all of the Add-ins, the error still occurs.
<br />
<br />
However, upon creating new profile per your second suggestion, the Calendar print worked for the test items - thank you.&nbsp; But I am still stuck with regular calendar items to be printed.
<br />
<br />
Please explain how to print the items I have in my regular Calendar under regular outlook user account ?&nbsp; Have used it for months without any problems before this, and rely heavily on my Calendar day sheet to keep me sane.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you and blessings, <br />
BKR<br />

            <span>As you can print without any problem in new profile. You can configure your email accounts in new profile and transfer the data from the original profile and start using Outlook
 on new profile.<br />
<br />
Follow the below mentioned instructions to transfer data and set the new profile as the default profile:<br />
1. Open Outlook in new profile &gt; File &gt; Open &gt; Open Outlook Data file &gt; select the original profile’s Outlook data file (by default the data file will be named as the email address if not upgraded from the earlier versions or navigate to the store location
 folder and select the file) &gt; Open.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
2. Click on File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Settings &gt; Data files &gt; select the original data file &gt; and click on ‘Set as default &gt; Close and re-open Outlook &gt; Click on File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Settings &gt; Data files &gt; select the new data file &gt; and
 click on remove. <br />
3. Go to Control Panel &gt; Mail &gt; Show Profiles &gt; select the new profile &gt; Always use this profile.<br />

 shows some of the original appointments and recurring events but not all, and it also shows none of the Categories -&nbsp; which I use extensively.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Is there some way to pull the original profile data (Calendar with all its existing data and categories, the Mail, the Tasks and the Notes ) all into the new profile without losing data?<br />
Thanks Daniel. <br />
<br />

            Thank you Daniel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please HELP.&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn't working for me.&nbsp; .... Or more accurately, I cannot get this figured out based on what I have.
<br />
<br />
In trying to import the original .pst,&nbsp; data files, I cannot locate any .pst files that show the color categories in Calendar.&nbsp; I just keep coming up with monotone category on all the Calendar entries.
<br />
<br />
But in attempting to work through&nbsp; the changes, I have somehow messed up my mail accounts.
<br />
Now somehow I have 2 separate mail folders - one under original profile and one under new profile; and the emails come in under which ever is open such that now my emails are being separated under 2 different profiles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help me get this corrected.<br />
<br />
Do you have a way to help me via live support where you can actually see what is going on?<br />
<br />
At this point,&nbsp; I just need my&nbsp; Outlook&nbsp; to work normally in one user profile and to print without shutting down the program.&nbsp; Please email or call or text.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Aloha Daniel and thank you for staying with me. <br />
<br />
I am currently stuck at Step 2 of your instruction - "Open Outlook Data File and select original user profile".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this window, there are only 2 choices - the backup OR the new profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The backup file in this window is clearly the largest.&nbsp; I sthat what you mena by original user profile ?&nbsp; (because there is no other option).<br />
<br />
I am not certain what you mean by "the store location folder" so I do not know how to navigate to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I assumed that it was the backup and went onto Step 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; There under Data Files, I have the following 4 choices :<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Archive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; backup<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; islandrap@gmail (which would be hte original user profile I believe; and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal Folders (which is currently marked as default)&nbsp; <br />
<br />
But when I highlight the original (islandrap), I am not able to "Set as Default" because that option does not turn on ( but it does turn on for any of the other 3 options - just not for islandrap@gmail).&nbsp;
<br />
So, I assume again that the original is "backup"&nbsp; (rather than the default to my email address as you mentioned in Step 2 above);&nbsp; And I move forward through your steps and am now able to print the calendar with color categories.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
However,&nbsp; on the left side Navigation pane, for each frame (Calendar, Tasks, Notes, and Contacts) I NOW have separate folders for each one - one is titled&nbsp; "backup" and the other is titled "Personal Folders"&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
TASKS&nbsp; - has different # of items under "Personal Folders" and&nbsp; "backup" folder views, and the To-Do List now has duplicates of every item.<br />
<br />
MAIL - Worst of all, the Mail frame now shows up under&nbsp; "backup" and&nbsp; has lost all my prior saved and categorized emails some of which are needed for a lawsuit and were categorized accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some it seems were automatically moved into the "archive" folder
 but no longer separated by the individual folders I had set up in organizing the lawsuit files.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
In addition to that, all the mail since Dec. 31st is missing from the inbox.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So,&nbsp; Daniel, could you continue to help me get all the mail back into the original folders ;
<br />
and how do I change the name from "backup" so that in the future we do not get confused on what the real backup is.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Again, Daniel, I really appreciate you sticking with me through this and helping me get to where I can at least print.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I just need the mail issue fixed and I don't really want to operate with separate backup and Personal Folders in each of the Office
 Operations - it is getting too confusing as is.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't want to create further confusion in the future with my current profile being "backup".&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you&nbsp; Daniel.&nbsp; Please help asap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            How can I remove checked items in OneNote Mobile to-do list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a windows phone 7.5 (mango) and I use OneNote Mobile to create to-do lists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if I go grocery shopping, I can go down my list in OneNote and "check" the boxes</p>
<p>on the left of each item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I am done, I would like to remove the lines with checked boxes automatically (instead of manually</p>
<p>deleting each line, which is tedious) since I may have 30 or so items that I have checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to keep the lines with unchecked boxes, because those are things the store did not have</p>
<p>and that I will have to buy at another store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to do this?&nbsp; If not, there should be!</p>

    <title>Printing header pages of a multi section word document created in mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryanmcauliffe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing header pages of a multi section word document created in mail merge</h2>
                    <p>I have created a mail merge document, and page 1 of each of the 36 sections is a header page requiring headed paper to be used. I do not have a second tray. I want to be able to tell word to print every first page all at once while I have the tray full of
 headed paper, then to print every other page all at once while I have the tray full or ordinary paper. It appears to me that word cannot handle this, or that the only way to achieve it is to actually write in the page range p1s1,p1s2,p1s3 and so on through
 to p1s36. However not all sections are the same number of pages. does this mean I have to then count every section to print the non headed paper pages, so p2s1-p3s1,p2s2,p4s2, until I reach p2s36-p3s36?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can imaging it sound ridiculous to me. It would be quicker to print current page to an appropriate printer for each and ever page individually. either that or print current page for the headed paper pages individually, then print the whole document and
 shred the copied headed pages printed on normal paper, exchanging them for the headed paper pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant be the first person with this problem, but cannot find a solution in Microsoft help. surely there should be an option to say p1s1-s36 or&nbsp;p1s1-36, or p1sall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help</p>

<p>Hey mdn1023</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>a. For how long have you had this error?<br />
b. Does it happen with other website too?<br />
c. Have you tried opening the same link with other web browser? Does it open fine?</p>
<p>Adding to Robert Aldwinckle on forums' suggestions, you may try the following methods and check if they fix the issue:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using Internet Explorer 8, it includes a Compatibility View feature that displays Web sites that were created for older browsers as they were designed to appear. You can enable Compatibility View in Internet Explorer or on the Web server.</p>
<p>Open Internet Explorer 8 in compatibility mode and see if that fixes your issue.</p>
<p>Refer the following link for more details on running Internet Explorer in compatibility mode:</p>
<p><strong>Some Web sites may not be displayed correctly or work correctly in Windows Internet Explorer 8<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956197" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956197</strong></a></p>
<p>Also, open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if that fixes the issue. If it does, one of the add-on is the culprit.</p>
<p>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,</p>
<p>• Click the Start button, click All Programs, click Accessories, click System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</p>
<p>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</p>
<p><strong>For more details, refer the below link:<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-Internet-Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-Internet-Explorer</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Optimize Internet Explorer and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Configuration settings in Windows Internet Explorer 7 and Windows Internet Explorer 8 may cause one or more of the following issues:</p>
<p>• You experience performance problems in Internet Explorer.<br />
• You receive an error message in Internet Explorer. For example, you receive an "Internet Explorer cannot display the Web page" error message.<br />
• Internet Explorer stops responding.</p>
<p>Follow the below link for more details on Internet Optimization:</p>
<p><strong>How to optimize Internet Explorer<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936213</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Reset Internet Explorer settings and check if the issue gets fixed.</p>
<p>To Reset Internet Explorer settings follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Exit all programs, including Internet Explorer (if it is running).<br />
2. Click Start, type the following command in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>inetcpl.cpl<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet Options dialog box appears</p>
<p>3. Click the Advanced tab.<br />
4. Under Reset Internet Explorer settings, click Reset. Then click Reset again.<br />
5. When Internet Explorer finishes resetting the settings, click Close in the Reset Internet Explorer Settings dialog box.<br />
6. Start Internet Explorer again.</p>
<p>Refer the below link for more details:</p>

                    I am using Office Outlook 2013. Two days ago when I started the program, it started to download emails and then stopped working. I have had a IT tech working for two days and he can't find the problem or solution.&nbsp; He has checked all of the obvious problems/solutions.
 It still won't stay open.&nbsp; Any ideas? the problem is I can't get emails!!!

            <p>I am working with MS Office Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open Outlook 2013 in either safe or normal mode&nbsp;the&nbsp;receiving email&nbsp;count advances to the last message.&nbsp; For example "Receiving 12 of 12."&nbsp; Then an &nbsp;"Outlook has stopped working...." message is displayed&nbsp;and the only option is a "Close Program" button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no error numbers or other error messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect that the account is POP3 but I can't verify that since close program is&nbsp;only option.</p>
<p>I know that it is not Exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The .pst file will open on another computer but none of the new&nbsp;messages (1 through 12 of the 12) are in the .pst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I can copy the .pst and take it to another computer and open it.&nbsp; The second computer doesn't attempt to receive and store new messages in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure occurs when receiving the last or next to last new &nbsp;message.&nbsp; (ie. Receiving message 27 of 28).</p>

<h2>            Trying to sync 6.5 windows phone with Windows Mobile Device Center and Windows 7 computer</h2>
                    I have a windows 6.5 phone HTCHD2 which I used on my old Windows XP computer no problems. With my new computer running Windows 7 I downloaded the Windows Mobile Device Center by connecting the phone and set it up. It recognized the phone but when syncing
 it just goes on an endless cycle and never finishes and doesn't sync anything. It does the same thing if I try to change or save the connection settings. I am just trying to sync contacts, tasks calendar and notes. There is nothing on the computer and it is
 all on the phone. should I be changing anything else

            The only PC Suite version that supports the N-Gage QD is the one you can find here, for example:<br />
<a href="http://www.n-gage.com/en-R1/support/Software/pcsuite.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.n-gage.com/en-R1/support/Software/pcsuite.htm</a><br />
<br />
I'm sorry to say, but there is no way to get PC Suite 6.* versions to work with N-Gage QD.

            Hi,&nbsp; This was somewhat helpful. Actually what helped me was:&nbsp; <br />
Tools, Internet Options, General: Tabs. settings. Look for 'When a new tab is opened: open' then select in the drop down menu "Your first home page", then click OK.
<br />
<br />
Now this was helpful. But you did point me in the right direction. <br />
<br />
Best regards, <br />

<h2>            Do Not Enter Sign on some pieces of mail</h2>
                    <p>One of my coworkers received an Outlook encrypted email. They were expecting an email from this recipient, the email&nbsp;<em>looks
</em>legitimate, the links within go to office sites, and I understand that the extension is what happens when Outlook encrypts emails but I've never seen the 'Do Not Enter' sign before and wanted to understand what this exactly was before I give my coworker
 the go-ahead to 'Read the Message'.</p>

<p>Hello Bezel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if you mean this Do Not Enter Sign? </p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56abf9df-dfe5-437e-8787-7c81cab39734?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56abf9df-dfe5-437e-8787-7c81cab39734?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>This stands for that the message is being encrypted. I have sent some test emails with different permissions and they are all encrypted with this sign. See the screenshot below. Don’t worry, you can just open the message.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9617a003-736b-4e8c-8b64-c2c242d9e002?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9617a003-736b-4e8c-8b64-c2c242d9e002?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Note: This sign has been changed to the following icon in the

    <title>Lock a callout shape&#39;s size and tail position - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisa_iff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock a callout shape&#39;s size and tail position</h2>
                    <p>I'm building a job aid template in Word 2013. Part of the template includes precisely formatted callout shapes with numeric text. These callout shapes are used to point to a portion of an image to identify the corresponding step number. I would like to lock
 down the shape's size (height and width) and tail position but still allow for the text (number) to be edited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are eight tail positions in all. In a perfect world, I'd love to configure the callout shape to allow me to move the tail, but it would automatically set itself in to one of those eight positions. Below is a graphic of the eight "allowed" tail positions
 and then one with the tail stretched and repositioned (which is what I'm trying to avoid).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible? Thank you for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The callouts are behaving as designed, so I wouldn't say I'm having an issue with them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a way to "freeze" their size and tail position(s), making them uneditable by other users of my template. I need the tail to point eight different directions, but only stick out the distance and in the positions depicted in the "yes" portion
 of the image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you aware of any way to do this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Duane, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft&nbsp;Community. I understand your concern and I'll be glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Are you getting any error message?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the methods below and check if it fixes the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Check the PC date and time - right click the clock in the tray and select adjust date and time.
</p>
<p>Verify and correct the month, day, year, and time. Reboot PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Run apps troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to run the apps troubleshooter and check if it helps with the issue.&nbsp;
<br />
The Modern app troubleshooter can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store
<br />
Refer to the following article and run the Apps troubleshooter:<br />

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest you to </span><strong><span>disable the security software
</span></strong><span>and check. use Windows defender during the process. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily

<h2>            Excel 97-2003 worksheet to Excel 2010 macro-enabled worksheet size difference</h2>
                    I have converted an Excel 97-2003 worksheet to a Excel Macro-Enable worksheet in Excel 2010, and the file size went from 1MB to 500kB.. Have I lost any data or is this normal?

            This is normal. The .xlsx and .xlsm formats are zip files that contain compressed files corresponding to various components of the workbook.
