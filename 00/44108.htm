    <title>Xbox 360S Hard Drive suddenly not formatted&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david romandaniels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360S Hard Drive suddenly not formatted&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Halo :Reach Xbox 360 S, and the other day when I turned the Xbox Off, the console stayed on a while and did thing where the disk drive spins really fast for a while and makes a bunch of noise before it shuts off.&nbsp; This took the longest time I ever
 remember.</p>
<p>Last night, when I turned it on to play&nbsp;my new game Brothers, it said it needed a new update.&nbsp; Then it said I don't have enough room, so I went to settings, storage, and it wants to format my Hard Drive.&nbsp; I have the original 250 gig hard drive that came
 with the console.&nbsp; I have not had other problems before this.</p>
<p>Many of my saves are on the cloud, but not all.&nbsp; I really do not want to lose everything by formatting the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what I can do to 'fix it'?</p>
<p>Can I transfer the hard drive data to another Hard Drive?&nbsp; There are a few saved games I would be so sad to lose.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have, turned it completely on and off, taken the hard drive out and put it back in, nothing has changed so far.</p>

<p>Chances are you have an aftermarket HDD. &nbsp;These get formatted after every major system update because of compatibility issues. &nbsp;It's recommended that you buy only official Microsoft branded equipment. &nbsp;If it is aftermarket support cannot help you.</p>

<p>I just had the EXACT same problem happen when i got home an hour ago. &nbsp;Somehow the xbox corrupted the 250 gb hard drive ive had for over a year now. ALL my game saves and activity are on that drive. Thats 5+ years of my life and hard work that got me to
 90000+ gamerscore. Im not going to lose it because of faulty hardware. Someone needs to tell us what needs to be done so we get all our game files back.</p>

<p>As I said 2 days ago, HDDs that format themselves after updates are generally counterfeit, aftermarket knock-offs. &nbsp;The only way to prevent it is to buy genuine Microsoft-branded products. &nbsp;If you paid less than $100 USD for a 250 gig HDD then chances are
 extremely great it's a fake and it's your own fauilt.</p>
<hr />
<p>As far as recovering last data goes, you can't. &nbsp;The 360 uses a proprietary file system that is not meant for the layman to access and as such has absolutely no software to run data recovery on.</p>

<p>Hey there</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have contacted support about this issue, and would like to post some more information that support had passed onto me.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>ZappyKins. </p>
<p>You can get your data back, if you have a transfer cable that plugs into your hard drive. You should be able to transfer your content onto another Xbox hard drive. As long as you have a transfer cable and as long as your content is not corrupt, you should
 be able to get your deta back from your other hard drive. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To get another data transfer kit, please go to the Microsoft Store. Or contact them on</p>
<p>0800 026 0329.</p>
<p>Microsoft Store Hours of Operation:</p>
<p>08:00-20:00 (GMT), Monday - Friday + 09:00-18:00 (GMT), Saturday</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And yes, the support agent also viewed this thread, and she recommended this option</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps with your question.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>I dont know about ZappyKins, but I have an official microsoft transfer cable, and my original hdd that came with the conse (i think its around 20 gbs?) Anyway, it doesnt work. It still says my hdd is unformatted. I never had a problem before this update,
 and my hdd is not aftermarket. This is unacceptable i want to know how microsoft intends to get my 5+ years of game saves back. That for me is the only solution that is acceptable.</p>

<p>Same here. I have a 250g HDD that's is Microsoft branded!! And I says it is unformatted. I have not had any problem until this update. I have a lot of game that I played for on my hard drive along with items that I don't want to lose. This update affected
 both after market and Microsoft branded HDD, reading from other posts. </p>

<h2>            Status code&#58; 80153067</h2>
                    
<p>Tonight I "purchased" Tropico 3 on Games on Demand. I suppose that was my first mistake. When I confirmed the purchase up popped an error message saying Status Code: 80153067. &nbsp;Then I get an email a few minutes later confirming my purchase and saying that
 my card has been charged. However, the game never downloaded and it is not in my purchase history. Anyone else had this problem? I couldn't find a single other instance of this anywhere on the forums. Xbox support has been completely useless up to this point,
 informing me that they couldn't help me with my problem before I had even told them what it was.</p>

<h2>            WSL X Server Unity</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I was trying to get unity to run on WSL. I know it's not supported, but I thought it would be fun to try. I read a bunch of articles similar to this one&nbsp;http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-run-run-the-native-ubuntu-desktop-on-windows-10/.
 The first error I encountered is that&nbsp;sudo sed -i 's/&lt;listen&gt;.*&lt;\/listen&gt;/&lt;listen&gt;tcp:host=localhost,port=0&lt;\/listen&gt;/' /etc/dbus-1/session.conf won't work because the dbus config file isn't there. After researching this issue, it appears it moved to /usr/share/dbus-1/session.conf.
 I just changed the file destination in the code to get that to work. After making sure everything was configured properly, I ran compiz to see if it would work. I just see this (same if I run it with sudo):</p>

<p>Nope. I gave up :\</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do know now is that it's a problem with xserver's composite support, assuming you enabled everything properly in the compiz configuration as root. I can't seem to find how to enable composite on xserver because they moved all the configuration so
 now it's super complicated.</p>

<h3> deanfenn  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX ONE S mic icon with line through</h2>
                    <p>I have bought my son a new headset (Fusion) as his other one didn't work and this new one still doesn't work. I have noticed that the mic symbol constantly has a line going through it. I have checked all settings and the mic should be on and working according
 to the system details but still nothing. I have reset the console a number of times ensured that both the console and controllers are up to date but still the icon is there.</p>
<p>I am starting a party and am being prompted that the microphone for is not working and to check settings.</p>
<p>I have tested through Skype but again I am unable to complete the test as Skype cannot hear me through the mic.</p>
<p>I have plugged the headset into a number of different devices and they work fine its just the xbox that doesn't seem to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft and they asked me to download an offline file which I did and then when I tried to install this I was prompted with yet another problem. This time an error message appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help as this is getting really frustrating now.</p>

<p>Hi Darkwolfecze, the mute button on the headset was pressed so that it shouldn't be muted and the volume on the ear piece was also set to high.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how the PowerA Support can help with the issue I have with the Xbox. The headset works plugged into any other device just not the xbox as this icon wont disappear from the xbox. Even when the headset isn't plugged into the controller this
 icon is still visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone from Microsoft/Xbox support advise at all or does anyone else have a tried and tested solution??</p>
<p>

<p>Hi DeanFenn!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response, if this issue is persisting despite having a working headset, try out another controller. If a 3.5mm jack on a controller is broken it would cause for the console to not recognize anything being plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps, thanks again.</p>

<p>I would second the advice given by Ezra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son dropped (on purpose) his controller with a headset attached.&nbsp; since then no headsets (mics or headphones) will work with it.&nbsp; He has since pinched my controller as I do not often use headsets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the controller is at fault, is it a new purchase, if so you may be entitled to a refund or replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3.5mm jack is not worth changing due to it's connection to the circuit board.</p>

<p>Hey Rashell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. From what I have heard, this is a known issue at the moment happening with some consoles. There is no estimated time frame as to when this will be resolved. However, you may want to try
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacting support</a> to report the issue. Some sites are taking information from customers such as yourself that are having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you require support, or would like to start a discussion, please create a new thread. We will be happy to help you there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />

<a href="http://esupport.sony.com/perl/select-system.pl?PRODTYPE=1,24,26,66,9,70,5,72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://esupport.sony.com/perl/select-system.pl?PRODTYPE=1,24,26,66,9,70,5,72</a><br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

            <p>I had the same problem with almost all applications,start menu, search,notification bar etc,</p>
<p>My issue was because of I ran a registry scan with Auslogics, It repaired the registry by removing all necessary items, Luckily I had the backup and used it. Now everything is fine.</p>
<p>This make me to understand that never run registry scans with other applications.</p>

                    Hello, I redeemed my FIFA 15 game by using a QR code. But before it was getting installed it got deleted while it was still on queue to get downloaded. And now I can't use that code again. Please someone tell me how can I get the game back. How to sort
 this out.

<p>I also have the same kind of problem, but I made the mistake myself.</p>
<p>I just want my Xbox in English settings so I set UK instead of Netherlands (where I live) after I downloaded FIFA with the redeem code I have to wait till tommorrow!!!??? I changed it back to Dutch settings but that doesnt work also...</p>
<p>If I delete the game and try to reinstall it with Dutch settings is not possible right? Because when you use your code once its gone or not?</p>

<p>Any purchased games should show up under "Ready to Install" in the "My Games and Apps" page.</p>
<p>The game should be available to play now it has been released and should show up there, and should also show up as purchased when locating the game in the store.</p>

<h2>            Vista says I&#39;m connected to internet and online, but web browser says I&#39;m not, and never loads a web page.</h2>
                    I had installed CA Antivirus to my computer a few days ago, but the firewall was way too tight,&nbsp;so I uninstalled it. Since then, I have not been able to get on the internet. My wireless is up and I have tried resetting it multiple times, however; My web
 browser continues to say it cannot connect. I dowloaded Malwarebytes free scanner, and did a scan, but nothing was found. Also, it seems as if the internet loads for a split second, but instantaneously does offline.<br />
<br />
Since that computer currently has no internet access, I am asking my query via my laptop. I used a flashdrive to transfer the malware program. Please help, thank you.<br />

<p>
<span><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens when you go online?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did the issue start?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<strong><span>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the Network Diagnostic tool
</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>The Network Diagnostics tool that is part of Windows Vista is designed to test the network connection for errors. The Network Diagnostics tool can also be used to
 determine whether network-related programs are working correctly. To use this tool to troubleshoot network connectivity problems, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1. Open Internet Explorer, and try to access the Web page that causes network connectivity problems.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2. On the page that displays an Internet Explorer error message, click the Diagnose Connection Problems link.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>The Network Diagnostics tool will run. When the tool has finished running, it will report one of the following results:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>• It was unable to find a problem.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>• It has detected a problem. Additionally, the tool will provide guidance on the next steps to take to troubleshoot the problem.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I understand that you are facing issues after performing factory reset. Since the issue persists even after performing a factory reset, there could be possibility of incompatible/corrupt driver or driver conflict issue.
 Though the drivers may look to be up-to-date but there could be some problem in firmware configuration.</span></span></p>

<h3> gz4au  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIN 7 - Cannot Copy Directory&#39;s From Toshiba Satellite CD&#47;DVD Drive - Need Help</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>I have a new Toshiba Satellite laptop with WIN 7 - 64bit loaded on it. I can rip, burn, and play CD's and DVD's but when I go to copy a directory from a CD or DVD and paste it onto my computer I get a message that says device not seen. It seems like the
 driver is losing communication with the CD drive. It's acting like the disc is being removed when it's there. I'm losing contact with the CD drive when I try to copy a directory. I can copy files off a CD but I<strong><em>cannot</em></strong> copy directories.
 I have been all the way through Toshiba technical support (level 1 and 2) and they feel this is a software issue. I spent&nbsp;aprox 2 hours with Toshiba in total.&nbsp;I have also tried your Microsoft ATS program that I found on this forum but it doesn't ask me if
 I'm experencing a copying problem. I have verified that the data that I am trying to copy is valid and not corrupt. Can you please help me? I like my Toshiba laptop and WIN 7 and I would really like to get this issue resolved. Thank you.</div>

<p>What is not responding, is it Internet Explorer, or Windows Explorer, both, or all applications?&nbsp; Is your machine 64-bit?&nbsp; Has it been behaving this way since Christmas?&nbsp; Did it ever run OK in its' short life, perhaps it is something you should report to
 the manufacturer, you wouldn't be the first person to receive faulty goods.</p>
<p>Have you tried testing it from within "Safe Mode with Networking"?&nbsp; If there is a considerable improvement in Safe Mode then try the second article too in order to isolate any possible cause.</p>

<p>Did any of your installs seem a bit odd at the time or did they all go in trouble free?</p>
<p>If I was a gambling man then I would be looking at Comodo (at least check it for recent updates).&nbsp; Do you have the free Comodo Firewall or do you have the full Comodo Security Suite with the included Antivirus program?&nbsp; Are you running other security programs
 at the same time and are they clashing with each other in real time?&nbsp; For example is&nbsp; Superantispyware, or Malwarebytes, running as real time scanners too?</p>

            Thank you for your response. After making sure all Microsoft and Adobe updates were current, the problem changed... PhotoShop and Dreamweaver now work while InDesign and Illustrator do not. I have found that this problem is because I recently added a 4th
 monitor. Apparently support of 4 monitors is an Adobe issue. If I disable a monitor then the software works.

<p>
</p><p>I saw that before but not recently.&nbsp; Fix was to use Win-P, CursorUp, Enter which resets the video port but if the Display configuration was already Duplicate puts the video on the wrong screen.&nbsp; So then either do it again or undo the first procedure, e.g.
 press Win-P, CursorDown, Enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full disclosure.&nbsp; Actually this is insight gained after the fact.&nbsp; I actually had to open up my tablet to figure out what was going on when my usual workaround didn't seem to have helped.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

            <p>Fyi...</p>
<p>The link that the Support Engineer provided was valid in 2011. Since then that forum was deprecated with known solutions moved (in 2012 CY)&nbsp;and merged into the Microsoft Answers forums which now support the majority of MSFT products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Windows Live Mail&nbsp; the correct forum (today) is:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases for messages stuck in the Outbox that can <strong>*not*</strong>&nbsp;be deleted the Compact option resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are reported cases where the user can not delete the messages in the Outbox. In this case the recommendation would be go off-line in WLM&nbsp; (temporary disconnecting from the internet) using the WLM provided 'Work Offline' option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on Work offline (found on the Home tab)&nbsp;on the 2011/12 WLM Ribbon<br />
Move the emails out of the Outbox to Drafts or&nbsp;Delete them<br />
Click Go online<br />
Check if you can send an email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other solutions that have been known to work (since not everyone's issue is identical or having the same root cause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Repair WLM (available as an option in Programs&amp;Features or Add-Remove Programs by clicking on the Windows Live Essentials installed program item</p>
<p>&nbsp;or</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete any messages in the account Outbox folder on the hard drive (requires navigation to the account Outbox folder using Windows Explorer)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;or</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. Remove the account and recreate the account anew (Note: Backup any messages to a user created folder in WLM's storage folders prior to removing any account - especially if the account&nbsp; is configured to use the POP3 protocol since removing a POP3 account
 will delete the account and messages in WLM and **also** on the user's hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After performing any repair, deletion, or account removal/re-setup retest the ability to send and receive mail by sending a test message to oneself or another contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a small percentage of cases the problem may not be within WLM but a corrupt Windows user profile and associated registry key necessitating creation of a new Windows user profile.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the possible root causes of the 'stuck message in the Outbox' are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. ISP temporarily disconnecting the user from the internet corrupting WLM's index</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. User aborting WLM while the program is still sync'ing email, contacts, or calendar</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. Sending and Receiving mail while&nbsp;downloading a large volume of newsgroup messages impacting WLM's ability to index both mail and news</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. 3rd party resident Antivirus or Antimalware programs running&nbsp;in the background (especially suites or programs that are configured to scan incoming and outgoing email)</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. Logging off a Windows profile or shutting down/restarting the pc while WLM is still indexing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6. Other intermittent connectivity problems (router, wifi connection, etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you winston, I understand the need for educational resources I like to read, when I have time for it, but however, I think the person and I was looking for a solution, not to read several page or heavy interface to finally find the 3 necessary step.
 As soon as I clicked on the link, I realized that looking for the simple solution was going to be a tedious task. Too much unrelated stuff to the question itself.<br />
<br />
You gave outstanding answer, and that why i am voting for yours answer for the second time.<br />
<br />
Take note that in my case, the person who was having this problem did has some sort of profile change to roaming profile, and in the end, there was two copy of the same pop3 account in the accounts windows. After looking, one was always empty with no message,
 probably due to been mis-configured or whatsoever, but the other (same) account in the tree list, was working fine. The problem is, when trying to send multiple emails or such with the client, it was also trying to (i think) connect to the account that wasn't
 setup properly or wasn't working therefore timeout and failing after a long time, which, if each of the account doesn't work on their own thread, would basically ddos the others mail in the outbox / other mail account, waiting to be sent. This is just how
 I saw it. <br />
<br />
As soon as I removed the non properly configured (dupe / clone / created when changing with the user profile type) and left the working one intact, all emails started to work and get sent properly.<br />
<br />
Since both were having the same name (mail account), I though to rename one by adding some suffix, closing the mail client, and reopen it to make sure that there was no hard/soft link between the two mail account entry. As I restarted the app, each mail account
 was having a different name then, and I could safely delete the not working one, knowing that the working one and it's mails would stay there.<br />
<br />
Appreciate the "real" help and replies tho :)<br />

<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the original link (in the&nbsp;post from the Support Engineer which apparently a moderator finally found appropriate to delete today&nbsp;- i'ts not showing up here - if it was there would be 5 replies not 4 prior to this one and your initial reply wouldn't
 say 'reply to deleted message) was a dead link to the deprecated windowslivehelp forum may very well have had similar questions with recommended and valid solutions)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But...since this thread had new activity&nbsp;over a year later than the initial post/question and with more history of the same problem (inside and outside of the forums) imo it was appropriate to provide as many as possible known issues to update the thread
 in case anyone else wanders in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad to hear you found your own root cause and&nbsp;solution and possibly others in a simialr situation will realize the same.</p>

            Hi Ibrahim.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try this fix next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, IBRAHIM_A_ALASMARI<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor <br /><br /><br />Try this <br />The problem that you indicate, can be generated for different reasons, some of them: <br /><br />Failures in the system controllers. <br />Errors in physical sectors. <br />Windows services disabled. <br /><br />To try to solve the problem, do the following: <br />Verify the Windows service <br />Use Windows Key + R. <br />When you open the window you write: <br /><br />Services.msc. <br /><br />When you open the list of services, look for "Windows Audio". <br />Double click on the start button and verify that the start type is in (automatic). <br />Driver update: <br />You had already done it, as you mentioned before. However, it is important that you update the drivers related to BIOS and chipset. You can do this from the technical support page of your computer manufacturer. <br /><br />I hope it helps you

<p>a dual jack is the 1/8 inch jack port that is both input and output on most PC's and Laptops these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 laptops with them. When I plug in speakers or a mic, the app pops up and you select which you are plugging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double check in you all apps section for any folders or apps pertaining to sound or your sound card to make sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can go to your PC OEM website and look at the specs for your PC and find out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But have you checked in device manager and made sure the drivers are properly installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Device Manager&gt;&gt;View Tab&gt;&gt;show hidden items</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure there are no RED or YELLOW flags next to any item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to uninstall the drivers for all sound items, restart PC and windows will reinstall them. restart pc again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you can also try to roll back drivers to older version, but I have never seen this really work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run the sound troubleshooter in </p>
<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Troubleshooting</p>
<p>troubleshoot audio recording</p>
