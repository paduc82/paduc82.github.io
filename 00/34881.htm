    <title>Laptop screen stays off after sleep. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidg42393  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop screen stays off after sleep.</h2>
                    <p>I think this started happening after an update(INTEL HD Graphics 530). I have a 2015 Alienware 17 r3 with windows 10. Everything was going fine, but recently, if the laptop screen goes into sleep mode, then i press the power button, the laptop will turn
 on but the laptop screen wont. I have connected an external monitor that does turn on. I have looked into power settings and monitor settings but nothing helps. What should I do????</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I notice that when i go into display settings, under Multiple Displays it only stays on "display number 2(external monitor). I cannot change it to duplicate display. Even if i press windows+P, i cannot get it to duplicate display. So the monitor is definitely
 off for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-UPDATE - Ok, so now while both monitors are connected. After i wake from sleep, the laptop monitor is still off but the external monitor is on. If i hit windows+P and select "PC screen only" the laptop monitor will turn back on.&nbsp;Can't figure out how to
 fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the laptop is in sleep mode and the hdmi (for external monitor) is disconnected, the screen is will stay off if i turn it back on, however, when i connect the hdmi cable for the external monitor, the laptop screen turns on when the external screen does.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Im going to do a reset on my computer and see if that helps.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conflicts with the power plan settings or a corrupted display driver can cause your screen to stay black when waking from sleep mode. As an initial step to prevent this from happening, we suggest that you restore the power plan settings to default. To do
 this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type Command Prompt in the search box. From the search result, right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.</li><li>Copy and paste or type in the command below:<br />
<strong>powercfg -restoredefaultschemes</strong></li><li>Press Enter and wait for the command to finish.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This option will delete all custom power plans and restore the built in power plan settings of your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that you encounter the same issue after restoring the power plan settings, ensure that your device display driver is updated. You can follow the steps provided on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to update your drivers and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can update us with the results.</p>

            Weappreciate your response. Since you have tried the troubleshooting steps above and the issue still persists, this could be an issue about the Intel Management Engine Interface settings. I would suggest that you follow the troubleshooting steps provided

<p><em><strong>The following looks like a long story<strong> (it is only 600 words)</strong></strong></em>.<em><strong> I do not know what the user's overall knowledge is, and what exactly was already done. Thus the info goes through the motions
 of configuring and checking most of the common aspects of Windows OS' LAN features.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>----------------------</strong> </em></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . You have to establish specific users. <strong>Everyone</strong> means all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p><strong>***Note.</strong> Some of the processes described above are done Not for Windows sake but to compensate for different Routers and the way their firmware works and stores the info about the computers that are Networked.</p>

            Hi  Flmemaw4
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which web browser are you using?
<br />
<br />If you happen to be using Edge and you get and error when you load a site requiring Flash, it's possible it's just disabled.
<br />
<br />To change that, open the More actions menu in the top right corner of the Edge browser, scroll down, click the View advanced settings menu then toggle on Adobe Flash Player. Refresh the web page or close Microsoft Edge then open it again. In rare cases, you might need to restart your computer
<br />
<br />If there's no overt signs on the page that Flash needs to be enabled, but you still sense that there is some missing content, then it's possible that Flash content isn't loading.  This may be by design; as a security measure, Microsoft is limiting the use of Flash where ever it can. So, if you are greeted by a web page with only a puzzle symbol, don't be puzzled. Instead, look in the address bar, then click the puzzle icon. From here, you can choose whether you want to allow the website you are viewing to always run Adobe Flash or Allow it once.
<br />Update Adobe Flash Player in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Since Microsoft bundled Adobe Flash in Windows, you also get Adobe Flash updates via Windows Update. So, if you have tried all the above and Flash still refuses to load in Microsoft Edge, you likely need to install an update.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. Download and install the latest update for Flash if it's available.
<br />
<br />Sometimes even Windows Update might prove problematic when installing updates for Flash Player updates. What you can do is download the update for Flash Player manually from the Microsoft Update Catalog. We showed you how to do that in our previous article on how to install Windows updates manually.

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems viewing Flash content, then you might want to try to repair or reset Microsoft Edge.

<br />
<br />What About Other Web Browsers?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 bundles Adobe Flash for use with the Edge browser. If you use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or other web browsers, you will need to either enable or download then install Adobe Flash manually. In Chrome, when you visit a website that requires Flash, click the Secure menu in the left of the address bar then click Site settings.
<br />
<br />Scroll down, click in the list box for Flash then select Allow.
<br />
<br />If Flash still does not work, you likely need to update it. In the Chrome address bar, type chrome://components then hit Enter. Scroll down then click Check for the update under Flash Player.
<br />Mozilla Firefox
<br />
<br />In Firefox, first, check if Flash is enabled. Click the Open menu , then Add-ons, Plugins then click on Preferences for Shockwave Flash. Click on the Choose Change when this add-on runs list box then choose Always Activate.
<br />
<br />Updating Flash on Firefox requires users to visit Adobe's download page where they can download and install the latest versions for their respective web browser.

<h2>            Gears of War 4 - crash on startup</h2>
                    <p>I've purchased this game about 3 or so weeks ago.&nbsp; It immediately worked when I started it and was running very well.&nbsp; But for the last week or two it would not start.&nbsp; I get the Gears of War splash screen on startup and a few seconds later it will just
 go back to the desktop.&nbsp; I've tried everything mentioned on the internet, in the microsoft community as well as other gaming sites without any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really disappointed that I bought this game and it will not work.&nbsp; I'd like to get it working as soon as possible.&nbsp; My computer consist of the following hardware:</p>

</p><p>Amd Ryzen 2700X</p>
<p>2 x 8GB - G.Skill DDR4 3200&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asus Crosshair VII Hero</p>
<p>Zotac GTX 1080 ti</p>

            HI StephanTheunissen,
<br />
<br />Have you attempted to reinstall the game? sorry to ask, as you havent mentioned this I didnt want to assume you have. Have you checked to see if there is also an update for Gears of War
<br />
<br />Also have you checked to ensure that all drivers for your machine are up to date?

<p>Hi Jordan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are up to date.&nbsp; Reinstalling the game is a problem.&nbsp; That would mean I need to redownload 130 odd gig and in South Africa, I'm sorry that is a problem.&nbsp; If need be I will, but then I would like to know why?&nbsp; I purchased the game and it worked, why
 do I need to reinstall it?&nbsp; Sorry, I know you are not at fault, but it is a bit of a pain for me.</p>

            Stephan, not a problem, the reason why i say this is at times installation files can become corrupt and the best way to resolve is to simply uninstall and reinstall the application.
<br />
<br />Have you tried the Windows store reset? this should clear the cache but keep the installations intact.

<p>Hi Jordan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry been so preoccupied at work.&nbsp; I tried your suggestions but still a no go.&nbsp; Same splash screen for Gears then back to desktop.&nbsp; I'm really upset about this.&nbsp; When you buy software or a game it should work but this is really becoming an irritation now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the store reset as well as what they suggest in the link you posted but still a no go.</p>

<p>I don't use the MS Store and don't know how to fix all of it's failing, but the Windows Store is prominent in the errors.</p>
<p>If resetting or repairing didn't help, uninstalling and reinstalling (in accordance with the linked method) the Store client may.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the problem only with the one game ?</p>
<br />
<p>- There is also a possibility your Anti-Virus, or another software you have running in the background is blocking the game
</p>
<p>from loading beyond the splash screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The splash screens don't really use the gpu, and crashing when loading can indicate either the driver or gpu have an issue</p>
<p>( gpu if more than one game is affected).</p>
<p>Have you tried re-seating your card ? Do you have another Nvidia gpu you can try&nbsp; (If for nothing else AMD APU and Intel HD</p>
<p>graphics are good for testing) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the problem started after a Windows version update, installing a newer BIOS, if there is one, can help.</p>
<p>Also download any motherboard drivers that may be newer than what you have installed.</p>
<p>- When you updated the Nvidia drivers did you download them from Nvidia and install them manually,</p>
<p>and do you use DDU (<em>Display Driver Uninstaller</em>) in the process ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"When you buy software or a game it should work"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And they do, but things go wrong... endlessly. MS seem to be adding to the problems though. It seems a
<em>lot</em> of people have problems</p>
<p>caused by the Stores client software. One of the more common issues is games getting stuck in a download loop, with the fix</p>
<p>being to delete all of the currently downloaded files and start over again... Fun.</p>

<p>Yes I have contacted them SO MANY TIMES.... just going round in circles!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to use a computer, its says the accounts are restricted from paid services, so basically I cant use them.... it says to unrestrict them press "fix". You then have to enter some basic info regarding the account/s which I have done SO MANY TIMES
 for all 4 accounts and EVERYTIME is says sorry we can not unrestrict them! Skype Support keep saying this is the only way to unrestrict the accounts and I keep telling them Ive been trying! I set the accounts up so I know all the info! I also have the debit/credit
 card I used! So they took $6.50 x 4 for the Skype numbers, $19.99 x 4 for the calling subscriptions, THEN restricted my accounts and when I said OK Ive had enough just refund the money they said YOUR ACCOUNT HAS TO BE UNRESTRICTED TO GET A REFUND! WHAT A SCAM!
 All I want is to be able to use the Skype accounts to make international calls! Why all the drama, problems and issues! Why has this even happened!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe it was because I set the accounts up using the same computer and internet but that would be silly to restrict accounts for that! Then I was told you can only set up/pay for up to 2 Skype accounts per debit/credit card which again is silly,
 10 Skype accounts would require 5 debit/credit cards! But yes 4 Skype accounts I used 2 different cards! I need to be able to use the Skype accounts! A number and a calling subscription! Thats what Skype offers!</p>

<p>I'm very sorry to hear these. Have you tried replying to the email you received stating that your account can't be unrestricted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that the system restricts accounts to avoid fraudulent usage or possible unauthorized purchases to protect your account. If you are the owner of the account, you&nbsp;might be able to regain access to Skype's paid features by filling out the

<p>No I have filled out the form generated several times.. I used a debit card to make payment and that option is not listed only credit card so tried many different answers/methods, there are only a few questions and as I set the accounts up I know the answers
 to those questions but EVERYTIME it says my answers dont match, they do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The matter was passed to a "Supervisor" and still I was being asked to complete said form after I explained numerous times that is exactly was I have been doing. I was on Skype Support everyday for 5 days! Just going round in circles, agents saying "I will
 definitely get this sorted for you" and nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then got an email saying the accounts will "remain restricted" even after providing all the information required, as I said if feel completely scammed! Skype took the payments then restricted the accounts, I followed the procedure, done what was asked
 and nothing, very bad!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive now been told to set the accounts up again!!! After the poor and lack of Customer Support I have received and after what I have been through I am VERY reluctant! Ive never even been given a direct answer to why my accounts were restricted! I set them
 up! They are my accounts and I paid for them! So... I want to be able to use them! All quite simple.... but far from it!</p>

<h2>            How to safely remove hardware &#8211; particularly my Windows Phone 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Greetings community,</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I apologize if my question is going to sound stupid, but I’m still spending most of my time working in Windows 7, and I rarely got
 the time to fire up Windows 8, until now finally getting my vacations.</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I purchased WP8 developers subscription to have some fun during those free days. So I open Visual Studio, connect my phone (because
 my old computer doesn’t want to run emulator), play a little, and everything is fine.</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>However, when I close Visual Studio and try to safely remove the phone, it says that it couldn’t be done because some program still
 uses it, and that I should stop that program first. The only way I could do that really safely is to shut down the computer.</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>So I have two questions:</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>How to find out which program is still using some hardware, in order to stop it?</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Is there any way of removing the hardware in Windows 8 without using the desktop mode?</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Thanks for any thoughts.
</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>When you try to safely remove a USB drive from the computer, the reason why you are getting the mentioned error message is because the files in the USB drive are locked as they might be still in use by some process in the
 computer and Windows is unable to stop the process and unlock the file for the safe removal of the drive. We can definitely find out the process responsible for this. This can be done by using a tool called Windows Sysinternals Process Explorer. Process Explorer
 shows you information about which handles and DLLs processes have opened or loaded on the computer.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You may download and run the Windows Sysinternals Process Explorer from the given link and check which process is responsible for this issue.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">Regarding your second query, in Windows 8, there is also another way to remove any connected hardware device from the computer.
<span>&nbsp;</span>This can be done from the “<b><i>Change PC Settings</i></b>”. But, the Microsoft suggested way to do this is by using the “<b><i>Safely Remove Hardware</i></b>” option from the taskbar.

<h2>            Game Not Displaying In Full Screen Anymore...</h2>
                    Hi there...&nbsp; I just upgraded&nbsp;from Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;to Windows&nbsp;10 a couple of days ago.&nbsp; I have a game called "Cue Club" which displayed perfectly in Windows 10 until yesterday.&nbsp; Now, I have black bars on the side and Windows is stating that "Cue Club" is not
 "Compatible" when I run the Troubleshooter...&nbsp; How is this possible?&nbsp; If it wasn't compatible, wouldn't you think it would not have worked from the very beginning of upgrading to Windows 10?&nbsp; I have tried all of the resolutions to no avail and there is no
 "Screen Option" in the game settings...&nbsp; I've been playing this game for&nbsp;over 12 years...&nbsp; I really hope there's a fix for this...&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in advance...&nbsp;&nbsp; Rico&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Mouse moving to touch input</h2>
                    I have my touch screen laptop connected to an extended display. I want to be able to watch videos and read and do work on my extended display and touch my laptop's screen whenever I want to change music and such, without the cursor moving to where I last
 touched the screen. Because Ill be working on my extended display, tap pause on my laptop screen to stop music so I can watch a video or something, and then I have to move my mouse from where I touched the screen back on to the extended display, the mouse
 pointer doesn't stay put. Is there any way to change this?

<h2>            The User Profile Service failed the logon &#40;for the 2nd time&#41;</h2>
                    
<div>I own Windows Vista, and this is the 2nd time in a couple of months that this has happend. The first time I was able to fix it by following this tutorial.<br />
<br />
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/130095-user-profile-service-failed-logon-user-profile-cannot-loaded.html<br />
<br />
But I cannot do it twice, because I already have a folder with a .bk at the end and one without the .bak. So I cannot rename the folders, so neither solutions work. And I'm can't do a system restore because it screws up my McAfree. Please can someone help me?!</div>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
McAfee is one of the antivirus programs known for causing some strange issues so you might want<br />
to consider replacing it. If so then uninstall it and then run the McAfee Removal Tool to be sure no<br />
remnants are left which can cause strange issues.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free Versions that are very effective.)</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The .bk is only a backup on the 1st operation that can be removed so you can repeat it.<br />
Also you could use .bz (or anything else) instead of .bk for this effort. The important<br />
part is to save the old profile before you rename the .bak.</p>
<p>BTW there is a good chance that McAfee is the root cause, or at least aggravates, this issue<br />
so check the next message of options.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>

<br />
BE VERY CAREFUL IF USING THIS ONE :<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to<br />
ADMIN. This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the<br />
above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same<br />
password (or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

            Those <i>are </i>the technical differences. &nbsp;Many professionals spend years in college learning this subject matter. &nbsp;If you want more in depth training, look for training courses or search online with your favorite search engine. &nbsp;It is not in the scope
 of what we can provide here, we aren't here to give you a degree in computer science.

In round numbers XP, Vista and Windows 7 32-Bit Versions of the Operating System can only address 4GB. Does not matter how much memory you have installed 4GB is the max. From that max your video card has XXXMB of ram on the card so that limits the operating
 system to 4GB minus the cards XXXMB of memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition other hardware also takes away additional amounts of memory (usually a small when compared to the video card)
<br />
and the remaining memory (address space) is available for Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 OS and your applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that 4th GB thru 16 GB of ram you installed or will install goes unused on a 32-Bit OS. Does not matter what the BIOS reports or what the OS shows as installed memory it still limited to that 4GB address barrier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A link to the white paper titled "Gaming Performance Analysis" by Corsair <br />
Memory Inc. provides a good clear explanation of how a video card effects <br />
the amount of available memory in your PC.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I made a call to ms denmark, they told me to recover my 8.1 installation, then upgrade, and then do the clean install again. &nbsp;supposelly ms should automatic detect the new license. but under the clean install its ask for the license key. så it does not self
 detect the license key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So still no fix to it :(&nbsp;</p>

            <p>so i made a call til ms denmark again, beacuse i didn't think de solution was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new guy told me that the servers was overloaded so it takes a few hour's after upgrading to win 10 before the could validate the new license code..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i have to recover back to my win 8.1 pre-installed version. upgrade ton win 10, wait af few hour's before performing a clean install..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still not a good solution but it make's sense.</p>
