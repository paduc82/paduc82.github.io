            Hi Joe.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That driver is for PC Tools, an optimizing suite that is not recommended by any experts in forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands).   I would uninstall it in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Then What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These special steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing when running the media which almost always works, and is close but not as good as a Clean Install which is also offered as an option.  Your files should have course always be backed up if you value them at all. 
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then immediately after it fails try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean Installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Knight Oddfellow,<br />
<br />
The issue that you are experiencing might be due to corrupted registry components, software conflicts or incorrect settings. We'll need additional information in order to further isolate your concern. Please answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the current build and version of your Windows 10? </li><li>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue? </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try updating your video card driver to the latest version. Before doing that, uninstall first the old driver and detach the other video cables. Once successfully updated, connect other monitors, one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

    <title>Gamertag issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the hunty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'm posting cause I've been having some minor problems here and there and I believe it has something to do with my GT being offensive. I made this account, oh, 4-5 years ago and had no problem with it, but since about a few months ago some things
 are starting to mess up. One example is on Halo Reach, one day I was suddenly not allowed to put anything into my fileshare that had my GT as the author, or I'd get a message saying something about inappropriate name. I kind of ignored it cause I knew it had
 messed up for other people in the past and usually resolved itself but a few weeks went by and it was still there. More recently I got Modern Warfare 3, and I'm not allowed to put a clantag cause it claims anything I put to be prohibited text. I always used
 to be able to make a clan tag in any of the previous Call of Duty games, and also had access to my File share on Halo games before, it just suddenly claimed my Gamertag wasn't allowed or what ever. my big issue is I can't really afford the 800 MS points to
 change my name, and I'm not going to get people to report my gamertag cause I know that's wrong and can lead to trouble. I was wondering if there was anyway Microsoft could give me the points to change my name so I can continue to have full access to everything,
 or if I'll have to deal with it until I can afford it myself?</p>

<p>Hey there! After doing a little research, it looks like part of your name is now being used as slang for, well, something else. Let's just say it is language we don't want to encourage on our service. You could change your GT to try to avoid this issue in
 the future. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<p>Yeah I figured that was the problem, at least now I know for sure. I was just wondering if there was anyway I could get a free GT change since I can't really afford it, or if I'll just have to wait until I can get the money for the 800 MS points.</p>

<p>In a case like this, the only "free" GT change you are going to get is a Forced Name Change if the Enforcers find your name to be offensive. I would highly recommend changing it before this happens to avoid any negative marks on your account. Hope this clears
 things up, let me know. Thanks! </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That should do the trick.</p>

<h2>            USB Mouse driver is missing...</h2>
                    
<p>When I installed Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, My USB Mouse is not working. I have a Dell XPS 600. My USB Mouse is hooked up/powered on with the red lazer, but Windows XP dose not install the driver... I went to my computer/manage/ device manager,
 and under Mice and other pointing devices, it just says unknown device.<br />
Is there a fix for this?</p>
<p>Right now I am using a PS2 Mouse.</p>
<p>Thanks, Nick Hanson</p>

            USB mouse drivers are automatically installed in most XP set ups.&nbsp; However, you would first need to access the PC's BIOS and make sure the USB ports are "turned on."&nbsp; Then, install the correct chipset drivers required for your PC.&nbsp; You will find these
 on the manufacturer's web site.

    <title>postpone restart in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bangskij  say:</h3>
<h2>            postpone restart in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am running a long render, it's been running for three weeks and has two more weeks to go. Restarting the computer means having to restart the render from scratch, I have promised my clients delivery in 20 days and I will be liable for late-fees after that.
 If windows restarts in one week as it's threatening to do I will lose face and a lot of money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there *anything* I can do stop windows from restarting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already explored the obvious -settings will only let me postpone for one week. I found some changes I could make in obscure system files to turn off automatic restart but the computer wants to restart before those settings take.</p>
<p>
<em>&lt;Removed link&gt;</em><br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Is it possible to crash the update system or delete it? I don't care if it breaks windows -I can reinstall when the render is done.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Outlook Mail App does not work offline.</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with windows 8.1 and when I am working offline, away from wifi, the mail app does not work. &nbsp;it will not allow me to see emails 'stored' in the mail app at all. &nbsp;Just a blank screen with a "Mail cannot work while offline, connect and try
 again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm offline, but why can't I just see my emails? &nbsp;I"m fine with not connecting or uploading. &nbsp;I just want to review my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this. &nbsp;This only became an issue recently.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Changes in your account settings may result in your <strong>Mail </strong>app not working offline. To help us determine what's causing the Mail app not to work offline, we'd like to ask the questions below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the domain address of the email account you're using for your app?<br />
</li><li>Do you have any other account connected to your Mail app? If so, does it replicate the same issue?<br />
</li><li>Have you made any changes to your account before this issue occurred? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we recommend that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix problems with apps from Microsoft Store: run the troubleshooter">run
 the troubleshooter for Windows apps</a></strong>. This troubleshooter solves most app issues.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. I've used the mail app for years, and in the past it's always allowed me to see downloaded emails and write/save draft replies when offline. However I now get the same error if I open the app while offline. I think this happened
 since I last installed the most recent windows 8.1 updates on 14 February.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all the settings and can't see anything that can be changed to enable the mail app to work offline. I've made no changes to my accounts recently. I have 4 accounts on my mail app - 2 hotmail ones (including this one) and two outlook web app
 ones. The problem is with all accounts, as I cannot even get to the account settings if the computer is offline, just a blue screen with the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very frustrating as I often use the app on journeys when I have no internet access and at the moment I can't. Thanks for your help.</p>

</p><p>I have recently been unable to open Skype on my Windows Vista desktop or Laptop.&nbsp; Is Windows Vista and recent Skype updates the problem, or is there something else going on.&nbsp; I have also been unable to find a valid phone number for tech support, to talk
 to someone regarding the problems I've been having.&nbsp; When I googled Microsoft support for Skype, I was routed to a bogus site and wound up compromising my computer in the process.&nbsp; After scrubbing the computer of all malware and viruses, I'm still unable to
 download and access Skype.&nbsp; Please direct me to a tech support phone number on the Skype website.&nbsp; The only option I'm finding when I search the support tab is to come to this community forum.&nbsp; Given my recent experience, just a number will not suffice, please
 tell me where I can actually see the number on the site. Thanks,&nbsp; Frustrated</p>

            I suggest you uninstall it and redownload it or switch to another brand or use the built in Microsoft Security Essentials. AVG has a bad reputation for bugginess, false positives.

    <title>Can&#39;t configure my new headset in playback devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jo&#235;l---  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t configure my new headset in playback devices</h2>
                    <p>So i recently bought a new headset (steelseries arctis 7) which supports 7.1 surround sound. A friend of mine told me how he could click the "configure" button in the playback devices menu to setup the 7.1 surround sound. For both the game channel and the
 chat channel of this headset, this configure button is greyed-out. Now i have been busy downloading and installing new drivers and even deleting my old ones, but this have led to no succes so far. I would like to know if this is a known issue or if anyone
 has found a solution for this yet. </p>
<p>The headset is wirelessly connected via a hub that is connected via usb. I have also installed the steelseries software which does recognise the headset and lets me adjust some settings (such as an equalizer).</p>
<p>All help would be appreciated. Someone with a similar problem i found:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/configure-in-playback-devices-not-working/a9f209ed-8d94-486b-b97d-4265fd163eea</p>
<p>This person seems to have the same problem, but there is no answer to be found in this chat. I hope to get my answer though :).</p>
<p>Some technical details:</p>
<p>Motherboard z270 gaming m5</p>
<p>Audio driver: Realtek High Definition Audio version 6.0.1.8382</p>

                    Hi! :/ not much I can say. I'm pretty bummed, and I think this is fatal. I didn't know what category to put this in, so sorry about that. :/ I'm getting a blue screen after I login to my user. My computer fully shuts down and restarts. So I have NO way
 at all of fixing this blue screen myself. Because it won't let me get into my user. Luckily I have another computer but I would like to get my expensive one back ^^. So please please help me. I've tried safe mode and I still get the same thing. I don't know
 whats happening. So again HEEELLLPPP!!!!! :/

            Thanks, but I figured out the issue. The virus dumped my ENTIRE hard drive. I have nothing left. :'(. Luckily my computer is still under warranty so I will probably get a new one. The weird thing is that I had anti virus software. And trust me it wasn't
 the cheap kind. :/

            Hi OmoOyeIDS 
<br />
<br />To begin a Remote Desktop Session, you must be using Windows 10 Pro on the initiating PC, otherwise you would need a 3rd party utility, like the free version of TeamViewer or LogMeIn . . .

    <title>Windows 10 Activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasjones1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation</h2>
                    I recently ran into a problem with my pc where the WiFi adapter would no longer connect. I tried several things including resetting the driver, enabling and disabling, but nothing worked. Finally I decided to do a reset. I go&nbsp; to reset my computer and
 it hangs on 1% for about 30 minutes before going and staying on 2% for a google 2 1/2 hours. I tried to restart my computer, but it appeared that BIOS could not find windows. I decided to use my wife's computer and loaded up a copy of win10 on a usb drive
 in attempt to install the OS that way, and it worked. I have logged in and now it is telling me I need to activate, I go to the store to find the activation, which I was told was free, but all I get is an error saying "We're not sure how you here, but you
 can't buy this version of Windows 10." with the error code 0x8000FFFF and CV:qm/10JKP10a2IHPYZ. I am pretty lost and I cannot afford to buy Windows 10 and I don't even have the option to go back to my Windows 8 recovery partition.

<p>First of all, what is the actual problem you are having? What have you tried and Is there an EXACT error code or error message given?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick search found this -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/3-d-ultra-pinball-creep-night/user-reviews/2200-50731/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.gamespot.com/3-d-ultra-pinball-creep-night/user-reviews/2200-50731/</a>&nbsp;Is this your game?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, its older than 2004, or was there a later version re-issued?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article says&nbsp;<em>"</em><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)"><em>Users of Windows XP shouldn´t install it from CD, because for me it did´n work at all. Instead, just run it directly from CD, creating a save file on HD. Other platforms,
 such like Windows 95, 98 and ME should run with no problem."</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So have you tried:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>( a )</em> Running the game directly from the CD, If you can? </p>
<p><em>( b )</em> If that doesn't help, then installing the game in compatibility mode for W98, and also running it in that W98 compatibility mode as well.</p>
<p>Compatibility mode -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eightforums.com/threads/compatibility-mode-use-in-windows-8.6832/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eightforums.com/threads/compatibility-mode-use-in-windows-8.6832/</a>&nbsp;and check both Options in the
 article and the various other choices like 'Run in a 640x480 screen resolution' and 'Run this program as Administrator' If needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>IF the disc had an old copy protection system you will have other problems and need a workaround for that. Hence the question about possible error messages. See

    <title>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Visual Studio 2008</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with publishing a project that I was able to publish before. I wrote this originally in 2015 and was trying to update the software and publish it. I get an error stating;
</p>
<p>Error&nbsp;2&nbsp;An error occurred while signing: Failed to sign bin\Release\app.publish\\setup.exe. SignTool Error: Signtool requires CAPICOM version 2.1.0.1 or higher. Please<br />
&nbsp;copy the latest version of CAPICOM.dll into the directory that contains<br />
&nbsp;SignTool.exe. If CAPICOM.dll exists, you may not have proper<br />
&nbsp;permissions to install CAPICOM.&nbsp;BedLabels<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have downloaded and installed the capicom.dll and it exists in the same location as signtool.exe.</p>
<p>When I run regsvr32 to register the dll I have gotten two errors for that;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1;) the module loaded, but the call to the dllregister failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2;) the module failed to load</p>
<p>make sure the binary is stored at the specified path or debug it to check for problems with the binary or dependent. the specified module could not be found</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and double checked the spelling and that the file is indeed in the right location. I have searched the internet for solutions and found several , but none have worked. I hope someone out there can help me with this.</p>
<p>Thank- you&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim</p>
