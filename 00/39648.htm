<p>I find that if my mic is not working but I am able to hear other people, I am able to resolve it by returning to the dashboard, selecting Sign In, and Choose this Person. &nbsp;Like RippenHarra hinted at, it seems to be related to the mic being attached to a
 different profile or controller.</p>
<p>This issue only occurs for me occasionally when I am signed in automatically using Kinect.</p>

<p>What type of headset you running with? I ask because a friend of mine bought the XO7's and had trouble due to a dodgy boom mic. We tested it on my condole also with a different adaptor and it was still the same. Rule out the components if you can and if
 all else fails return the headset if you can. My mate got a new set and it all was fine after that.</p>
<p>Also make sure you have updated your controller.</p>

    <title>renaming or deleting a phantom or ghost drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            renaming or deleting a phantom or ghost drive</h2>
                    I have not installed a new program or device in quite some time but all of a sudden a ghost&nbsp; CD drive showed up under my computer.&nbsp; It has no hardware corresponding to it and is labeled CD Drive (E:) and containes 0 out of 0 bytes.&nbsp; ( Type: CD Drive and
 File System: Unknown under properties)&nbsp; Normally I could just ignore this however I had 4 external hard drives already installed and when this was created it changed the letters of all of them (so Drive (E:) is now Drive (F:) and so on) and this messes with
 all of my links throughout my computer.&nbsp; In particular itunes which has all my songs in an external hard drive folder and it can't find any of them because of the drive letter change.&nbsp; I have tried device manager and it does not display (even after inputting
 the instruction to show hidden devices in command prompt) It also does not show up under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ MountedDevices either.&nbsp; System Restore up to a week before this problem occurred does not fix it and lastly I have tried renaming the drives
 under disk management however the phantom CD Drive E does not display here for me to delete and I cannot rename the Drive that I want as E as it does not appear as an option in the drop down list.&nbsp; At this point I am completely out of ideas so any help and
 getting rid of or deleting this thing would be a HUGE help.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Phantom devices can appear for any number of reasons. Perhaps the most common reason is a shutdown error with a removable drive. Most people don't know this,<br />
but there are actually three different ways to disconnect a removable drive. <br />
<br />
See this link for the fix-<br />

            <p>That I can't just right click a tile and rename it.</p>
<p>I have all these tiles to things that are useful to me but I can't give them a meaningful name. I have a series of blue squares&nbsp; which I can't seem to amend. I have seen lots of similar queries from other win 10 users , the solution offered seems to be right
 click and edit source , but I just get "Unpin", "Resize" or "More". </p>

<p>I thought John's complaint regarding the inability to (easily) rename tiles in Windows 10 was extremely clear in his original post.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>You cannot so far as I can see rename tiles. The tiles use the name given to the software by the provider of the software.</blockquote>
<p>No offence, but it's kinda strange to see a mod and Windows 10 "launch expert" say this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To rename tiles for traditional desktop programs:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the tile to be renamed, go to "More" and select "Open file location"</li><li>Right-click the shortcut name that you want to change, rename it and close the window<br />
</li></ol>
<p>To rename tiles for Modern/Store apps:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the tile from the Start menu to the desktop</li><li>Right-click the tile in the Start menu and select "Unpin from Start"</li><li>Right-click the shortcut to the app created on the desktop and rename it</li><li>Right-click the shortcut again and select "Pin to Start"</li><li>(Optional) Delete the shortcut from the desktop</li></ol>
<p>Now why do we have to jump through all these hoops and deal with such nonsense just to rename tiles to what we want? Because Microsoft is an **** and for some weird reason
<em>really</em> doesn't want us any more to customise the Start menu the way we want it.</p>

<p>But when I right click on tile and select "More"&nbsp;the only option I get is "Turn live tile on" or "turn live tile off" I don't get "open file location" so can't rename- I have seen this solution suggested many times but I don't have the options you suggest

<p>Huh, didn't know there was a time limit on editing my posts. If something like this is required, I'm sure you can ask Microsoft to incorporate such a limitation in the forum, just as exists on various other fora too. FWIW I edited my post before refreshing
 the page to see the subsequent answers from you and the OP. Also, if this dumb forum had an option to multi-quote posts, I wouldn't have had to post and edit in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>My mistake. I am familiar with a few technical fora where only subject matter experts can attain mod status. I was also posting immediately after being dismayed to see a few more "answers" here from mods who had clearly not read the questions properly. Anyway,
 I apologise for the snark.</p>

Works as stated here. Pinned "Excel 2016" from All apps, then followed my own instructions to rename it to "Microsoft Excel 2016". Worked right away.<br />

<p><span><span>There is no time limit. The problem caused by late editing is that after a reply is submitted, an email containing the new message is sent to all parties interested in the thread. Your
 reply in its original form was received here 1 minute 24 seconds later. Some users reply without checking the message in the forum. I do not do that but I read your original before it was changed and replied. I might have realised that it had changed, had
 I refreshed the window but I did not. Late edits lead to misunderstandings. If you feel the need to make substantive changes it is better to post a follow up message as it highlights any changes made.

<p>Yeah, I can understand how editing the actual text of a comment previously posted might cause problems, but I personally don't see adding something one thought of later as such a big issue. Plus I don't like double-posting in case I want to add something
 later and no-one has replied yet. Anyway, your point is noted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual question is, is the OP's question answered, and more importantly, why has Microsoft chosen to restrict Start menu customisation so much? Just renaming tiles for pinned sites added by Edge is a frickin' nightmare. No wonder people are turning to
 third-party Start menu replacements even with Windows 10, just as they did with Windows 8.</p>

<h2>            How do I provent my windows from starting without my permission.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><div>
<div>My windows recently updated and restarted my computer without my knowledge or permission. My computer was off or in sleep mode. When I tried to set my computer to not restart until I wanted it to do so, I couldn't find the options for it.
</div>
<p>Is there a way to set my computer to not restart ever until I'm good and ready to restart it?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
Thanks!

</p><p>Restarting the computer after downloading the latest updates is important to install the updates. For the meantime, here's the best way to disable automatic restart after downloading the updates:</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Ameer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can assign your "Active Hours" up to an 18 hour period per day, in which <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
no RESTARTS</span>&nbsp;will occur to your system without granting permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Start Menu &gt;Settings &gt;Update and Security &gt;Scroll to "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Change Active Hours</span>" &gt;Choose your hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the best you can do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not wise to try and disable updating. &nbsp;Do so at your own peril.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the quick reply and assistence. I followed your recommendation, and to my surprise the option in the task scheduler is Disabled already. or does windows update override this command any way? &nbsp;

<p>Active hours do not seem to do much of anything for "Critical" updates. If it's minor then it works while logged in, unless you are on the lock screen. In which case active hours are thrown out the window and it will restart regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For critical updates it does not care what settings you suggest short of disabling windows updates entirely. This needs to be addressed by someone at Microsoft. It is not acceptable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ameer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you designate your active hours this simply prevents <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
RESTARTS</span> during this time period.&nbsp; Windows Updates will download to your device in the background, but the RESTART will not occur unless you grant permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RESTART is critical to perform when convenient for you.&nbsp; When you go to shut down your system and updates are requiring a RESTART, the shut down menu will ask for permission to RESTART and then shut down after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is about as convenient as it gets.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to delete ZoneMap&#47;Domain registry keys permanently - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to delete ZoneMap&#47;Domain registry keys permanently</h2>
                    
<p>I am giving maintenance to Windows 7 Home Premium machine. IE 8 and SpywareBlaster are installed and as a result all spyware SWB has blocked and immunized show on IE 8 Restricted sites&nbsp;and also in the registry. The owner wants to clean all of it but continue
 using SpywareBlaster. I tried uninstalling SWB while System Restore was off. When&nbsp;installed SWB again everything came back in the registry and IE 8 Restricted Sites. Is there anything short of reformatting hard drive to make those registry keys to go away
 and still be able to use SpywareBlaster.I&nbsp;have seen this question on some forums but never an answer that would work. Those keys keep coming back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully somebody has true&nbsp;wisdom.</p>

            Since the keys keep coming back you need to check the SpywareBlaster FAQs or send a note to their helpdesk.

<p>Thank you for your interest and suggestion. I followed it and am waitnig to hear from there. However, it seems to me that this is also an issue to Win 7. My reasoning is: when SWB is reinstalled the keys come back which to me seems to indicate that SWB somehow<strong>reads
 from somewhere in the registry</strong> what spyware SWB has blocked in the past and then reinstalls them on IE8 restricted sites. I don't think a new fresh reinstalled SWB can carry with it knowledge what had been going on in this machine before. The machine
 must have kept the information somewhere else in the registry. So, I would like to understand whether there is another part of the registry controlling ZoneMap/Domains and is able to refresh it to any program that peeks in looking for past history. I hope
 that somebody could give me deeper understanding of registry. Any ideas are welcome.</p>

            Seems to me I read at the Spywareblaster site that if you uninstall Spywareblaster without first removing all protection within the program&nbsp;then it will remove the program but leave all the zonemap/registry keys and restricted sites on the computer.<br />
<br />
I don't know why the owner would want to keep using spywareblaster but not let it use its list of bad domains/active x's to where ever it needs to write them to, it seems like it would defeat the purpose of the program unless he just wants to use it for the
 extra tools like to backup the hosts file and disable flash and such. <br />

<h2>            Adobe Creative Suite 2 Premium</h2>
                    I have adobe Creative Suite 2, and it is one of the primary pieces of software that I use with my computer.&nbsp; It worked well in Vista 64 in its own "adobe" folder.&nbsp; I installed windows 7 RC hoping it would speed things up some.&nbsp; I tried to install CS2 and
 I get the same error every time.&nbsp; It is:<br />
<br />
"Error: .\AutoPlay\main.ini"<br />
<br />
Followed by<br />
<br />
"Error:&nbsp;MAIN_FILE_VERSION"<br />
<br />
and then<br />
<br />
"Error: PRODUCT_REGISTRY_PARENT"<br />
<br />
and finally<br />
<br />
"Error: PRODUCT_REGISTRY_KEY"<br />
<br />
It gets no further in the install than that, meaning nowhere.&nbsp; It doesn't even begin to launch a setup wizard of any kind.&nbsp; I have run through all the various trouble-shooting forms available in windows 7, all of the compatibility modes, and the same error
 pops up every time.&nbsp; I have done as well a great deal of searching for a solution on the web, and there have been no answers forthcoming.&nbsp; I know it's not my machine that's at issue.&nbsp; I'm presently using an HP M8430F PC.&nbsp; Q6600 processor, 750GB hard drive,
 Nvidia GeForce 8500GT graphics card, and 4gb of RAM.&nbsp; As I said, it worked splendidly in Vista, but won't even attempt an install in windows 7.<br />
<br />
I should also note that this is Hobby Software, and as the new CSx versions are not within a reasonable price range for a non-professional editor, if there is no fix, this will instantly kill Windows 7&nbsp;as far as my usage is concerned.

            Well, I'm not sure how well that particular tool would have done.&nbsp; What I ended up doing is a system restore to Vista 64 to wipe out the hard drive again, with a full formatting.&nbsp; If I'd been paying attention, I suppose, I could have done that in the first
 place with Win7.&nbsp; That said, it was only during the second installation of Win7 that I noticed the advanced options with the "format" option.&nbsp; It might be a good idea in later installation versions to include a more explicit option for a "Clean Install with
 Formatting" to make it easier.<br />
<br />
In the end, I think that tool you linked to would do the trick, but I couldn't say for sure.&nbsp; CS2 seems to work just fine now, though, so that's a very positive thing.&nbsp; It means I can at least spend time in the system to see if it's worthwhile.&nbsp; I will add
 threads as more issues come up in later things.&nbsp; I hope they don't, but it's nice to see that if I do have issues, there's support for them.<br />
<br />
Thanks much.

<h2>            Sleep mode not available on my Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Just got my Surface Pro 3 yesterday. I logged in with my account which synched&nbsp;the settings with my other windows devices.</p>
<p>Right out of the box I noticed that the sleep option is not available. Only options available are Hibernate and Shut Down. Even if I try to modify the power options only Hibernate and Shut down are available in the drop down menu.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix this? It is a real pain to wait for the device to boot every single time.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

 to connect better). I will NOT be installing Visual Studio in the future, but microsoft needs to get this issue fixed.

<p>You can disable Hyper V and leave Visual Studio installed.</p>

            <p>You may have to perform a RESET instead of a REFRESH in this case.&nbsp; Some components of the operating system probably did not install or install correctly and needs to be redone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your data off before you do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing RESET and logging into your account, look on the power option to see if "Sleep" mode option is displayed and available.&nbsp; If it is not, perform your Windows Updates as you normally would do and during each update, spot check the power options
 for the sleep mode to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't, you may have a corrupted recovery image on the tablet and contact Microsoft Technical Support.&nbsp; You may be able to download a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That option, by the way, is part of the motherboard resource drivers.&nbsp; At times, some motherboard components get updates like anything else which can fix an issue during an update installation.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Device Manager would display "Other" for a component
 not recognized.</p>

    <title>Unable to use Backup and Restore Center - always fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mluck94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to use Backup and Restore Center - always fails</h2>
                    <p>Using a Sony VAIO T-Series ultrabook (model svt131190x) with Windows 7 Pro x64. &nbsp;Whenever I try to use Backup and Restore Center, whether I try to backup a system image or just simple files the backup will fail. I get two different errors depending on if
 I backup files only or a system image. I've posted both cases below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Steps I've tried:</p>
<p>-Confirmed Volume Shadow Copy service is running</p>
<p>-Disabled non-ms startup programs and services from msconfig</p>
<p>-Tried backing up to different drives</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Errors below:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>If I try to backup files or libraries without included system image, Backup Restore gives me this error:</strong></p>
<p>"Invalid window handle, error code 0x80070578"</p>

                    Hi Guys.

</div>
<div>When configuring RAID for Windows 7, is it better to configure within the BIOS or within disk management?</div>

</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            BIOS based RAID settings could indicate t hat you have hardware that would control the RAID.&nbsp; Any hardware based RAID setting would allow a fast RAID set up and maintenance than the Windows's "software" RAID control.

            <p>Depends, the two will probably give different types of raid configuration, disk management uses dynamic disks and if you have a PC with win7 preinstalled that PC makers Tools/Utilities and hidden recovery partition may no longer function.</p>
<p>And unless you are using a dedicated raid card, any raid configured will be software raid.</p>
<p>Finally what reason do you have for using a Raid?</p>
<p>Mirror Raid is not a replacement for a backup</p>

            Thanks for your responses.
<div><br />
<div>I custom built this workstation, installed Windows 7 independently.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just wondered if there is a speed advantage to configuring RAID within the BIOS or the OS. I am ignorant as to exactly how the RAID overhead is processed between the CPU and the RAM. I just want to follow theoretical best practice to make all my configurations
 most efficient.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there a best practice? Does OS RAID control add extra overhead?</div>

            <p>I have not experienced this with Windows 7 but with Windows Server 2003.&nbsp; Slowed down the "server" by 50% when the OS software RAID was being re-built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As previously replied, Mirroring disks is not a backup replacement.&nbsp; Backups are always important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro keyboard no longer works.</h2>
                    <p>I believe I may have a hardware fault with my Surface Pro, but not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My keyboard all of a sudden stopped working on my Surface Pro one time I booted. &nbsp;So I did the usual diagnostics:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean contacts on side of Surface Pro - no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall keyboard driver - no difference, however it did auto reinstall driver. &nbsp;Surely it must detect a keyboard to reinstall its driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have all latest updates installed - no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon Microsofts advice after a phone call, I purchased a new keyboard but again, no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system reset - no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can try, or is my Surface Pro broken some how?</p>

<p>Hi Dexy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you've tried every possible solutions and yet the keyboard still does not work, then this could be hardware related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you haven't tried to restore your device using the recovery image, we suggest that you try that. This will restore your device to it's factory settings. Click on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to download the recovery image for your Surface. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also bring your device to a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store near you</a> and have it assessed. </p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you able to sign in using your Microsoft account, and enter the serial number of your device? Just like what MVP Barb Bowman said, you shouldn't be asked for a product key since the product key for Surface is saved in the device's system. Try getting
 the <strong>Recovery Image</strong> by following the steps <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated, we'll look out for your reply.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Windows 10&#93; Mouse cursor disappears after waking up from sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I wake my Windows 10 PC from sleep my mouse won't work. I don't see cursor on my screen nor can I move my mouse (I can't hover over buttons or Start button).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough left and right click are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Turning fast startup off doesn't work either. Only solution is to reboot my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same setup worked on Win8.1, with same drivers. No newer Windows 10 drivers are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rig:</p>
<p>AMD FX 8320</p>
<p>Asus M5A97 R2.0</p>
<p>12GB HyperX Fury DDR3 1866MHz</p>
<p>MSI GTX760 Gaming 2 GB</p>
<p>Intel 530 120GB SSD</p>
<p>Samsung 500GB HDD</p>
<p>Mouse: Genius Maurus</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10 Pro x64 with latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TL;DR - mouse won't work after sleep.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT (12.05.2016)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As of today, 12th of May 2016, issue is still not resolved. Build 10586.318</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As you can see in following screenshot - your fix can't be applied.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1cb1083-4074-427a-8b50-db784bae38bc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, really? I need to reset my PC and completely start over with my settings and app installations just because reset is the easiest way to "solve" issues with Windows?</p>
<p>C'mon, you can do better than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - I actually did clean install, didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, can anyone actually reply, not just copy/paste generic answers from "How_to_make_This_Forum_Useless.pdf"?</p>

            Did you come up with real solution? Meanwhile I clean installed Windows 10 and issue is still present so it's clearly an issue with Windows 10.

</p><p>I've had the issue since the last Windows Cumulative Update, so I believe it's a Windows bug.</p>

            Hi <strong>DavePhillips_672, </strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8. As I understand, ‘<strong>F9</strong>’ key is not working and you are unable to disable ‘<strong>Touchpad’
</strong>after installing Windows 8. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you have any registry cleaner or antivirus programs (such as Constant Guard, AVG) installed on the computer?
<br />
<div>2. What is the model number for the ASUS laptop? </div>
<div><br />
3. Is this issue confined to any particular application or with all? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to check with the issue using onscreen keyboard. </div>
<div><br />
a. Press <strong>Windows key + W </strong>on your keyboard from Desktop.<br />
<br />
b. Type ‘<strong>Turn On-screen keyboard on or off’ </strong>and hit <strong>ENTER</strong>.
<br />
<br />
c. Click on ‘<strong>Start On-screen keyboard’. </strong><br />
<br />
d. On the bottom left hand side of the keyboard, click on <strong>Fn </strong>keys and check with the issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> <br />
<br />
Run the Hardware troubleshooter and check if it works.<br />
<div>Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:<br />
<div>a. Press <strong>Windows key + C </strong>on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.<br />
<br />
b. Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and click Troubleshooting under Settings.<br />
<br />
c. Now type <strong>Hardware Troubleshooter </strong>in the search option.<br />
<br />
d. Click on <strong>Hardware troubleshooter </strong>to run the troubleshooter.<br />
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>a. Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’ </strong>key on the keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
b. In the ‘Run’ windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click <strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
c. Click the <strong>‘Boot’</strong> tab and uncheck <strong>‘Safe Boot’</strong> option.</div>
<div><br />
d. On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click to select the option <strong>‘Selective startup’</strong>, and then click to clear the option
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box.</div>
<div><br />
e. On the <strong>‘Services’</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>‘Hide all Microsoft services’
</strong>check box, and then click <strong>‘Disable all’.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>f. On the <strong>‘Startup’</strong> tab, click <strong>‘Open Task Manager’</strong>. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select
<strong>‘Disable’.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>g. Click <strong>‘OK’</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
<br />
</strong><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</div>
<div><br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</div>
<div><br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</div>
<div><br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</strong></div>
<div>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
<div>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
</strong></div>
<div>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<br />
</strong>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</div>
<div>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</div>
<div>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</div>
<div>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</strong></div>
<div>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 7:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</div>
<div>a. Press the<strong> ‘Windows + R’ </strong>key on the keyboard.<br />
<div>b. In the ‘Run’ windows type<strong> ’MSCONFIG’ </strong>and click <strong>‘Ok’.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>c) On the <strong>‘General’ </strong>tab, click the <strong>‘Normal Startup’
</strong>option, and then click‘<strong>OK’.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>‘Restart’.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also update the keyboard drivers from the manufacturter website and check. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 5: To disable Touch pad drivers</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may try the following steps and check if that helps:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
a. Press Windows <strong>key + X </strong>and click on <strong>Control Panel.</strong><br />
<br />
b. Click on <strong>Mouse. <br />
</strong></div>
<div>c. On the Device Settings tab of the Mouse Properties screen, click the <strong>
Disable </strong>button to turn off the <strong>Touchpad</strong>.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue, however, shouldn't you be able to just take the photos from your app as you are viewing them and save them to a file somewhere in a file created just for Digital Life in "My Files"? After all, everything is being viewed via the
 app/web.&nbsp; I actually thought since this was an AT&amp;T program it would be a lot more user friendly.

<p>I've tried this several months straight, only completing 1 a day, not going back to previous days, &nbsp;trying time jumping day to day from a new month, nothing seems to work to pop this achievement. &nbsp;Is there any work around to complete this. &nbsp;Currently i cannot
 finish 100% this game due to this glitch. &nbsp;This is the second Arkadium game to be a glitched as badly, &nbsp;Microsoft should really consider getting a INTERNAL studio to do any future entries in the casual series. &nbsp;I Miss when you employed Carbonated Games on
 tasks like this.</p>
