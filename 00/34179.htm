<h2>            Fallout 3 DLC &#40;for PC&#41; Unavailable</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello, I am having trouble re-obtaining The 5 DLC for Fallout 3 (PC-Version). Operation Anchorage, The Pitt, Brotherhood of Steel, Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta.<br />
</p>
<p>I have purchased these DLC titles back in 2009, using the Games for Windows Marketplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would download them on my computer using the Games for Windows Live Client (GFWL) back then, but now i only receive "There was an error retrieving you purchase history. Please sign out and try again later.".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through 3 different support agents trying to resolve the problem. The end result is that since GFWL is no longer available (shut down) and the products i am looking for, the PC version DLC's for Fallout 3, are no longer on the current marketplace,
 I am unable to obtain any of the products I have purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since GFWL is shut down I only receive the error about retrieving the purchase history, so there is no information on your (microsoft) end about these purchases either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm trying to do is just get back these 5 DLC's for Fallout 3 (PC) that I had originally purchased when they came out in 2009.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help that can be provided about this query is most appreciated. Thank you for you time.</p>

<h2>            Anyone heard of alu.exe&#63;</h2>
                    Has anyone heard or know of alu.exe? It showed up on my computer in my task bar. After investigation and Norton Scans it has no problems. Yet it was created on my computer when I bought it, (which is recent), and created 8/10/11, and just "updated" itself
 today. I've checked the internet and I get so many various remarks on it that I am concerned about it.&nbsp; It is 2,283kb in size anjd is in my 'Program' folder under 'emachines updater'.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<p>
</p><p>I tried looking around and found that it was ALU.exe and seemed to be related to Asus. However my PC is not an Asus, and I finally located it in C:\Program Files\Packard Bell\Packard Bell Updater. I have no idea what it does, since it never asked me to update
 anything, but it doesn't seem harmful.</p>

<h3> samuelsteinhardt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I sync a briefcase between two computers&#63;   I want to store the exact same files on two separate computers, and sync them each time I make changes on either computer.</h2>
                    <p>I know how to use a briefcase - provided I store a file on one computer, and I have a briefcase on a USB flash drive, I can easily update both of them whenver I edit the files. What I would like to do is, copy files from one computer onto another computer,
 and being that I use both computers almost every day (they are not on the same network), I would like to know if there is a way to sync them both, and automatically update each computer when I make changes to the files on the other one. Is there a briefcase
 task that can accomplish this?</p>

    <title>How do I unlock my external hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darkvampire  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unlock my external hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My ext hard drive--seagate 2 TB--is bitlocked. I am running Windows 10. When I enter a wrong password it immediately tells me so, but when I enter the correct password it hangs and becomes unresponsive. The drive makes a loud vibrating noise and all I can
 do is pull out the power cord, at which point everything returns to normal, only my drive is still locked. I have no key. My PC is nearly 6 years old. It originally had Windows 7, and has been updated to 8 and then 10. It was fairly high-end when I bought
 it and, despite heavy use has never gone wrong. I am certain I have the correct password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            The bit about the drive making a loud vibrating noise and you pulling the power cord indicates that you might be experiencing a hardware failure (which you might have exacerbated by pulling the cord).&nbsp; You should try the drive on a different computer and
 see if there's a different result.&nbsp; No drive or important data should ever be encrypted without having an unencrypted backup.&nbsp;

                    <p>I have a full version of w7 that I preordered back in '09. In that time I've been able to do fresh installations of the OS whenever I've had issues or upgraded HDDs etc. My worry is that if I upgrade, I will lose that flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure you could use the option "Remove everything and reinstall Windows" in the new settings menu, but it's not really a fresh install and for that next HDD upgrade you'll have to what, spend hours cloning over the OS? Whereas before I could have just done
 a fresh install from installation media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say I'd upgraded, and had to reinstall via my w7 discs after the 1yr period, due to a faulty HDD etc. what happens then? Will I then be stuck back on w7, or will Windows update recognise that the associated product key was upgraded during first year and

            <p>Thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine though that the created w10 recovery media, while it will be basically the same as using the w7/8 installation media (and you will be able to use on new HDDs etc), will be locked to the hardware its installed on? Regardless of whether the product
 key from the upgraded OS product key was OEM or a full license (that could be transferred to a new system)?</p>
<p>What I'm basically asking, will the upgrade essentially turn a w7/8 full license into an OEM copy, fixed to the current hardware?</p>

                    <p>What is the latest on this rumor?&nbsp; is there a surface book 3 that will have lte?</p>
<p>I am surprised that there's not more pressure on this subject, it would make this the best all around device ever.</p>
<p>its is such a pain to always be looking for wifi, nice if it was like my ipad that is always connected, you don't even have to think about it.</p>
<p>looking forward to not using it anymore and switching 100% over.</p>
<p>Any info on this subject would be helpful., i understand they have release surface pro with lte, but i would like to have it on the surface book. &nbsp; thanks</p>

            Hi Bpersons1,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately there hasn't been any news in regards to LTE for Surface Book 3. Microsoft will typically release the information once the product is about to launch.
<br />
<br />The Surface Pro with LTE could be an option for you, or using your phones hotspot to connect to a Surface Book. 
<br />
<br />All the best,
<br />Nathan

    <title>Xbox Live Friends List Problems. Can&#39;t see game&#47;party invites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drvomitkc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Friends List Problems.  Can&#39;t see game&#47;party invites</h2>
                    <p>So about a month ago I started having problems receiving invites for games/parties. &nbsp;After researching I cleared my MAC Address and did a hard reset. &nbsp;Now that worked sometimes, and other times nothing. &nbsp;The problem would keep returning though. &nbsp;As annoying as it is I've learned to live with it.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. &nbsp;I decide to log on to the xbox website to delete some of the people I no longer play with. &nbsp;I delete about 20 people and fire up my xbox. &nbsp;The problem is everyone who I just deleted is still on my xbox friends list. &nbsp;Yet when I go to my friends list on xbox.com it shows me my list without the people I just deleted. &nbsp;And on top of that when I go to add a person as a friend they don't show up at all. &nbsp;But when I click their profile it shows us being friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I decide to factory reset everything and put &nbsp;my account and everything back on from scratch. &nbsp;Still doesn't solve the problem. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have an open NAT and I am hardwired with an ether net cord. &nbsp;I consider myself pretty tech savvy but I'm lost on this one. &nbsp;Anybody else run into this? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey, Dr!</p><p><br /></p><p>Sorry to see any issues. It sounds like there might be a delay from the service to your console. If it's reflecting appropriately on the website, then the service is definitely working, and your account wouldn't have any issues.</p><p><br /></p><p>Because you've done a factory reset and that didn't resolve you, that leads me to believe that the speeds you're getting might need to be addressed.

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Did you make any changes to your PC immediately&nbsp;after Upgrade?</em>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Is your PC installed with any third party Antivirus Software?</em>
<strong>Yes, Norton Security 2016 which was installed and running prior to the Anniversary Update. Opening USB folders and files were not a problem prior to the Update.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I described is occurring on my 2 Windows 10 Pro PCs. One PC has an Intel Motherboard and processor, and the other PC has an ASUS Motherboard and AMD processor. Both computers are USB 2 compliant. The problem occurs with HDD and Samsung Galaxy phone.</p>

                    I have a Time Capsule hooked up to my Mac as my wireless network at home. &nbsp;I recently received a Compaq Presario as a gift but I'm having trouble connecting it to my existing wireless network. &nbsp;It recognizes the wireless network but won't connect when
 i enter the password. &nbsp;I've tried converting my password to HEX code, changing every setting (WEP,WPA,WPA2,WPA-PSK with TKIP data encryption, etc.). but nothing seems to work. &nbsp;Has anyone been able to connect their PC to an existing Apple Time Capsule network?
 &nbsp;Thanks.

    <title>RSAT Not Installing on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barryspoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            RSAT Not Installing on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Windows 10 Ent - 10240)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been battling with this for a couple of weeks now. I am trying to install Remote Server Tools on Windows 10, but the installation fails during the restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded RSAT from here -&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520</p>
<p>UK based PC, but I have added the US-EN language pack as this seems to have fixed it for many other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing RSAT, the installation seems to go fine, and I click to restart as requested. You get the standard "Apply Updates" screen which counts up to 30% then restarts. You then get a another applying updates screen that looks more like you get when
 Windows 10 is installing, which counts to about 15% before dispalying a Fatal Error something like "<span>fatal
 error c00000D4 applying update operation xxxx of yyyy". Windows again restarts and gives a screen stating the update failed and is being rolled back.</span></p>
<p>I have spoken our good friend Mr Google and there are various fixes out there for Windows
 failing during updates, but none that I could see for RSAT failing to install. I have tried various options I found on there such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cleanup</p>
<p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what happens, it still fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this? Does anyone know a nice helpful fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            Hi Paul
<br />
<br />Thank you for the feedback. 
<br />
<br />You are using Skype on a Windows version which is compatible with the new skype (<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-a...</a>).
<br />
<br />It should not be the sleep mode because, if this happens during a call, then it is no longer on sleep mode.
<br />
<br />Sometimes there are glitches in the installation / update process that don't pop up an error message so we end up thinking the installation is all ok when it not the case, which can cause strange behaviors as the one you describe.
<br />
<br />May I suggest that you uninstall Skype, restart your device, re-install Skype and try again?
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />Margarida

    <title>Printing issues with Windows Journal viewer in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rab6363  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing issues with Windows Journal viewer in Windows 8</h2>
                    I have been using Windows Journal to annotate pdf's for years.&nbsp; I print the pdf using Journal Writer, write my hand written comments, highlight, etc.&nbsp; To share my comments with another party, I print the Windows Journal document using a pdf print driver.&nbsp;
 All has been well until my new machine with Windows 8.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, when I print the annotated Windows Journal document using the same pdf print driver I have been using for years, all highlighting comes out opague, covering the words, as opposed to transparent.&nbsp; I have tried several pdf print drivers, with the same
 bad result.&nbsp; I understand the "layers" concept in printing, and that the pdf print driver is reading the highlighting as solid as opposed to transparent.&nbsp; But this has always worked for me in the past, including through Windows&nbsp;7. it seems to me that something
 has changed with the latest version of Windows Journal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.&nbsp;</p>

<div>I am not attempting to print a physical copy of the Windows Journal document. I am trying to convert my annotated Windows Journal document to pdf via the use of a pdf print driver. The pdf print driver is up to date, and I have tried several different
 pdf print drivers. All have the same problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It should be noted that when I use OneNote to annotate a pdf document, or convert the annotated Windows Journal document to OneNote before printing, the pdf rendering is fine (highlighting shows up as transparent as it should). Thus, the problem is with
 Windows Journal or Journal Writer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your suggestion to update Journal Note viewer makes no sense since I am not attempting to view the document via viewer. I am attempting to view and share the document with others as a pdf.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please advise further.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I apologize for the delayed reply. It appears that print PDF driver that you are using is causing this issue. Since, you are able to print it fine after converting the annotated document to an OneNote document, the issue might not be
 caused by the Journal viewer or the printer. The print PDF driver might not be compatible with Windows 8. You can search in your favorite search engine for PDF convertors or PDF drivers which are compatible with Windows 8.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you couldn’t find any Windows 8 compatible driver, you can reinstall your current driver in compatibility settings and check. Refer to this article:</font></p>

<div>It is definitely not the pdf driver. &nbsp;I have tried many pdf drivers, as well as pdf conversion software. &nbsp;The folks at Nitro also tested it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;This appears to be a problem with Windows Journal compatibility with Windows 8.</div>

<p>This method does NOT work. I am also having issues printing Word documents to Journal Note Writer, which have just recently started. When using the Compatibility Mode Troubleshooter (a) Journal Note Writer is not on the list of found programs, and (b) when
 you browse to find it, and then select it, the troubleshooter says that it cannot be fixed by changing the compatibility mode.</p>
<p>My problems have just surfaced in the last few months. Prior to that, I was using the same computer (Surface Pro 3), same operating system (Win 8.1) and the same printer. The only thing that has changed has been the Windows updates that I have religiously
 installed.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

    <title>envelopes problems on a HP CP2025 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindapolk  say:</h3>
<h2>            envelopes problems on a  HP CP2025</h2>
                    Just about every time I print envelopes multiple problems arise. Sometimes the computer just stops talking to the printer. Sometimes it prints from the bottom tray even though I'd not done anything different from the few evelopes before that came from
 the top feeder tray. Often, it cleans itself after every envelope eventhough it's only printed 3 short lines. How can I keep these from continuing?

            Do you mean the volume icon on the taskbar? If so, then yes I can click and see the speaker. Also, when I click on Playback Devices I can see the green bar moving while audio is playing but nothing is coming out of the speakers.&nbsp;

            There is only one speaker item available to click on. And no I can't hear the sound, I can only see the green bar moving when a tone is played or music is played but no sound is actually coming out of the speakers.
