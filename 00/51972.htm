                    <p>okay so before anyone asks. I've tried pretty much everything I could find to try. I hard reset it. I unplugged it for 5 min. Tried the on Xbox trouble shooting thing by holding sync and eject.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Okay so for the past month my Xbox has been acting up like this requiring me to factory reset it weekly. The first time was like this time where it would take 5-10 min to reach the green screen. And the only way I could fix it was to hold the sync and eject for the 5-10 minutes and it actually ended up going to the troubleshooter so I could reset it. Then the three other times it messed up the boot sequence was normal so the troubleshooter worked like a charm. But now I'm back to the long boot time and I tried 2 times last&nbsp;night holding it the entire time til the green screen came up&nbsp;but it never&nbsp;went to the troubleshooter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this without sending it in? And as a side question if I have to buy a new Xbox how woul

    <title>In Windows 10, how can I disable program running at startup without - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandymilne  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows 10, how can I disable program running at startup without logging in to administrator account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My computer is running Windows 10 Pro, on a domain. For everyday use, I log in with my domain account which is NOT a member of the machine's local administrator group.&nbsp; Safe computing, etc etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>disable a third-party program that has been configured to run at start-up.
</strong></span>(Dell Sonic Wall Net Extender).&nbsp;When I run Task Manager as my normal login that's not-admin, the enable-disable&nbsp;button on&nbsp;Task Manager's&nbsp;Startup&nbsp;tab is&nbsp;grayed out.&nbsp; Within Task Manager's File | Run Task popup, there is no checkbox to 'run as
 administrator' because I'm not using an administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to make this change to startup applications by doing something like running Task Manager at an elevated level so that the "Disable" button is available on the Startup tab.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know I could switch users and log in as the local administrator account. That does work.&nbsp; But it's very inconvenient.&nbsp; I want to be able to do a particular task "as administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running taskmgr itself from the command-prompt-as-admin. But then the Startup tab doesn't list anything whatsoever, so that's not helpful.</p>

<br />
<br />If you have a VPN from a service or from work that they provide you, you can easily do this by following this guide from Microsoft here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20510/windows-10-connect-to-vpn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20510/...</a>

    <title>Timestamps still messed up after 100 days - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeroenros  say:</h3>
<h2>            Timestamps still messed up after 100 days</h2>
                    <div>Good evening to all,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On July 31st i should've received two achievements. These were Three's Company and Bling Bling, both from the Xbox one title 'Agents of Mayhem'. Even though it did unlock on my Xbox (proof: https://ibb.co/hsmh8z), it did not show up on xbox.com as there
 were some issues with the servers. When searching on google (Reddit, Trueachievements etc.) i found that many others had the same issue that night.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because i was that day on a 289 consecutive days of achievements and i wanted to keep the streak going, i made sure to get some achievements in Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy (Win 10), but also these did not unlock at all. A bit frightened for my streak,
 but confident in Microsoft's capabilities, i went to bed that night, assuming everything would be allright after all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But this did not happen. The next day i noticed that on xbox.com the timestamp of the achievements changed from what i've seen the day before. Apparently i've unlocked my Agents of Mayhem achievements somewhere that night, around 5.00 am. Because i have
 a responsible job i can assure i was not gaming at night.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So later that night i contacted xbox support. They suggested i'd do the power cycle to make sure the timestamps would syncronize. Instead of fixing my issue, the timestamps changed to the incorrect one from the website, breaking my streak: https://ibb.co/k62LwK</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This <strong>(Mod Removed-Profanity)</strong>me off, especially since i did not actually break my streak, something on the serverside of Microsoft/Xbox messed up.<span>
</span>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</div>

<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Since that day i've contacted multiple support employees, but neither one was able to help me. Christian I made sure it would be fixed (which it did not), Michelle tries to comfort me by saying many positive things without any solution so far and Nathalie R
 did not manage to figure out what my issue is, as he/she keeps saying completely irrelevant things in broken English. Also Othmane E was making very serious promises<strong> (Mod Removed - Personal Information)</strong> which resulted in absolutely
 nothing. Later i talked to Nathalie R again (even though she/he claimed it was a different Nathalie R) but it was not the fault of the xbox servers. It had something to do with my router according to him/her. Then i came in contact with Hannah R, she seemed
 to agree that this was not up to me to fix, but couldn't bring me a solution either.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
In the meantime i have been e-mailing with Michelle and Nathalie R. Michelle is ignoring me for now while Nathalie R closed my support ticket.</p>
</div>

<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</div>

<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p style="margin-left: 0">
So far i've done the power cycle multiple times, deleted my profile and re-added it, filled in some survey about achievements three times, posted on the Xbox forums multiple times, uploaded the screenshots multiple times, posted on Reddit (because that's where
 the offline team is residing, as Microsoft doesn't have it's own platform for that?) and contacted many support employees who all seem to avoid blaming the cause of this issue: the Xbox/Microsoft servers. So far my timestamp remains incorrect since august
 1st, 2018. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
This should not be this difficult to rectify! Any other tips that have not been done multiple times?</p>

</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist. It seems like you're experiencing an issue with the achievements system on the Xbox. During the time you unlocked the achievement; you mentioned that we were experiencing an issue with our servers. Unfortunately,
 that can happen but we do our best to ensure we get those problems taken care of for all of our Xbox family. I see that customer support did try to assist with the issue, and you're still in contact with one representative. I definitely recommend keeping in

</p><p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thanks for the reply. So far things are not going great. It was 101 days ago that the servers messed up (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not just for me, i have seen many reports that day</span>) and nothing but comforting words and
 false promises came my way. I have worn out probably 10 support employees and no one was able to help me. I spent way to many hours writing my story again and again to see someone just blame my internet connection for this worldwide issue that bothered many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to update you all on how nothing happens, but apparently after a while a post on the forums here gets marked as solved (which it is surely not). This is my third rant already on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to see some 'representative' actually 'assist me with my issue' as you stated. So far i'm losing faith in the support and i'm losing fun and interest in playing on these console.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I have tried this as well and i'm going to add it to the list of things that do absolutely nothing to resolve my issue.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Don't get to much faith, it seems that support is just giving you false hope to get their 5 star reviews and make you temporary feel happy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is correct. I had a streak of 289 days (https://www.trueachievements.com/winstreak.aspx?gamerid=382935&amp;start=151017), and because the timestamp messed up i now have a new one which is 101 days as of today (https://www.trueachievements.com/winstreak.aspx?gamerid=382935&amp;start=010818).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually i should have a streak of a little more than a year, but unfortunately this was not granted for me.&nbsp;</p>

            Here's my observation ... in one of your responses, you stated "<span>So far i'm losing faith in the support and i'm losing fun and interest in playing on these console." Starting a new streak, especially one of such length as 100 days, would
 suggest that's not entirely true. If I was losing interest, I wouldn't be that concerned of what achievements I was earning or when. So why not let the old streak live in the past and build a new one that eclipses it?</span>

<h2>            Switch Audio Device Without Restart between computer and TV.</h2>
                    <p><strong><u><em>Switch Audio Device Without Restart </em></u></strong></p>
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have an HDTV hooked up as a monitor to my desktop via an HDMI cable to an HD video card. The video works wonderfully but for some reason the sound no longer switches over easily. I used to be able to just change the sound output on the computer from speakers
 to the Rear Output HDMI and restart the program to get sound through the TV. Now I have to restart my computer each time I switch in order for it to work. This works but I would like to be able to switch back and forth without a restart.
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help? I'm not sure what happened, it used to work without a restart and now does not. This happened some time ago so I'm afraid I can't give any details as to what caused it.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>It just goes into a loop and comes back to the same screen. The new version accepts my password but the old classic one that I downloaded nothing. I have even put the wrong password on purpose to see if it does come up with an invalid password error but

<p>Hello there again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply, but let's try this steps if it will resolve your issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Make sure that Skype is no longer running. Quit Skype.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On your keyboard, press the Windows key + R key. Then, the run windows will appear.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the run window, type in %appdata%\Skype and hit enter. Please find a folder that has your Skype name on it.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please rename the folder as Skype_Old.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please try to relaunch Skype and login, then check if there are now changes from it.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I hope this helps. Should you have further queries, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.</span></span></p>

<p>I did all of these and the only thing it did was change the skype name to Skype_Old and still no change in terms of password. It is just looping with the same issue. I even uninstalled and reinstalled but no change.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cheaters - why aren&#38;&#35;39&#59;t they being banned&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So having talked to the support staff, I was told to repost this thread here, since it concerns a game on GFWL on PC, and the enforcement team doesn't seem to read those posts, or so I was told. So here it is:</p>
<p>I'm curious, I have now filed multiple complaints vs the same player who uses cheats, and is VERY well known in the gaming community to use cheats. He still hasn't been banned or had his points removed (he has a top spot on the leaderboards). When are you
 gonna do something about him? I'm not gonna name him in case there's a policy against naming and shaming, but his exploits are well documented on YouTube, so there's really no reason not to have him banned yet. Please Microsoft, do the right thing and ban
 cheaters and people who use exploits to gain advantages in online competitive games.</p>

<p>So we're proud much good to have to deal with this is what I'm gathering form what I've been dealing with, I'm starting to think I might need to find the number for their human resources department and find out how to file a complaint against them, because
 it's becoming more and more difficult to even play a fair game anymore with all the modding and lag cheating I've been seeing and I'm not to sure but I've heard about a virus that has been sent out from someone.</p>

<p>The only way to run unsigned code is by modding the console hardware itself to bypass the check, the so called jtag or RGH consoles. And lets face it, if those were to get infected with a virus would anyone really care.</p>
<p>As it stands the 360 does not run unsigned code, lets be more specific since that is what you want, there is a great difference between modding a save file or game disc and running a unsigned program on the console.</p>
<p>We as general users can't do that. Only those with the modded hardware can.</p>

    <title>HP Laptop LAGS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrick kemp  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Laptop LAGS</h2>
                    <p>Several years ago, I bought an HP 2000-410 laptop with these specs:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Intel Pentium B960 @ 2.2GHz (Sandy Bridge) w/ Intel HD Graphics.</li><li>4GB of RAM</li><li>500GB HDD</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a clean install of Windows 7 on it, and it has the latest Windows Updates installed. Every couple months, I run Disk Cleanup, Disk Defragmentor, and Disk Check. I've adjusted it for best performance, and tweaked startup items in MSCONFIG. I have
 ongoing anti-virus/anti-spyware software. Still, it lags and crashes when using the most basic programs (Firefox, OpenOffice, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p><br />

            Hi Itsmeitsyou 
<br />
<br />EurekaLog is a bug resolution tool for Delphi and C++Builder developers 
<br />
<br />If you are not a software developer, that was probably put there by some application your installed, it will cause no harm to your PC, however if you wish, you can just delete that folder . . .

<h2>            PitBull and Rottweiler discrimintaion on XBOX&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I was looking threw the props section of the avatar marketplace a few minutes ago. When I came across a prop of a husky. The dog was jumping around and being playfull with my avatar. Then I got really excited because I saw a prop of a pitbull, and as a pitbull
 owner I was thrilled that xbox had put the breed on there. That is until I highlighted the the pitbull to see what it did... and Ill be damned the pit does have a little ball to play with like the other dogs or a treat to do tricks for. NO xbox thought it
 would be approprate to make the pit and the rott walk around in an agressive manner barking and growling when my avatar point in a giving direction. This in an OUTRAGE!!!!</p>
<p>As a PITBULL owner and lover this is border line criminal in my book! Everday I have to try to educate people about the breed and change the media induced stereotype place on the breed I love! And please anyone that responds to my post dont start with the
 breed bashing my dogs are some of the best trained and well behaved dogs you will ever meet. They are great with my other dogs and love my 4 childeren.</p>
<p>I damand that XBOX address this problem NOW!!!</p>
<p>Any support from the xbox community would be great..</p>

<p>It's a matter of opinion, Pitbulls and Rottweilers are known to be aggressive dogs, it's an avatar it's not life threatening. If you don't like it you don't have to purchase it, there's really nothing they can do to simply change the function of the avatar
 because one person doesn't like that it's walking around aggressively. You can however use this:
<a href="http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Xbox.com/Feedback.aspx?formID=43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mymfe.microsoft.com/.../Feedback.aspx</a> and leave them some feedback on how you feel about it and maybe in the future they will make an avatar that's more to your liking.</p>

<p>So you guys are saying that wolfs and dobermans arent know to be aggressive which is why they are portaied in such a playful manner when compared to the big bad pitbull right!?!?!?!?!?!? Yeah right. Every breed that xbox chose to put in the prop section
 could be labled the same way you two and xbox are labling pits and rotts.</p>
<p>And yes I do blame all the DIPSHIT ignorant oweners like MICHAEL VICK that continue to give these breeds bad names by abusing them and using them for fighting. But as a responible pitbull owner its my job to help break that stereotype placed on my dogs for
 no reason other than there breed. I dont see that any different than racial profiling</p>

<p>I didn't even notice the dog's behaviour at first, but yes. It's very wrong to portray Rottweilers and Pitbulls as anything other than playful in an environment such as Xbox Live. The breeds may be more dangerous than others when in the wrong hands, but
 that does not make it ok to assume that EVERY Rottweiler is aggressive. I've seen more aggresive Poodles than Pitbulls in my life!</p>
<p>My biggest concern with the avatar props was however that the tails and ears of breeds such as the Rottweiler and Doberman were clipped. THIS is not ok from my point of view as that is not how these dogs naturally look, nor should they. Stop cutting parts
 of your dogs! And Xbox Live, stop supporting this!</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />
Choose the applicable link for the operating system:<br />
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3813-language-add-remove-change-windows-10-a.html<br />
https://www.eightforums.com/threads/language-add-or-remove-in-windows-8.5849/<br />
https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/87317-display-language-change.html<br />
<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive or drop box to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-OneDrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07<br />
<br />
This command will automatically collect these files:&nbsp; msinfo32, mini dumps, drivers, hosts, install, uninstall, services, startup, event viewer files, etc.<br />
<br />
Open administrative command prompt and copy and paste the whole command:<br />
<br />
copy %SystemRoot%\minidump\*.dmp "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\"&amp;dxdiag /t %Temp%\dxdiag.txt&amp;copy %Temp%\dxdiag.txt "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\SFdebugFiles\"&amp;type %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts &gt;&gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\hosts.txt"&amp;systeminfo &gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\systeminfo.txt"&amp;driverquery

 GET Caption, Command, User &gt;"%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\startup.txt"<br />
<br />
There are two files for you to find manually:<br />
<br />
a) C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP<br />
<br />
Use file explorer &gt; this PC &gt; local C: drive &gt; right upper corner search enter the above to find results.<br />
<br />
b) dxdiag: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the left lower corner search type:&nbsp; dxdiag &gt; When the DirectX Diagnostic Tool opens click on the next page button so that each tab is opened &gt; click on save all information &gt; save to desktop &gt; post one drive or drop box share link into the thread<br />

            We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.

            Can you access Windows via safe mode with networking?
<br />Can you access the recovery options by force shutdown three times?
<br />This should give you access to the options for safe mode &amp; repair options.
<br />If yes turn off fast startup &amp; ‘use your Information to sign in automatically after a restart or update’ this has been known to cause black screens.
<br />Also check to see if the update included a graphics card driver, this too may have caused the black screen.
<br />You can try this <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/27180-windows-10-recovery-tools-bootable-rescue-disk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/27180-w...</a> if you have access to another device &amp; can download it, it has several programs including imaging software so you can backup your personal files.
<br />If you cannot access Windows even from safe mode or access the recovery options then unless another Independent advisor has another suggestion the only option is to clean install Windows.

                    My laptop&nbsp;that runs Vista Home Prem. 32 bit.&nbsp;will not detect any wireless network. When I go to connect to a network the show box is blank. Checking the device manager a warning shows for the wan miniport (pptp). Upon trying to do an update for the device
 searching online, I get an error message that an error had occurred while installing. The properties box for the device shows Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39). Windows update will show
 no updates availible for this computer.

            Hi code8000,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to re-install the WAN miniport driver by following the steps below.<br />
<br />
1. Go to device manager and select "Show Hidden Devices" under the <br />
View menu. <br />
<br />
2. Expand Network adapters. You should see the WAN Miniport (PPTP) <br />
<br />
3. Try right clicking on it and uninstalling it. More than likely it <br />
won't allow you to. To get around this update the driver to something <br />
"uninstallable" like the MAC Bridge. To do this right click on it and <br />
select update driver. Choose no to look on windows update. Then choose <br />
to specify a location. Next choose dont search. Next unselect show <br />
compatible hardware and find the MAC Bridge under Microsoft. Force it <br />
to install it. After thats done you should be able to uninstall your <br />
new 'MAC Bridge Miniport." <br />
<br />
4. Now that it's gone, lets reinstall it. Now get the devcon.exe <br />
package from the link below<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311272</a> and extract
<br />
it desktop or c:drive. <br />
<br />
5. Go to the command prompt (Run it in administrator mode) / console (cmd.exe) and get to the folder with devcon.exe in it.
<br />
<br />
6. Run this command: devcon.exe install c:\windows\inf\netrasa.inf <br />
MS_PptpMiniport <br />
<br />
7. Go back to the device manager. You should see the WAN Miniport <br />
(PPTP) back.<br />
<br />
This should do it.<br />

            I was servicing a PC that got hit my countless viruses and malware; it made disasters to it as far as not even letting it start through Safe Mode by a registry key deletion.<br />
<br />
In this particular case it also managed to corrupt the network drivers for the PC, but once I restored the registry keys for Safe Mode I was able to fix that up.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the WAN Miniport (this case IP, not PPTP) was still corrupt and, even though this doesn't use this Networking app, I wanted to leave this PC speckless and problem-less for anything else.<br />
<br />
This method worked, instead using MS_NDISWANIP.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

<h2>            Notifications</h2>
                    Why would I not get notifications from one contact and not another contact. I have to open the app to see the message. I have notifications turned on for the app and the person. I have reinstalled the app. I have cleared the cache. The other person has
 reinstalled the app. I have deleted the contact and added them back. What's the point in using Skype if I don't get notified of new messages. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>This doesn't solve anything. I know several people with the same issue, some get notifications from all contacts but one, others from one-on-one conversations only but not group chats, and so on. It's not even a consistent problem, the only thing that's
 consistent is that the problem happens with those specific conversations only, for the others everything always works as expected. In any of the cases, notifications are turned on, which doesn't change a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is a work tool for many, and this as the potential of rendering it useless. This needs to be looked at ASAP.</p>

<p>Stop lying to us Microsoft.....you know full well that notifications do not work and calls do not connect.....you know the new version of the app is a disaster....many of us rely on Skype for work and staying in contact with our families and you have destroyed
 it by hurrying out a pointless snapchat&nbsp;copy that no one needs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be wholesale sackings at Microsoft over this. What type of deluded "Emperors New Clothes" atmosphere must have taken hold at Microsoft for no one to have pointed out that the new version of Skype was hopeless....I can imagine them all slapping
 themselves on the back and opening champagne, </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Yay look at us we've created a snapchat clone....we're down wit' de kidz...the kidz will love us now"</p>

            What is your XP version and Service Pack and do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same SP as your installed SP?<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are pressing 'R' to Repair a Windows XP installation...&nbsp; after booting on the XP installation CD and that will attempt to load the XP Recovery Console and that is not how you perform a Repair Install (in spite of what the message says).&nbsp;
 You can also resolve the issue of not being able to get past the password prompt in Recovery Console, but one does not perform a Repair install from the Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
To perform a Repair install you need to instead press 'Enter' to '<i>set up Windows XP now</i>' and then proceed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Performing a Repair install of XP is a pretty drastic measure - the next to the last thing before a complete reinstall of XP and only after all other troubleshooting methods have been exhausted (unless you are just practicing) so unless there is a really good
 reason to do a Repair install, you might want to consider other alternatives.<br />
<br />
And you will not be doing a Repair install if the genuine bootable XP installation CD you have is not the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack.&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; If you have Service Pack 3 installed and your CD is less than SP3, you will not be doing a Repair
 install and will see a message like this:<br />
<br />
<i>Setup cannot continue because the version of Windows on your computer is newer than the version on the CD.</i><br />
<br />
The fact is that on the planet called earth most people don't have a matching genuine bootable XP installation CD or they have no genuine bootable XP installation CD at all.&nbsp; All the more reason not to suggest or consider a Repair install.<br />
<br />
Do you have your XP Product Key handy?&nbsp; You are going to need that too.<br />
<br />
Then even if it were to work, you would have to reinstall all your drivers (probably), get back on the Internet and download and reinstall all the perhaps hundreds of Microsoft updates that have come out since you first installed SP3 (definitely) and probably
 reintstall all the third party programs you have installed.&nbsp; You have all that stuff ready, right?<br />
<br />
That all sounds like too much work to me.<br />
<br />
If you want to tell us what the problem is that you think a Repair install will resolve, perhaps you can just fix what you have.<br />
<br />
