    <title>GAMES DON&#39;T WORK EVEN AFTER RESET - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            GAMES DON&#39;T WORK EVEN AFTER RESET</h2>
                    <p>So I've had this computer since December 2016, and I've had steam and other apps before this one. In the past couple months a few of my games stopped working (not even loading, or going to a black screen forcing me to restart the computer). Examples include:
 Left 4 dead 2, Garrys Mod, Call of duty World at War, CSGO, and Overwatch. At first I couldn't find any solutions to my problems, so i hesitantly reset my computer. After a several hours of reinstalling apps, the games work again! I was so happy... then, today
 at 9:48 pm, I feel like playing Overwatch, so I open up the blizzard app and click play, It goes to a black screen and doesn't even load. I checked and I didn't realize it was updating so after it fully updated I restarted my computer and loaded up everything
 and clicked play. Black screen. No game. Restart Computer. I did this a few more times and it still didn't work. So I got skeptical and checked to see if any of the other previously mentioned games worked. Garrys Mod and L4D2 just loaded up their screen for
 a few moments before closing out. SO I AM BACK TO SQUARE ONE, NO GAMES WORK AND I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO RESET MY COMPUTER EVER AGAIN. I NEED ANSWERS, MANY, MANY ANSWERS. Do not give me one or two solutions that could "fix my problem". GIVE ME THE CORRECT ONE...
 I feel like I may need to downgrade to windows 7.</p>

            <p>It may depend on the store which you bought the Xbox One. &nbsp;It's possible that the store has ordered consoles from another region which may cause the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I couldn't find any related notes about KB4073543 either. Let's make sure that we are on the same page. Tell us which version of Windows you are running. Press the<strong> Window key</strong> and type
<strong>winver </strong>then press <strong>Enter</strong>. The KB4056893 seems to be an update for the initial version of Windows 10. If this is what you are running, the update being offered is not applicable to your system because its for a different Windows
 10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>The PC is a new Lenovo Ideapad 320 laptop that I am setting up and downloading all updates found via Automatic Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>winver shows Windows Version 1703 OS Build 15063.786 for a Windows 10 Home OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates were stuck on download of:</p>
<p>1./&nbsp; "Windows 10 Version 1703 x64 based systems KB4073543" with download not showing more than 6% for more than 24 hours.&nbsp; I eventually shutdown the PC and restarted it some 10 hours later when I had some time to try again. &nbsp; My internet connection was working
 as I tested it by searching Microsoft and a few other websites and had responses.&nbsp; Note on the Lenovo this update has gone after 48 hours.</p>
<p>2./&nbsp; Now trying to download update "2018-01 cumulative update for windows 10 version 1703 for x86 based systems KB4056891". This was in Update Centre (searched on KB number) last night before logged this question.&nbsp; The update is presently at 26% and has
 been for 6 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remembered these version numbers (1703) were downloaded for a different PC recently however I could not find the files on the PC after an update for version 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this basis I believe that version 1703 was the previous update before version 1709 where both were on a Windows 10 Home PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please advise of my next actions to get the updates complete as it is also preventing other downloads?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also can I go to the update centre and download the relevant / latest versions for these updates then manually apply them to each of these PCs rather than spending a lot of time for each to automatically get and apply the updates?&nbsp; Is there a particular
 order of applying the updates, in this case should&nbsp;KB4073543 be applied first then the cumulative one KB4056891 (assuming they exist)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Kim Eddy</p>

<p>Got it. If there are no important files on your device yet, then I would suggest to do a clean installation. In this way, the Version 1709 will be installed and you won't have to download the updates individually. Read this

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Have successfully upgraded from&nbsp;<span>Windows Version 1703 OS Build 15063.786 for a Windows 10 Home OS to Version 1709 OS Build 16299.125.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I followed the instructions and created Windows 10 Upgrade / install from a USB memory stick and all worked well although it did take over 4 hours to download, verify &amp; create bootable USB then to install the new version 1709 and configure
 the applications that I wanted to install.&nbsp; Fortunately did not have same problems as many other people (looking at other postings / questions).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happened to missing updates for Version 1703?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Suggestion - can the download / verification, install process and windows "finalising update /configuration" process list the typical steps and estimated / indicative time ranges to complete each step then "tick / mark step complete" so that
 have idea what has been done and what is still outstanding in the process.&nbsp; Plus what input is required from user, eg start download and about 1 hour later reboot PC before starting installation of download so that user knows if can leave PC to do the download
 / installation without their input AND be able to do more useful tasks.</span></p>

<p>It's good to hear that. You do not need to worry about the missing updates in Version 1703. Since you have successfully installed the Fall Creators Update you should start receiving updates to this current version only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your observation/suggestion, it might be a good idea to post this in Feedback Hub. We'll never know, maybe this feature will be included in the future. I think what we have currently is the percentage of which the installation has completed.
 Normally, it shouldn't take you an hour to install an update. It might seem longer because you did a full installation. When you install updates moving forward, it should be pretty quick.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are things that you need to do, you may configure Windows Update to adjust to your work hours. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Change active hours. This will tell Windows that an update cannot be install if you are using the device. You can
 also custom the time and date as to when you would like your computer to restart and install an update. This could be that after downloading the update, it won't restart until the indicated time &amp; date.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encounter the same issue with&nbsp;KB4073543. However, I have too much installed. I run my setup for 3 years now and it would be nerv wrecking to install the whole thing again from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current situation is as follows: OS BUILD: 15063.909</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three KBs and the feature update that won't install properly in the updates list:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB4073543</p>
<p>KB4074592</p>
<p>KB4033631</p>
<p>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is a MSI GS70 Stealth, first generation, Intel inside. 16MB RAM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest doing ? Thx for helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers !</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<p>It still isn't listed in the MS Update Catalogue and I cant do a clean install as suggested below as it is too involved.

            You don't need autorun to work in order to play games.&nbsp; Install the games by running the setup.exe or similar file when you browse the contents of the CD/DVD.

            <p>Did you upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license or was a preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 OEM license?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            <p>Hey HappyWone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error can happen if an essential Windows Service is not running. &nbsp;One of them is the Windows Update service. &nbsp;Any chance you might have disabled that or installed software to manage updates on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, try to do a full restart and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, we have improved the error messages for this in the Creators Update out soon.</p>

            I still receive the same error message with the Creators Update. I also have the Windows Update service running, so I am wondering if there is a more exhaustive list of services that must be running?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows 10 Pro from Bootcamp on a Mac with Parallel Desktop and I have activation problems every single time there is a change in the Virtual machine. This time, I had to re-install the Mac OS because the auto-updater for Microsoft Office 2016 for
 Mac would not work. I wasted over 10 hours on the telephone with 3 different Microsoft tech support and no solution could be found. The only way I was able to get this going properly was to erase my Mac drive, reformat and re-install the Mac OS and all my
 applications. In doing so, I had to re-install Parallel Desktop for Mac and recover my Bootcamp installation of Windows into Parallel Desktop. This, of course, caused the f_ _king activation problem again for both my Windows OS and my Office 2016 Pro for Windows
 Suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a vicious circle that has been going on for years &nbsp;and never properly solved. This is simply shameful from Microsoft. Updating Windows will easily take 2 to 3 hours and multiple restarts whereas updating OS X generally takes an hour or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft are to do like Apple and give away their OS for free, as they did to entice users to update to Windows 10, then give the goddammed thing for free and stop harassing users with these stupid activation issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am simply fed up with this crap from Microsoft.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Accessories has disappeared in my All Programs portion of the Start Menu in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have been looking for a while now and have had no luck trying to figure out how to get the Accessories to come back to my start menu, all the tips and tricks have not helped me fix it. I can find it when I search for Accessories and have been able to
 put a shortcut on my desktop but I can not get it back to where I want it. I have had the computer for two days and it disappeared while installing software, I did a couple of restores, including right back to the start and it will not come back. Just a side
 note I did lose all my Favorites I had added but was able to fix that in the wee hours last night. I have no clue if the two incidents are related. Please HELP!!

            Well I think I have figured it out. I took a closer look at things and I noticed that in the C:/Users/owner file had been changed to a hidden folder (no clue why) but as soon as I made it into a read-only folder it said I needed administrator permission
 (which I am and there are no other user accounts on herer) to change it. Once I clicked the ok button it changed a whole wack of things in a pop-up window. Once it was finished I went back to the start menu and all of the Accessories are back where they belong.
 And as a kicker it also replaced all the favorites back into my IE8. I have no idea what changed the folder to hidden but for now it seems to be repaired. If anyone has any additional information I would still like a better conclusion than a low-tech carpet
 guy stumbling across the repair. LOL.

    <title>OpenGL Version becomes 1.1 after changing to Windows 8.1 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OpenGL Version becomes 1.1 after changing to Windows 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    <p><strong>Yes, I have seen other threads about this problem but their graphic drivers were different.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>System Info:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Processor: Pentinum(R) Dual-Core CPU E5700 @ 3.00 GHz, Penryn, Family6h, Model: 17h,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stepping: ah</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Display Adapter: Intel(R) G41 Express Chipset (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Before the windows 8.1 update, the display adapter was something else,</p>
<p>I think windows 8.1 updated the adapter)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Monitor: &nbsp;Acer G195HQ</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Adapter RAM: 782</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Display: 1366 x 768 x 32 bpp (60 Hz)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OS: Windows 8.1 Pro Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened to me few days ago (isn't fixed yet.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Windows 7 Ultimate, which wasn't activated.</p>
<p>So my dad bought me Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>Installed it, enjoyed it's new features.</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>First, I faced an issue with my screen resolution.</p>
<p>Resolution became <strong>1024 x 768.</strong></p>
<p>It looked ugly, I tried my best fixing stuff,</p>
<p>nothing happened, eventually, I switched the PC off, then switched it on again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;New Updates popped out and I installed them,</p>
<p>Then my resolution was fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a person who likes working on 3D objects, with the help of an application called ''Blender''</p>
<p>I've asked the community in blender to help me with this problem, they said go ask Microsoft forums to help you,</p>
<p>it's something with the PC and not with the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I was using Windows 7, the application was fine,</p>
<p>&nbsp;no problems at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, I re-installed the object since my PC got formatted (due to windows 8.1 upgrade) and some apps were lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the application, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'<strong>'Your system does not use a 3D hardware acceleration. Blender requires a graphics driver with OpenGL 2.1 support.''</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This may be caused by:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>* A missing or faulty graphics driver installation. Blender needs a graphics card driver to work correctly.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and other 2 objects which weren't much obvious ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Youtube for help but no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OpenGL's version became 1.1 after the changing the OS.</p>
<p>Back then, it was something higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My favorite hobby was playing with Blender,</p>
<p>
</p><p>now I think I might have to change back into Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you respond soon! :)</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're using the classic Skype version and the same device and you set your history to forever, your conversation is stored on your local device and it should sync on your account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure you sign in using the correct account with your email address, phone number, or Skype account information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, if you made any changes on your Skype folder even if you set your history setting to forever all your old conversation will be deleted and it will only capture the most recent conversations.

    <title>Gears Of War 2 Game Data And Online Rank Deleted. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> x vicious babe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears Of War 2 Game Data And Online Rank Deleted.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have sent emails and messages to Epic games and Microsoft and they have told me that I must come here to get my problem resolved.<br />
<br />
Basically they told me that I "may" have breached the terms of use. However I don't know how I could have done that.<br />
<br />
If someone could please help me get some facts about how it happened and how it can be fixed it will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
I believe I have done nothing to delete both my campaign data, my Seriously 2.0 and my online Rank. I have been working so hard to get these achievements, I only have 2 left, and I need 1 (Veteran Gear) for Gears of War 3.<br />
<br />
What happened Prior to the deletion was:<br />
<br />
July 4th event. Grind Experience from level 52 to level 70.<br />
<br />
Turned off the Xbox.<br />
<br />
Next day checked to see if the event was still on, played a match of Horde, the event was over, I then quit the game and exited to the Dashboard.<br />
<br />
Everything was fine until yesterday when I put the disc in and I went on horde and everything was deleted.<br />
<br />
There was no updated inbetween of any sort. This has happened to me before. About a year ago my Game data was deleted due to a title update. That hasn't happened this so I am wondering why this has happened.<br />
<br />
I don't really care about my save game but if it were at all possible to get both seriously 2.0 and my level 70 rank that would be great. My rank is the only thing of real importance here. I doubt this but if you could also get my save game data back thank
 you.<br />
<br />
If you need any more information from me please let me know.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sincerely yours,<br />
<br />
Kristy.</p>

<p>To be clear, Babe, is your saved data for that game currently missing as well? You can find out by accessing your memory device under 'System Settings,' and checking that specific game folder. If it is missing, I'm afraid that would explain where your rank
 and progress got off to, as those items are stored in memory, rather than online. What kind of memory device are you using currently?</p>

<p>All of my game saves are gone, and basically everything that is connected to it like how many units I have killed in total. When they told me about violating the Terms of Use I think they just meant it was the only logical explanation as to why this has
 happened. Although I don't hack, let alone, know how to.</p>

<p>Okay. At this point, it doesn't seem to be a memory issue (as the other associated data is still present), nor does it appear to be a ToU issue, as you haven't broken any of the game's rules. I know Epic directed you to these forums, but as the issue is
 specific to that game only, I'm afraid they're the only team that will be able to provide more info.</p>

 I GO ONTO MY MAC IT IS FINE. SORRY CAPS LOCK CAME ON, ISNT ME SHOUTING, (YET)! ALTHOUGH I FEEL LIKE IT, AS THIS IS TAKEN UP ALL MY TIME. IF I CANT GET A RESOLVED MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK TO WINDOWS 7, AS WINDOWS 10 HAS A PROBLEN WITH IPHONE. OT RECOGNISES IT,
 BUT WILL NOT COMPLETE THE DRIVER.</p>
<p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might try disabling your security software temporarily to see if it's causing a conflict with the iPhone driver and check if it works.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Please make sure that you enable the security software after downloading the driver to avoid system threats.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try to Install the iPhone drivers in <strong>Compatibility Mode</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Download the driver from the <strong>manufacturer’s website.</strong></div>
<div>b. Right-click on the <strong>driver setup file </strong>and click on ‘<strong>properties’</strong>.</div>
<div>c. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility’ </strong>tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for’
</strong>and select <strong>Windows operating system </strong>from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done,
<strong>restart </strong>the computer and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Run Windows Update and download the latest driver:</strong></div>

<h3> karl1950  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;You have files waiting to be written to the CD&#34; message</h2>
                    <p>Hello: I recently backed up my Windows fonts file to a CD. The files copied to the CD perfectly. However, now when I insert a new CD into the drive,</p>
<p>I get the little file pic with an arrow and the message stating: "You have files waiting to be written to the CD"&nbsp; The files were already written to the CD!</p>
<p>When I select "Delete temporary files" at the left, I get an error message which says "Cannot delete arialbd.ttf. Access is denied. Make sure the disk is not full or write protected and that the file is not currently in use." I also can not drag the file
 to the recycle bin, as I get the same message. What is going on here?</p>
<p>Does this temporary file have a name? Where is it? How come it won't delete, as per the Windows help file? Unchecking the "Enable CD recording on this drive" under properties does not help either. Any ideas on this?
</p>

</span>
<p><span>A character encoding system consists of a code that pairs each character from a given repertoire with something else, such as a sequence of
 natural numbers, octets or electrical pulses, in order to facilitate the transmission of data (generally numbers and/or text) through telecommunication networks or storage of text in computers.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Laufwerk klackert - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drizzt1987  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Laufwerk klackert</h2>
                    
<p>Mal eine Frage...Ich hatte letztens Splatterhouse installiert und da gabs am Anfang für 30-40Sekunden beim Installieren extrem komische Geräusche. Dann ging es und ich konnte das Spiel normal installieren. Ich war nicht der einzige, der das hatte. Von daher
 gehe ich davon aus, dass das ein Fehler bei der Produktion ist. Aber seit dem Zeitpunkt habe ich das Gefühl, dass was mit dem Laufwerk nicht stimmt. Wenn man auf dem Dashboard ist und eine Disc im Laufwerk hat, klackert das Laufwerk. Daher meine Frage, ob
 es mir vorher einfach nicht aufgefallen ist oder ob das bei euch auch so ist. Die Disc dreht ja da, glaube ich, mit minimaler Drehzahl, aber das Geräusch ist mir bisher nicht aufgefallen. Im Spiel dreht die Disc ja nicht mehr (beim installierten Spiel) und
 da geht es ja dann auch. Von daher bin ich mir sicher, dass es das Laufwerk ist.</p>

<p>also es ist das laufwerk. wenn ich die lade öffne, hört es direkt auf. oder wenn ich die lade ohne disc schließe. disc drin-&gt; geräusch. vielleicht täusche ich mich ja, aber normalerweise ist das geräusch nicht da, oder? der support will die xbox "reinholen".
 das ist meine neuste...die lief vielleicht 60 stunden seit oktober. und auf den refurbished mist habe ich keine lust. habe mich dazu mal durch mehrere foren gelesen und das spricht nicht für die refurbished boxen. wenn 3 austauschkonsolen in folge kaputt ankommen
 etc...von daher hätte ich einfach eine LW-Reparatur, einen LW-Tausch oder einen Tausch gegen eine neue Konsole.</p>
<p>wie ist das denn mit dem verpackungsmaterial? in manchen foren stand drin, dass man sich verpackungsmaterial zuschicken lassen kann. die beiträge sind von 2009. von daher: ist das noch so? ich habe zwar ein wenig material hier. aber ich möchte sie dann schon
 korrekt verpacken.</p>

<p>Hab immer ne ziemlich große Kiste genommen und um die Xbox herum mit zusammen geknüllten Zeitungspapier ausgefüllt.</p>
<p>Wirkt fast genauso wie diese Luftpolsterfolie und düfte damit sogar einen Sturz aus 1,50m Höhe unbeschadet überstehen^^</p>
<p>Ob das mit dem Verpackungsmaterial noch zutrifft weiß ich nicht. </p>

            <p>Hi Faisy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. It's unfortunate that un-install the existing mouse drivers from Device manager didn't help to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to&nbsp;go to Program and Features under installed programs and check if there is any software related to IntelliPoint or any application software related to mouse in installed. If so, please go ahead and un-install them and then try to install
 the IntelliPoint 8.2 driver software in compatibility mode as suggested in my earlier post dated
<strong>December 22, 2014</strong>. Refer to the following link on how to un-install program:</p>

            <p>Hi K Johnston, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the issue description, I understand that you are having issues with setting up 5.1 surround speakers. Let me know if this is not the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Have you tried setting up your surround speakers through speaker configuration window?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> If not, I would suggest you to follow the steps to set up your speakers and check whether you are able to select the surround speakers option in speaker configuration window.</div>
<div><strong>Set up your speakers</strong></div>
<div>To set up your speakers for the best sound, follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
a) Open Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Sound.</div>
<div>b) Click the Playback tab, select Speakers, and then click Configure.</div>
<div>c) Under Audio Channels, select which speakers are present in your speaker configuration, and then click Test. You should hear a tone play in each speaker. Click Next, and then follow the directions to continue the configuration process.<br />
<div>For reference: <strong>(Applicable to Windows 7) <br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Get-high-definition-sound-and-music-from-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Get-high-definition-sound-and-music-from-your-computer</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>If you havent got any option to select the surround speakers option in speaker configuration window, then it seems you do not have the compatible drivers for the surround speakers to configure on Windows 7 computer. So, I would
 suggest you to contact the manufacturer to get the compatible drivers for the surround speakers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope it helps. If you have any issues in future please let us know. We will be happy to help you.</div>

If you need more help, please post back with more information about what exactly the computer is doing when the blue screen happens - is it playing a game, or online, or running an application, or sitting idle, or booting up, etc.&nbsp; What is the brand and model
 of the computer and the version of Vista you have.&nbsp; When did the problem start and have any changes been made to the hardware or software recently.<br />

<p>I've been struggling to get Skype for Business- Mac to update my status based on my Outlook calendar. &nbsp;It will not show that I'm "In a Meeting." &nbsp;My company uses Skype for Business Online and Exchange Online. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reinstalling both. &nbsp;I'm using the same credentials on both. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Anthony Hunnicutt,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to reconfirm the situation, by saying “Statues does not update based on the Outlook calendar”, do you mean the status based on calendar free/busy information?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If so, this feature is not available in Skype for Business on Mac.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox needs hard reset every time i turn it on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox needs hard reset every time i turn it on</h2>
                    every time I turn my Xbox&nbsp;1s on I need to do a hard reset (hold the power button down then unplug from the wall) in order to do anything on it... the controller still connects etc but nothing on my Xbox loads, doesn't update my online friend's list etc.
 Is this a hardware issue or just something wrong in settings etc?
