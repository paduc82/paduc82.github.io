<p>Hello Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be solved. My friends skyped me tonight and all is well.</p>
<p>It seems they are using an iPad and they updated a few other things on there.</p>
<p>Whatever it was it has resolved the issue.</p>
<p>Many thanks for taking an interest in trying to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Microsoft you suck</h2>
                    <p>Today windows 8.1 came out and I have been trying to download it for the past 8 hours. However, since windows 8.0 is such a ball of turd, none of the metro apps connect to the internet, INCLUDING THE STORE. Funny though, I'm able to connect just fine though
 explorer and firefox on the desktop with no problem at all. I searched the internet for solutions all day. It seems I'm not the only one with this problem. It's been happening to quite a few people and it's been going on since windows 8 launched. Unfortunately,
 no one has found a solution yet. I was hoping 8.1 would fix this issue, but I cant even download it because it's located in the store that&nbsp;I don't have access to.&nbsp;How about making&nbsp;a manual download?&nbsp;I was even desperate enough to call tech support, which was
 a complete waist of 2 hours because they&nbsp;knew nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your product it garbage. Your support is garbage. I will never buy another Microsoft product again. You ****!</p>

            Forgive me ,but a small correction - - MS SUCKS......... <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>BIG TIME</strong></span> !!! The powers that be are <strong>ONLY </strong>
interested in their fat annual bonuses. Example - today I bought 365 Personal and........its ALL IN SPANISH!!!&nbsp; My mother tongue is English, but because I live in Spain the 'baboons' who run MS make Spanish the default with
<strong>NO OPTION</strong> of installing 365 in English, (methinks those halfwits couldn't even organise a drunken orgy in a brewery/destillery). After 34 minutes+ on the 'phone with a most charming AND patient lady in Manila I was left with no other alternative
 but to ask for a REFUND and I am out of '365 Personal'. Suppose I'm lucky that I don't live in Mongolia and didn't get 365 in Mongolian !!! Ref. the so called execs at MS - "<em>PRIDE ALWAYS COMES BEFORE A FALL"
</em>(<em><strong>nota bene</strong></em> -usually from a great height onto <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>VERY </strong></span>hard, sharp rocks).<br />

            As far as I know there is not much you can do.  That location appears to be based on your assigned IP address. If the wrong geographic location information is stored for your IP you are out of luck. 
<br />
<br />At one time my location was reporting about 2000 miles out, across an international border (put me in the wrong country).  When I did some checking, only one of the registrars had the wrong info, others were OK.  If you want to check for yourself, Google "WhoIS" and try several of the services to see what they say about your location. Most will probably be correct.

                    Theres this clan called MEA(Murderin Evolution Army).For a while they have been doing lots of things against the code of conduct but from what I see nothing has been done about them.I have a few pictures of Xbox live profiles who are known for such things
 as well as pursuading bios that tell members to hack/ do whatever to bring other clans down.Im wanting to know if something can be done about them.

    <title>Code 39 on CD&#47;DVD drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaiboec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Code 39 on CD&#47;DVD drives</h2>
                    When I attempted to install the 2012 Norton Security on my PC (running Vista) and on my laptop (running Windows 7), I got a message saying the process could not continue because the CD was removed or disconnected.&nbsp; I now find that I have a Code 39 on my
 CD drices on both computers.&nbsp; I have had no difficulties prior to this.&nbsp; I have gotten the programs installed with the assistance of Norton Support but the CD/DVD drives are still inoperable.&nbsp; I understand from some internet searches that the problem could
 be in the Registry because updating has no effect, nor does uninstalling.&nbsp; Odd that it happened on both computers at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone help me out with this?

<p>Hi,<br />

Code 39 means the driver is corrupt or missing.<br />
<br />
Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total process which solves
<br />
the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also check with your System Maker to see if there are updated drivers for your DVD. Or even if there<br />
are old ones you can reinstall. Many use the Windows Default drivers however a few will have special<br />
ones. Also check the drive maker's site.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Many thanks for your help.&nbsp; #314060 worked on the Vista.&nbsp; But the Trouble shooting for the Windows 7 did not.&nbsp; Kept looking and finally deleted the Upper and Lower Filters from the registry.&nbsp; All is fine now and the CD/DVD drive works as it should on both.

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also check with your System Maker to see if there are updated drivers for your DVD. Or even if there<br />
are old ones you can reinstall. Many use the Windows Default drivers however a few will have special<br />
ones. Also check the drive maker's site.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            I'm pretty sure it has to do with how Microsoft updated their privacy policy and they're now collecting personal information. Since it is illegal to use a program to collect the personal information of minors, I believe it will be disabled until you are
 18. And even then, I wouldn't use it if I were you.<br />

    <title>Civilization 6 CPU Priority - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_984  say:</h3>
<h2>            Civilization 6 CPU Priority</h2>
                    Why does Windows 10 constantly set Civilization 6 at below normal priority?&nbsp; This game NEEDS normal to above average priority on at least 2 cores to run properly.<br />
Every time I set it to above normal priority on 4 of my 8 cores it runs great for a minute or so then chugs to a halt as Windows has forced it back down to below normal priority.

<p>What brand and model cpu graphics processor are you using, and where are you forcing how many cores are used ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games will normally use as many available cores as they are coded to use without any user input.
</p>
<p>There are a few games that were coded for dual core that need fixes to the game configuration files when running more than</p>
<p>dual core cpu's as well (eg- Fallout 3) or they will crash, but most don't need extra cores to be forced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You use the term Priority, but this is more commonly used for the option in <em>
TaskManager&gt;Processes</em> to force Windows to direct more system resources on the process in question, and does not directly affect the number of cores used by that process.
</p>
<p>- Selecting the number of cores (processors) in <em>msconfig</em> is not recommended for general use. This option is intended for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, if you want to force a game to use four rather than one or two cores it's best done in the games .cfg or .ini files.</p>
<p>If you are forcing four cores here (from what I see Civ6 benefits from 4 cores but no improvement with 8), you may need to change</p>
<p>the file to <em>Read Only</em> to prevent the game from changing it back to the default, which commonly happens as the game is loading,</p>
<p>or shortly thereafter with games that don't normally make an allowance for modified configuration files.</p>

    <title>problem with uninstalling a program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#126;inthebox  say:</h3>
<h2>            problem with uninstalling a program</h2>
                    <p>I went to Programs and Features and right clicked on a program in order to uninstall it, but while it was uninstalling my computer froze(well, not really freeze, because I could only move my mouse). After 15 minutes, I shut down the computer completely,
 and went back to uninstall the program. It was no longer listed in Programs and Features, but it wasn't uninstalled. I have no idea how to uninstall it now since it's not listed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have another problem where a program that is technically uninstalled and removed from the computer is still listed on Programs and Features. I installed something called "Timberman" when I was fiddling around with Firefox Marketplace. I deleted Timberman
 instead of uninstalling it and now when I try uninstalling it from Programs and Features, nothing happens and it has stayed there ever since.</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for late response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to place the computer in clean boot state and then uninstall the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Place the computer in clean boot state</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Run System File Checker tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, type <span>Command Prompt</span> or <span>
cmd</span> in the <strong>Search</strong> box, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><div><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></div>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>I was having the same problem. When you connect your Idea 3G net setter, does your widows shows the icon which represent some USB device has been connected. Usually this icon is right side bottom of the screen. If it does show, then please you just need
 to turn off your Airplane mode. After that click on the wi-fi range which is on right side bottom of the screen. When blue widow will open on right side, there you will see the idea cellular broadband is been connected. For latest drivers, go following URL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am again repeating the steps in details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Turn Off Airplane mode of your machine</p>
<p>2) Connect you idea modem</p>
<p>3) Click on wi-fi range, which is located right side bottom of your screen</p>
<p>4) You will see there that, Idea cellular modem is been connected.</p>

</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Hi Samarjeet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your widows update are on automatic mode, I mean ON, then would need to update your idea modem's driver frequently. Try to put your widows updates turned off or update it rarely.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I've read its a video card issue with Nvidea, or one of the programs that run with it. then i read its a memory issue, and the list goes on....</p>
<p>Throughout fighting this, I've reinstalled windows, and all the drivers for my video, MB, and then changed to a different make of video card after uninstalling the old cards drivers. Installed the new drivers and between every step I've mentioned, it has
 crash which prompted the next thing. I'm out of ideas. I have my DMP file and my system file on onedrive, but since its my first time posting, i wasnt sure if i was supposed to post them here or not. &nbsp; Im tired of guessing what it is, so id appreciate any
 help!</p>

            My Question still stands.. I have a meter so i know the temp of my cpu, gpu, and fan speeds for both. they are all ok. So i uninstalled graphics driver and reinstalled straight from the site. I have even changed vid cards 3 times, every time uninstalling
 the old before shutting down to change the hardware, then once rebooted back up, reinstalled the new drivers and im still having the crash issue. The info I posted is prolly old, and i will redo all the info if i can find someone willing to help me figure
 this out. I have questions like, will a bad memory stick do this? And Ive also noticed it does it mostly(if not only) when im online doing games that run flash. I can watch dvds on here and play all my installed games like Diablo and even the old Neverwinter
 nights, and it doesnt crash..ive ran the stress test that i was asked with no problems &nbsp;so i dont know what else to do. ive done all the help that is in that link to no avail.

<h2>            Questions about how Skype Numbers work.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask 4 questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If I take a skype number (e.g. for UK) while I live in France, is it possible to keep my french number as well? Will my french friends be able to call me in my old number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If they have to call me in my new number &nbsp;(Skype number) will they have to pay extra?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If I have to use exclusively my Skype number, how much it will cost me to call to UK and how much to France?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Do I need to buy a new mobile to get a skype number? Are all mobile devices appropriate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank in advance,</p>
<p>Rose</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/230da49d-29ad-4bfa-b944-81f1c2128d2d" title="rose &amp;">
<p>
</p><p>Good day and welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will answer your queries about the use of <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i-get-a-skype-number?q=skype+number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype Number</a>&nbsp;according to its order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you have an existing Skype Number on your account, you can still add more to it. You can have up to 10 Skype Numbers attached to your account&nbsp;– perfect if you frequently receive calls from more than one location. You can choose a different Skype Number
 for each country or area code you regularly expect calls from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Your Skype Number has both an international and area code, so when you call one from a mobile or landline,
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA247/how-much-will-it-cost-my-friends-to-call-my-skype-number?q=skype+number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
local and long distance charges apply</a>. However, what’s great about a Skype Number is that you can choose both the country and the area code. This lets your friends from that area call you on your Skype Number at a local rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Skype Number is designed to receive calls and not to make outgoing calls. For you to make a call to phone numbers&nbsp;using Skype, you need to have a calling
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10414/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
subscription</a>&nbsp;that covers the country you want to call to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Skype Number is saved on your account. So, no matter what device you are logged on to, as long as that device meets our
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=supported+devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
minimum&nbsp;system requirements</a>&nbsp;and it has Skype installed in it, you can use it.
</p>

<p>Hello Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the first two questions, what if my french number is not a skype one? Could I keep it and take a skype number for britain &nbsp;too? Is it possible for my french friends to call me in my old one (not skype number) and british friends to the skype one?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/230da49d-29ad-4bfa-b944-81f1c2128d2d" title="rose &amp;">
<p>
</p><p>If your number is not a Skype Number, you can still keep and use it. However, the charges that your callers will incur will be based on the international calling rates of your telecommunications service provider.
</p>
<p>We do not have a way to port&nbsp;your&nbsp;existing phone&nbsp;number into Skype, meaning it cannot be used as your Skype Number. You can only choose a Skype Number from our pre-selected&nbsp;range. In addition, you can buy&nbsp;up to 10&nbsp;Skype Numbers&nbsp;for any country listed on
 this <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA269/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you will be&nbsp;answering the calls&nbsp;using the Skype application, there will be no more extra costs since you already paid for the Skype Number itself.
</p>
<p>But if you want the calls to be picked up on a mobile or landline, you need to set up
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12258/how-do-i-use-skype-call-forwarding?q=call+forwarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Call Forwarding</a>. To forward your incoming calls to a mobile or landline, you’ll need a little
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/store.buy.skypecredit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Skype Credit</span></a> or a calling

If you use Skype Credit, forwarded calls are charged at Skype’s low per-minute rates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Receiving SMS is not a function of the Skype application. And Skype Number's function is only for receiving calls, it doesn't have the ability to make outgoing calls, send text messages and receive text messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>

    <title>No security tab, cannot delete folders of photos off of phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms.ronzio  say:</h3>
<h2>            No security tab, cannot delete folders of photos off of phone</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Windows 10 user here, I'm trying to delete folders of photos on my iphone because I really do not want to manually delete 15,000 photos and 2,000 videos. When I try to do so in Windows file explorer of the phone, I get a message "IMG_xxxx could not
 be deleted. You do not have access to this item." I attempted to locate the security tab in properties, there is none. In my registry I have everything up to and including the Policies folder, but there is no Explorer folder. Upon trying to create the folder,
 no solution was applied. I even restarted the pc entirely. When I try to run the command in cmd prompt, I simply get "ERROR: Access is denied". I'm the administrator of my pc, but when I navigate to advanced security options in security under cmd properties,
 it shows TrustedInstaller has full control and I do not. I can't even locate my user profile. I'm not very good at this stuff, so I'm coming here for help before I break something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I did this correctly, thanks for any insight you can provide!</p>

<h2>            Moving Google Chrome screen vack to center of screen</h2>
                    My Google Chrome page has moved to the right of my screen so that I cannot access controls on the right side of the page . I run Windows 10, edition 1803. What is the simplest way for an amateur like me to get the page back to the center of the screen?
 &nbsp; Thanks!

<p>Hello Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're using Google Chrome browser and the window is off center of your monitor screen, right? To get it back to the center, I recommend to do the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the browser.</li><li>Press&nbsp;<strong>Alt + Spacebar</strong>&nbsp;keys together, then select&nbsp;<strong>Move</strong>&nbsp;from the menu that appears.</li><li>Now tap the&nbsp;<strong>left/right</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>up/down</strong>&nbsp;arrow keys to move the browser to whichever position you like.</li><li>When you have positioned the browser where you want it, close the browser. This allows it to set its current position, so it opens there the next time you use it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get
 notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>LiaRomo,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forums!</span></p>
<p><span>Does this happen with all the applications that you use or just word?</span></p>
<p><span>Sounds like you have selected
<strong>key board input layout and language settings</strong> as Spanish during the factory restore.</span></p>
<p><span>To add the United States-International keyboard layout, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>Windows 7 or Windows Vista</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start,</strong> type <strong>intl.cpl</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong>Keyboards and Language</strong> tab, click <strong>Change keyboards</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Add</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand the language that you want. For example,
<strong>English (United States)</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand
<strong>Keyboard</strong> list, select the <strong>United States-International</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Default input language</strong> list, click <strong><em>Language name</em> - United States-International</strong> (where
<em>Language name</em> is the language that you selected in step 4), and then click
<strong>OK</strong> two times. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Regional and Language Options</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong>.
<br />
<br />
Notice that the <strong>Language</strong> bar appears on the taskbar. When you position the mouse pointer over it, a ToolTip appears that describes the active keyboard layout.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Language</strong> bar, and then click <strong>United States-International</strong> on the shortcut menu that appears.<br />

    <title>Service Pack-2 update fails to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fermion52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Service Pack-2 update fails to install</h2>
                    <p>I have a two year old HP desktop which runs Windows Vista 32-bit OEM.&nbsp; In the past two years I have updated the OS with Microsoft updates regularly, except one: Service Pack-2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must have tried to update with the Service Pack-2 about half a dozen times,
 and it failed every time in the same manner.&nbsp; The last futile attempt was today, and then I decided to seek help.&nbsp; The strange thing is that the Service pack update proceeds normally, and it succeeds.&nbsp; Then it asks for a reboot, and I reboot the machine.&nbsp;
 After the reboot, and after about 10 minutes, I reach the Windows update screen which says:</p>
<p>"Installing Service Pack: Stage 3 of 3 - 100% complete.&nbsp; Do not turn off your computer."<br />
<br />
I expect that would be end of update, but then I get a new screen about a minute later:<br />
"Service pack did not install.&nbsp; Reverting changes.&nbsp; Do not turn off your computer."</p>
<p>After I get the 100% complete message, the upgrade must be doing one last thing which fails.&nbsp; Does anyone know what that might be?&nbsp; Can I do anything about it?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
to see the cause of failures with Windows Vista or Windows 7 updates, we must look for error messages in the file CBS.log.<br />
<br />
Please run the Windows Explorer and go to the folder "C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\" and copy the file "CBS.log" to your document folder (otherwise you can't upload it) and upload the complete CBS.log to your SkyDrive [1] and post a link here.<br />
<br />

<p>I looked at the CBS log file before uploading it.&nbsp; It does not appear to be informative at my limited level of understanding.&nbsp; I could not find the strings "fail" or "revert" in it.&nbsp; It must be more subtle than that.&nbsp; If you can get any useful information

<p>Hi sinan,</p>
<p>some files are damaged.<br />
<br />
Please start the <strong>command prompt</strong> (cmd.exe) with <strong>admin rights</strong> [1] and run sfc [2]:<br />
<br />
<strong>sfc.exe /scannow</strong> <br />
<br />
Is it able to find and repair broken files? If all files are repaired, install Sp2 again.<br />
<br />
best regards<br />

<p>Thank you for your reply. I executed sfc as you suggested.&nbsp; And you were right.&nbsp; It finished with the message: "Windows source protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; Details are included in the CBS.log...."&nbsp; I checked the log
 file and the problem file seems to be settings.ini in Windows Sidebar.&nbsp; This file was last modifed by 10/23/2009.&nbsp; I don't even use the sidebar.&nbsp; It never appears on my desktop when I boot up.</p>
<p>I uploaded a new file called clips_from_CBSlog.txt to the skydrive, basically cutting and pasting a few lines where the error is described.&nbsp; sfc attempted to fix this file twice, and it failed both times.&nbsp; It amazes me that a simple innocent text file could
 cause this problem (if it is indeed the cause.)&nbsp; My current Vista seems to function perfectly well with the corrupted file, but SP2 fails to install.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, I am able to install all updates without a problem, except SP2.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping.</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same problem - and have what sounds like the same HP model computer. But, ever since I originally skipped the service pack, my computer has been repeatedly blue screening, and i think it's probably related..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do come up with a solution to this problem, I would very VERY much appreciate you posting it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error after installing Service Pack 1 for Windows 7</h2>
                    I am receiving this error message after installing Service Pack 1 in Windows 7: "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item." This message is appearing every time when I wanna

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span>It seems to be a permission issue. </span><span><span>You may take the ownership of the drive where the data is saved and use the steps to grant permission to everyone. You can login as an administrator and make the required changes.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><b><span>Before taking ownership I would suggest you to create a new restore point so that the system may be reverted back in case of any loss of data or irregular behavior.
</span></b></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><b><span>Follow the steps in the below link to create a restore point -</span></b></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time.
 You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the problem. To restore back you need to have a restore point available so I would suggest you to create a new restore point before taking ownership of the folder.
 Refer to the below link to create a restore point manually –<br />

            <p>Hi Delvin</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I have literally just finished re-installing Windows 10 and getting my e-mail and internet up and running. This has sorted the problem. The problem started though when I installed Windows 10 Anniversary update. Doing a scan using sfc
 /scannow seemed a likely fix from forums but this did not cure the problem.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Mike.</p>
