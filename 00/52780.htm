<p>Windows live mail has been dead for quite awhile. The program will not connect to send and receive any messages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to use Outlook mail&nbsp;on MSN.com website. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f80dd728-1c03-40aa-8ef4-48ac622df911?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f80dd728-1c03-40aa-8ef4-48ac622df911?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get to your outlook webpage, you can save the link in favorites on your fav tool bar on your browser for easy access to your email. Useful if you do not use MSN as your browser Home Page. I use MSN but also have a quick link to my email as shown
 in photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or on Windows 10, you can use Windows Mail App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set Up email and personal settings and that's all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you log on to your Windows account/desktop with your Microsoft account (email and password), then you will not have to log on to outlook on your browser more than once after you initially log on a select to remember your user and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to: Start Menu</p>
<p>When you see the list on left side Click on your user account Icon/Your Name</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/087f3b84-42c1-4c8f-9998-039cd757ab6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/087f3b84-42c1-4c8f-9998-039cd757ab6f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Select change account settings.</p>
<p>Select sign in with&nbsp;Microsoft account</p>
<p>enter your current Microsoft account email user (@msn, @live, @outlook, @Hotmail)&nbsp;and&nbsp;password and click on next and complete process.
</p>
<p>**BE SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOUR LOCAL USER ACCOUNT NAME AND LOCAL USER ACCOUNT PASSWORD for future if you shall switch back to Local Account.**</p>
<p>
</p><p>LOCAL and MICROSOFT ACCOUNT are different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then restart PC, Log on and go to outlook on your default browser you use. Sign in and then you should not have to&nbsp;sign in again to send and receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any other help just ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Some people claim there is a download for WLM or Windows 7 Essentials&nbsp;that works even in Windows 10. I am not too sure of that as Microsoft itself said long ago they discontinued WLM and mine stopped working as I used it for years.

<p>
</p><p>I do not doubt you about it may work again. All I know is I had Windows 7 and then 10, and not sure if it was before I installed 10 or not, but Windows Live mail stopped working and syncing email with no in our out messages working anymore. My other PC's
 with 7 and 10 also stopped working. Others I know the same thing.</p>
<p>I also got emails from Microsoft prior to it stopping working notifying me of the date it will no longer work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I believe 2+ years now, they&nbsp;must have changed something in a newer version&nbsp;for it to work again. I just use Windows Mail 10&nbsp;or Outlook on Web. The problem is, eventually it is going to be a target for intrusions with no more support for the
 program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably could have used a different server&nbsp;settings in WLM and got it to work but Windows 10 Mail is fine and using web is fine too.</p>

<p>I do have to point out some false statements you made. I have "NO" ads in my outlook email on web in browser or in the Windows 10 Mail app "WHATSOEVER" And I have not paid for a premium account either. Just the free account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have never had an issue sending or receiving emails from every other type of email accounts such as aim, gmail or any other email server with Outlook Web or Windows mail App and a Microsoft email account, nor does anyone else I know, and that is many
 people. I also have not seen too many posts about this so called issue, but a few that usually have a system issue causing the issue at hand.</p>

            Hi sydnight 
<br />
<br />It depends on the hardware you have!
<br />
<br />What is the exact Model No. of your HP Laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . .

            Hi Sydnight, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />You would need to provide the model number of your HP Laptop for me to know what type of SD card you can use.
<br />
<br />It would either be microSD or full-size SD, but microSD card come with an adapter for full-size usually anyway.
<br />
<br />The formats can vary too, either SD, SDHC or SDXC. I'll be able to let you know what format to use once you've provided your laptop model details.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to helping you further!

<h2>            Help - This PC can&#39;t run Windows 10 - We couldn&#8217;t update system reserved partition</h2>
                    Running Windows 10 Pro and been prompted to update my copy of Windows 10, but every time I try i get the same error 'We couldn’t update system reserved partition.'<br />
<br />
I get the error code 0xc1900201.<br />
<br />
My partions look like the below, could it be because the System Reserved partion isnt on a drive with Windows?<br />
<br />

            Hi Mitch
<br />
<br />This is a well known error in Windows Update, the solution is posted by Microsoft on the page below, the heading you need is 'Windows 10 with MBR partition'
<br />
<br />It is a bit involved, and indeed you may think when looking at that initially, you would need a degree in Computer Science, just take that one step at a time . .

            Hi Mitch, your drive already has the drive letter F, so, you need to click change drive letter rather than add drive letter . . .

            Hi Louis,<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you followed the instructions on how to create the installation media and on how to use it from
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>?<br />
<br />
If not, you may follow the steps from there to make sure that you got the correct installation media and steps to take.<br />
<br />
If this is the same thing you followed, have you tried saving the installation media on a CD instead to see if the same error will occur?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

    <title>I want to remove duplicate media files, but am having problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r0bperry  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to remove duplicate media files, but am having problems selecting more than a single file in media player at time.</h2>
                    I want to remove duplicate media files, but am having problems selecting more than a single file in media player at time. How can I select multiple files at once so I can just delete them. I used to be able to do this in previous versions of Media Player
 but this function now seems blocked or unavailable. The problem is this: Through previous uses of media player it duplicated all my media files several times whenever a media device was added. It would try and save the files on my main drive but since there
 was not enough room it would save teh files elsewhere.This happened several times I guess, because when I upgraded my computer and a media scan was conducted it found duplicates of all my media at least 6-8 different times. I have since consolidated my media
 onto 3 multi TB &nbsp;drives, but now have several hundred duplicate folders and several thousand duplicate media files. Previous versions of Media Player would allow me to select all the files then delete them both from the play

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>1. Have you made any recent changes on the computer?<br />
<br />
2. Is Windows media player creating duplicate files when playing the music files?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To clear the duplicate entries, click another feature tab in the Player (such as Now Playing), and then click
<strong>Library.<br />
</strong><br />
If this doesn't clear the duplicate entries from your library, you can use the <strong>
Add to Library </strong>by Searching Computer dialog box to<strong> scan a folder
</strong>on your computer that the invalid duplicate entries point to. The Player will remove the invalid entries in your library that point to files that no longer exist in the folder.</p>
<p>Do the above step for the files that are stored in Hard drives. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>To use the Add to Library by Searching Computer dialog box<br />
</p>
<p><br />
a) Start <strong>Windows Media Player.<br />
</strong><br />
b) Press <strong>F3</strong> on your keyboard to open the <strong>Add to Library </strong>
by Searching Computer dialog box.<br />
<br />
c) Click the <strong>Browse </strong>button to locate the folder on your computer for which your library contains invalid entries. Specify the folder location in the Look in box.<br />
<br />
If you are not sure which duplicate entry in your library is invalid, you can add a<strong> File Path
</strong>column to your library display. <strong>Specify the folder </strong>on your computer that matches the invalid file path displayed in your
<strong>library.<br />
</strong><br />
d) Click the <strong>Search </strong>button.<br />
<br />
The Player will search for digital media files and playlists in the folder that you specify and will remove the invalid entries in your library that point to files that no longer exist in the folder. If invalid duplicate entries point to other folders on your
 computer, repeat this procedure, specifying a different folder each time.<br />
<br />
If only a small number of duplicate entries exist, you can delete the invalid ones manually by right-clicking the invalid entry, and then clicking<strong> Delete.<br />
</strong><br />
For large number of duplicate entries in your library (or if your entire library is duplicated), it might be best to create a new library and delete the files.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After deleting the duplicate entries, run the <strong>Windows media&nbsp;library</strong> settings&nbsp;troubleshooter&nbsp;to resolve this problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open the Windows Media Library troubleshooter</strong></p>

<h2>            Constant BSOD Video TDR Failure nvlddmkm.sys</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I launch a game on Steam I simply crash with a BSOD, I've posted a link to four separate mini-dump files made on the same day. I'm using a GT 745m, it has had problems before, but sometimes it manages to work for some time. The crashes started to
 happen on Windows 8.1, and I thought i could fix them with windows 10, but it didn't fix everything. If anyone can take a look at the dump files and help me figure out what is wrong and get me a solution, it would be much appreciated. I'm afraid that my GPU
 could be toast at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried clean installing the driver multiple times, and all my other drivers should be up to date as well, including the Intel ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[PROBLEM SOLVED] - Updating my BIOS and drivers at Lenovo's website seems to have stopped the crashing. Thanks to everyone who helped me here.</p>

<div><br />
<div>1.Yes issue is confined to the mouse.</div>
<div>2. Havent tried this yet. but the USB worked in safe mode.</div>
<div>3.Yes</div>
<div>4.no</div>
<div>5. Brand new. When I first used it the mouse worked and then it gradually degraded to not&nbsp;recognized. I have downloaded some apps from the app store and installed steam(for gaming). Would any of these do something to confuse this machine?</div>
<div><br />
<div>did a safe boot and the mouse registered and I could move it although it was not very smooth and seemed to cut out.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Downloaded a new Microsoft 3500 Mouse driver file. Made no difference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The device manager sees both mouses I have tried.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a new HP laptop that does not have the swipe technology(whatever you call it when you use your finger on the screen)- it's just a normal old school laptop.</div>

    <title>Xbox One Home Screen Not Loading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brad234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Home Screen Not Loading</h2>
                    <p>Basically, the issue begins with the fact that, upon turning on my console, the normal green Xbox One loading screen appears, however it stays like this for around 5-10 minutes. After this, the screen turns dark grey, rather than loading up the home screen.
 When I press the home button on the controller, the blank grey screen darkens slightly, as if the side menu was brought up, then lightens again when I press the button once more to remove the non-existent menu. During this time, none of the buttons do anything,
 and I cannot navigate the home screen, as it is completely grey and blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as this, sometimes after going through all of the above, the home screen and all does load in, after a long time. However, if I try to click a game or app, they do not open. I also cannot send messages to anyone, as the keyboard cannot appear.</p>
<p>This is highly frustrating, and I wanted any solutions at all. I have searched, and seen people with similar and identical problems as me. Please DO NOT suggest doing a factory reset (despite keeping games and apps) as everyone suggests this one the other
 forums, but this deletes all profiles, settings and progress on the Xbox. I do not want to lose all that I have done; Therefore I don't know why anyone would suggest this.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Doing a factory reset does not lose all your progress. Your game progress is saved to the cloud and when you add your profile back to your Xbox One and start to play a game, it syncs back to the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would strongly suggest doing a factory reset keeping all games and apps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the console power button till it fully shuts down.</li><li>Press and hold both bind and eject buttons (keep held)</li><li>Press the power button (keeping bind and eject held)</li><li>wait for second power up chime and release buttons</li><li>From troubleshoot menu select reset console</li><li>Reset keeping all games and apps.</li></ol>
<p>All you need to know is your login details and add your profile back. You will lose nothing at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the console takes that long to start, it's usually because of an inconsistency of the file system, that the console has to check and tries to repair (similarly to the Chkdsk program your Windows PC runs, if it was turned off unexpectedly by a power
 outage or something).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the console is unable to repair the inconsistency, your only option IS to use the factory reset, or if that doesn't do it, reinstall the console OS via an USB thumb drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry! As long as you have the email and password for the accounts on your console, you can simply sign into these accounts again, and all save game progress is primarily stored on the Xbox Cloud online.</p>
<p>The console only keeps a copy of these locally on the hard drive. So if you start any game with your profile after the factory reset or USB recovery, the console will simply download your game progress, and you'll continue where you left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as long as your console was online before that behavior happened, your progress and everything are safely backed up online. Your console can burn down to the ground, and you can get another one, sign in with your account, and you can download your games
 for free, and your progress will simply download to the new console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So don't be afraid of resetting your console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes I would also suggest trying a factory reset. All of your game progress will be saved via cloud and when you boot a game back up to play, it will sync your save and you'll be fine. The only thing you'll have to do over again is your settings in general
 for the Xbox, such as if you want to make your feed and games visible to everyone, friends, or blocked etc. Good luck and I hope the factory reset helps! :)</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I know how frustrating it is to be unable to receive important emails. We have to consider several causes why you were not able to receive emails such as:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>A. Filter Settings of the account.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To ensure that your account filter settings are not causing incoming email not to be delivered to your account, I suggest that you check your settings by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Check your Junk folder</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign in <a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>2. Click on <b>Junk</b>on the left pane. </p>
<p>3. Check to see if the missing mail is in this folder.</p>
<p>4. If you see any messages that should have been delivered to the Inbox , click the box on the left of each message to put a check mark and then click the
<b>Not Junk</b> button. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Check your Blocked sender list</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the gear icon, and then click More mail settings. Under
<b>Preventing junk email</b>, click <b>Safe and blocked senders</b>.</p>
<p>2. Click <b>Blocked senders</b>.</p>
<p>3. In the Blocked senders list, select the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign, such as hotmail.com) that you now want to receive mail from, and then click &lt;&lt;
<b>Remove from list</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Add the email address to your Safe senders list</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the gear icon, and then click <b>
More mail settings</b>. Under <b>Preventing junk email</b>, click <b>Safe and blocked senders</b>.</p>
<p>2. Click <b>Safe Senders</b>.</p>
<p>3. In the text box, type in the email address or domain you’d like to always receive email from, and then click
<b>Add to list</b> &gt;&gt;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Check your Email Rules</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the gear icon, and then click <b>
More mail settings</b>. Under <b>Customizing Outlook</b>, click Rules for sorting new messages.</p>
<p>2. Perform one of the actions as per your requirement:</p>
<p>Click <b>Edit</b> next to the rule that you want to edit. </p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>Choose the rule that you want to delete and click <b>Delete</b>. </p>
<p>Note: Not all international characters are supported as filters. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Check your Junk Mail Settings</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the gear icon, and then click <b>
More mail settings</b>.</p>
<p>2. Under <b>Preventing junk email</b>, click <b>Filters and reporting</b>. </p>
<p>3. Under Choose a junk e-mail filter, choose the level of protection that you want, and then click Save. If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe sender’s lists will have been sent to the Junk e-mail folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Check your Reply-to address </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the gear icon, and then click <b>
More mail settings</b>. Under <b>Writing email</b>, click <b>Reply-to address</b>.</p>
<p>2. Select <b>Current e-mail</b> address radio button. </p>
<p>3. Click Save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>B. Mail Client Settings.</span></b></p>

            Thanks Abigail for your very clear reply. In the end I was able to unblock the mail box by setting up a new email program and downloading emails. That also unblocked my Windows mail address. All working fine again.

            <div><font>Hi Beth,</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>This could be an issue with the setup or the .exe application file for the games from iWin. While loading the game, it may not be able to use the application file for that particular game.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>Run the game in administrator mode and check if it helps. Right Click on the setup file and select “Run as administrator”. If you still find the same error message, follow the steps:</font></div>
<div><font>a) Now, I would suggest you to find out the location of the iWin game folder under:</font></div>
<div><strong><font>drive:\Program Files\ iWin </font></strong></div>
<div><font>OR <strong>drive:\Program Files\ Name of the game </strong></font></div>
<div><font>b) Double Click on the .exe application for the game from the folder and check if you are able to launch the game.</font></div>
<div><font>c) If yes, find the game icon on the computer that is showing the error message. Right Click on the game icon and select
<strong>Copy</strong>.</font></div>
<div><font>d) Right Click in the games (or iWin) folder under program Files and<strong> paste
</strong>it.</font></div>
<div><font>e) Try to launch the game again. If the issue still persists, right click on the game icon
<strong>(.exe application file</strong>) under<strong> Program Files </strong>and select “<strong>Send to Desktop</strong>”. Check if you are able to start the game from the desktop screen.</font></div>

<h2>            Windows 10 - crash &#61;&#62; Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB3120677&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After successfully downloading and installing this recent update I rebooted my computer and got the Alienware Respawn window - basically Windows could not boot and Dell's Alienware recovery s/w intercepted to assist me in restoring the O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a USB Western Digital MyPassport SSD plugged into facilitate weekly backups using Acronis so i unplugged it and low and behold Windows booted successfully. &nbsp;Plugging it back in reliably repeats the windows crash during the boot sequence. &nbsp;I can
 plug it in with no issues - after booting, but not prior to booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why all of a sudden, after installing this update, having a portable drive plugged in during boot up would cause windows to crash? &nbsp;My thought may be that the BIOS was affected and the boot sequence was changed to look at USB drives
 first....I will need to check that, but other than that i have no clue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts in advance!</p>
<p>

            <p>All,</p>
<p>well, I did check the BIOS settings and the boot sequence had changed to boot out of the USB Western Digital drive. &nbsp;I changed the boot sequence and made the internal SSD scanning the Windows OS first and things worked fine. &nbsp;Even so, it seems odd that the
 BIOS would fail when scanning the USB drive as there is no OS here. I would have thought it would have simply scanned it, and jumped over it looking for an OS in the next position in the boot list. &nbsp;In this case it was USB drive, DVD-ROM, UEFI internal drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short---changing the boot sequence fixed my issue. &nbsp;If anyone has any ideas why Windows tried &nbsp;(and failed) to boot from my USB HD, please reply back...more curious than anything else!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Black Friday,</p>
<p>Chris.</p>

<h2>            BSOD Memory Management but memory seems fine</h2>
                    I have an Alienware Aurora R2 which I've been upgrading ever since I bought it. Now it has 16gb of ram (4x4gb kingston). I keep getting the memory management BSOD, but when i run the memory diagnosis of Windows 8, it says everything is fine with the memory.
 I even try removing the memory and testing it on another computer that works fine and it seems there is nothing wrong with RAM.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could it be either BIOS or MB? Not knowing what is broken is driving me crazy, has anyone had the same issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Update: I've finished running Memtest86 and it shows no errors on any of the memories, but then again when I start using Photoshop or playing Rome II windows crashes with a Memory Management_BSOD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I will attach the report from memtes86 as well as the minidump files from windows in a couple of minutes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Installing AutoCAD 2009 on Windows 7.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to install AutoCad 2009 on Windows 7 Home Premium which I am unable to do. Can I get a solution ASAP for the same??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also read in the forums that if I upgrade to the Windows 7 Professional I would be able to run AutoCAD installation in the XP compatible mode. Kindly update me on the same.</p>
<p>I am using Asus K61IC Series Laptop and would like assistance on the upgrade too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<div>Hi,</div>

<strong>a.</strong> Do you get any error message while installing this software on Windows 7?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of AutoCAD® 2010 and AutoCAD® LT® 2010 are compatible with and supported on Microsoft Windows® 7 however Autocad 2009 is not tested on Windows 7 platform as per the information available on Autodesk website:<br />
