<h2>            A yellow blob appeared on my Nokia 930&#39;s screen</h2>
                    
<p><span>Today I noticed a yellow blob suddenly appear on my 930's screen. I mean a few hours prior I was reading some manga(white and black) and didn't see anything, but after a few hours when I went to google search site in the white background I noticed
 a horrific yellow blob. I've never seen this before on an amoled screen before, I mean my previous phone was a S3 and never have I ever witnessed this before. And I've only had this Nokia for 4-5 weeks...&nbsp;:crying:</span><span> So what should I do now? Is this
 warranty service eligible or void?</span><br />

            It's called bubbling, well that's what I was told anyways. It happens with AMOLEDS. Should be covered by warranty, the manufacturer put in the faulty display, not you.

<span>&nbsp;I have already replied to your survey, I am guessing it was not read by anyone. I am tired of getting scammed. I just touched base on some of the things that happened. I would venture to say your Phone system
 has been compromised by a group of people claiming to be a support team for Microsoft. I am not very pleased with the service I have been getting.. I am not even sure if I am sending this customer satisfaction form Microsoft or if I am warning the liars and
 crooks that have scammed me before. I have been getting programs added to my account. I still have that shadow in the box that indicates to automatically sign me in. I still don't have access to many of my programs. I get a message access denied. I still feel
 there is another person on my account . But there is an account with the sign on of Jerry@Jerry2375, there are also other times my name&nbsp; or&nbsp; come up I never use my Real NameGerald or just Jerry. Someone need to take control of my computer and get rid of all
 of these Corrupt Files and Names. By the way I am not going to pay for any more of this stuff. It is Microsoft Phones that have been compromised, I have called no less that Ten Numbers that are listed as Microsoft, They have the Logo and everything they claimed
 to be partnered with Microsoft. They use the name;&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, They also use a Survey Form&nbsp; From; Surveymonkeyuser.com, They also use; JBVK SECURITY SUPPORT INC&nbsp;
 also JVBK SUPPORT .txt,&nbsp; Also ; SSLSecurity, For a lifetime of service cost is $ 999.99, If you feel you need to call me I gave my Phone number on the other survey I was sent. I must tell you I am hard of hearing and if your English isn't to good I will hang
 Up. Jerry&nbsp; Sorry someone is messing&nbsp; with my computer , This survey keeps disappearing.<br />

            The best way to handle someone else accessing your PC remotely without your permission is to reset Windows. Make sure you have all your license keys because you'll have to reinstall all of your applications.

            <span>Thank you for contacting me. First off I am not a computer Whiz. My Computer and my television are my windows to the outside world I am a disabled Veteran. I did what the message said to do it was blocked and access
 denied. The message I got was Create file failed code 5 access denied. I tried it several times but got the same message. Whoever is on my computer has changed everything my user name I have had since 1994 has been altered and other names have been added I
 never use my full name Gerald Dixon and most of the changes have to do with that user name except one&nbsp; it is Jerry@jerry2375 if I try to contact that E-mail address it turns red. I have little or no access to any of the programs, If I go into one the person
 feel threaten by it is blocked and access denied . I told AOL about the problem they said I was scammed and there was nothing they could do. I have called so many telephone numbers that claim to be Microsoft when I check the number it says it is a Microsoft
 Scam , I even called the Microsoft Store in Orlando , The woman gave me a number that was listed as a Microsoft Scam. I think the entire Microsoft Phone system is compromised. Because when I call a person answered in English then there is a pause and another
 person answers and claims to be Microsoft support, But the English is not so good. Sometimes I see that a light is on in my office and it is my printer light it only comes on when the computer is turned on. Yesterday I called what I though was Microsoft and
 the person wanted to take control of my computer to see what was wrong, I told him NO and he said for 449 dollars he would fix everything. Then he said is this Gerald, How in the hell did he know who I was just by me calling them.&nbsp; Sorry this is so long I
 am just so frustrated and I don't know what to do. I don't have the kind of money they are talking about. I am on a fixed income and there isn't much to spare. Thanks I hope maybe you can help&nbsp; Jerry</span>

<h2>            Excel 365 desktop version 15.30 for MAC object libraries, how to access them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>From what I have read there currently the object library browser is not available in the VBA editor.</p>
<p>Is there another way to access a searchable library with the excel objects anywhere online or in a downloadable app or viewer that includes the current objects?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Cbosse,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the version of your Office is not the latest, we suggest you update office via Help&gt;Check for updates&gt;Automatically Download and Install&gt;Check for Updates, then check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above doesn't help, please provide the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.Did you get any error message when using Object Library?</p>
<p>2.Mac version. You can check it via Apple icon&gt;About this Mac</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did update the version and now one can see the different references to the object libraries which are available and select them through an icon in the bottom left corner which was not available before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a step in the right direction but the editor still does not have the browser of the object library available at least in an intuitive way. Is it available through a key combination, if so I would appreciate to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Regarding your questions:</span></p>
<p>- No I did not have any error message, I trying to write some macros for Excel and need the object library to be browsable to find my way around to select the right objects for my code.</p>
<p>- As for my Mac Version it is: Sierra 10.12.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Just to be clear - the current version of Office for Mac (15.36 general release build) DOES have the ability for you to set references. Click the Add References button in the lower left corner of the Visual Basic Editor Window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current hideous editor will go away (hopefully very soon), so this answer will become obsolete when the new editor is released. The new editor will have the Object Browser if Microsoft keeps its promise to deliver the VB Editor we had in 2011.</p>

<p>To be among the first to test the new VB Editor, go to Excel's Help menu and choose Check for Updates, which launches AutoUpdate app. In AutoUpdate app, choose to join the Insider Fast program. This gives you pre-beta builds of Office weekly, and a special
 forum where you can interact with Microsoft's developers. Do not use these builds for production purposes. They will have bugs and unexpected behavior at times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new editor hasn't reached the pre-beta stage, yet.</p>

            <p>Right it is not necessary for them to remotely access someones computer. The issue is on their end and most likely a mistake. It is not a browser issue, I don`t have or get virus`s or malware, I rarely send emails, I don`t spam,I don`t keep or use contacts,
 I always use the same pc, no one but me can use this pc. I purchased windows 8 in the past. How I violated terms is beyond me!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>2520 sudden death with su-42 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martti_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            2520 sudden death with su-42</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I got my 2520 with the power keyboard,&nbsp;it seems to shut down when the keyboard battery runs out. This happens every time. It can be restarted after holding the power button down for 10-15 secs, and&nbsp;after that it runs ok with the tablet battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a hardware problem? Why isn't 2520 able to switch to the primary tablet battery when the secondary keyboard battery runs out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone else has complained about the same issue, <a href="http://www.surfacegeeks.net/forums/index.php?/topic/1159-issues-with-nokia-2520-power-keyboard/," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.surfacegeeks.net/forums/index.php?/topic/1159-issues-with-nokia-2520-power-keyboard/,</a> but I have no broken parts in my keyboard and no keyboard recognition promlems either.</p>

            I have started having issues with my keyboard too. I thought it was because I dropped my tablet/keyboard and damaged the alignment pins and one edge of the edge of the cradle where the tablet base fits. I also thought that my screen cracked so I purchased
 a replacement table and keyboard on eBay and ended up with practically a brand new setup. It ended up that it was just the screen protector that cracked so I fixed the keyboard cradle and let my wife use the new keyboard and had a spare tablet. I have 3 tablets
 and 2 keyboards.<br />
<br />
A short while later I noticed that the % battery remaining would drop to something like 30% when the keyboard battery empties and the tablet battery is still at 100%. I thought something in the keyboard might have been messed up so I put my original tablet
 in the new keyboard (which worked properly with the other two tablets) and found that it started acting the same, it no longer worked like it was supposed too. I checked the old keyboard that had been dropped with the other two tablets and they also didn't
 work like they were supposed to. When I use the new tablets with the new keyboard they no longer work properly either.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can figure out is that one of the updates that came within the last month or so has messed up the battery monitoring system. I can at least run with an empty keyboard battery but the tablet will just die when the system determines that the
 battery level is too low. Also, the keyboard battery only drains to 2% before the tablet battery starts being drained. One time the keyboard battery only drained to 97% before the tablet battery started being drained. Swapping tablets and charging completely
 restored the system to using most of the keyboard battery again before draining the tablet battery.<br />
<br />
I have to say, this has been frustrating. It used to work normally and now it doesn't. I hope MS releases a fix soon.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should see if I can back out the more recent updates to see if normal behavior returns.

            1. Try creating a new notebook and copy paste the content from the problematic notebook into the new one. Delete the problematic notebook.

                    Does anybody know how can get any of my Microsoft office to work? when I try to open the app a pop show up that said Microsoft office cannot verify the license for this product. You should repair the Office program by using the control Panel. So I went
 to the control panel and click on programs and features and right-click my Microsoft &nbsp;office 356 and then click change but I still have that problem if anybody know what to do or have any suggesting please let me know.

<h2>            Excel keeps shutting down</h2>
                    <p>
Issue at the moment with Excel. <span>
It keeps shutting down or the message (attached) comes up continually (if not the 1</span><sup>st</sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>time
 I save a file, definitely the second).&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I am the only one who opens this file and I am the only one who accesses it in my OneDrive.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39035e7c-5dc1-45a5-b169-960090ab1b7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39035e7c-5dc1-45a5-b169-960090ab1b7f" /></a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If I could get rid of this, I would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
I use Windows 7 Professional and under an Office 365 Work / Business Account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi June,</p>
<p><span><br />
For this behavior, some users have reported it, y</span><span>ou may</span><span> try the following steps</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>1. In registry editor(Go to Run, input
<em>regedit</em> to open it ), go to:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Excel\Options</p>
<p>2. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD Value.</p>
<p>3. Type
<em><strong>QFE_Saskatchewan </strong></em>for the name, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>4. Right-click the
<strong><em>QFE_Saskatchewan</em></strong> entry, and then click Modify.</p>
<p>5. In the Value box, type 1 to have Excel disable the time stamp check and suppress the dialog in every case.</p>
<p>Note: We do not recommend disabling the time stamp check.</p>
<p>6. Click OK to save the setting.</p>

    <title>Build 10041 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rajesh pathak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10041</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update delivered/installed Build 10041.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few initial observations:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The Display Size (Font Size) on the Login Screen became larger. Same has happened in Setting.&nbsp; Is it by design?
</li><li>Every time I try to Personalize the Display (Wall Paper), the System sort of Freezes and all I get is Black Screen. The Mouse Pointer is visible but it sort of stutters,</li><li>The Start had a new Icon microsoftcommunicationapp@. Clicking it does nothing.</li><li>Also the programs pinned to start prior to update went missing after Build 10041.</li></ol>
<p>Is this Build more Resource intensive.&nbsp; I find my system has become a bit sluggish after the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is it that&nbsp;I am the only one facing this peculiarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards - Rajesh Pathak</p>

            <p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run Update after Updating. Albeit it resulted in Error. Am trying again and will keep the Community posted. The update error is also appended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I find 10041 has:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also broken my Mail App. It blinks and goes away. Trying to reinstall results in error. Both errors attached herewith.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One clarification required:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update started downloading last night and at some point, the laptop battery must have run out. The system went in to Hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the morning the system was restarted and downloading of update completed, followed by installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the break in downloading the update be the reason for the erratic behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I am planning to roll back the update by tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; regards - Rajesh.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SQL - Vehicles Available</h2>
                    <p>Hello it's me again! I am currently trying to create a query which will be a button and its function will be to show Vehicles that are currently available(not currently rented)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6450a3ce-a2ee-4f68-8f24-80b42a3bc9ee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6450a3ce-a2ee-4f68-8f24-80b42a3bc9ee?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I made an SQL statement as follows:</p>
<p>SELECT Bookings.[End Date], Bookings.[Vehicle ID], Vehicles.Brand, Vehicles.Type</p>
<p>FROM Vehicles INNER JOIN Bookings ON Vehicles.[Vehicle ID] = Bookings.[Vehicle ID];</p>
<p>WHERE [End Date] IS NULL;</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding of this is that I want to show All vehicles(+Brand and Type) that have been booked and show the ones that Do Not have An End Date, so I want it to return all Null Values of End Date which means that if there is no end date, then it is not
 rented. I also tried to do it by adding a Parameter but it looks like its not bringing anything back. Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you<br />

<p>Don't you want to also show vehicles that have never been rented? I would expect the query to pull records where the End Date is in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you be a little more specific?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have future rentals, then you would want to search for vehicles that would be available between two dates.</p>

<p>Yes, good point. Why would you expect the query to pull records where end date is in the past?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely Sir! The main function of this is supposed to be that if someone is calling and wants to rent a car, it can be quickly checked whether the car is available. So It will be&nbsp; a button in the form called 'Vehicles Available'. Although it sounds like a
 good idea to have Like a Start Date/End Date Parameter. Not too sure on that one tho.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes there will be future rentals</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I came up with so far.</p>

This little demo file illustrates the basic methodologies for room reservations, but just think of rooms as vehicles.&nbsp; The demo uses the following query for returning those rooms which are available within a date range defined by parameters:<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS Forms!frmOccupants!sfcReservations!EntryDate DATETIME,<br />
Forms!frmOccupants!sfcReservations!DepartureDate DATETIME;<br />
SELECT RoomNumber<br />
FROM Rooms<br />
WHERE NOT EXISTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT *<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM RoomOccupations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE Rooms.RoomNumber = RoomOccupations.RoomNumber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND WithinDateRange(NZ(Forms!frmOccupants!sfcReservations!EntryDate,#1900-01-01#),
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NZ(Forms!frmOccupants!sfcReservations!DepartureDate,#2100-01-01#),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EntryDate,DepartureDate));<br />
<br />
The query calls the following function which returns TRUE if the two ranges passed into the function as its arguments intersect:<br />
<br />
Public Function WithinDateRange(dtmParamRangeStart As Date, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmParamRangeEnd As Date, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmDataRangeStart As Date, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmDataRangeEnd As Date) As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
' Accepts: date at which parameter range starts<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date at which parameter range ends<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date at which data range starts<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date at which data range ends<br />
' Returns: True if data range intersects with parameter range<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False if whole of data range outside parameter range<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; WithinDateRange = _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmDataRangeStart &lt;= dtmParamRangeEnd And _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmDataRangeEnd &gt;= dtmParamRangeStart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Storage - Other Category</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumia 810 and I have been getting warnings from my phone that it is low on space so I checked out how my phone is storing stuff and I found that the other category has almost 3.6 GB. I've cleared my Maps and Browser caches and have deleted
 all but the necessary apps, photos, videos, and music but still the "other" category has a huge amount of data in it. What is all of this and how can I get rid of it so that I have space on my phone for things I need it for (e.g. Music and photos)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> john369xp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 32 Bit System Freezing &#40;locking Up&#41;</h2>
                    Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate.&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro 32 Bit System.&nbsp; (Not my insider computer)<br />
Cannot get a screen shot.&nbsp; <br />
When I start to export the movie after I select the location for storage I get this message.<br />
Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just <br />
collecting some error info and then we'll restart for you. (30% <br />
Complete) Freezes at this point and does not restart. <br />
If you like to know more, you can search on line later for this <br />
error.<br />
CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT<br />
I have to manual restart the computer and Windows 10 does a repair of the hard drive.&nbsp; Windows 10 then restarts normally and all programs seem to be working that I have tried (I am writing this on Windows 10) except Studio 19.&nbsp; I have tried two (2) times to
 burn the DVD with the same results. From reading some of the post this seems to be a common problem!<br />
Any Suggestions?

            I would check with Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate. see if any new drivers are available for Win10. I checked and that version &nbsp;Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate. is listed as a 64bit program? and you show Win10 32bit? as the spec's for that program are for 64bit
 only???

<h2>            HP iPAQ 210 synch problem with Outlook 2007 on Vista laptop</h2>
                    
<p>The HP iPAQ210 (brand new) connects to the Vista laptop and does synch with Outlook 2007 e-mail &amp; Outlook 2007 Contacts. But, it will not synch with the Outlook 2007 calendar. I have tried the HP forums, and many
 iPAQ users have the same problem.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Note, I have had no problem also moving WORD 2007 and Excel 2007 and PowerPoint 2007 over to the iPAQ210 and running them.&nbsp; Only the calendar does NOT synch, and I need that the most.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 messages stuck in outbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i3v  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 messages stuck in outbox</h2>
                    Today I've sent about 10 emails, and there are 3 of them stuck in the outbox.<br />
This occurred time to time with Outlook 2010 too. It occurs more frequently on less reliable connections (3G).<br />
<br />
Today this happed on a 100% reliable LAN connection. 30% loss is too much...<br />
I'm not sure, if it's actually sent, or not, since my mail server won't keep outgoing messages (although, this option is checked in outlook).<br />
<br />
This is a pop3 account. <br />
<br />
Why this messages are stuck?<br />
How to this in future?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to help you resolve the issue. However I need more information.</p>
<p>What is the size of the emails that are stuck in Outbox and does these emails have any attachments?</p>
<p>Are these emails sent to multiple recipients or to a particular recipient?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may check for send/receive errors by doing the following:</p>
<p>Click Send/receive tab, click Show Progress under Downloads section, go to Errors tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply with the following information to assist you better.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Thank you for your concern, Aravinda!<br />
<blockquote>What is the size of the emails that are stuck in Outbox&nbsp;</blockquote>
This time it was 1 email with ~10MB attachment, and 2 text-only emails.<br />
The size is OK (also, finally I managed to sent the same email from the same mailbox).<br />
<br />
In fact, I suspect, that something went wrong with one of emails, and all messages after that one (they were already in the outbox) get stuck.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Are these emails sent to multiple recipients or to a particular recipient?<br />
</blockquote>
From my experience - the bug does not depend on it...<br />
It sometimes occur to single-recipient messages, and sometimes to multiple-receipt...
<br />
Though, I'm still not absolutely sure about it...<br />
<br />
<blockquote>You may check for send/receive errors by doing the following:

</p>
</blockquote>
Next time this would happen - I'll try to capture the contents of this window. <br />
Thank you for the suggestion.<br />

So, this happen again. Though, there's no errors. Here's a couple of screenshots:<br />

<br />
By the way, why this "Send/Receive Progress" window is unable to change it's horizontal size?<br />
<br />
It's funny to mention,though, that i was trying to send another bug report...<br />
<br />

<br />
The interesting thing is - bug looks a bit different in these two cases. In ano case it's enougth to move message to "Drafts" folder and re-send it. And in another case this was not working, and I had to create a new message, copy-paste all the stuff there
 and send it.<br />

Once it occur again i'll try to follow your suggestion...<br />

Not sure if it could help when message is already stuck....<br />
Of course, I don't like the idea to keep my PC in "cleenboot mode" till it happen (possibly) again, and, on the other hand, I'm unable to reproduce the issue on-my-will, it just happens time to time.<br />

            Since it is intermittent, try disabling the antivirus scanning of outgoing emails only, i know it creates issues with sending emails.<br />
Mostly these are internet connectivity issues on that particular instance of time.<br />

I've switched off outgoing mail scanning. Hope this helps.. Though, i had not had this issue for about a week now... So, it'll take some time to confirm that this is the cause.<br />
<br />
By the way, my anti-virus is KSOS2 (http://support.kaspersky.com/7292) .<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't get is the way outlook deals with already stuck emails: OK, there was an error. Still, this is not the end of the world, it should be handled properly.. It should try to send it once again, i think...
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm going to do some tests on my 3G connection now and write back...<br />

            Nice list :) <br />
It might be some plug in.... <br />
(<br />
Although there's only one disabled plugin "social connector" visible in file-&gt;manage plugins.<br />
Strange thing is - there's at least Abby Finereader plugin installed too. May be it's not displayed because it was instadded before office 2013 itself.<br />

<h2>            weather app keeps opening&#47;starting on it own without clicking, touching anything.</h2>
                    For the past 2 days now, the Weather App seems to start on its own. I can be doing something on my desktop and all of a sudden the mail app opens. Not sure if the frequency is related to the when the live tile updates?? You might check that...

<p>
</p><p>I right clicked it and pinned it to the taskbar ..&nbsp; now maybe once a day I see it pop and disappear instantly.&nbsp; Mostly when I'm at YouTube.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps html5 video coding&nbsp;triggers it somehow sometimes im wondering&nbsp;?</p>

            <p>I had been having the same issue and discovered that <strong>Application Frame Host
</strong>is the culprit. When you open a Store app they open in the Application Frame Host and once you close the apps this Background Process remains running and as long is continues to run Store apps you have previously ran will reopen even after closing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a fix but opening Task Manager and under Processes\Background Processes, end the Application Frame Host process.</p>

            <p>In the Select Data Source dialog, click in the address bar at the top and enter the folder path (%homepath%\TMP). Click the file type dropdown to the right of the file name box, and select either Web Pages (to limit the file list to .html and similar extensions)
 or All Files. Click on Tmp.html and click the Open button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't just type the full file path into the file name box when using an environment variable such as %homepath%; if you do that, you just get a message that the path is invalid.</p>

            <p>Ah! Thank you! You correctly guessed what I had been doing...attempting to type it in the filename box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I marked it helpful instead of answer, because...my point of needing to do this is to be able to save the environment variable with the form file, so that it works regardless of the machine that it is on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In copying this form file and data.html file to another workstation that uses a different login/user name, the data source doesn't read properly. Unfortunately, it does not understand the homepath of the new workstation...when I open the form file, it does
 not automatically find the data source. So I guess maybe it is "hard coding" the user name in the form file instead of saving it with "%homepath%"? &nbsp;How can I make the form file understand the homepath, regardless of the user name?<br />

            <p>It's true that Word doesn't understand environment variables such as %homepath%, nor is there any way to convince it to accept them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full path of the data source is indeed hard-coded in the document file -- if you change the extension of a .docx file to .zip and extract its contents, you'll find the path in two places in the word\settings.xml file. However, it must also be stored
 somewhere else, because changing the value in the settings.xml file and re-zipping the document doesn't change the place where Word looks for the data source. As for using a macro to make the change, in VBA the document's MailMerge.DataSource property is read-only,
 so trying to change the path there won't work.</p>

 the original source (click Mailings &gt; Start Mail Merge &gt; Normal Word Document) and then select the new source.</p>

            <p>Awesome! I had to remove the "c:" when I switched the environment to appdata, and I'm on the way, but hitting a slight snag...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the data source is no longer an html file, its an mdb file, thus, I changed your line to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;.OpenDataSource Environ("APPDATA") &amp; "\TMP\Tmp.MDB"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I follow it with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Destination = 0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Execute<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; wd.Windows(Mrgform).Activate</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; wd.Visible = True</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, the doc is in an invisible state. I can click on Mailings, Edit Recipient List, and I can see the tmp.mdb data. I click Finish and Merge, it does, but stays invisible. I can save it, close word, and reopen word, then see the finished product, all
 correct, with correct data merged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have stepped it through by putting msgboxes after every line, and it's not getting past the .opendatasource line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tmp.mdb has more than one table. I don't know if that is the culprit. I looked for a way to reference the exact table name and couldn't find anything. But again, when I manually finish the task, I can see it has populated the finished document with the data
 from the correct table.</p>

</p><p>Seems to me Edge is worse than any IE version. I have sent feedback several times via web browser and the notifications section on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please fix this, MSN is your own website for cryin' out loud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also no way to import bookmarks / favorites from Firefox, only Chrome, what's up with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded 5 PCS / laptops to win10 pro and this is a problem on all of them.</p>

            <p>I have found that MSN works on IE11 no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have problems with a lot of Microsoft web sites no opening on Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise</p>

            <p>The point was it was not working in the new Edge browser. I had no problem with IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with the latest win10 build 10586 and the earlier 10576 the buttons worked and the thumbnails were displayed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you MS!</p>
