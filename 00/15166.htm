<h2>            Unable to create account</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to create an account named "admin" in my domain swami.ws. I have been getting the error message "The requested account name is already in use or was used in the past and has not been through the required waiting period to re-use." for the
 last several months now. I have read answers on this forum that there is a 270-day or 365-day waiting period for re-creating accounts that had already been created and deleted. What I want to know is how much longer do I have wait to create this account in
 my domain? Do I have to wait 3 more months, 6 more months, etc.? I don't remember when I had created/deleted this account since it has been so long - so I can't tell when the waiting period will end. I don't want to log in and try to create the account every
 day just to see this error message. Can you tell me how much longer I must wait?</p>

<p><span>Just to clarify, is this your first time creating the account?&nbsp;Most likely that it was previously used and someone used the same

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t my Phone work properly with my Cars Built in car kit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shuntfield---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t my Phone work properly with my Cars Built in car kit &#40;mainly phone book&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p>Car manufacturers are now building complex car kits into their vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companies include:</p>
<p>Ford, Audi, BMW, Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, Vauxhall/Opel, Volkswagen, Mercedes, and other high end specification cars.<br />
<br />
One of the functions, is that it pulls the phone book data from the phone via bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Background Information</em></strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
A lot of the Nokia E and N series, Symbian S60 handsets, do not carry the required bluetooth profile in their bluetooth stack.<br />
<br />
The phone is missing the Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP) that allows the car to pull data from the phone.<br />
<br />
Why the phones do not carry the profile is unknown. What is known is that using the Nokia 810 car kit downloader software, you can partly restore some of this functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/product-support/nokia-616-car-kit/car-kit-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia 616 Car Kit Downloader</a> will also function, along with the Ford Connectivity Downloader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Workaround&nbsp;</em></strong> </p>
<p><br />
The information is here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4143881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4143881</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You'll need to delete the existing&nbsp;pairing in the handset and the car, then install and run the application,
</strong>don't just install the application and expect it to work, you <strong>must</strong> re-pair the handset and the car.<br />
<br />
When it is installed start the application, and then re-pair the phone to the radio, this may then copy your contacts into the radio, be paitent, as it can take a few minutes to copy and setup.<br />
<br />
It may copy the phone book over, but the Missed Dialled and Received calls may not work.<br />
<br />
I have tested this with an Audi S3, A4, and A6 on a Nokia N82 and N95.<br />
<br />
The Nokia E71, appears to have the profile and functions correctly with an Audi car kit, in Handsfree Profile mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia E71, when connected in SIM access profile mode is the same as the other E and N series handsets are requires the 810&nbsp;or&nbsp;616&nbsp;downloader to be installed in the handset.<br />
<br />
Installing the 810/616 downloader only restores phone book functionality, there are some software combinations on car and phones that work without the downloader.<br />
<br />
It may also be possible for your car manufacturers franchised dealer to be able to update the software in your car so that additional features are available, they may charge for this service. Also updating software in the phone may also help, as Nokia may see
 fit to add the profile if they are able.<br />
<br />
For some cars and handsets, when you are connecting with the SIM Access Profile function, you will still need to install the 616/810 downloader application as detailed above, as the phone normally switches off most of its functionality. The phone book will
 then normally function when you have installed the application.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
The workaround only resolves the problem with the phone book. Problems such as random disconnecting which also is reported, are beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: 24-01-09</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed recently that random&nbsp;disconnecting can be caused if you have an Internet Telephony Service running in your handset. Also if you have the WLAN&nbsp;discovery setting enabled then this can cause&nbsp;the same problem - whilst I am not attempting to try
 and resolve random disconnects, it could be a reason for why this is happening.</p>
<p>I have recently installed a VoIP service in my handset and 100 mtrs from my home when the handset disconnects from this service at my house, the Bluetooth disconnects from the Car Kit, in my E71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit 14-04-09</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audi also make a&nbsp;Bluetooth Sim Access Profile&nbsp;adapter for their Generation II and Generation III&nbsp;(Low) mobile telephone interface. (Audi Part No:
<font><font>8P0051440)
</font></font>The SIM access service will require the 810 phone kit downloader application. With this on my kit I am getting disconnections with Bluetooth. To prevent this, I switch Bluetooth off and then on again prior to connecting to the kit, this resolves
 the disconnecting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit 12-05-09</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further to the Audi edit above, I now have an Audi S4 2009 with the Audi Mobile Phone Preparation (high) for this to function correctly with phone book access the 810 Downloader needs to be installed,
<strong>and running</strong> when the phone connects to the car every time it connects. Otherwise the phone book access does not operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit:12-06-09</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use the Ford Contact Downloader application from</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ford-mobile-connectivity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ford-mobile-connectivity.com/</a> - select downloads then Select a Nokia E or N Series Device and download the contact application (this works fine in my Audi)</p>

            <ol>
<li>Office 2004 runs on PowerPC Code.</li><li>Your new Machine uses an Intel Processor</li></ol>
<p>Therefore 2004 is not compatible with the new Machine. For years Mac came with emulator software that allowed power PC Code to run on Intel machines but the last system able to run this emulator was OS X.6.8 And The rights to use the software was allowed
 to run out by Apple. &nbsp;Intel Processors have been out about 7-10 years now and with the introduction of OS X. 7.0, it was decided to cut the cord.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think that Office 2004 was actually the best Mac office Package ever put out. Things were much easier and more things could be done. Office Mac (although 2011 is pretty good and&nbsp;I would declare 3 rd best, behind Word 6 and Excel 5) has been
 steadily going downhill. Word 2016 to me unless they add back a bunch of features and start removing the Debugging code, will wind up with a reputation 20-50 times worse than 2008.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sorry to say you will have to upgrade to&nbsp;either 2016 Or if you can still Purchase 2011 (possibly on Amazon as New Old Stock) do that. &nbsp;Maybe in a year or two or three or four, they may have 2016 improved enough to be worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just to [perhaps] save you some money :-) You don't need to invest in Office 2016 unless you want to do so. Office 2011 will run just fine on the current builds of both macOS 10.11.x &amp; 10.12.x, will handle the existing files you've saved using previous versions
 &amp; enable the creation of new files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That having been said, Office 2011 is on the tail end of its life cycle &amp; all support for it will be withdrawn effective October 10, 2017. You'd still be able to continue using it beyond that date, but there will be no further updates to that version. That
 suggests that the more macOS continues to change the more likely Office 2011 is to be left behind. (IMO there won't be more significant updates to 10.11, but 10.12 will continue to be updated... and then there's always
<em>macOS Next</em>. Who knows what that's liable to cut off at the knees.)</p>

                    IF this has been answered elsewhere I am sorry, I couldn't find it. When the Insider program started I clean installed the preview and have been updating as we go along. When it comes time to get a final install will Windows 10 ask me for my Windows 7/8.1
 codes or will I have to reinstall them and upgrade back to Windows 10?

            <p>Hello Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download ISO file and upgrade each computer offline. ISO file should be available at the time of Windows 10 launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to buy product keys for both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Please refer "<strong>I have multiple computers, do have to download Windows 10 on each computer?</strong>" section in the article provided in the previous post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it helps.</p>

 to show in the TOC.&nbsp; Does this sound like something that can be done?&nbsp; Here's the code.&nbsp; I only included the code for heading 1, it repeats for heading 2 and heading 3.&nbsp; Unfortunately the Attachments heading could end up being number 6 or number 8 or even

    <title>E52 Display problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bo6o  say:</h3>
<h2>            E52 Display problem</h2>
                    
<p>A few days ago I bought a new E52 phone and happily took it home.<br />
After the initial excitement and after putting a darker theme,from<br />
the saved on the SD card ones, I noticed that the display is<br />
flickering like a desktop monitor configured with a bad refreshrate.<br />
Tryied hard reset and firm reinstall-but nothing.<br />
Any ideas before returning it for repair - hardware prob,or soft,fixing?</p>
<p>Can the problem be from a bad contact of the battery (it's not turning off by itself)?</p>
<p>Btw-the first phone they gave me at the store didn't even start when I tried</p>
<p>it there, they plugged it to charge it, but even then it didn't start and gave me another</p>
<p>one - with the flickering problem.</p>

<p>I just checked the site of the store where i took it - they don't offer that model anymore ?!?!?!?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am also facing a similar problem on my e52.</p>
<p>Though its tolerable enough to actually use the phone it bothers me as a defect.</p>
<p>But during taking photos its really bad ie the flickering.</p>
<p>I wolud like to know what you did to solve it.</p>

<p>Well, I went to the store, they said that currently they don't have another piece</p>
<p>to give me instead of that one and I left for fixing. Tomorrow I'll phone them</p>
<p>to check things out and how long it'll take, and if it's going to be more than</p>
<p>one week I'll ask for another phone model,may be N79. Pitty,but...</p>

<p>I guess that the flickering effect is because your theme is on memory card. As I wrote in other thread here, I suspect E52 in having very bad implementation of memory card interface.</p>
<p>It affects everything that require memory card access: shooting photos, reading files, turning on...</p>

            Nope, it's not from the memory card, even without it and with the golden theme from the phone it still flickered. Two days ago they gave me another E52 with the same battery as mine and with my mem. card and there was still some flickering, but very unnoticeable
 and seen only on darker themes,so I kept it. For now it's working great.

<p>I also bought a E52 and experienced the same flickering problem when using the darker profiles. I talked to a Nokia technician, but he hadn´t heard of the problem.</p>
<p>As I found&nbsp;the flickering&nbsp;to disturbing I sent the phone back.</p>
<p>It´s a pity, cause I liked the phone, thin and compact with great battery life.</p>

<p>I returned the phone to Nokia care. They told they havent heard of such a problem even after me showing it.</p>
<p>After a day they returned it saying it was fixed. The waves had sure reduced a bit but it was still there.</p>
<p>So i asked them to rectify it completely or find me a replacement. Its still with them for&nbsp;4 days now.</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 - How to add IMAP accounts that point to existing PST file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK so I got an outlook error on my main PST file. &nbsp;I tried several steps like Scanpst to fix it but to no avail so I deleted it and started again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have 2 pst files with emails from my two IMAP accounts in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do now, is to re-add the accounts and have it deliver to these two existing PST files. &nbsp;Can that be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the two files opened in outlook successfully and can read olf emails in them. &nbsp;I just want the new ones delivered there too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I choose POP3, I can select a data file but not for IMAP it seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>#1) ...............but it seems like the answer is that I have to create a new file and that I can't link to my old file as you can with POP3.............</p>
<p><br />
#2) Can you confirm my understanding please? &nbsp;Also, does any of this change when I move to Outlook 2016?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Correct, you cannot link an IMAP account to a specific data store. The data store (.pst file in this case when OL'2010 or earlier is used) related to your &lt;email&gt; data will get recreated every time the account gets configured and you email data will
 get downloaded (sync'd) the next time Outlook connects with the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In OL'2010 &amp; earlier - two data stores (.pst files) were used - (1) for email and (2) for contacts/calendar folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - In OL'2013/'2016 - Imap is consolidated into one .ost file (assuming there is only one email account configured) including contact and calendar folders which will have the added folder descriptions of "This Computer Only". The most important thing to
 remember when you have data in folders marked as "This Computer Only" is that if the .ost file gets disconnected from the account that created it (or the account gets deleted) - you will lose the data contained in those folders. Good idea to create a new PST
 file in these cases and make it the "default" data file for the profile which will then contain the default contact/calendar folders - done by</p>
<p>File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data files tab --&gt; set the newly created PST file as the "default"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most important thing to remember when configuring Outlook with multiple email accounts is that "what data stores get created" and "which is designated as the default" is determined by the &lt;sequence&gt; in which the email accounts get configured examples of
 which are described in</p>

<h2>            ADO- ranges and null values</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>I have a workbook that has lots of rows with different words. New words are added weekly and therefore I can't specify a range other than using $D:D]. Each column has its own version of the macro code posted below doing different kinds of operations. It's
 a total of 13 macros running in a sequence . However, column A has more values than Column B and that causes an error and the rest of the macros will not work. Is there a workaround for this problem?

</p><p>The email login is the Skype account itself hence, you cannot change it.</p>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<br />
Glad to hear the issue is resolved. Here is the summary:<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Issue description:</span></strong><br />
<br />
When you follow below steps:<br />
Go to Microsoft Forms -&gt; create a quiz-&gt; click the … on the upper right corner -&gt; settings -&gt; locate to "options for responses", you cannot see "Open with the Take a Test app" as quiz option.
<br />
<br />
<br />
This feature is not available to all users at this phase.<br />
<br />
<br />
We've been informed that the concerned team had added your tenant to white list in order to use this feature.
<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Jim<br />

<h2>            Adding Microsoft Works to Windows 7</h2>
                    I recently bought a new computer running Windows 7 Premium (64 bit), then upgraded to Windows Professional (64 bit). My last computer&nbsp;was running&nbsp;Vista (64 bit). It was also running Microsoft Works 9. I have many files and projects that I&nbsp;REALLY NEED&nbsp;but
 can't open in any other program. Having Microsoft Office Professional on the new computer&nbsp;doesn't matter much because none of those programs will open anything in "Works". I've downloaded 'Windows XP Mode' and 'Windows Virtual PC'. So does this mean I can
 install Microsoft Works 9 and be able to open all of my 'works' files and projects??????

    <title>Remove Comments&#47;Popups from Workbook Template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salmon gram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Comments&#47;Popups from Workbook Template</h2>
                    <p>I am using an expense report template to create a simple report for some financial items at my job.&nbsp; The problem is that most cells have constant comment popups that keep displaying when those cells are selected that I am unable to remove or even hide for
 some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbb70910-dbdc-4ea0-9430-82694395b417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbb70910-dbdc-4ea0-9430-82694395b417" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have through a few steps to try to remove them but none seem to work.&nbsp; If I right-click in the cells, the option to delete comments is greyed out.&nbsp; Here are other steps i have tried</p>
<p>1 - Excel preferences --&gt; View --&gt; selected "No comments or indicators"</p>
<p>2 - Edit menu --&gt; Find --&gt; Go To --&gt; click Special --&gt; select Comments.&nbsp; This prompts a message saying "No Cells Found"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to find anything on the web regarding this issue, I initiated a chat with MS.&nbsp; Not only was this a total waste of time, as the rep was clearly doing nothing but pushing to get off the chat as soon as possible, but he only recycled the very steps I
 had already told him I tried.&nbsp; He then told me in a very belittling demeaning comment that would email steps that I could go through to fix the issue.&nbsp; I should have suspected something was amiss when I asked if I was just going to get an email with the same
 steps I had already tried and that he repeated to me and did not receive a response.&nbsp; After the chat and I received the email, sure enough, they were the same steps we just discussed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am now unfortunately no better off than before with trying to resolve my problem.&nbsp; Only now I am rather irritated at the unbelievably terrible support.</p>

<br />Select the cell where pop up message is appearing &gt; Data tab &gt; Data Validation &gt; The pop message is in the Input Message &gt; Either you can remove messages or just say clear all.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Microsoft Excel isn't currently your default program for viewing and editing spreadsheets.&nbsp; Do you want to select the types that Excel should open?"</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I am sorry to hear that you are unable to open Excel files even after associating the file types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may repair Office 2013 following the steps from this link and check if that helps:</p>

            <p>Response is not applicable to windows RT.&nbsp; If you follow the instructions linked above you find that there are no programs listed on the computer.</p>
<p>The solution I ended up with was to accept all associated file types for the program. You can do this by going to control panel\Set Default Programs\Set your default programs, select Excel and then select Set this program as default.&nbsp; This will associate
 all 24 files types listed&nbsp;under the excel program.</p>
<p>My personal feeling is that one of these file types may be in conflict or associated with another application in windows, but then again I'm not a programer so what do I know.&nbsp; If that is the case and I need to unassociate a particular file&nbsp;extension from
 excel I'd appreciate the feedback.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Why don&#39;t YouTube links work in Facebook app&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philthy1402  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why don&#39;t YouTube links work in Facebook app&#63;</h2>
                    **I want to preface this post by pointing out that the Facebook app for Windows Phone is developed by Microsoft and so regardless of if this is a problem with the app or the OS, I believe it is appropriate to be brought up in this forum. &nbsp;Furthermore,
 I believe this could be fixed either in the OS or in the app.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Steps to reproduce:</div>
<div>1) Install YouTube and Facebook apps from Marketplace</div>
<div>2) Launch Facebook app</div>
<div>3) Find (or create, then find) a wall post that links to a YouTube video</div>
<div>4) Click on the video link</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Expected Result: Video plays</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Actual Result: Page loads informing user that the phone can't handle the type of file being downloaded</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional notes: If you open a YouTube video link from the "What's New" feed, the video will play. &nbsp;There seems to be a problem with either the OS knowing that the file coming in from the Facebook app can be handled by the YouTube player or the Facebook
 app not calling the right URL or API to open the link so that the OS handles it properly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think this is a fairly easy-to-fix bug that would resolve a pretty visible malfunction. &nbsp;My friends and I exchange video links via Facebook regularly and the current behavior leads users to believe WP7 doesn't support YouTube videos, even if they download
 the YouTube app. &nbsp;This may be why the YouTube app has such low ratings in the marketplace.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Cannot read emails on Outlook Email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mm883  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot read emails on Outlook Email</h2>
                    <p>I have had lately an issue, where whenever I try to read an email in my account, once I click it no message body appears. Instead I get a message "Error: Your request can't be completed right now. Please try again later". This all happened when I had logged
 on a different computer I do not normally use. I am not sure if this is the cause of it or perhaps it has nothing to do. Additionally I cannot forward, reply or do any action regarding the emails of this account.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help regarding this issue.</p>

            To isolate your concern, have you tried disconnecting the accounts on your Outlook.com and link them again? If not yet, we suggest that you do. Also, consider clearing your browser's cache, cookies and history.<br />
<br />
Let us know the result.<br />
