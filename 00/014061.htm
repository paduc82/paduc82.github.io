<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a soft reseting my E-ten M800 I am not able to run any of third party software... It is even not possible to install anything including CAB files. The only soft working are from either MS or E-ten. So when I am trying to run anything else
 a message box appears saying something about certificates error or missed components</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are following certificates listed in Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Certificates-&gt;Root:</p>
<p>- ZTEN CA<br />
- Thawte Server CA<br />
- Thawte Premium Server CA<br />
- Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority<br />
- Secure Server Certification Authority<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any one have a clue&nbsp;about the&nbsp;problem?</p>

<h2>            WiFi Connection with Mobile 5.0</h2>
                    I have a Palm Treo 750 with Windows Mobile 5.0 on board. Syncs beautifully via ActiveSync 4.5. I have just purchased a WiFi SD Card and transfered the .cab file to the device however, there does not appear to be a WLAN program in this version of Windows
 Mobile., the OS is 5.1.195 (Build 14995.2.6.3). Is there a way of "switching ON" WLAN or is just not there in the first place? The SD Card is Pluscom WMSD-MT5911, a Mini SDIO 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Card. This did not have the .cab file on the original disc
 so had to download it from the Pluscom Web Site.

            The operating system really doesn't have anything to do with whether or not a device has wifi or the wifi software on it.&nbsp; If the device is wifi enabled, then it will have the drivers and user interface needed to use wifi.&nbsp; Since your device was not naturally
 wifi enabled, then it did not have the software and drivers on it.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When you purchase a wifi SDIO card for a device, the card should come with software that you install to the device.&nbsp; The software includes the drivers and software needed to use the wifi SDIO card with the device.&nbsp; If you installed software to the device and
 still cannot use the card, then you've probably installed the wrong software to the device.

    <title>Trigger Event on Record Change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmarkie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trigger Event on Record Change</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have a form with various fields that all but one is normally disabled eg. you can see but can't modify.&nbsp; The one field which is enabled is a checkbox.&nbsp; I have two questions.</span></p>
<p><span>1. I find the disabled fields difficult to read because they are disabled and i have tried changing various properties of backcolor, font color etc to help the visibility of the data as you scroll
 through records.&nbsp; The reason for disabling is so the operator can not change/modify them.&nbsp; Is there an alternate way to accommodate the security of the data or the color/visibility issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What event procedure would you recommend to use that when it occurs will evaluate the checkbox and if it is true i would like to enable some of the fields that are disabled.&nbsp; I've tried the
 update event for the form and as i scroll through records i can't seem to get the code to run that will evaluate the checkbox value.&nbsp;Essentially i want the event to trigger when a new data record is presented in the form by scrolling through the data table.</span></p>

<p>1)&nbsp; If you set both the Enabled = No and Locked to Yes, the control will look normal , but users will not be able to interact with it in any way.&nbsp; The fore and back colors can then be set however you want to give some kind of indicator of the situation.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the data tab of the properties sheet for that control, change the control to locked, but leave enabled = yes. That way, the control will not be dimmed out. You can also remove the tab stop, so during tabbing around on the form, the control will be skipped
 over.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For just about any control, check box, combo box etc, when you want to do something AFTER a change been made, you use the aptly named "after update" event. This will take care of WHEN you change the control. So, for each control that has some setting,
 the code could be placed in the after update event to set/un-set or do whatever you require. However, when you navigate to a new record, then all this code out of the blue does not run (too slow, too much waste).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, you also as a rule have to place the SAME code in the forms on-current event. So, when you move to a new record, you need that code to run again. It is thus likely best to build a SINGLE routine that both the several after update event(s) can call,
 and also the on-current event. Your goal is to only code one routine. If you place all the code in each after update event for the 3-5 controls, that takes care of when you change the control, but you still need to run the same code when you move to a new
 record (after update events ONLY fire when you change the control, not when you navigate). So, build ONE routine that all after update + the on current event can call, and thus you only write the code once to handle this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that in place of running code in the on-current + after update events, you can often use conditional formatting to hide or enable a control. In fact, for a continues form you MUST do this. IN a Continues form there is ONE instance of each control
 that is is used over and over. So, with the exception of conditional formatting, in a continues form, since you ONLY placed the control ONCE on the screen there is ONLY ONE set of properties for that control. (so, all copies will take on whatever you set in
 code, so in this case, conditional formatting is really your only choice).</div>

 earlier is selected when at this blank record it allows other fields to be enabled and data can be entered thereby creating a new record when/if the operator selects the recordsave cmd i have in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do i keep the form from scrolling to the open/last 'blank' record?&nbsp; Essentially i want to stop at the last record which has data in it and go no further.&nbsp; All this form is doing is allowing the operator to scroll through the data so they can approve
 the document/workorder so that it may go on to the next approvals step.</p>
<p>Thx</p>
<p>DAve</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Games Compatibility List</h2>
                    <p><em>If you're having issues try verifying the integrity of the game cache (</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>right click&gt;properties&gt;local files&gt;verify integrity of game cache), re-installing the game, or trouble shooting the
 compatibility by navigating to the local game file via Windows (Right click&gt;troubleshoot compatibility).</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reminder : This article was started back when Windows 10 was in beta aka "Technical Preview", so there might be different experiences for different people. Especially as time progresses and updates of the official copy of Windows 10 continue to roll
 out. For the most part though, I've continued to see no issues with Windows 10 being on my dedicated gaming rig. - 1/15/2016</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10 has officially been rolled out. If your copy "isn't ready yet", try directly installing via their
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool as found on their website</a>. If you'd like to add benchmark numbers or pictures, please feel free to do so. Hopefully this becomes more of a thread and less of a list I feel obligated to update.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">If you're helping out by adding to the list,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">PLEASE POST YOUR SPECS!</span></p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most games will be initial test only, not a play through. If you have anything to contribute please feel free to do so and I will focus on other games. I will list my specs, as sometimes different set-ups (graphic cards etc) have different issues. So be
 sure to post your specs in your response. I will try to keep this organized as possible. Because I run crossfire, I will be sure to double check all games in single card mode after I get issues. If anyone feels like this thread is pointless or we have most
 games running with no issues, I reckon I'll just ask an admin to remove this thread. I have 190+ games I will be testing (initial, some play through). I just recently did rigorous testing on all my hardware, so my hardware itself should be fine and is all
 less than 2 months old. All games NOT tested by me will be tagged with posters handle. Poster should post their rig's specs along with their original post.
<strong>This list is no longer updated on the main page, readers will have to search the replies for specific answers. You can also use the search tool on this site or google for specific issues. OR reply to the OP and join the discussion. - 1/15/16</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL the incompatible games can be conveniently found in the "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_perf/windows-10-incompatible-games-list/c12850f5-6072-4420-a34d-e98e40797d82?tm=1423805379440">Incompatible Games
 List</a>". </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please still comment with "Playable" or "Not Playable" games in this (Windows 10 Compatible Games) thread (the one you are currently viewing) and I will transfer the non-playable ones to the other list at a later time. I will still tag you in whatever
 games you add to the list. Credit will be given where credit is due.</em></p>

    <title>How to convert codec video files into window media files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeanniegirl1958  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to convert codec video files into window media files</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately my pocket pc converted my video files into mp4 file types and windows media player on my computer will not convert them to play them. I found out through many searches that I must buy another program that does this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just don't&nbsp;appreciate this scenario by windows. Why would they have their pocket pc's do something to files that they know regular window computers can't run? I think that it's very deceiving and disruptive of my time.</p>

<p>I think the thread starter talks about movies that are recorded with the on-board camera. These are 3ggp or M4V movies, for which Windows desktop OS generally misses a codec to play these files. Also the MP4-containerformat
 used by these movies generally gives problems with Desktop Media Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I play the movies with MPlayer (see <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html</a>), downloading the Windows GUI&nbsp;version will give you a player which plays basically any known format on the planet.</p>

<h2>            Problem sending emails with excel attachments</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>Having trouble recently sending emails with excel attachments. Im on my laptop with Windows 7 Ultimate. Couple of facts that might help in your response, the excel spredsheets are macro enabled, i have recently had issues accessing my email and had to reset
 my password. Since them i noticed the phone number for my account is an old number and i couldnt get a verification code as i cant find how to change my number, do you think i am limited to what i can send now because i didnt verify by text?? im lost and need
 to be able to send these emails as they are for work and i could always send them with no issues before i done password reset. The message that displays when i try to send the email is "We cannot connect to Outlook.com right now. Please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for anyone that can help me </p>

<p>
</p><p>This was meant as a query for some sort of support from microsoft, not a moderator of a user forum. I have found no phone numbers or contact emails for technical support, and don't know if they exist, which tells me microsoft/live/outlook doesn't value the
 opinions of it's users. Especially when they alter the access to its services, which is the source of my problem. It's interesting to me that the pathway to use the email services has been changed, and the only way to voice constructive criticism is through
 a general forum where the mods are overly sensitive</p>

    <title>Sharepoint Permission bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sumitdas7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint Permission bug</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Q1.</p>
<p>If we &nbsp;create a group with basic read access and set the group members as the group owner.Then as per logic the group members with only read access can add new persons to the group.(Though they have to know the direct group url).So a person with read access
 can add user to a site.<br />
By the same logic a person who have only read access to the site can be set up as a owner for full control groups.<br />
<br />
is this by design or a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q2.<br />
When ever a SCA or site Owner shares a site,the person to whom it got shared receives a invitation mail.<br />
But when a person with read access shares the site using the previous mentioned method the mail does not get triggered.Does it is a expected behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For both of the sharing,the invitation mail text area &nbsp;is coming and we are filling it.But for SCA and site owner its getting triggered and for &nbsp;another cases it is not</p>

<p><span>Hi Sumitdas7,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, it sounds like that you created a group site and grant users the Read permissions. If yes, generally if the users are only granted the Read permissions, he will be unable to add users and set him as the group owner.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To clarify the scenario in your environment, I’d like you to do the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. How many users are there experiencing the issue? Check and let us know the outcome if you grant a new user the Read permission.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Upload some screenshots showing the affected users’ permissions in the group sites.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>About the question 2, what site do you share? Does the issue happen in the specific user with the Read permission? Generally, the users invited by the shared user can receive the invite emails when the site administrator approves the sharing. So please
 check if the&nbsp;</span>site administrator approves the sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What do you mean about “</span><span>For both of the sharing,the invitation mail text area &nbsp;is coming and we are filling it.But for SCA and site owner its getting triggered and for &nbsp;another cases it is not</span>”? Could you upload some screenshots
 and some examples?</p>

            Sorry If I was not entirely clear while asking the question<br />
<br />
Q1.<br />
I cannot provide the screen shots as It will violate our company policy.The scenario is, for a team site there are many &nbsp;permission &nbsp;groups available in People and Groups.I will work with 3 groups.<br />
a.OWNER(full control to the site ) &nbsp;b.Contribute (contribute access to the site ) c.Visitor(read access to the site).<br />
<br />
Lets say <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> is a member of <strong>Visitor </strong>
group and he is the <strong>Group Owner</strong> of the same group.So as a group owner he can add new member to the Visitor group.So when he is adding a new member to Visitor group,he is basically providing &nbsp;Read access to the new user &nbsp;for the team site.<br />
<br />
As per Sharepoint permission policy only &nbsp;owner(full control)/sca can provide access to the site.But here in this case a user with Read access also able to provide access.So my question is,is this a bug or a expected behavior.<br />
<br />
Q2.<br />
Now lets say the SCA of the site adding *** Email address is removed for privacy *** user to the Visitor group.Here the invitation mail is getting triggered and&nbsp;<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is receiving the mail.<br />
<br />
But regarding our previous scenario when *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is adding *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to the Visitor group,then the invitation mail is not triggering.This scenario is replicable when ever a user with less than fullcontrol/sca access providing access to another
 user(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***),though the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is getting access to the site he is not receiving the invitation mail.The mail fuction is not even triggering

<p><span>Hi Sumitdas7,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, it seems that you grant the user the Full Control permission and the Read permission as you set the use as the group owner. So he can add users as members and grant permissions.
</span></p>
<p>

            Cliff, you're missing the point. Group owner and full control permissions are 2 separate things. A user with read permission can be made a group owner. Sounds like Msft didn't think this through properly.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>actually we are not providing full control access.we are adding a user with read permission as the group owner.Because in SP there is no permission restrictions for &nbsp;who can be a group owner.</p>
<p>So here a user with read access is becoming the group owner.His permission stays same as before.Once he becoming the group owner he is adding new members.So in a way a user with read access is providing another user access to the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the mail it is not depending on the receiver permission.When sca or owner adding any user to the site,the added user gets the mail.But if a user with read/contribute permission adds another user then the receiver not receiving the mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All users are internal and newly added users are getting to access properly.Only when they are added by a user with read/contribute permission they are getting added to the site,but not receiving mails.If required I can share the steps</p>

<p><span>Hi Sumitdas7,</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, if a user with the Read permission is set as the group owner, he should have the Full Control permission. So what you have encountered is an expected
 behavior. Please navigate to the Site permissions&gt;Advanced permissions settings&gt;Check permissions to check the affected users’ permissions and capture a screenshot of the page for our clarification.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About the issue 2, confirm what site the issue happens in and list the reproducing steps for our troubleshooting. If you are talking about a team site, check
 if the site administrator approves the sharing.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cliff</p>

<p>thanks for the reply cliff.I will provide the screenshots and complete steps to replicate on tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here we are adding all the &nbsp;"group members" as the group owners.Here in SharePoint groups we can specify a single group as an onwer.so we are having the read access group itself &nbsp;as its owner.</p>
<p>You have mentioned "<span>Generally, if a user with the Read permission is set as the group owner, he should have the Full Control permission.".</span></p>
<p><span>So if I add the the group(read access permission group) &nbsp;itself as the owner does all members of the group will be having full control access?</span></p>
<p>I have checked multiple times and I can surely confirm after adding as a group owner the users does not&nbsp;</p>
<p>get any full control access. Their permission level stays same.they can add new users to the group but in site level their permission stays the same as Read.This is true for single person made as a group owner</p>

            This sounds like a faulty design. If a group with read permissions can be made a group owner shouldn't an alert be given if permissions are then changed for members of the group? Or better yet, shouldn't this action be blocked with an alert that you need
 to manually change permissions first? &nbsp;

<p>Question1</p>
<p>1.Login Into the site using Farm Account</p>
<p>2.Go to People Groups and Create a new Group <strong>"TestRead"</strong></p>
<p><br />
3.Set Group owner as the <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>.<strong>User1 </strong>
does not have any other permission in the site.Set the permission Level as "<strong>Read</strong>".For "Who can edit the membership of the group? " ,set group member.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.Save ..Add <strong>User1 </strong>in "<strong>TestRead</strong>".<br />
</p>
<p>5.Check the permission of User1 and it will show as "Read".<br />
</p>
<p>6.Open "<strong>TestRead</strong>" &nbsp;group again and the Copy the group "<strong>TestRead</strong>" URL.This is important as the user with read access wont be able to go people and groups via settings page.They have to directly visit group<br />
</p>
<p>7.Logout and open the site using <strong>User1 </strong>credential.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.Paste the group Url in the browser.Though User1 having Read access only,he is the owner of the "TestRead" group.He adds *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to the site.The User2 now can access the site with Read permission.<br />
</p>
<p>9.Now we have set "Read".For "Who can edit the membership of the group? " as &nbsp;"Group member",any user who is added to the site can add a new user.So in a way user with Read access can provide access to another user in the site<br />
<br />
*****I have verified all the users permission and they only have "Read Access" in the site.NOT FULL CONTROL.IF YOU ADD ANY USER AS A SITE GROUP OWNER,his permission will be same as the group.Not Full control</p>

<h2>            Lumia 2520 Screen Flickers</h2>
                    
<p>I'm experiencing a screen flicker with my Lumia 2520. It only happens when I try to play certain games. I've tried turning off the auto brghtness, but it still does it. Previously, if I closed the app and went back in it would fix it. Now it doesn't. Very
 annoying. Any suggestions on what to try?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>TheGimper,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the forum!&nbsp;:cathappy:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Yes. All games were downloaded from the Windows App store. Some of the games are WordTwist, Microsoft Treasure Hunt, Microsoft Mahjong, Microsoft Minesweeper, Jewel Fever. It seems to happy only when the battery is very low (even with the charger connected).</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, . Have you also tried checking the battery saving settings of your Lumia 2520?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try looking for <strong>battery saving settings </strong>using the<strong> Search
</strong>function. Swipe from the rightmost corner of the tablet's display, and then tap
<strong>Search</strong>. Once done, tap the <strong>'Change battery settings'</strong> option in the list of search results. You'll be redirected to the&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel items &gt; Power options</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under <strong>Choose or customize a power plan</strong>, select <strong>Change plan settings</strong> under
<strong>Balanced</strong>. And then, choose <strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>. Tap on&nbsp;<strong>Display</strong>, select
<strong>Enable adaptive brightness</strong>,and then&nbsp;choose your preferred settings. After this, monitor the Lumia 2520's performance and see if it'll improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it will go.&nbsp;:cathappy:</p>

<h2>            Why are there symbols on the bottom left of my icons and how to I remove them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Here is one screenshot where gray squares cover up part of the icons, it does this to almost all of my thumbnails and I'd like to get rid of them. By the way, I am using Windows 10 Home 64bit Insider Edition Build: 183621 if that helps.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PS: I originally&nbsp;put this under the normal Windows 10 section because I thought that's where it belonged but I was told to move it here. I tried to edit the original message and delete it but when I did it said "Sorry your request couldn't be completed
 please try again later," so I'm sorry about that.</p>

            Hi Kyle
<br />
<br />Those icon overlays are created by Norton 360, to indicate the status of your backup . . .
<br />
<br />Those overlays mean those files are excluded form the backup, because those are just executables, not files . . .

            Those are Norton backup overlays which indicate those files are ignored when the backup is run.
<br />You can turn off overlay from within the Norton program iirc.

<p>MSE will get updates and be there anyway and having a 3rd party antivirus alone is not any problem, as long as it's not a zillion of them. Like it was pointed out, go into trhe programs settings and change them there. The reason those symbols are there is
 because it's likely they didn't remove any exclusions from the default state or???</p>

<h2>            Excel online won&#39;t open in Excel program</h2>
                    When in my OneDrive, I have a few Excel files that I'm unable to open in Excel for Windows. Until a few days ago, it was able to open in the program itself, and now it tries to open the "search" function on my computer instead of opening the actual program.
 It'll open in a browser just fine, but that's not how I want to work on the document.&nbsp;

            I usually use Microsoft Edge, but I haven't tried in other browsers. Office is updated as I had problems with it month or so ago and had to uninstall/reinstall everything and keep up with the updates. I don't have the file on my computer, it's only in
 the cloud. This is what happens when I try to open the file I need from OneDrive and selecting to open it in Excel and not the Excel Browser.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f3245bc-cd15-41aa-9196-143ed9cd3381?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f3245bc-cd15-41aa-9196-143ed9cd3381?upload=true" /></a>

<h2>            Centering on the screen a MS 2013 Publisher Website</h2>
                    I have built a website using MS Publisher 2013 and it appears to the far left side of the screen and wish to have it centered.&nbsp; How do I do this?

            <p>Publisher web pages are fixed width and left justified by default.&nbsp;If you want centered pages the only way we have found to do it over the years is to edit the code directly after you produce it. However you can simulate centered pages. Read the following
 article for a description of one way to do that.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><font>Reference: Understanding background padding in a Publisher web (aka whitespace):<br />
</font></span><a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/dbartosik/archive/2006/01/07/80563.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://msmvps.com/blogs/dbartosik/archive/2006/01/07/80563.aspx</font></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the centering pages workaround, here is&nbsp;a set of directions if you choose to try it: (I haven't tried it with Pub 2013 code, but assume it will work.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you "Publish to the Web" direct the output (the index.htm file and the index_files folder if you are using the subfolder option) to a folder on your computer where you can find it. Each of your *.htm files requires adding a centering code after the
 existing&nbsp; &lt;/head&gt; code.<br />
<br />
Method 1: Manual method.<br />
<br />
Go to the folder on your computer where you directed your web files.<br />
<br />
Open each *.htm file in NotePad by right clicking the file &gt; open with &gt; NotePad. If you are using the subfolder option in Pub 2003 or 2007, your index.htm file is your home page, and your other *.htm files for your other pages are usually contained in a subfolder
 called "index_files".<br />
<br />
Find the &lt;/head&gt; code, and replace with:<br />
<br />
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="760"align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<br />
<br />
If you are using a page width that is different than 760 pixels, change the width in the code string with the width of your web pages. Close NotePad and save the changes. If you are using inches for measurement, multiply the width in inches by 96 and use that
 number.<br />
<br />
After editing the code on each *.htm file, you can upload your files to your host.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Semi-automatic method.<br />
<br />
With this method you can find the &lt;/head&gt; code, and replace it with the revised code string in each *.htm file semi-automatically.<br />
<br />
Download and install the free "Replace In Files" program:<br />
<a href="http://www.emurasoft.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emurasoft.com/index.htm</a><br />
<br />
Open "Replace in Files". The four boxes in the "Replace in Files" program require the following information:<br />
<br />
Find: &lt;/head&gt;<br />
<br />
Replace with: &lt;/head&gt;&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="760"align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<br />
(Note: the code string may wrap in this message, but it is one line. Also change the width to the pixel width of your web pages. If you are using inches for measurement, multiply the width in inches by 96 and use that number.)<br />
<br />
File Types: *.htm<br />
<br />
In Folder: Use the ... button to browse to the folder where you directed your web files on your computer when you Publish to Web.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you are using a subfolder, check the box at the bottom "Replace in Subfolders".<br />
<br />
Click "Replace All", and you should get a "Finished" dialog that will confirm the replaced strings of code for each *.htm file/page in your web files.<br />
<br />
After editing the code you can upload your index.htm file and your index_files folder to your host.<br />
<br />
You will have to run Replace in Files each time you modify your Pub file and produce new web files. However, once the options in Replace in Files are filled out and the "Replace all" is selected, the entries are retained for the next time you use the program.
 Also once you get this process to work correctly it is an easy two click process in the future.</p>

<h2>            Unable to change battery saver options.</h2>
                    I am unable to change battery saver options for Facebook messenger in Windows phone 8.1. I was able to, before I uninstalled the app. I've installed it again, but I can't change the settings. What do I do?

            <p>Has there been an update for that app since the 8.1 update? it could be the developer has to enable some part of that functionality in their app. I'm not running 8.1 yet myself so can't verify.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be worth contacting the app developer to see if this is the case. Do other apps respect such exemptions to the battery saver mode?</p>

 to exit the app with windows key instead of suspending it.</p>

    <title>Rights-managed documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip colmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rights-managed documents</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows Phone running Mango. We are using Exchange 2007 with Office 2010 and a corporate PKI. The phone is an LG E-900, connected to Vodafone. The specific OS version is 7.10.7720.68.</p>
<p>I have created a Word document and use Rights Management to protect the document. I email that document to myself and it shows up in the Inbox on the phone. If I try to open the document, I get the following pop-up message:</p>
<p><em>Need credentials</em></p>

<p><em>We need to connect to &lt;URL&gt; and verify your credentials before we can open this document.</em></p>

<p><em>Should we use your "Outlook" username and password?</em></p>

<p>I tap on Yes. I then get:</p>
<p><em>Can't open</em></p>

<p><em>There's a problem that we can't solve at the moment. Please try reopening the document.</em></p>

<p><em>Error code = 8004cf48.</em></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the first time I tried to open the document, I was given the expected security warning (because the PKI hierarchy wasn't trusted). I said it was OK to proceed but it continued to pop up the same message. Whilst I was starting
 to type this message, the lock screen kicked in. When I unlocked the phone, Word was just sitting there without the pop up message but apparently not doing anything. I had to turn the phone off and on to recover.</p>
<p>I've also tried this by installing the root CA's certificate. This bypasses the "untrusted" bit but still gets me to the Can't open screen.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Philip</p>

            <p>I've resolved this now.</p>
<p>The underlying issue was permissions on the files executed on the RMS server. Not all of the files had permissions inherited, particularly the mobile device certification file, but when I re-set the security permissions and rebooted the server, the phone
 was able to access rights-managed documents from email and SkyDrive.</p>
<p>Hope that helps anyone else that encounters this.</p>

<p><span>Hi Mburwell,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your feedback.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As your problem occurred after you installed and uninstalled Skype for Business, then I recommend you can
 try to clear the cache of Skype for Business. For detailed steps, please follow below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Paste
</span><span>“</span><strong><span>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync</span></strong><span>”</span><span>
 in the search box of <strong>File </strong>and press<strong> Enter</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>2. Delete
<strong>sip_profileName</strong> folder.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Delete files in
<strong>Tracing</strong> folder but not the folder itself.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Open command prompt and run “<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, we are glad to further help you, but if the issue persists, as Oliver has mentioned, we
 have ended support for Office 2013. Then for better using experience, we highly recommend you can update to latest Office series to do business, which won’t affect your personal data, and if you have further concerns after updating to the Office 2016, we will
 continue to help you here. I am highly appreciated for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Betty</span></p>

<p>Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thx.&nbsp; Sadly that did not cure the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no Lync folder at&nbsp;<span><strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync, though there was one at&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</strong><span><span>.&nbsp;
 within that Lync folder </span><span>t</span></span></span></span>here was no sip_profileName folder to delete.&nbsp; I did all the other actions you suggested on that Lync folder, but that did not remove the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried removing the internet file "<strong>setupskypeforbusinessentryretail.x86.en-us_(1).exe_Rules</strong>" that I found in&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0.&nbsp;
</strong>That also did not solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Any other ideas?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>BR,</span></p>

<p>Hi Mburwell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand that you have Office 365 for Business account, right? If so, in order to check the Outlook client and the iCloud for Windows sync issue, I recommend you try to
<a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhelp%2F4026923%2Fwindows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C20869fff9a9e48f4684e08d67d2916b6%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636834012899991022&amp;sdata=F3Q6EJ0rCxj2AYsEIlHkTqvHTdF%2BU1N1RNrvtCWeXaA%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new user account</a> in Windows at first, and then use Office 365 for Business account to install new Office 365 suits on
<a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.office.com%2F%3Fauth%3D2%26home%3D1&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C20869fff9a9e48f4684e08d67d2916b6%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636834012900001030&amp;sdata=U6S4nu1cUyy%2BFNj6GCXe%2Fnmu%2F6deukT9TJVrv2xcghE%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office portal</a>(Click <strong>Install Office</strong> &gt; <strong>Office 365 apps</strong>). Finally, add iCloud for Windows to the latest Outlook 2016 to check whether your problem still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists in Outlook 2016 client, as the current thread focuses on Outlook 2013, which had stopped supporting, we recommend you post a new thread in this forum so that we can better analyze and deal with your problem. I am
 grateful for your cooperation and understanding. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
