</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you referring to contacts under

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With the new Skype, there is no option to delete call history under the Calls tab. You can delete the conversation from the Chats screen as a workaround
 but the calls are retained in the application.</span></p>

    <title>What passkey should I enter on my phone to connect it to my PC using - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrjim52  say:</h3>
<h2>            What passkey should I enter on my phone to connect it to my PC using Bluetooth&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to connect my flip phone to my Windows 8.1 PC using Bluetooth so that I can send pictures from the phone to the PC. Although Bluetooth is enabled on both devices and the phone shows up as "ready to pair" in the Bluetooth sub-panel in PC and
 Devices section of Control Panel, the phone is prompting me for a passkey in order to connect. The first time I tried this, Windows displayed a passcode that I should use. However,&nbsp;every time I try, I get a&nbsp;"connection failed"&nbsp;message on the phone when I enter&nbsp;that
 code&nbsp;into the phone's Passkey field. Can I change the passkey? It was only displayed the first time I tried to connect the two devices. If I hadn't written it down, I wouldn't know what passkey to enter.

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Jayant. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth is enabled and running on the PC and on the phone. The phone icon is displayed in the Manage Bluetooth Devices screen, the PC icon&nbsp;is displayed on my phone's screen, but&nbsp;Windows 8.1&nbsp;simply won't connect the two devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked for a driver update for Dell Wireless 1705 Bluetooth and it responded that I already have the most recent driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when I go to the Manage Bluetooth Devices screen and click "Pair" in the "Ready to Pair" box, by the time I enter the passcode that is displayed on the Windows screen into my phone, it changes to another number, and both the PC and the
 phone give me a message that it's invalid&nbsp;after I click "Pair" on the phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried manually entering 1234 into the passcode field on the screen and in my phone's passcode field&nbsp;and when I click Next on the PC, it displays "That passcode&nbsp;isn't right. Try again" The phone also gives me a failure to connect message when I click "Pair."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong? Is there a way to permanently set a Bluetooth passcode in Windows?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Update, 12/22/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get two different phones to pair with the PC but was only able to send photos from one of them. The phone that successfully sends photos doesn't require a passcode after pairing. The way to connect to the phone that prompts for a passcode is
 to get the code from the PC, type it into the phone, and click "Pair." Most of the time it fails, but a couple of times it was successful. But even after successfully pairing, when I tried to send&nbsp;a photo, I got a "Can't connect" message. Bluetooth simply
 isn't usable for this purpose.</p>

            <p>The Share will give visibility to the folder on the network and by default any contained folder, you can't "unshare" a nested folder because it is not actually shared in it own right anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to define security permissions to restrict access to a specific subfolder by removing the automatically inherited permissions for that subfolder and assign specific permissions instead. The user would be able to see the restricted folder
 but if they tried to open it would get permission denied messages.</p>

            <p>I am sorry but it is. There are two separate status involved with a share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sharing permission when applied to a folder makes all subfolders within that folder accessible but the individual subfolders are not shared directly. You can also share any subfolder individually if you wish to apply separate sharing rights but they will
 still all be visible through the parent folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example folder A is shared with subfolders B, C, and D. If a user has sharing permissions for A they will see B, C, D. If D is also shared a different user may have access to D but not A so also cannot see B or C</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot unshare B or C because they are not individually shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Completely separate to Sharing Permissions are Security Permissions, one problem is by default some versions of Windows do not show the Security Tab. Security Permissions are defined on a per user basis and in the majority of cases subfolders inherit security
 rights from its parent folder so whichever users has access to folder A will have access to folders B, C, and D. In this case you can add additional rights to a subfolder as well as the inherited rights but if the inherit right option is in place you cannot
 remove one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove an inherited right there is an option to remove automatically inherited rights and assign rights specifically to a folder. If folder A (note, not Share A) has user W, X, and Y with permissions to read the folder then inherited rights are applied
 to B, C, and D. While that is in force you can add user Z to folder D but not remove X, Y, or W. To remove user W you have to remove that inherit flag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is this separation of Share Permissions and Security Permissions that is the cause of so many "Access Denied" messages.</p>

            <p>Then the problem has be down to security permissions. For users to have access to files on another PC in a workgroup the user accounts on each of the PCs has to exist on the Sharing PC (the one holding the files i.e. Windows 7 PC) including the passwords
 used if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why Microsoft recommends that the maximum workgroup is 10 PCs/Users because every PC has to have the users of all other PCs configured on them and if a user changes his password on his own PC the password on every other PC in the workgroup has to
 be changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you do not enter a password and the PC logs on automatically it will have at least a username. Use the
<strong>Set </strong>command in a DOS box to verify the currently logged on user for each PC and check if that user has access at a share level and a security level.</p>

<h2>            Moving files within a folder</h2>
                    How do you move files within a folder.&nbsp; Example: I have multiple pictures in a folder and would like to move them in a specific order.&nbsp; In my last version of windows, I just clicked on it and moved it to where I wanted it.&nbsp; Now, it just pops back to where
 it was.&nbsp; Help, this is very inconvenient.

            Hey there, t662s38   
<br /> I see what your wanting to do.
<br />
<br />So your wanting to order your pictures within the folder, to where you want them. Hopefully I have understood correctly. 
<br />
<br />If I have, and this is something your wanting to do, then you can organize them by changing the sort by option under the View tab to Name or something else on the list of available options. Click onto View &gt; Sort by to bring up this option. 
<br />
<br />If your wanting to click onto the picture and folder and move them to a particular place on the list - within the same folder - then this is not possible at the moment. You can submit feedback about this by typing Feedback into Cortana and launching the feedback app. 
<br />
<br />I would love to be able to do that, and can see it been a popular feature. 
<br />
<br />Hope this  helps, 
<br />Regards,

<p>I have recently been having trouble running Windows Experience Index to rate my laptop... I keep getting a warning saying:
</p>
<div>
<div>"Unable to rate system</div>
<div>Video playback error"</div>
<div>---</div>
<div>It seems to be an MF.dll error... Someone said the MF.dll file that was already there in my OS was most likely corrupted by repeated software installing and uninstalling or by a virus/malware... I looked online for a solution to this and everywhere it
 says to replace the existing MF.dll file in System32 folder with a known good copy of it... I don't want to download an MF.dll file from some websites like dll-files.com or dll-dump or something along those lines as I don't trust them and I'm afraid of viruses
 or worse - messing up my operating system...</div>

<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use the arrow keys to choose Repair your Computer in the Windows Advanced Boot Menu Options and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select Command Prompt from the System Recovery Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Command Prompt window type “sfc /scannow” (without quotes) and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer after it is done and check for the issue.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to perform startup repair using Windows 8 DVD.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>a) Boot from the disk, Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option “Install now”</span></p>
<p>
<span>b) Click on Repair your computer</span></p>
<p>
<span>c) On the next page click on Advanced Options</span></p>
<p>
<span>d) Now click on Troubleshoot</span></p>
<p>
<span>e) Lastly click on Startup repair and follow the on screen instructions</span></p>
<span>This may take 15 to 20 minutes to repair. Once completed try to login to your desktop<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</span><br />

<h2>            Error 0xc00d11cd &#40;0x8000ffff&#41; Playback stopps after every Track</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>XBox Music stopps playback after every played Track and this Errormessage appears at every following Track. I can start playback of every Track manually, but after one Track the Error appears again.</p>
<p>This happens with all Music, no matter if it is Streaming or a locally saved mp3.</p>
<p>I tried to reinstall the MusicApp and also "refreshed" the Tablet (the Thing without loosing Data), didn't work.</p>
<p>I also checked the Region Settings of my Account and of the Tablet as mentioned as a possible solution by XBox.com/Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would be nice, if anybody could help me with this Problem,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>greetings,</p>
<p>Mig</p>

<p>Hi Mig,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the app troubles. Let's see what we can do. <br />
<br />
I would suggest uninstalling the app once more, by following the directions below.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the app’s tile<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select “Uninstall” and confirm<br />
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Metro UI, type “WSReset.exe” and press enter<br />
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you see a confirmation the store cache has been reset, reinstall the app<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey Mig,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strange that the same solution didn't work a second time. You mentioned you tried some troubleshooting steps already, were they the steps listed <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/apps/windows-8/windows-8-error-c00d11cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>?&nbsp;<br /><br />Could you also make sure that your device is a listed device on your account under the <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Devices/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage Xbox Music &nbsp;Devices</a> page?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, this is the troubleshooting I used at first.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Tablet is not listed as a Music Device. So maybe I just have to wait till the 4Devices/Month limitations resets?</p>
<p>There are only my laptop and Lumia800 listed there. Strange thing since the Lumina 800 doesn't even has Xbox Music support with Wp7...</p>

<p>Hey there Mig,<br />
<br />
I've done some digging on this and found a few things that may help get it resolved:<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span><br />
Let's first run the app troubleshooter and check if it helps. You may download and run the troubleshooter from the following link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span><br />

<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span><br />
If the second method didn't fix the issue you may create a new local account and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Refer to these steps to create a local account:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>a) Press ‘<strong>Windows + W’&nbsp;</strong>key to search&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong>Users</strong>” without quotes and press&nbsp;<strong>enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) To create new user account click on the&nbsp;<strong>plus sign (+) ‘Add a User’.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>d) Select ‘<strong>Don’t want this user to sign in with Microsoft account?’</strong></span></p>
<p><span>e) Click on ‘<strong>Local account’&nbsp;</strong>button.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Enter the&nbsp;<strong>User name&nbsp;</strong>and click on ‘<strong>Next’&nbsp;</strong>button and click on ‘<strong>Finish’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>g)&nbsp;<strong>Restart&nbsp;</strong>the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>h) Check if the issue occurs or not.</span></p>

<p>Hey guys, I have the same problem that Mig369 has on my laptop, but on a slightly bigger scale.</p>
<p>The problem is that I can't play any music and no videos on the app. I tried to play videos on the media player, but the sound is gone. Even when I try to watch videos on youtube, same thing, no sound.</p>
<p>I thought that it's probably the work of a virus, so I did a full system scan... and I was right, because I did find a virus in the system and I removed it. But I think that the virus might have done some damage to my PC before it got removed. So the question
 is... what do I do???</p>

<p>Hey there Blood</p>
<p>Welcome to the Xbox Community forums<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>I would advise you to uninstall the Application and re install it back onto your computer. However, please note that in some operating systems like Windows 8.1. You will not be able to uninstall the Music App nor the Video App (As far as I know) because
 they are integrated into the Windows Operating System. (I believe it is just like OneDrive).</p>
<p>However, if you can uninstall and re install the software, then that will bring any files back that have been corrupted and/or deleted by the virus.</p>
<p>I would also advise that you try and follow the suggestions that the Xbox Support staff have stated above, to try and resolve this issue. However if that does not work, then please post back</p>
<p>Also by the looks of your question. The virus could have damaged or removed your sound driver that is&nbsp;installed on your Computer and/or Device. To confirm this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to get sound from any Application from your PC or device? </li><li>Is your sound or audio working? </li><li>Have you tried playing sound through a working head set on your device? </li><li>Is the sound muted on your PC via the task bar, or in the Application its self
</li></ol>
<p>If the sound is not working:</p>
<ol>
<li>What version of Windows are you using? </li><li>Have you tried to do a System Restore on the last saved restore point on your PC or Device?
</li><li>What programs did you last install onto your computer, or email did you open. Viruses come in all shapes and sizes, even through email attachments. This is why I always stress;
</li></ol>
<p>I will try my best to help you with your issue. However, I am only a community member.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Click Run</p>
<p>Type: wsreset.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make sure they say installed in "your apps"</p>

<h2>            Wordpad 5.1 to Wordpad 6.1 Print Preview&#47;Print Discrepancies</h2>
                    <p>Hi-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At my company we currently have some users that have upgraded to Windows 7 and the others are still on an older version of XP.
</p>
<p>The XP users have access to Wordpad 5.1 and the Windows 7 users have Wordpad 6.1.&nbsp; We have dat files that we use to print out invoices with Wordpad.&nbsp; In the 5.1 version of Wordpad everything looks fine in print preview and prints exactly how the format appears
 in print preview.&nbsp; When opening the same dat files in Wordpad 7.1&nbsp; they look the same using print preview but when they print out ,the invoices are all mis-formatted.&nbsp; Does anyone know why if the print preview looks correct that it would print incorrectly?&nbsp;
 I have mirrored the 5.1 setup options to the machines running Wordpad 7.1 and still have the same issue with the formatting changing once printed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Matt</p>

            If you have configured a policy like preventing updates to install during active hours or controlling updates using policy, the message would appear.

            This appears to be normal after the 1803 update, if you have active hours set then whenever there is an update this message appears.
<br />All that is required is to restart the PC to finish the update &amp; the message will disappear once logged in.

<p>Interesting...so all users that have updated to version 1803 (I confirmed my Installed version is 1803).....will be seeing this alert...."Some settings are being managed by your organization"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems misleading...at best.&nbsp; I have worked with Microsoft Support 2 different agents....who need to be educated that this is Normal....they did everything you can ..I could image....changed some settings; added Text in Registry, even had me Install New copy
 of Win10 (keeping all personal apps and settings)....and of course, none of these resolved...got rid of this Alert.&nbsp; There is aslo another similar Alert, All Settings/Privacy/Diagnostic and Feedback....it also displays alert in Red&nbsp; "Some settings are hidden
 or managed by your Organization".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is norm for 1803...Microsoft needs to change...as it is confusing to the end customer.&nbsp; First thing Microsoft Support asked, is your PC connected to Your Workplace...which is what these Alerts seem to mean......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other with version 1803....let's us know if your PC displays these Alerts...Thanks</p>

            If the message is seen elsewhere - usually diagnostic &amp; feedback - then you use group policy editor to get rid of it which requires Windows 10 pro or via regedit.

<h3> preston park  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restarting Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Enterprise. Windows Explorer locks up - the start menu won't open, can't launch applications, can't start task manager from the taskbar (ctrl-alt-delete works) - until I restart Windows Explorer from the Task Manager. My current computer (Computer
 2) is an hp EliteDesk with 16GB of memory. My previous computer (Computer 1) was a fair bit older with only 8GB of memory and it behaved exactly the same way. Computer 1 was upgraded from Windows 7. Computer 2 was given a clean install. The only thing in common
 between the two is Windows 10 Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing these issues? Is there anything I can do other than wait for service packs to be released?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 64bit - Touchpad Scroll problem, Works in File Explorer but not in control panel or Store</h2>
                    <p>Lenovo Thinkpad R500 - Touchpad scroll works in Internet Explorer, Firefox, File Explorer, Device manager, Help and som other places, but it does not work in Start menu or any menu under Control panel, Edge or Windows Store - no matter what I have tried
 it simply will not Scroll - There is no doubt this a <strong>BUG</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution or Fixit for this odd behaviour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing without really knowing it, that most of the user interface windows like Store and Control panel and Start menu is linked to Edge and that is the one having the bug. Like some linux distro's have chromium integrated and if removed it crashes
 because that is Engine that runs it all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can answer this cause it driving me nuts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With kind regards</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to boot computer in Safe mode and check if issue persist.<br />
Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809468</span></a></p>
<div>
<p>Note:&nbsp; To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.<br />
If the computer works fine in safe mode, Perform a Clean boot<br />
Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".<br />
Note: The troubleshooting steps in the above links are meant for windows 8, however, you can use the same for windows 10 tech preview as well.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also please make sure you have all&nbsp; the Windows udpates installed on your computer.</div>
<div><br />
Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</div>

            <p>Hello, it would be helpful if you support engineers actually read the whole question before answering!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs not working: Start Menu, Store, Edge, and anything under System - basically all with the new Metro UI.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all other programs the scroll work great, even in Internet Explorer, Firefox, File Explorer, Device manager, Help, old control panel and anything else under windows key + x, Programs and features, Services and task manager + many more - So I fail to see
 how it can be HW/Driver issue - Clearly an MS bug and not HW/Driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But convincing MS to take an extra look "under the hood" has always been very difficult.<br />
</p>
<p>Safe mode will disable the drivers that actually works! So, not a solution!</p>

            <p>Since it would seem that you got offended and no longer are interested in helping, i have moved to another forum that actually are interested in helping:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tenforums.com/drivers-hardware/16061-touchpad-scroll-work-firefox-explorer-but-not-store-edge.html#post339397</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time you answer someone, make sure you read the question first and don't dish out some standard solution, like you guys are infamous for. The safe mode solution you came up with, I would expect from someone not knowing what the heck they were doing.
 A real tech would know that, the drivers controlling scroll will not load in safe mode - thereby no scroll at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of support ticks me off, please learn and don't do it again!</p>

<div>When I locate the drive and double click it, it says "windows can't open this file".</div>

<div>when I clicked on "Computer" as a hard disk drive next to the "Acer C", but then when</div>

<p>I have a few questions, and will provide a solution that may be an immediate, short term fix for the problem.</p>
<p><b>What size is your hard drive (4 GIG or 250 GIG) and how much space is left on it?</b></p>
<p><b>Have you downloaded anything recently, marketplace content or update?</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If so, did you experience any issues with the download, or usage of the content?</b></p>
<p><b>Do you have any external memory units connected to the console, or any non-Microsoft peripheral devices connected to the console?</b></p>
<p><b>Does this issue only transpire when you are connected to Xbox live, and began after the Spring update?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Quick Fix Solution:</span></b></p>
<p>Without singing into an account, go to the system settings menu: this can be access quickly by clicking the guide button in the center of the controller, navigating to the settings blade, and selecting system settings. &nbsp;Once on the system settings menu,
 navigate to memory and press <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A</span></span>. &nbsp;You will need to highlight your memory unit or hard drive, if it is not already highlighter, and press
<span>Y</span>. &nbsp;You will select "clear system cache". &nbsp;The operation should be fairly quick. &nbsp;Once complete, you will restart the console and attempt to log in again.<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;I
 will monitor this thread for a response.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Second Hard drive not showing under My Computer Win.7</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>I've installed a second hard drive in my pc but it does not show under my computer. If i go in the BOIS it picks up the second hard drive and under disk management you can see it but when i try to format it,i can only select help (all the other options is
 faded out) and the hard drive shows offline and there is no drive letter.</p>
<p>I did try disk part in the command prompt but still the second hard drive does not want to go online. I hope anyone can help me and i even provided you guys with print screen shots.</p>

 a problem where&nbsp;recognized me as a "free account" and said I would have to buy minecraft windows 10 edition, as well as not letting me sign in. I then tried playing on the normal PC edition and encountered the same problem, it says I own minecraft and minecraft
 windows 10 edition on the microsoft store but I am still having this problem, how can I fix it?

            Hi Joseph, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />You could try reinstalling Minecraft Windows 10 edition to see if it recognizes your installed version.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you can get in touch with Minecraft support here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/emails/new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/emails/new</a>
<br />
<br />They should be able to look into your account to see what's causing it to not recognize your purchased licenses.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!
