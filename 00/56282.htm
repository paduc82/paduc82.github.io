<h2>            Can&#39;t watch video ads to get coins</h2>
                    <p>For the past 3 days, I have been unable to watch the video advertisements to get coins or tickets. &nbsp;I play this game every day and I am going low on each of these on my game. &nbsp;I click to watch, it goes to a black page with a teeny bit of a circular scroll and then flips back saying "Purchase Error" and "Your purchase cannot be completed at this moment; it has been cancelled. &nbsp;Please try again later." &nbsp;And I have been trying numerous times each day, reloading my computer and trying again and I just keep getting this error! &nbsp;How am I supposed to play when I don't have any coins???? &nbsp;Or maybe you want me to spend my real money to get these two things! &nbsp;We have been able to get this just for watching a video for years and now I am unable to get them free! &nbsp;What's up with this???????</p>

    <title>How can I recover my Hard Drive files from a Diskpart Clean Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rockwell lancer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I recover my Hard Drive files from a Diskpart Clean Hard Drive</h2>
                    I was trying to install Windows 8 Preview, however, I kept receiving a message saying that Windows could not install on the Hard Disk because it was in GPT format or something. When this happened, a forum on the internet suggested I use DiskPart to clean
 the disk. I did as it said, not realizing that it would literally clean off my hard drive. I am trying to use another hard drive and install an OS (Win8 preview) on it so that I may access the old hard drive and recover it using a program called TestDisk&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk</a>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am hoping this will work, however I would like some input on this and perhaps some VIP advice.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At this point, any advice is good advice.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>First, I would highly recommend NOT using Windows 8 for your recovery efforts.&nbsp; All new operating systems have incompatibilities with prior generation tools and utilities - witness the fact that all the major antivirus companies are updating their products for Windows 8.&nbsp; Stick with a released, known operating system.</p><p>Next, realize that anything you do to the old hard drive decreases the chance that you'll be able to recover the files.&nbsp; Ideally you would take the drive, put it in an antistatic bag, and ship it to a data recovery firm which would likely charge you hundreds to thousands of dollars to recover your data but would likely have a 100% chance of recovery so long as the drive hasn't been written to since the diskpart session.</p><p>Having never been in the position you're in because my computer gets backed up every night, I cannot recommend a recovery product based on personal use. I've seen a good many folks recommend Recuva (<a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva

<h2>            Gdiplus.dll is missing&#58; SOLUTION</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>If you have a gdiplus.dll error similar to the one in the screenshot below you could try these steps: (for Windows 10, 8.1 and 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.Go to this link: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?gdiplus</span></p>
<p><span>2. Download all the available file versions for your OS (32/64 bit) and extract them to somewhere easily accessible.</span></p>
<p><span>3.In Windows Explorer, navigate to the path that the error message says (remember to copy it out exactly!)</span></p>
<p><span>4.Go back a step in the Path bar to 'WinSxS' and right-click the folder highlighted in grey or blue.</span></p>
<p><span>5.Select Properties and under the Security tab select Advanced and in the window that appears, there should be a blue Change link.</span></p>
<p><span>6.Click it and in the 'Select User or Group' box enter your username. Press OK.</span></p>
<p><span>7.Click Apply then OK again and back in the Properties window and Security tab click Edit.</span></p>
<p><span>8.Select Users from the list then tick the box marked Full Control</span></p>
<p><span>9.Click Apply then Yes&nbsp;and exit Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>10.Now try copying each of the downloaded .dll files to the folder until you find the error goes away.</span></p>
<p><span>11.Next, change the permissions of the folder back by repeating steps 5 and 6 but instead of your username, enter&nbsp;SYSTEM.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>12.Lastly, select the User item in the list that has Full Control and press remove.</span></p>
<p><span>13.Reboot your PC</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic Repair Loop</h2>
                    I know people have been having lots of problems on this. I tried all of the solutions, even some of my own. Before you reply note that I did the free upgrade to Windows 10 so I do not have a disk. I have an Aspire 4830T -6841 and this happened to me today
 when I woke up. The previous day I had no problems with it. I am pretty sure when I did system restore (which failed) said that my D: was corrupt. I tried startup settings, reset my PC (which I am currently trying to do), and I changed the BIOS. Please help!

            Technically if the FAN is not working that means it is a hardware issue. Either the FAN is damaged or it is not getting power. Have you consulted manufacturer regarding this?

 at the end with error - The Parameter is Incorrect error code 0x80070057. Tried rerunning restore and now I get error - Element not found 0x80070015. Is there something special I need to do to the drive before restoring the system image?</span>

            It might be the fact that you made the image of a traditional mechanical hard drive and you are trying to restore it to a hybrid drive. As the drive is part solid state and mechanical drive do you know which you are restoring the image to. I assume it
 a the OS image. Windows would need special drivers to use the SSHD. Have you tried using installation media created with the Media Creation Tool

    <title>Skype touchtones on MacOS MacBook Pro 2016 High Sierra do not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melmalinowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype touchtones on MacOS MacBook Pro 2016 High Sierra do not work properly</h2>
                    <p>I am abroad, trying to make Skype phone calls. From my iPhone 7 plus, the touchtones work, and successfully activate the many navigation menus you encounter before speaking to a person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, they do NOT work from a MacBook Pro. As a Mac developer, it sounds to me like the Microsoft Skype software is not generating a true touchtone, which is a mix of two frequencies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes it impossible to get through in many cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minor gripes: in Skype, if you go to support, contact Microsoft, you get led through a series of selections, only to find the only choice is 'Ask the Community'. No chat availability as promised. If you need to set up a new Microsoft account, that button
 leads to a 'not working at this time' page. Ugh. It took me 20 minutes of working through the system to get here.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To further investigate, please answer the following questions below to isolate the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>What exact version of Skype you are using?</li><li>When you say touch tones, do you mean DTMF or dial pad for entering extensions?</li></ol>
<p>Please provide additional information about the issue. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.

<p>This is a problem on all versions of the new Skype. I was using skype classic until I was FORCED to update to an inferior version. Now I don't know who is and isn't in my contact list without completely opening a contact's profile because the offline/online/away/not
 a contact indicators are gone. Now I have removed contacts appearing in my active!! What the he'll? I shouldn't know that contacts I removed are currently online...BECAUSE I REMOVED THEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just bring back Skype classic, it was so simple. New Skype is a mess.</p>

<p>It won't boot passed the welcome screen.</p>
<p>Usually it booted ok and prompted for my sign in password.</p>
<p>The screen now just shows my log in screen but with nowhere to sign in.</p>
<p>Also the mouse and keyboard are inoperable.</p>
<p>I have been able to boot up using Kaspersky rescue disc and got all the pictures and files off the pc and stored to an external hard drive.<br />
I now want to restore my pc back to the start.<br />
I have an old Vista pc which works perfectly.<br />
Can I create a rescue drive from the Vista machine so i can use it on the windows 10 machine to do a full restore back to windows 10?<br />

            Hi,<br />
What is the make and model number of the computer?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems to be a hardware damage issue. I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer of the computer/charger for further assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information is helpful.<br />

That sucks, truly, but not sure how it is a Microsoft Windows issue. ;-)&nbsp; Get the hardware repaired/replaced.

<h2>            Midnight Club LA, gamers selling modded cars</h2>
                    
<p>My 11 year old son bought a car on Midnight Club LA through Rate&nbsp;My Ride using ingame cash today (7/22/2013) and he was unaware that it had been modded and some individuals have said a few things to him.&nbsp;He was totally unaware of this could cause a issue
 until relaying what was going on to me.&nbsp; I have educated him on the seriousness of this and he is no longer going to be using&nbsp;the car online.&nbsp; Is there a way to find out thru what IP address did the modding on the car?&nbsp; And I would like to know if my son has
 had any complaints on his gamertag for this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Michelle</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open pictures &#40;jpg&#41; in Windows 8 after restoring from a backup from my old Windows 7 laptop.  Permissions Issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using a WD 1TB external hard drive and WD software I performed a backup of my old computer intending to transfer pictures, documents, etc. to my new Windows 8 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files backed up and I selectively restored the My Pictures files to the new machine without error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the My Pictures folder under Windows 8 I see the files but the thumbprint does not show the picture.&nbsp; instead an icon for Windows picture something or another shows (purple picture of mountains).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pictures will not open in anything I have tried.&nbsp; Something about a permissions issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas about what I could have done wrong or how to fix the permissions issue so I can actually see my pictures?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try downloading the Windows Live Essentials setup and check if Windows Live Mail is listed as installed when you run the installation. Refer to the link for the download:</p>

<p>Thank you both for responding with helpful solutions. Before embarking on the Windows Repair I re-ran the SFC but it found no Windows Resource integrity violations this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also re-ran the DISM /Online /Cleanup_Image /RestoreHealth which reported that it successfully repaired component store corruption which is odd given that SFC reported that there were no problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm.... {scratching my&nbsp;head} At least I got some good tips to help future troubleshooting.</p>
<p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t complete some functions when in xboxlive.com due to a weird Silverlight issue.</h2>
                    
<p>For instance, when attempting to access the avatar editor from my computer while on xbox.com, it will load up to 99% and then a pop-up screen will appear with an exclamation point and the following message, "This application was created for an expired beta
 release of Silverlight. Please contact the owner of this application and have them upgrade their application using an official release of Silverlight." Since I did not create the app on &nbsp;xbox.com, shouldn't they upgrade this on their end? How do I troubleshoot?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This happens to me too. When I first went to the avatar editor page all that was on it was the "down load Silverlight" icon. When I did that it said I already had it installed. It still didnt change anything. So I uninstalled it and re-installed from the
 avatar editor page. It installed successfully. I re-booted but still, only the Silverlight download icon is on the avatar editor page, nothing else. What is going on here?</p>

<p>Hi Mr. Gwyther, Still not working. Have cleard cache etc.. since last we spoke in December. My broser is IE9. I have not tried a different browser yet, has anyone had luck with that? Why would IE9 cause this problem? And what is the Avatar page supposed
 to look like anyway?</p>

<p>Issues like this are typically caused by the user's PC, either something not installing properly or settings preventing it from functioning properly. &nbsp;Gwyther wanted you to try another browser to try and narrow down if it's the browser that is causing the
 issue or if it is your PC. &nbsp;I use to have an issue browsing xbox.com with Firefox, when I switched to Chrome the issues were resolved, so it stands to reason that something with my Firefox setup was preventing it from loading properly. &nbsp;I never figured out
 what exactly caused it, I just that know it was Firefox. &nbsp;So until you test a different browser, it will be difficult to determine the cause.</p>

<h2>            Programs Not Responding on brand new laptop&#47;100&#37; Highest Active Time</h2>
                    
<p>I know this is a well known issue, but I have tried all of the fixes to no avail!&nbsp; I have a acer aspire 1551-4650 with 4GB of ram and an AMD Athlon II NEO X2 K325 1.3GHz processor.&nbsp; I have had this computer for 2 weeks and&nbsp;I cannot get the programs to stop
 not responding.&nbsp; IE doesnt respond, Mozilla and&nbsp;msconfig same issue.&nbsp; When I have the problem the program states it is not responding and the resource monitor shows 100% higest active time for the disk.&nbsp; It lasts on average 30 seconds.&nbsp;I checked the reliability
 report and didnt see anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>I have removed Mcafee, added Norton, removed Norton, stopped prefetch, reset IE settings, ran the hot fix, clean boot, and the list goes on and on.&nbsp; I have brought the computer back to factor specs and it still happens!!!&nbsp; I checked the hard drive for errors
 and received none.&nbsp; I dont know what else to do?!&nbsp; I want to throw this computer in the garbage.&nbsp; I contacted Acer and they gave me this generic list of things to do, like end task and restart program.&nbsp; I knew more than the tech.</p>
<p>I have spent days researching this and I finally decided it was best to ask you guys for help.&nbsp; I would really appreciate any help!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Select Ctrl+Alt+Del to bring up Task Manager and click on the Performance tab. What are the details under Physical Memory?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you download Process Explorer. This freeware utility performs a similar function to the Windows Task Manager but it goes much further. Use it to identify
 what is using your CPU to excess.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further information about Process Explorer see here:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/SystemInformation/ProcessExplorer.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/SystemInformation/ProcessExplorer.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the
 top. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard
 and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp to empty your Recycle Bin, remove Temporary Internet Files and other selected
 options. I also recommend you click on the More Options tab, System Restore and remove all but the latest System Restore point. Run Disk Defragmenter.</span></p>
<p><span>Using the System restore option is most appropriate when your system is running slow and you need to increase free disk space on your C partition.
 If you have errors which might be resolved using System Restore to put your system settings back to before the error first occurred do not use this option.</span></p>
<p><span>If more than one person uses the computer and they have their own user Log on you need to run Disk CleanUp in each user profile to remove all unwanted
 files.</span></p>
<p><span>A better programme than Disk CleanUp is cCleaner but note that cCleaner will not handle System Restore points. Removing older restore points can
 be important if you have limited free disk space. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.ccleaner.com/download</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update definitions and run in safe mode. Disable other security software whilst you are
 doing scans.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download and run SuperAntiSpyware (Free Edition)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It could be a sub-process or application that's running in the background <br />
and taking all the CPU resources.</p>
<p>To find and display what could be the problem try Process Explorer:<br />

<p>Worth Reading: The Case of the System Process CPU Spikes<br />
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2008/04/07/3031251.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2008/04/07/3031251.aspx</a></p>
<p>Once you have Process Explorer installed and running:<br />
In the taskbar select View and check:<br />
'Show Process Tree' and the 'Show Lower Pane' options.<br />
Move your mouse cursor over any column in the right hand pane and<br />
right click and check the following boxes: <br />
'Command Line' and 'Version'.<br />
Then expand the process named 'Explorer' (click on the + sign)<br />
In the column on the left named 'CPU', look for any high CPU usage.<br />
Next click on the CPU column to sort the processes by %CPU usage<br />
(Highest to Lowest).</p>
<p>You can also mouse over and check any spike or high/low point in the CPU graph.</p>
<p>Move the mouse cursor over any process, <br />
you should see a popup with some detailed info.<br />
Then mouse over the process that's using most or all the CPU %.<br />
Then click on that process to highlight it,<br />
Now that&nbsp; it's highlighted, right click and from the options listed select: <br />
'Search Online'.<br />
This should display what out there on the web about that process.<br />
You can also double click on any process to open up a more detailed <br />
'Properties' window.<br />
Note: some entries like Explorer, System/Services, and Svchost <br />
may need to be expanded to show the detail (sub processes),<br />
in this case click on the + located to the left of the entry.</p>
<p>An alternate method when using Process Explorer <br />
is to double click on the Graph just below the Menu bar.<br />
This will open the 'System Information' window, which has a larger display <br />
of all three graphs. Move your mouse over any spike in the <br />
CPU Usage graph to see what process/application or service is the cause <br />
of the spike.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Family - Android app</h2>
                    Is there an app for Android in which I could add more time to child account, not to go through e-mail or browser?? If not is Microsoft thinking of making such an app for managing Family?
