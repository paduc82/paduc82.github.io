<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(74, 74, 74, 1)">I was charged $9.99 for one month of Game Pass on the 11th of October.
 It's showing as active in the Subscription tab of my Xbox profile. However, when I attempt to download anything, it directs me to the Game Pass purchase screen, and doesn't let me download the game.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(74, 74, 74, 1)">What's going on? I've tried to communicate with the support robot but
 it's not working. Is there any way to fix this, or do I have to process a refund and re-sub to Game Pass all over again? I'd rather not waste the $10.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Most likely doing a hard reset on the console will clear up the issue.

<br />
Short answer:&nbsp; Don't run a "registry scan."<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>If you ever think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, or optimized (it doesn't), read
<a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099</a> and draw your own conclusions.</p>

<br />
Longer answer:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Each time that you start using a new application, Windows operating system automatically extract the application name from the version resource of the exe file, and stores it for using it later, in Registry key known as the
 'MuiCache'.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
For XP, this refers to the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam\MUICache.
<br />
<br />

</blockquote>
<br />
It could also refer to the Windows Multlingual User Interface cache, but AFAIK, that should only be in the registry for Vista or Windows 7.<br />

            <p>The best way to describe the Windows Registry is: it's&nbsp;like a garbage truck that keeps collecting trash, but never goes to the dump!
</p>
<p>I build and repair PCs and always install 2 free Registry cleaners on every PC. The ones I use are the free versions of: IObit Advanced System Care &amp; Glary Utilities, as well as IObit Smart Defrag. After running these and rebooting, every PC boots, opens
 programs, and shuts down much faster.</p>

<p>Hi BobberBP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. You actually &nbsp;addressed the question and gave a helpful answer. What a novel idea!!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the MS MVP's should take&nbsp;their cues&nbsp;from you when answering&nbsp;instead&nbsp;of using&nbsp;it as an opportunity to be arrogant and more cryptic.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>This question keeps coming up and all we seem to get is don't run a registry cleaner.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You answered the question and how to correct it.</p>
<p>I use IObit Advanced System care and find it to do the best job.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't want to spend umpteen hours deleting registry keys for things like Nero (that's one of the worst)</p>

            <p>MUI (I thought) stands for Multilingual User Interface but not sure how that relates to MUICache, but every registry cleaner I have used (and that's most all) will report "errors" or things that need attention from the MUICache and MRUCache (Most Recently
 Used).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is just a section in the registry where Windows keeps track of things that have been happening on your system so it can remember things...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read some about it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windowsir.blogspot.com/2005/12/mystery-of-muicachesolved.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsir.blogspot.com/2005/12/mystery-of-muicachesolved.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just an accumulation of what you have been doing on your system and you can disable it and clear/empty it but as soon as you perform any operation (click something), stuff is going to get put into the MUICache and MRUCache.&nbsp; It doesn't hurt anything
 or slow you down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at this tool from NirSoft you can read about the MUIcache, view, edit, clean your MUICache withour using a registry cleaner:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/muicache_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/muicache_view.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For an experiment, run that tool, look through the results and you will see what you have been doing on your system lately then you can select all the items and delete them all so the MUICache is empty:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0f91e4e-3f68-403c-9da5-a8c443dff0b6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do something simple like Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up Task Manager and run the tool again (or refresh):</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dcfb7b8-34ef-4697-b327-dbc37abb7e87" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>All that stuff for put into your MUICache just from opening Task Manager and everything you do on your system after that is going to put more stuff in the MUICache until it gets to a predetermined size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So every registry cleaner is likely to report the contents of MUIcache as something that needs attention and you can sure have the cleaner empty the MUIcache for you but as soon as you perform any operation on your system it is going to start to fill up
 again.</p>

<h2>            Loads of Error Codes and issues since Feb 2015 Update was applied.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
Since the Feb 2015 update was installed on my Xbox One (while in Instant On standby mode) i have had endless problems with Error Codes and issues when launching games. Here is a list of what ive enountered multiple times with the accompanying text since Sunday
 8th Feb 2015:-</p>
<p>Error Code 0x87c40000 - Try again soon. Not sure what happened there.</p>
<p>Error Code 0x87c40001 - We cannot send invites right now. (Happened multiple times when playing Halo:MCC, Killer Instinct and Titanfall)</p>
<p>Error Code 0x807a1007 - Due to network limitations, you are unable to join party chat at the moment. (When trying to join a party in various games)</p>
<p>Error Code 0x0 - Please give it another try. If this happens again, let us know by entering 0x0 at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate. (Needless to say entering 0x0 at that web address comes back with nothing. The website says the code isnt even on
 Microsofts database!)</p>
<p><br />
I am also encountering issues launching games. Halo took several attempts to load. It would come up with the initial load screen then crash back to the Home page.</p>
<p>Killer Instinct has crashed several times too while in the menus.</p>
<p>The first thing i checked was my network connection but all seems perfectly fine. My NAT is open (port forwarded), the Xbox has a static IP assigned and im getting around 70Mb download and 18Mb upload speeds with 0% packet loss and an MTU of 1480. All network
 test come back ok.</p>
<p><br />
I have also tried hard reseting my Xbox several times by holding the power button for 5-10 seconds and also unplugging the console for 10 minutes but nothing has alleviated my problems.</p>
<p><br />
I firmly believe its an issue with the latest Feb update since i had never encountered any problems before that update was installed. Is anyone else having similar issues? Is there a fix in the pipeline?</p>
<p><br />
Many thanks, Buz.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 laptop constantly crashing - error&#58;  Kernal inpage data error</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So since late December 2018/early January 2019, my computer (Windows 8.1 laptop) has been having a lot of problems. It started when I first booted up the computer as normal after it'd been in sleep mode overnight. Upon booting it up, it brought up a notification
 on the upper left-hand corner saying it was c<em>hecking media</em>, followed by another notification saying
<em>checking media [failed].&nbsp;</em>After that, it brought up an error saying <em>no boot device found, press any key to reboot your machine</em>. I had to reboot it twice before getting back to windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Windows opened, an error came up saying that Dell Backup and Recovery was not compatible with my version of windows, even though I had not updated or changed anything on it. On my taskbar, the Dell Backup and Recovery logo stated that my computer was
 in 'unstable' condition. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed up everything on my computer and rebooted it and it worked alright for a while until it crashed for the first time, the error code being
<em>Critical_Service_Failed. </em>From there, it crashed at least once every two days, except every time afterward it said
<em>Kernal_Inpage_Data_Error </em>and no matter how much I researched it, I couldn't find a definitive answer for what this error really means.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC has been locking up a lot recently as well, to the point where I have to force restart it because it will not unfreeze on its own. Last week, when it crashed I had a new&nbsp;error code which was
<em>Critical_Process_Died.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I have a theory that my version of Windows is now corrupted as my system has not run right since I upgraded to Win10 in summer 2017 and it messed up my battery meter in the process. I reverted back to Windows 8.1 after that. All these errors feel
 like they're pointing in the direction of it being left over files from Win10 or something like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try going into Bios and messing around with the boot order, which did fix the first problem I had with the checking media failure and no boot device found error, but the fix only lasted about three weeks before coming back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or ideas on what to try would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is five years old, and was originally a Windows 8 when I got it and updated it to Windows 8.1&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original Xbox as well as the Xbox 360 are region-locked, although it is up to the publisher if a game is region-free or not. A number of games are region-free and will play on a unit from any region. Digital content through Xbox Live are also region-locked,
 such as DLC, movies, and apps.</p>
<p>A regional lockout (or region coding) is a class of digital restrictions management preventing the use of a certain product or service, such as multimedia or a hardware device, outside of a certain region or territory. A regional lockout may be enforced
 through physical means, through technological means such as detecting the user's IP address or using an identifying code, or through unintentional means introduced by devices only supporting certain regional technologies (such as video formats, i.e. NTSC and
 PAL).</p>

<br />It is strange that those exist online and not on your PC, unless you have OneDrive set to Files on Demand . ..

<br />If you open OneDrive in a web browser, you should be able to download those back to your PC from that web page . ..

<h2>            Libraries vs moving personal folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just about to rearrange&nbsp;my hard drive with my personal documents/music etc to a separate partition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you&nbsp;can move the actual default position of your personal folders by going into their properties and selecting "move"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know you can instead add a folder to the "music" library etc. and change the default save location to the new folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there and advantages or disadvantages from doing one over the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heard that some of the controls of Libraries have been hidden In Windows 8. I don't want to get used to doing things one way and then find out they've removed the feature in Windows 10</p>

            <p>Libraries are (at least right now) still in Windows 10, but they continue to be de-emphasized and only available to show as an option.&nbsp; Probably because it is complex for a basic user to understand the difference between local personal folders (known as
 Shell Folders), or Library views (more like search results) and the OneDrive online storage.&nbsp; To make it more clear where your files really are, they abandoned the hybrid Library view and specifically tell the user where the files are: "This PC" or "OneDrive".
 There's no gray area anymore, unless you opt to turn back on the libraries as a power user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly I think I would just re-point the shell folders as you wish, since it seems the libraries are going that way.&nbsp; And re-pointing those to the new location will still work with the libraries as long as they continue to exist.</p>

<h2>            How do Repairs work&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I submitted a "repair" because I purchased an Xbox that worked all of 2 days before the drive failed. I can't find any information on the repair process. All I know is that my "Replacement Console Shipped", as indicated on my Repair Status page. Two steps
 in the future is "Console Shipped Out (<span>Your console should be returned to you within 2-3 weeks of the day you ship it.)" Now I'm confused. If I'm having a replacement immediately shipped to me, and I'm shipping my paper weight back, why would I want
 it returned to me in 2-3 weeks? Is there a more elaborate definition of each step in the process or an explanation as to what is going on?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Usually they will turn up with a replacement unit within a few days up to a week depending on backlog and take your old unit at the same time, if that is the case then that is it, there will be nothing more to do, if they take your unit back for repair only,
 then that is when it can take 2 - 3 weeks to be returned to you.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>I request you to perform the following trouble shooting steps. Hope this would resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1 </span></b></p>

<p><span>a)Open the Network troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search).</span></p>
<p><span>b)Eentering network troubleshooter in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c)Tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking Identify and repair network problems.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Reset Store Cache</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.Press Windows key + R and open Run Window.</span></p>
<p><span>2.Type msreset.exe and hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Clean Boot</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option<b> Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the <b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click<b> ‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the <b>‘Startup’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window</b> under<b> startup tab,</b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click <b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>a. </span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b> Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b> Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b> Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box
 in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b> Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b> Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b> Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>

<h2>            the Error  0x800CCC0B  is shown while WLM is only sending messages</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am quite &nbsp;perplexed about this error&nbsp;&nbsp;0x800CCC0B which <b>only </b>shows me when WLM is only sending a message from only one Gmail account which added to WLM with using&nbsp;<i><b>Incoming mail server (POP3) name '</b></i><b><i>pop.gmail.com'</i></b><i><b>&nbsp;</b>via
 the port<b> </b>995, and the <b>outgoing mail sever name '</b></i><b><i>smtp.gmail.com'</i></b><i><b>(</b> with the port&nbsp;465).</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Besides, there is another Gmail account also added to WLM with the same&nbsp;outgoing&nbsp;and incoming mail sever names and with the same ports.&nbsp;</i><i>However,
<u>there is no error sending messages at all while WLM is sending messages using this account,</u>&nbsp;although&nbsp;the outgoing sever name &nbsp;the port(</i><i>465)</i><i>&nbsp;is the same.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>These two screenshots show the sever names of both accounts:::</i></div>

<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>&nbsp;Although I have activated the pop in both gmail accounts, this didn't make difference.</i></div>

</i></div>
<div><i>When I tried changing the port of outgoing mail sever from 465 to 25, the Gmail account which was sending messages&nbsp;without&nbsp;problem became having the same problem.</i></div>

<br />
I know that Gmail requires authentication before you can use its SMTP servers. This means you have to pass your username and password so that the server knows that you are a Gmail customer and knows who you are. Most SMTP servers require authentication these
 days as they try to prevent spam.<br />
<br />

</i></blockquote>
<br />
The servers are separate, so it's not unusual for errors to occur with the one but not the other. There are many factors involved, including&nbsp;account settings in Windows Live Mail. Something wrong with the settings for one server won't usually affect the ability
 to connect to the other.<br />

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />From your request I understand you want to use your Skye number to make calls as unknown, is that correct?
<br />
<br />If that is the case, you just need not to set up the caller identification (id).
<br />Once you set up caller id your mobile number or Skype Number will be displayed when you call mobiles and landlines from Skype.
<br />
<br />- <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/skype-number-not-showing-as-caller-id-shows-as/d768ca2a-5620-4a55-8dd8-27684d9f9843">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>

    <title>May I get a Refund on Castle Crashers. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            May I get a Refund on Castle Crashers.</h2>
                    
<p>I have had Castle Crashers for a while now, but I lost all of my data on it, I can not use my dlc characters, I have redownloaded them countless times and I can't get anything out of the game. It's good but it came to a end I guess. My game deleted all of
 my saves and I can't play with friends anymore, I would like a refund on all dlc for castle crashers, Purple Knight, Pink Knight, King, Necromantic Pack, Gamer Pictures, and the game itself. I can't play it anymore neither do I want it anymore. I have been
 told I can get digital refunds also by Xbox support a while back, I'm expecting my money to come back on my account.</p>

<p>You can't just ask for a refund because you don't want to play it anymore. The game has to be broken or something along those lines. Now I do see that the DLC's aren't working, so you could possibly get a refund on those, but on the main game itself, you
 don't have a very good reason for a refund.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;However, you will not be able to get a refund on any of the items that you have due to the fact that you've had them for a while now and have played them in the past.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of things to try to solve the issue of the game not working.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Delete your gamertag only (not tag and items) then restart the console before redownloading your tag.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Delete the game and DLC and redownload them from your Download History (Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Download History).</p>
<p>If you require further troubleshooting steps as to why the game is not working you can contact phone support at 1-800-469-9269 in North America</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

    <title>Trouble unlocking achievements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kinggonad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble unlocking achievements</h2>
                    <p>Needing an assist with some of the achievements for Pillars of Eternity more specifically Disposition, the Watcher with Eight Friends and Super Murderer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My xbox was definitely connected and I have done all the usual workarounds including waiting 72 hours, removing and readding my profile, deleting and reinstalling the game, doing a hard reboot and contacted Paradox directly who have advised they cannot unlock
 achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can I please ask for a manual unlock? I played a different game (assassins creed origins) and knocked out 4 achievements in short order so its definitely an issue with PoE not my profile more broadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gamerprofile: KingGonad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an additional question is there a reason this would have happened in the first place?</p>

<h2>            How can I activate my Windows 8 Beta Version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: windows 8 activation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I activate my Windows 8 Beta Version? It's not the same as other OS I've had before wherein you can just update or change your product key. Windows 8 doesn't have that (or just because I'm using the Beta version). But anyhow, the only option I've
 got is to purchase a new OS. Well I got the OS now from Microsoft store however I don't want to reinstall again the software since I'm afraid I'm gonna loose all the programs that I have right now. All I want to do is to activate the software using a valid
 key I have. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any Idea?</p>

            <p>Pre-release versions of Windows 8 such as the Developer Preview, Consumer Preview and the Release Preview have all expired. Your options are, backing up your data and reinstall the original version of Windows you were running prior to installing the preview.
 You can't activate the Preview (beta) versions of the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to install Windows 8 Pro upgrade, you will first need to reinstall your original version of Windows that was running on your computer prior to installing the Windows 8 Release Preview. Whether that is (Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7). After installing
 it, you can then do an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro. The Windows 8 Release Preview does not support upgrades to Windows 8 Pro.
</p>

<h2>            Vista Ultimate isn&#39;t seeing my JVC BR-HD50 HDV Deck via firewire.   PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have the Windows Vista Ultimate 64 OS and I cannot get the computer to see or recognize my JVC BR-HD50 (an HDV deck) when I hook-up the firewire cables.&nbsp; I've tried multiple ports and different cables.&nbsp; I've also tested other firewire devices like a
 external hard and it seems to recognize that with no problems.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP!! THANKS!

            Hi Jacobs,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to update your driver for JVC BR-HD50<br />
<br />
Steps to follow in order to update the driver:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Go to Start - Settings - Control Panel - Device Manger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click the cross next to Imaging devices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Right click on JVC BR-HD50 - Update Driver Software...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. New window opens - Browse my computer for driver software<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. New window opens - Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. New window opens - tick off Show compatible hardware<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. In the Manufacturer list choose JVC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. In the Model list choose JVC DV Tape Recorder/Player<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Click Next<br />
&nbsp; 10. Warning window pops up, click Yes<br />
&nbsp; 11. Windows has successfully updated your driver software, close<br />
<br />
If the above steps are of no help, I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer of&nbsp; JVC BR-HD50 to check whether they have released any firmware updates.<br />
<br />
I did not find any compatibilyt report on JVC BR-HD50 in the Windows Vista compatibility center.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this information is helpful<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            Are you using right click on a file &gt; Send to Mail recipient feature? If yes, Mail app is not supported by Send to Mail Recipient feature. Hence, even though you are setting it as default, it is not going to be invoked. 
<br />
<br />Other third party softwares like Outlook, Lotus Notes, Thunderbird etc are supported.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you using some other way to send your file.

<h2>            Unlock Local Security Policy</h2>
                    I have a Win 7 x64 Pro laptop - upgraded from Home Premium - and it seems a prior user (no longer exists) set various security policies including password length, complexity, etc., that I am unable to change.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can log in as the administrator, create new users, etc., &nbsp;but when I got to Local Security Policy, Security Settings, Account Policies and Local Policies all have the "lock" symbol next to them and I am unable to change any settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>I have turned off AV, tried unsuccessfully to boot into Safe Mode (it stops entirely at drivers.sys). &nbsp; Thanks.</div>

            <p>Yeah, but I'm sure the employee VPNed at some point which could have installed those policies.</p>
<p>Best bet is to start over on that system as described by OberWald.</p>
