<h2>            msi a4000 webcam driver is missing how do I reinstall&#63;</h2>
                    I have look in devices and printers, it's not there. I have also tried to find it in the device manager not there as well. I opened up the control panel to try and add new devices and it could not find it. I am sure this is because the webcam is built
 into my laptop. I tried to find updates for this driver but unfortunately cannot update the driver because it cannot be found.<br />
<br />
Please help! <br />

            <p>Presumably it worked before, if so what have you changed or updated?</p>
<p>You obtain any drivers or web cam program from your laptop makers site, specific to your model</p>

    <title>Media Player syncing... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacklecube  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Player syncing...</h2>
                    When I try to sync to my phone, I get the message that the device will be filled after sync, even though the device has more than 11GB of space spare. The reason it will be filled after sync is because WMP wants to sync everything in my library to the
 phone. The problem is, the sync list is empty, I want to sync individual things to the phone, not everything and I can't find a way to change to this, any advice greatly appreciated, thanks.

 laptop/tablet is only a week or so old and this problem started today. It has very think lines of the other side of the screen. If I do nothing about then then it eventually moves across the full screen. Each time another line is added it adds it to the right
 of them, moving the lines to the left. I've tried updating drivers but didn't work. The lines also disappear if screen is turned off for a short bit, but they return shortly after that. Is there a way to fix this or is it the hardware? I've also only installed
 Chrome on it and mainly only watch videos.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Dark,
<br />
<br />It is definitely hardware problem.
<br />
<br />If you still have your warranty better to use this replace device.
<br />
<br />If you have more questions you are welcome

            Alright, i wish that you can visit this discussion and try the solution below, which worked for me. What i tried here is by going to run type regedit , REGISTRY EDITOR will be open. click on COMPUTER (one click) and on header go to EDIT---&gt;FIND and type
 VAM in search and enter. Three entries will appear <br />
<br />
1. Default <br />
2.something related to VAM <br />
3. something related to VAM again<br />
<br />
leave the Default or remove the value of default and below delete those two entries :) and see the magic. The control panel shortcut will be disappeared. VAM is nothing but Microsoft Virtual Machine shortcut<br />

<h2>            32 bit to 64 bit Upgrade of Windows 10 &#40;Macbook Pro&#41;</h2>
                    <p>On a Book Mac Pro (mid 2011) a dual partition exists. OSX 10.10.3 (64 bit) &nbsp;and Windows 8.1 Pro (32 bit)</p>
<p>With the upgrade to Windows 10 in a few days, could it be possible to download and create ISO files of Windows 10 64 bit? Or the system is linked to what version of Windows 8.1 is already installed (i.e. 32 bit)?&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The free upgrade does not have the option to&nbsp;switch architectures, so the architecture will remain the same. If you want to switch architectures, you will have to download the Window 10&nbsp;.ISO file in the appropriate architecture (32 or 64 bit)&nbsp;and perform
 a custom install.

Windows 10 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. In fact, Windows 10 64 bit supports up to 512 GBs of RAM, while Windows 10 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 10 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 10."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108,

            First, you may try the Printer troubleshooter, which will attempt to automatically diagnose and fix your problem.<br />
<br />
Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.<br />
<br />
If Windows can't detect a printer that you want to use, follow these steps to find and add the printer manually:<br />
<br />
1. Open Devices and Printers by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , and then, on the Start menu, clicking Devices and Printers.<br />
2. Click Add a printer.<br />
3. In the Add Printer wizard, select Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer.<br />
4. On the Searching for available printers page, click The printer that I want isn't listed.<br />
5. On the Find a printer by name or TCP/IP address page, choose how to find the printer that you want to use, based on the type or location of the printer, and then click Next.<br />
6. Complete the additional steps in the wizard, and then click Finish.<br />
<br />
To make sure that printers on the network are being displayed, check to see if the network is working correctly. For more information, see View the status of your network.<br />
<br />
I’d also suggest you to refer the link below and follow the steps mentioned in the article to troubleshoot network printer problems:<br />

            What gives you an indication there is a Directx11 problem ?<br />
Have you installed the current drivers for the graphics card (301.42 - WHQL) ?<br />
<br />
If you are not able to use high graphics settings it is likely because the GT530<br />
is a low spec graphics&nbsp; card. <br />
Upgrading to a more powerful card would provide better graphics settings with all games,&nbsp; but you would most likely also need a new power supply as OEM mfg's such as Acer, HP and DELL&nbsp; always install a power supply that is minimum to the system requirements.<br />
<br />
For the best results - don't use Anti-Aliasing, and try 1680x1050 resolution.<br />
If the game uses HDR, HBAO or other dynamic lighting turn that off as well.<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 Connection to Comcast XB3 Gateway - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bnmmull  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Connection to Comcast XB3 Gateway</h2>
                    My Windows HP 8.1 computer will not connect to a Comcast XB3 (Cisco DPC3939 Docsis 3.0) gateway by either ethernet cable or wireless. When this same computer is connected to the XB3 via a Cisco Valet router it connects both via ethernet and wirelessly
 (to the Cisco Valet router) just fine. Five other devices all connect just fine both by ethernet and/or by wireless to the XB3. These include: a Windows 7 HP laptop, a Windows 8.1 HP desktop, a Google Nexus 9 tablet, and two Google Nexus 6p phones. I have
 searched knowledge bases and attempted recommended fixes including resetting and clearning the IPV4 settings and turning off the XB3 firewall. Nothing works so far.&nbsp;

            <p>Ratandeep, thank you for the link to the Xfinity forum. I already posted an assistance request on the Xfinity forum and am in communications with the Comcast internet support people. I have also searched the Xfinity forum and have not found a solution. One
 idea on the Xfinity forum was to examine and clean up the IPV4 settings which as stated in my post did not work. &nbsp;Re the gateway guide, I downloaded the user manual for the XB3 and studied it without finding a solution. I have also logged onto the XB3 with
 one of my computers which will linked directly to the XB3 and searched trouble shooting there without success.</p>
<p>I am not running or connected to a domain network. The XB3 is at my home and connects our computers, tablets and phones each with their own IP address. Again thanks for the assistance.</p>
<p>I have also posted assistance requests on HP and Cisco forums.</p>

            <p><span>Ratandeep. I have followed your instructions. The "troubleshooting" wizard advises that the computer needs to connect the ethernet cable; please note that this affected computer is in fact connected via ethernet cable to the XB3. The troubleshooting
 wizard is observing that there is no successful ethernet connection with the XB3.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Following your instructions, I connect the affected Windows 8.1 computer via ethernet cable to the XB3 and this produces the troubleshooting result which asks that an ethernet cable be connected. (This same 8.1 computer is now connected via a Cisco
 Valet router via the same ethernet cable, and the Cisco Valet router is ethernet cable connected to the XB3. This setup allows me to send you this response from this computer which will not connect directly to the XB3.)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In summary, I cannot successfully connect this 8.1 computer directly to the XB3 via ethernet cable (or wirelessly) and obtain access to the internet. When connected via Ethernet cable directly to the XB3, I am unable to access the XB3 via the 10.0.0.1
 address. When I set up a Cisco Valet router between my affected 8.1 computer and the XB3, I can connect to the internet via the ethernet cable and wirelessly to the Cisco router. I can also access the XB3 from the affected computer when connected via the Cisco
 router setup described in the prior sentence. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before last week, I used an AT&amp;T DSL modem (a Motorola NVG 510) and this affected 8.1 computer accessed the internet without problem when directly connected to the NVG 510 modem. &nbsp;I operate a second Windows 8.1 computer; it connects directly with the
 XB3 both via ethernet cable and wirelessly and successfully accesses the internet or the XB3. Both of these 8.1. computers are HP and were purchased directly from HP on the same day.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I believe that we can conclude from all of this that there is an interface problem with the affected 8.1 computer and the XB3 gateway. The problem impacts both the ethernet and the wireless interface between the XB3 and the affected 8.1 computer. I
 have also run the ipconfig utility and on occasion it seems to report there is a connection. I just ran a ping test on the impacted computer with 75% loss of data. I have never been able to access the XB3 wirelessly from the affected 8.1 computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As an after thought, I ran the troubleshooting wizard on the "Network Adapter, Ethernet connection" with different outcomes. One time the wizard cannot identify a problem and one time it asks to plug in an internet cable. This outcome is consistent
 with the history of directly connecting this affected 8.1 computer directly to the XB3, sometimes I sometimes have access to the internet but it is not stable. One minute I can go to a web page and a few seconds later there is no internet access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again for you comments.</span></p>

 able to access the internet both via ethernet and via wireless through the Cisco router which is connected to the XB3. I have not updated the DPC3939 MODEM driver since I am working directly with Comcast to support to fix their gateway device. Marvin

</p><p>Again thank you for your continued interest in my problem. I read the article and executed the changes to the TPC/IPV4 settings for obtaining a DNS server address and the associated changes to the Web Client setting on Services. The fix did not change my
 ability to connect the affected computer directly to the Comcast XB3 gateway. In reading the description of the issue on the HP knowledge base, I note that the HP described problems do not really fit my affected computer. I am able to get onto the internet
 just fine just not when directly connected to the XB3. Note that on my January 4th posting, I reported that I had followed a knowledge base suggestion to clean up the DNS settings; in following this recommendation on the IPV4 settings, I compared my affected
 Windows 8.1 computer with a second Windows 8.1 computer which is able to successfully connect directly to the XB3. I compared all of the TCP/IPV4 setting on the two computers. They were all the same which suggest that my connection issue is not likely the
 TCP/IPV4 settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reversed all of the changes in the attempted solution. I obtain DNS server addresses automatically and the Web &nbsp;Client is returned to "manual".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thanks for the assistance. I am sending this email from my Windows 7 HP laptop which is connected wirelessly directly to the XB3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You still do not say if&nbsp;you have a Vista DVD!<br />
<br />
Try&nbsp;the advice&nbsp;I have&nbsp;listed below, to do a Startup Repair/System Restore.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, and you do not have a Vista DVD, I'd save my Data, and reinstall:<br />
</p>
<p><span>As is the case with most computer/laptops these days, they do not come with the proper Vista Disk to do Repairs with; only Recovery Disks.<br />
<br />
If yours falls into the above category, download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk
 in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc with it.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it.<br />
<br />
</span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ISO Burner:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Repair Vista disk.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>It is not a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the same error code 80070002 (it has no relation with Windows update - I have already deleted the Window temp/update files and restarted based on your instructions).
</p>
<p>In this case it is a bcp command using the browser (vbscript), example:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>Option</span><span> </span><span>Explicit</span><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span>Dim</span><span> wshell</span><span>,</span><span> cmdline</span></p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span>cmdline </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"bcp ""MyTable"" out ""C:\MyFolder\MyFile.txt"" -c -S""MyServer\Instance"" -U""UserName"" -P""MyPassword"""</span></p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span>Set</span><span> wshell </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>CreateObject</span><span>(</span><span>"wscript.shell"</span><span>)</span></p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><strong>wshell</strong></span><span><strong>.</strong></span><span><strong>run
</strong></span><span><strong>(</strong></span><span><strong>cmdline</strong></span><span><strong>)</strong></span></p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span>set</span><span> wshell </span><span>=</span><span> nothing
</span></p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">*****</p>
<p>
<strong>wshell.run ("cmd.exe /C" &amp; chr(32) &amp; </strong><span><strong>cmdline</strong></span><strong>)</strong>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">*****</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I kept getting the error message:</p>
<p><span><strong>error '80070002'</strong></span> </p>
<p><span><strong>?</strong></span><span><strong>, line 0</strong></span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>OR .....</p>
<p>there is no error message and no action at all, it's as if the command is ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The same "cmdline" code runs perfect when I run it manually from cmd on the same machine.</p>
<p>Do I need to have a separate authorization for the browser to execute this command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>Hello, I am running Windows 10 on my ssd, I have a windows 10iso on my ssd, is there a way to install windows on another hdd in my system, without exiting windows on my ssd?</p>
<p>I don't have a USB drive, but need to install windows for another system, so I will take the hard drive from that, put it in my main system and install the iso to the hdd while still using windows on my system(I don't want to do whole system restart, nor
 change anything on any other drive)</p>

<p>Hello cdnhermit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to duplicating your group of tiles in the Start menu? Please be reminded that you can only have one instance of Start menu shortcut for an app. Apparently, there's no shortcut for duplicating your existing group of tiles. However, you can
 simply drag an app tile to an empty space and then drop it once a bar on top appears. This indicates that the tile is now part of a different group. After dropping the tile, you can set the name for the group. Check the image below for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4fca569-7392-43c8-aa9e-7ffd723740ed?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4fca569-7392-43c8-aa9e-7ffd723740ed?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Your idea about having a shortcut for duplication a group of tiles would definitely make customization easier in Windows 10. I encourage you to submit a feedback about it to our engineers using the

<h2>            Microsoft Updates</h2>
                    Why are the updates not downloading, It's stuck at 2%, but never does anything nor completes itself. When checking the Update History, there are quite a few that have failed or haven't successfully downloaded. My pc is fairly new,,,not even a year old
 yet. Who needs or want all of these difficulties...

            The first troubleshooting option you can try is Microsoft's own Windows 10 Troubleshooter for Windows Update. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you can find it in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot, click Windows Update then click Run the troubleshooter.

If you are running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or an earlier version of Windows, click Start, type: troubleshooting, hit Enter then launch the Windows Update troubleshooter.

You can run the troubleshooter a couple times to see if it helps. 

You can explore additional steps you can try:
https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/23-troubleshoot-windows-update-problems-in-windows-10-using-these-five-tips/

You can also try installing the latest cumulative update manually, learn how:

Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
net start wuauserv

Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 

Hope this helps, Good luck!

            Hi,
Try resetting Windows 10 updates using an automatic script. See:
www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html
Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

    <title>Reinstalling Windows 7 after Reset to Factory Defaults - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 7 after Reset to Factory Defaults</h2>
                    
<p>So I bought my laptop a few years ago and it came with Windows Vista. Earlier this year I upgraded to Windows 7. Then I took my laptop back to the store to replace the keyboard and the retards, for whatever reason, reset my computer to factory defaults -
 which means that I am back to Windows Vista.</p>
<p>Since it's the same computer, can I download Windows 7 again without having to pay for it all over again? Where can I do that?</p>

<p>Download the Windows 7 Professional 32 or 64-Bit .ISO and follow the instructions below to create your own installation DVD.<br />
You will still use the product key you obtained but the DVD will be created from the .ISO file you download.</p>
<p>32-Bit Digital River: <a href="http://msft-dnl.digitalrivercontent.net/msvista/pub/X15-65804/X15-65804.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm</a></p>
<p>For Windows .ISO file just place check marks in the SHA1 and&nbsp; CRC32 boxes. In the main HashCalc Window the 'Data format' box located in the upper left should be set to "File"</p>
<p>In the 'Data' field click on the&nbsp; ... box located in the upper right and then click 'Cancel' if you get an 'Insert Disk' window pop up. After you click cancle you should see a 'Find' window. Use this to navigate to the folder where your .ISO file is stored
 and click on the file.You should now see the .ISO file you clicked on listed in the 'File name' box located near the bottom of the 'Find' window. Now click the 'Open' button. The Data field should now show the directory/folder path and the name of the .ISO
 file you selected.</p>
<p>With only the SHA1 and CRC32 boxes checked (Do not place check marks in any other boxes as this can slow down the time it take to calculate the values) click the 'Calculate' button located at the bottom of the main HashCalc window.</p>
<p>It will take anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds for the calculation to complete and the SHA1 and CRC32 data values to be displayed.</p>
<p>These values are not case sensitive, so a lower case 'a' is the same as an upper case 'A' as far as the results are concerned. However they should match those I've posted below.</p>

    <title>Windows update removed all personalization settings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hyronious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update removed all personalization settings&#63;</h2>
                    An automatic update was applied a few days ago, and when I next used my computer, there was a blank desktop background (as opposed to the slide show I usually have), most of the shortcuts were gone (but not all), and the task bar, which I usually have
 on the side of the screen, was along the bottom with all the programs I had pinned to it gone. My search history in google chrome had also been deleted and the default browser changed back to internet explorer, and I had to log back into all the websites I
 had previously had the 'remember me' option turned on in.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I went to look at my folders, and within my user folder all the folders such as my documents, my pictures, downloads etc. had been duplicated (not the contents, just the folders) and by the looks of it the 'recognized' folders were switched over to the
 empty ones (so when I download something, it goes into the new download folder instead of the old one etc.) At first it just looked like a mild annoyance that I would have to fix quickly and forget about, but options such as my desktop backgrounds refuse to
 change (I have plain black) and some programs with file paths set to old folders are being directed to the wrong places. Also, when I delete the new folders, they get recreated, despite the presence of the old ones with identical names.</div>

    <title>Standard user vs admin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yovincenzo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Standard user vs admin</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>On a Windows 7 computer with only one user,&nbsp;is there&nbsp;any higher protection from malware infection to be gained&nbsp;by running as a standard user?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My understanding is that even when running as admin, the rights are not elevated until you allow the UAC elevation, so I am wondering if the unelevated
 admin is essentially the same as the unelevated standard user (again I am talking just from the standpoint of malware installation).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In my research I found it often said that the standard user can only make changes that affect his own user account, not the rest of the computer. But
 when you are the only user, that seems to be irrelevant. </span></span><span><span>I read one article by a Microsoft designer that said he could write malware that is perfectly happy running
 completely in a standard user account, and sending back that user's credit card info, usernames, passwords, etc, to the bad guys.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I've&nbsp;got&nbsp;different Win 7 computers running&nbsp;both ways, and it seems like both ask&nbsp;for elevation equally often, the only difference being that the standard
 user needs to input a password.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>So the question is, is there any advantage to being a standard user, from the standpoint of&nbsp;preventing malware installation (such as from driveby&nbsp;installations&nbsp;or
 from clicking a malicious attachment)?</span></span></p>

<p>Hello, YoVincenzo</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer.</p>
<p>When UAC is at its highest settings, there is little difference. Assuming you are the only one with access to the computer, I would say it's mostly personal preference and really depends on what you plan to do on the computer.</p>
<p>The biggest concern would be automated exploits on websites and if you visit websites that may contain them, you may want to opt for the standard account just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>The default UAC settings are a good mix between security and ease of use though and should be sufficient in most cases.</p>

                    i've had my computer for about 2 months now. running windows 7 premium and recently when i boot up my computer, after it displays the bios menu, it skips the windows logo screen and goes straight to the welcome screen. i havent noticed any issues other
 then this however i did notice strange noises when i booted up and first noticed the logo was missing . . . i've checked the menus and different options to turn off the logo but there all set to display it so im not sure what the deal is. i ran the system
 file checker and that came back clean aswell. could it be a gpu issue or a motherboard issue? i did install skyrim recently and it reinstalled directx11 and&nbsp;made a new microsoft c++ file. im thinking that could be it too. other then that im pretty much out
 of ideas. there was a few other programs i installed too. evga precision, fraps, nvidia system tools, nvidia system monitor. i restored my system to a point before installing these programs so it cant be those but it hought id add

            There may be a problem in the boot files or the logo file.<br />
I believe the default logo is&nbsp; from C:\Windows\System32\oobe\background.bmp.<br />
<br />
FWIW-<br />
In some quick searching I see a lot of confusion as to exactly how Windows 7 handles the logo (which is different from XP).&nbsp; There are some 3rd party programs around that claim to be able to customize it, and so might be usable to repair it, but none look highly
 trustworthy to me.<br />
<br />
One example is at <br />
http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/Beta-1-Review-212798.shtml<br />
<br />
It might be worth trying running sfc /scannow in an elevated command prompt, though it seems a long shot.<br />

            Hi  cpm5 
<br />
<br />ActiveX is a technology used in Windows for many years to provide functionality on web pages, including web controls . . . etc.
<br />
<br />It is still a technology used in Internet Explorer, but not used in the Edge browser
<br />
<br />May I ask why you want to delete that, are you getting ActiveX popup errors?       
        </p>

<p>ActiveX is a technology for creating active content. It was only used by Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ActiveX and Internet Explorer are very old and not secure. You shouldn't be using either one. You can't delete ActiveX - just don't use it. That will be easy since nobody has made content using ActiveX in a long time.</p>
