    <title>Need to deregister old domain from inactive O365 Small Business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ocarinalnk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to deregister old domain from inactive O365 Small Business account</h2>
                    <p>Here's the situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Years ago, I registered a personal domain, and utilized O365's domain services to tie that domain to my Exchange Online account/email. It was binded to Microsoft' nameservers, and everything worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Due to reasons, I had to cancel the account. However, my domain was never "dropped" or expired out - it still currently points to Microsoft nameservers, under a different registrar (GoDaddy) as the owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- for the past year, I've tried everything I can think of to get my domain back. Tried reaching out to Microsoft O365 support, but they won't support me as I'm no longer a Small Business user. I've tried reaching out to GoDaddy, but they've refused to help
 me as they say it was "purchased" with someone else other than them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone here help me? Any guidance, places to point me to, strategy, etc. I'm willing to do the work, but I am now completely and thoroughly lost as to what my next step should be. Thank you!!!</p>

<div>Smart Art is greyed out in my Word 2011 for Mac.&nbsp;</div>

<li>The document i want to edit has an extension of .docx.&nbsp;</li><li>I have checked and tried to resolve the compatibility issues (that show when the 'save as.' dialogue box appears).</li><li>I have re-started the Mac.&nbsp;</li><li>I explored the 'repair disk permissions' suggestion on the community earlier (Apple's online info suggests that happens automaricall/doesn't tell me how to repair disk permissions.)</li><li>I've checked a blank document and it is still greyed out.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            OK - Thanks for the clarification :-) It appears that the issue is as I explained briefly in point #2... You can't
<i>Edit</i> a SmartArt Object until you have <i>Inserted</i> one. Once you insert a SmartArt Object the
<i>Edit SmartArt</i>, <i>SmartArt Graphic Styles</i> &amp; <i>Reset</i> tools will activate whenever the object is selected.<br />
<br />
SmartArt is not a feature for creating graphic content of your own design. SmartArt Objects are ready-made diagrams, flow charts, etc. intended to save time &amp; effort. Also, the shapes that comprise a SmartArt graphic are all contained within a single workspace
 or canvas. Among other characteristics they also interact with each other, so if you add or delete a shape the others scale automatically.<br />
<br />
Although they can be customized to some extent they are not free-form drawing tools. To delete or otherwise modify a specific shape in the diagram click the edge of that shape to select it. You can then press
<i>delete</i> to remove the shape, change it to a different shape using alternatives provided by the Shape tool, move &amp; scale it, change its color, etc. Shapes can also be added/removed using the toolbar in the Text Pane of a SmartArt diagram. The Text Pane
 can facilitate entering text &amp; provides some additional tools for promoting/demoting as well. See these Word Help articles [among others] for more information:<br />

<br />
If you prefer to draw your own diagram use the features described in the opening paragraph of my initial reply - The button looks identical to the one on the SmartArt tab but works differently. Using those tools you can select the type of shape you want, then
 draw the shape in the document &amp; modify it as you wish. Unlike SmartArt, shapes created this way are independent of one another, so if you want them to remain in a specific arrangement you need to select them all &amp; apply the Group command. For more information
 on use of the drawing tools see these Help pages &amp; their associated links:<br />

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any important data on that system, you need to save it to external media. You will need to work around the 2 hour reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the data is saved, if you want to continue using the Preview builds, you can format the drive, create an installation disk from a Preview ISO and reinstall the Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The latest ISO, is a few builds behind the latest, but they have an expiration date of 10/1/2016. This should work to get you close to the current preview build. You need
 to update the Preview build using Windows Update on a regular basis.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span><span>Download Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO:</span><span><span><br />

            It seems the download is off line as of right now. Maybe there is a temporary halt to the download as Microsoft might be getting ready for RTM. Nothing on Dona's twitter feed right now but anything is possible since is the weekend.

            I am glad I downloaded the necessary build 14390 files earlier today and is now installing on my laptop. The good thing is I made an ISO from esd file from my other computer I upgraded yesterday. If I had to I could have used that ISO to install on my
 laptop.

            Strangely, I just figured out that you can still download the Insider ISO to a smart phone. &nbsp;My phone can get to the Insider ISO site, choose all the menu options and download the Insider ISO. &nbsp;It is downloading one right now and up to 5%.

            Even though phones and pc's have the same build number they are two completely different versions of the Windows 10 Operating System. Final code for pc's could and I emphasize could be complete but the phone version might not ready so that is why you can
 download it as Microsoft might need more feedback before releasing final version of Windows 10 phone code.

            I don't have a Windows phone. &nbsp;I am downloading the PC ISO to my Android phone. &nbsp;But even easier is to hit F12 and change body Display from "none" to "show". &nbsp;Works in Chrome or Edge browsers.

<p>On a windows 7 Pro 64&nbsp; Bit PC just uninstalled office 2010 and installed full 2013. When the user opens one of the shared calendars (from her corporate MS hosted account) outlook crashes and restarts. User calendar is OK. Have started in safe mode and run

            <p>It was MAPI. The problem is fixed, the Profile was corrupt. I added a new profile, let it load, then tried the shared calendars and they all worked without crashing outlook. I went back and deleted the first profile and all is now working.</p>

<h2>            Letters jumping and getting all out of order as I am typing especially in Outlook when composing a new email to send</h2>
                    I know my problem has to have a relatively simple solution, it seems when I am typing&nbsp; as I am typing letters will not stay in order, sometimes they go to the beginning of the line or in the middle of another word.&nbsp; How do I remedy this please?&nbsp; Also the
 page jumps when of course it should not be.&nbsp; I was in an area recently where one can make changes to the touch pad and did increase the width o&nbsp;f the black horizontal line that follows each word, that is when&nbsp;&nbsp;my troubles began.&nbsp; It is doing it constantly
 while I am trying to type this.&nbsp; Any assistance would be appreciated.

<h2>            Comparing two string columns in excel sheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi&lt;br /&gt;Can anybody help me to correct this data? There is a long list of this type of data.I want shortcut method to solve it as if there are columns that are exactly matched like in row number 5(Harley- harley) it should return 1 or 'true' in column C
 and the columns which are not exactly matched like in Row no 3(Kerry Sean-Kelvin) it should return 0 or 'false' in column C and where there is little mismatching between two columns as Row 1,2,4,6, it should return -1 or 'Mismatched'.</p>

                    <p>I changed the password for my hotmail address by mistake and would like to go back to the one I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, outlook.com does not allow to use past passwords, so it must keep a list of them somewhere (surely not the passwords themselves, but a hash or something similar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone knows how long is that list? In other words, how many password changes must occur before a password can be reused?</p>

<h2>            Teams group does not reflect in Sharepoint online.</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>We have workgroups trying to adopt MS Teams and trying to collaborate with files uploaded in MS TEams groups. They also synchronized the MS Group files and folders and noticing that the sharepoint online is not always visible in Sharepoint online, even months
 after the group creation.</p>
<p>An example is shown here although the MS teams group was created a few ours before.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42ee8f6e-0792-40c5-8802-c6d7217d8e89?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42ee8f6e-0792-40c5-8802-c6d7217d8e89?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Even in ONeDrive the site does not show</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abb41318-b44c-457a-9a8a-72c102ecc827?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abb41318-b44c-457a-9a8a-72c102ecc827?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Users will not typically go online to update or open files. They will look on their machine and look onto folder structures.</p>
<p>Is this by design so that users cannot synchronize to folder structure?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Angie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For point 1, I'd like to explain that Microsoft Team is a service which integrated with many other Office 365 for Business services. The site in a team is a SharePoint Online team site. The the SharePoint Home page is for end user to display Following, Recent,
 Suggested sites. The best way to let a team member find the site from SharePoint Online home page is to following the site. Another method is that team member can easily access that site from Teams.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For point 2, based on my test, normally delete a team will block the access to the related site (403 forbidden), at last the site will be completely deleted. User cannot access or sync items in it any more. I noticed that you have another thread about this
 point in our forum. We can discuss further in that thread. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Nokia e72 unable to format corrupted memory card</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dropped my phone the other day and cracked the screen. I since had a replacement screen fitted but now it says my memory card is corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My camera wont work because I think its looking for the memory card for its stored memory, it just tries to open then the phone resets back to the main menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go to office &gt; file manager &gt; memory card (where it says my memory card is corrupt) &gt; memory card options, and the menu that pops up to the right of this is just blank? its a blank grey box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas whats going on? Can I change the camera memory to internal so I can use my cam without the memory card? Or can someone advise how to fix the memory card issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>failed 2 updates</p>
<p>code 9C57</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even downloaded the IE 10 manually to my machine and install form there, it will install and half way, again asks for pre-requisites...I went over one by one, all has been installed on my machine</p>

The only way the % complete field for a summary line can be changed by the user is via VBA. And if it is changed with VBA then the % complete values for the subtasks will change also.<br />
<br />
So, there is no "manual change" possible for % complete at a summary level.<br />

                    <p>To use the new family version of OFFICE 365 you have to register it with a product key. The little booklet says to go to office.com/setup but after you give your name and password it takes you to a screen which says, "<span><span>This
 site is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance. Please try again later." It's been a week and every night I get the same thing. Will this ever be fixed? Is there an alternative way to register? I live in Australia so telephone support&nbsp;wouldn't work because
 Microsoft are permanently closed (they are never open during working hours in Australia).</span></span></p>

<p>I set up a private browsing session as you suggested (I had to google it, I didn't even KNOW you could do private browsing on a Mac). Obviously it's Safari since that is the default browser for all Mac users. Anyhow, once I did that (For those following
 at home what you do is click File and then choose private browsing session and you get a black title bar). Then I entered the address in the little box from Microsoft which is office.com/setup and Lo and Behold it actually worked. It even remembered that I
 was in Australia and didn't offer that ridiculous list of countries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: for some reason (and it isn't disclosed in the Microsoft documentation) you have to use a private browsing session for registration and installation on a Mac.</p>

<h2>            Latest Windows 10 build not showing up in Windows Update no matter what I do</h2>
                    <p>Greetings everybody. I'm running Windows 10 Insider Preview on my secondary machine, as well as my primary one. Since my primary computer has been having unsolvable issues lately, I've been using my secondary computer, and fixed a lot of problems on it,
 slowly making it my new main, but there's still one issue. Windows Update won't show the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview build, so I'm stuck on build 10130. My other machine had updated to 10166 before I switched to this one. I loved 10166, and I want to
 use this PC for a bit of light-ish gaming, so being updated is a good idea.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> keith_f___  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Sharepoint in IE, I cannot open an Office document while Google Chrome is running</h2>
                    <p>When using Sharepoint IE the only way I can open an Office document is by first closing Google Chrome. If I have Chrome open IE just hangs and cannot be used (any window) until Chrome is closed. IMMEDIATELY when Chrome is closed IE snaps back to life and
 opens the Office document. I've tried this with Word and Excel documents with exactly the same results. I can then re-open Chrome and continue about my life until I have to open another document using Sharepoint in IE again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opening documents from within Sharepoint using Chrome doesn't work&nbsp;- I get a message "The document could not be opened for editing. A Microsoft SharePoint Foundation compatible application could not be found to edit this document." So I can ONLY open Sharepoint
 documents in IE.</p>

<h2>            web Portal Office 365 attach button</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue regarding Office 365 Attach button.&nbsp;When I create a new email, and click on the Attach Button, whatever file I try to attach, it shows like its loading, but then deletes it.
</p>
<p>Drag and drop in the email works and attach the file so does the Outlook in my computer. The problem is from within the Web when I press attach and choose a file and doesn't attach it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have this problem?</p>

            <p>Hello Mark Ole,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, this is what I have done so far.</p>
<p>1. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox didn't work properly. </p>
<p>2. I have changed the owa appearance to the classic (light version) and it can attach files, when I turn it to the new version, it's not working.&nbsp; (Please see attachment) It tries to load the attachment with a little cloud at the bottom left and then it
 deletes it directly. This attachment is directly from my desktop, no clouding, no Mapped drives. Just an excel file on desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Dragging and Dropping the file in the email seems to attach it but from the attach button it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further explanation of Screen Sharing please call me (number at my signature)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well to many issues at the same time i never heard.</p>
<p>So best solution is to update the phone even with the same sw version.</p>
<p>But as you said there is no way for you to update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then i am afraid there is only one solution : please visit the nearest authorized Nokia care point. You can get the location information from at the top of the page "repair &amp; cycle" .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure Nokia care point will help you.</p>

<p>some problems are just bugs (if they arevery rare) or you have some infected file on your phone try deleting apps (downloaded even from a trusted supplyer) or removing memory card if those problems will stop you had an infection by virus and if not try update
 or take it to the workshops</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Send to OneNote images not transferred</h2>
                    Problem is that images in the e-mail are not always sent to OneNote, even though the text is, when using the "Send to OneNote" button in Outlook 2010.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using the Office 2010 ProPlus (Outlook 2010, OneNote 2010), no SP.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sending an e-mail from Outlook 2010 to Outlook 2010 in HTML format: Images are transferred to OneNote.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sending an e-mail from Outlook 2003 to Outlook 2010 in HTML format: Images are NOT transferred.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sending an e-mail from Outlook 2003 with Word as editor to Outlook 2010 in HTML format: Images are transferred to OneNote. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Using Rich Text Format, with automatic conversion to HTML for Internet recipients on the Outlook 2003 client, and sending to Outlook 2010: Images not transferred to OneNote.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The HTML code of the e-mail on the receiving side, shows a pattern. When images are transferred, correctly, the img-tag reads something like:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&lt;img width=716 height=530 id="_x0000_i1025"&nbsp;<b>src="cid:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***95CAB0</b>"&gt;.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When they're not, the img-tag reads something like:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&lt;IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline <b>src="cid:265475015@08112012-2290</b>"&gt;</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So in the first line, the cid: references a .jpg-file, in the the second, the file extension seems to have been lost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In both e-mails, the image is visable in Outlook 2010 (the receiving client).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><b>Can anyone explain this? Why is Outlook 2010 able to handle both img-tags, while OneNote 2010 handles only the first?</b></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

<h2>            Cached Outlook 2013 &#58; 1 month cache displays emails in excess of cache duration in some folders</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user &nbsp;who I set offline outlook &nbsp;cache &nbsp;exchange mode &nbsp;to &nbsp;full cache mode. (all email) &nbsp; Local OST was over 10GB and concerned about performance reduced cache &nbsp;slider &nbsp;bar to 1 month</p>
<p>The offline OST shows messages up to 1 month and then the expected &nbsp;'click here to view more on MS Exchange'. &nbsp;I click on this and older messages are displayed. &nbsp;Expected behaviour</p>
<p>User has a folder called 'archive' which has many other folders nested and all this data is being locally cached regardless of time stamp. &nbsp;Local folder size indicates over 8GB &nbsp;which is the same as the server data folder size.</p>
<p>Checking folders indicates messages years old but these are being locally cached. &nbsp;What is causing this behaviour ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no filtered synchronization filters in force on these folders</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Martyn</p>

<p>hi martyn,</p>
<p>the cache mode only controls ost files size.<br />
have you referred to the autoarchive feature in the outlook client? if yes, the archive folder is used to backup older items locally in a separate pst file. it’s a normal behavior that the cache mode settings don’t apply to this archive folder.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=974452e3-dc2a-4851-820b-abc4b0e18fac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d974452e3-dc2a-4851-820b-abc4b0e18fac" /></a></p>
<p>for your reference: <br />
automatically move or delete older items with autoarchive: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/automatically-move-or-delete-older-items-with-autoarchive-e5ce650b-d129-49c3-898f-9cd517d79f8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>if not, i’d like to collect the following information to better understand your situation:<br />
1.please check whether the archive folder can be seen on owa.<br />
2. file &gt; account settings &gt; data files, please provide a screenshot about it.<br />
3. the detailed steps about how the user created this folder.<br />
4. i have sent you a private message to collect your problematic email suffix. you can access it by clicking
<strong>private messages</strong> under <strong>your details</strong> section in the right part of the page.</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, click <strong>use rich formatting &gt; insert\ edit media</strong>.<br />

<p>Auto archiving is not enabled. &nbsp;It may be misleading that this folder is called 'archive' but its just a folder which was created by support at the time of their migration and their old data migrated into it. &nbsp;It is nothing to do with the archiving features
 in outlook or the online archive which can be created.</p>
<p>The issue is when 1 month cache is enabled : why does this folder and all nested folders beneath it not observe the 1 month cache....instead it downloaded everything to the local ost</p>
<p>folder is displayed in OWA</p>

<p>Hi Martyn,</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply and thanks for the information.</p>
<p>To further narrow down the issue, could you please check the following?</p>
<p>In the EAC, go to <strong>Recipients</strong> &gt; <strong>Mailboxes</strong>, and then select the problematic mailbox from the list. In the details pane, under
<strong>In-Place Archive</strong>, confirm that it is set to <strong>Enabled</strong>. Click
<strong>View details</strong> to view information such as archive status, usage, and quotas.</p>
<p>If the feature is enabled, this folder should be an online archive folder.</p>
<p>If not, please provide some screenshots for further investigation. One about the archive folder (a list of the mailbox folder) and one about the Data Files(File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Data files)</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

                    <p><strong>I can't upload anything to anywhere on the internet<br />
<br />
</strong><br />
That means:<br />
1. I can't attach anything to an e-mail<br />
2. I can't upload anything to fb<br />
3. I can't upload anything to sendspace etc.<br />
<br />
The problem is only on this computer. I've tried the router on another computer and I can upload on that.<br />
<br />
I have googled this problem but to no avail. I have tried the following:<br />
<br />
1. Turned off Firewalls.<br />
2. Turned off&nbsp; Antivirus.<br />
<br />
Nothing. I am on Vista and there are no additional service packs downloaded. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
I have also tried the speedtest site. It is unable to do the "upload" test. Downloads are fine.

            <p>Hi Hiren,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us posted and sharing this information with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer the questions-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What is the size of the file that you are trying to upload?</p>
<p>2) Did you try resetting the Internet Explorer settings (the article suggested earlier does not apply to Internet Explorer 10)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a possibility that the file that you are trying to upload is large in size. Try uploading a smaller sized file. Check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in most conditions a slow internet connection does not permit uploading the file. Make sure you have a good internet connection as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do get back to us know. We will be happy to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

            <p>I am having this problem with IE10 Preview for Win7, too. Mostly uploads do not work and I an thrown to an IE page titled "This page can't be displayed." This appears to be a very generic page and it has no information at all that allows diagnosis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been tearing my hair out because I'm testing Web sites that I built thinking that I had an error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, the pages in question work perfectly in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, as well as IE9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, back to IE9 for now.</p>
