<h2>            email sending using my husband&#39;s name</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send an email to particular recipients, it is sending using my husband's name and he is not linked to &nbsp;my account nor does he have access. How do I change this? It must be a glitch - it is not always happening but I cannot send emails with the incorrect
 sender's name.</p>

            <p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing with outlook.com, let us work together to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a few questions to get a clear picture of the issue.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;How are you accessing outlook.com? Is it through a mail&nbsp;client, app or a web browser?</p>
<p>2. Does this issue occur when you are sending an email to a particular email address?</p>
<p>3. Have you&nbsp;created an alias on outlook.com account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into your Outlook.com account. Click on settings (cog wheel icon) and select
<strong>options</strong>. Under <strong>Writing email </strong>category select&nbsp;<strong>Reply-to address&nbsp;</strong>and check if you have provided a different email address as a reply -to address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also <strong>view basic information about your account </strong>under <strong>
Managing your account- </strong><strong>Account details (password, addresses, time zone)
</strong>and check if the display name shows your name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us if the issue persists.</p>

<h2>            How to stop favorites from scrolling back to top</h2>
                    <p>I was on my college's web site for an online course and going through their web pages this screen came up and said security settings on explorer task bar need to be turned off so I clicked it and hen I could see the pictures on the screen, after this I noticed
 that my favorites kept scrolling back to the top. and the volume&nbsp;meter also keeps going back to 0&nbsp;when you try and click on volume and make it go up on speakers. This one security setting caused all this.&nbsp;I restarted my system to another saved point but didn't
 help. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.</p>

    <title>Why does Outlook hate me&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devencombs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Outlook hate me&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am a US government contractor working alongside several other contractors and federal employees. A few weeks ago I created an event in the Outlook calendar for an important meeting to be held in the future. I sent the calendar invite to over 40 recipients.
 Later on I received the correct email address of another individual, so I added that address to the calendar invite and sent the invitation again, but only to that recipient. But instead of sending the invite, Outlook immediately canceled the event and sent
 the cancellation to everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not all. I recently received approval from local tech support to create a virtual group mailbox in Outlook. Instead of copying and pasting over 40 addresses, I only have to enter the mailbox name and the email goes to all the addresses that I added
 to the mailbox. When the mailbox was created, I added myself and four of my coworkers, including my supervisor, to the list. Then I sent an email to the five of us explaining that the mailbox was operational and I would start adding more addresses after I
 sent the email, which is what I did. Again, there were over 40 addresses to input, so it must have taken me 30 minutes or more to add all those addresses, AFTER I sent the notification to myself and my four coworkers. The next day my supervisor emailed me
 asking me why I sent the notification to the 40+ members of our group. I replied that I didn't; I only sent it to the five of us, and I only added the extra email addresses AFTER I sent the notification. My supervisor then forwarded me the email she received.
 Every one of the addresses I added to the mailbox was in the To Line. Somehow the email that I sent to myself and four others went to the 40+ addresses too. Again, I did not add those addresses to the mailbox until AFTER I sent the first email. It NEVER should
 have reached those addresses!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my supervisor is pissed; she informed me that I am not to send out any emails until she or another coworker approves it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to Outlook I now look like a buffoon to my coworkers who cannot be trusted! WTF is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, if I'm ever elected President, my first order of business will be to scrap all Windows based machines in the US government and replace them with Apple. Microsoft sucks!&nbsp;</p>

<br />How did you send it? If you removed the other addresses, that is a cancellation. Forward to the new recipient or add them to the message and choose the option to only send to the new people.

<br />Yeah, it shouldn't have done this after the message was sent. I'll see if i can repro it.  The only thing I can guess is that it was still in the submission queue (which it shouldn't have been) but I won't know until i test it.

<p>That is a possible explanation, except that when I sent the notification email, I almost immediately received it in my Inbox, because I added my own address to the list. By the time I added one more address, that email should have been long gone.

            Hello
<br />The only thing i can think of is that one of the addresses was a Distribution list and caused the error.
<br />None of this are normal behavior.
<br />
<br />As a community collaborator, this would have to be reproduce in order to validate some troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />If you take the header of those delivered email and analyze them on the TO: how many email addresses you see?

<p><span>I did not remove the other addresses. I only added the new address and sent the update. When I clicked to send the update, a dialog box popped up asking me if I wanted to send it to everyone or just the new address.
 I made sure it was to go to ONLY the new address and clicked Okay. Half a second later the event was cancelled and everyone was notified.</span></p>

            I'm not sure if a message trace will give much information on the cancellation, but it could give you an idea about happened to the message sent to the DL. The Exchange admin will need to do it though. 
<br />
<br />If the delivery report option is enabled for your account or supported on your exchange server you can get some information:
<br />open the sent message then file, open delivery report. 
<br />at the top, you'll see a list of members it was sent to and at the bottom, delivery status.

<h2>            InfoPath Merge Error - Catastrophic Failure</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a form published to a SharePoint site, and the merge function is crucial to our team's process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The form was developed in InfoPath 2010 and published to a SharePoint 2010 site. &nbsp;Some users in our organization are upgrading to Office 2016. &nbsp;When that happens, users have issues submitting the form via email (InfoPath crashed and no email gets send).
 &nbsp;We resolved this hiccup by requesting the users to update their software to InfoPath 2013. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, once the users have Office 2016 and InfoPath 2013, merging forms is no longer possible. &nbsp;Every user with this software configuration receives the same Catastrophic Failure message when he/she tries to merge forms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our organization is also updating to SharePoint 2016 this year. &nbsp;We created a new site in SharePoint 2016, published the form to this new site and the users with Office 2016 and InfoPath 2013 still receive the catastrophic failure message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how this can be resolved? &nbsp;I am worried that the catastrophic error could lead to an apocalyptic error! Just kidding. &nbsp;All joking aside, any advice or recommendations will be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One final piece of information is that the error happens with Windows 7. &nbsp;Our organization is upgrading to Windows 10 soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Cory</p>

    <title>The text in cells to the left &#38; right of horizontally split cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff1436  say:</h3>
<h2>            The text in cells to the left &#38; right of horizontally split cells in a table in Word have disappeared.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and Word 2016.&nbsp; When I split a cell in a table horizontally, all of the cells in the table to the left and right of the cell I split horizontally go blank (My text disappears) and I cannot even click in those cells anymore.&nbsp; When I undo
 the horizontal split, the text in the cells to the left and right comes back.&nbsp; I am having no issues when splitting a cell vertically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my computer, but that did not fix my problem.&nbsp; I tried to open a similar Word document with a table that I created several years ago, but as soon as the document opens in Word, all of the cells to the left and right of any horizontally split
 cells is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Microsoft's new Virtual Agent, and it's suggestions, but that did not fix the issue.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;received a call from a&nbsp;"Microsoft Technical Support Agent," who simply told me that Word was "opening fine" (which was really confusion to me, since half
 of my document was missing when Word opened my document).&nbsp; Then they told me that this web site was the only way I could find support from Microsoft for my issue.&nbsp; However, all I seem to be able to find on this web site is how to split a cell in a table horizontally,
 and I already know how to do that two different ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is anyone out there that can offer me suggestions as to how I can fix this issue,&nbsp;or where else I can turn&nbsp;for help,&nbsp;I would really appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            MSEv2 &#38; Windows XP For Legacy PC&#39;s &#40;WinFLP&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>MSEv1 installed and ran on WinFLP just fine.</p>
<p>MSEv2 cannot install on WinFLP and throws a 0x8004FF04 error, both on an internal upgrade (using the built-in upgrade feature) as well as a clean installation on a newly set up machine with NOTHING else on it aside from SP3, a full Windows Update and a few
 other M$ additions (DotNet 2-4, C++ 2008 &amp; 2010 runtime, etc.).</p>
<p>I am finding this very confusing because WinFLP SP3 is functionally IDENTICAL to WinXP SP3, aside from a few programs (MS Paint, OE, WMP, games, etc.) missing from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, I wouldn’t mind knowing how MSEv2 determines the OS, in order to spoof XP SP3, and/or I wouldn’t mind knowing how to hack MSEv2 to remove/disable/alter the OS checking routine (maybe a setting in an XML file?? I’ve already used 7zip to pull
 MSEv2 partially apart…).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the up side, I have discovered (to my great pleasure!) that MSEv2 64-bit for Vista/Win7 installs and runs PERFECTLY on both XP 64-bit as well as Windows Server 2008 R2.</p>

<blockquote>Yes, the requirements are very clear. WinFLP SP3 is functionally IDENTICAL to WinXP SP3. Essentially, it IS WinXP SP3. So why does MSEv2 not work on a system which is, to all intents and purposes, XP SP3?? The ONLY significant thing different about
 it is the name, and the granularity of the install process. Period.</blockquote>
<p><br />
How a Windows product version appears to operate&nbsp;isn't relevant, only how it is licensed and supported.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs</strong> ("<strong>WinFLP</strong>")&nbsp;is exclusively available to<span>Microsoft Software Assurance</span> customers.&nbsp; Since these are primarily Enterprise customers and no Enterprise products
 are supported for use with MSE which is a consumer product, the lack of support for this&nbsp;is clear.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Fundamentals_for_Legacy_PCs#Availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Fundamentals_for_Legacy_PCs#Availability</a></p>
<p>As already mentioned, only the Windows XP 32-bit, and Windows Vista/7 both 32 and 64-bit retail or OEM clients used in a consumer or small business environment with up to 10 client PCs are supported by MSE.&nbsp; No server or embedded products, which WinFLP is
 based upon, are supported.</p>
<p>The fact that&nbsp;MSE might install or even appear to run on a platform doesn't matter, since you will receive absolutley no support or aid from Microsoft if an issue occurs with an unsupported plaform.&nbsp; The EULA and License as well as all supporting FAQs and
 other information have been clear about this for quite some time now.&nbsp; As you accept the License Agreement during the installation process, you will be lying if you agree while using any unsupported product, which legally invalidates the agreement by implication.</p>

<p>Rene', what do you not understand about license agreements, requirements, and support?</p>
<p>You want to know how to spoof a configuration that provides protection against malware?&nbsp; Think about that for a moment...&nbsp; pause... Now, is that not the same thing that some malware does?</p>
<p>MSE is only supported on XP 32-bit, and Vista/W7 32 and 64-bit.&nbsp; That you think, and the keyword here is THINK, you have it running, is incorrect.&nbsp; You do not know that it is actually working, or working as it should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop this silly posting about solutions that are unsupported, and not in compliance with the eula and requirements.&nbsp; There are plenty of other products out there.&nbsp; You should use those that work as stated for your needs.</p>

<p>The Nokia X2-01 did not get the direct E-mail client, it stayed with the proxy E-mail client; which the proxy did turned off.&nbsp;Furthermore, you got&nbsp;the direct E-mail client via a firmware update only. Only via the Nokia Suite (= update of content package).
 Finally, the server for app updates is down for several months now, therefore, you are not able your client. Anyway in any case, it would have stayed at the proxy variant which is defunct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I attached the direct E-mail client from the Nokia 207. Never tested that with the Nokia X2-01. You have to rename the file extension from DOC&nbsp;to jad; and from PNG&nbsp;to jar.</p>

<h3> lenny33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can print titles from one worksheet be referenced in another worksheet in the same workbook in excel 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Have set up a form in excel that uses merged cells to approximate an existing printed form.&nbsp; Below the fill in area, are merged rows/columns for the user.&nbsp; There is a requirement for the user to be able to use the sort function which requires these columns
 to be 'unmerged' and then re-merged which the user is not going to do.&nbsp; To try to get around this....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I separated the top information which uses the merged cells and placed the columnar information on a separate worksheet with the cells non-merged where the user can enter their data and sort as required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I reference the Print Title cell range A1:M137 from the first worksheet as the Print Title for the second worksheet so when this sheet is printed, it prints as the completed form?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't find the exact circumstances trolling other sites....</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>1. check that the image is properly linked to the source cells: click the picture and check the formula bar. Does that still show the reference to Sheet A and the range you specified? If not, repeat the process of linking the image to the cell range. Once
 the link is established properly, the image will always show exactly what is in Sheet A, like a photo of the sheet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. check the print area for Sheet B. If the image does not appear in the print preview, then you may not have included the newly inserted rows in the print area.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Make sure to add the print titles and select the 7 rows with the picture.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. You may need to re-size the columns in Sheet A to fit the width of your form. Then delete the first image and re-do the copy as picture and paste and link back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And finally: I'm not aware of any other way to use a range from anther sheet as the print titles.</div>
<div><br />

            Since Skype is now part of Microsoft product, deleting Skype account will be the same with deleting a Microsoft account. If you haven’t updated or migrated the Skype account you want to delete to a Microsoft account, then you will need to go through it before deleting the account. You may use a different Microsoft account (Dummy email address) if you don’t want your Microsoft account to be deleted. However, if it’s already updated to a Microsoft then there’s no option to unmerge it and it will delete the Microsoft account as well.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you in Full Screen Mode? Hit F11 to toggle Full Screen on &amp; off. The Menu Bar would disappear n Full Screen Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 2... Disable third-party toolbars (Google, Bing, etc) to see if another toolbar is causing problems with the IE toolbar layout.</p>

<h2>            CRM Outlook Plugin</h2>
                    
<p>hello all</p>

<p>we have succesfully installed/configured our crm plaform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>now we want to try updating our installation of the crm 2016 outlook plugin, but when i try to uninstall the previous version, it just keeps uninstalling....</p>

<p>i let my computer try to uninstall the application for 1 night ( +12 hours) but unfortunately, it just won't&nbsp;</p>

<p>hereby a screenshot&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=25bea2c3-df22-40e6-9974-c3323367d45e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d25bea2c3-df22-40e6-9974-c3323367d45e" /></a></p>

<p>i've tried this uninstall on a couple of clients, but all of those clients do have the same issue.</p>

<p>the version of the plugin we use is following (8.0.0000.1088):</p>

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ef810460-ed46-4578-8917-229d1585b141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3def810460-ed46-4578-8917-229d1585b141" /></a></p>

<p>anyone had similar issues and found a resolution for this?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            OneDrive has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>OneDrive previously worked without any issues, but it suddenly stopped syncing on this workstation. It continues to work okay on other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attempted to sign into the OneDrive app, after selecting the sync location I get this error:</p>

</p><p>If I attempt to go through the OneDrive for Business app to sync the library URL I get this message:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to uninstall and reinstall Onedrive, and made any other settings changes recommended through the microsoft assistant.</p>

<p>Hi JB_V，</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to improve company data security, admin will take some policy to limit persopn computer to use OneDrive for business which is not in domain.</p>
<p>For example, that computers outside the domain can not access the library by policy on IP address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using personal computer and can't sync the library, I'd like you can contact with your manager or IT administrator and check if related policy changed or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>JB_V，</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the factor. As my first reply, have you check if you have the permission to sync library outside domain network or not now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think admin probably changed the sync policy.</p>

<p>I have similar problems on my home Win10 workstation. OneDrive folders and files still appear in Windows Explorer, but no thumbnails appear, and the files will not open. It says OneDrive is not running on this computer. This is the BUILT-IN OneDrive, not
 the add-on Windows app, which is useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple weeks ago, I was able to re-install OneDrive with a program called OneDriveSetup.exe, and everything was copicetic for a week. The little icon appeared on the taskbar, files synced, thumbnails appeared and files opened. I came back after a 4 days
 absence, and the computer had reverted to the previous OneDrive non-working state.&nbsp; Tried to reinstall from previously named file, and message said a later version of OneDrive is running and must be uninstalled first. However, it does not appear in Add/Remove
 programs, any file manager, or other uninstallation programs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive has become so frustrating to try to use that I may abandon MS altogether, and use Google, Amazon, or Dropbox storage.</p>
<p>It's essential to me as I need my photos &amp; files created in the field to show up on my desktop for easy opening &amp; editing.</p>

<h2>            How to make custom ribbon tabs for Mail, Calendar, Tasks, etc.</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to make a custom tab or group for just Calendar or Mail? If I make a custom View tab, for instance, the view controls are very different for Mail and Calendar, and the default groups only appear on the proper windows, but custom groups do
 not. An example is Arrangement, of which there are three, for three different window types and it knows which one to display. When you make a custom group this differentiation is lost and the group shows up in all windows. Is there a way to differentiate custom
 groups (or tabs) to mimic the original distinctions?<br />

<p>What do you mean by ‘When you make a custom group this differentiation is lost and the group shows up in all windows’?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you created the custom groups in the default tabs (Home, Send/Receive, Folder or View)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, you may create a new tab and then add custom groups to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is not the case, do get back to us with more information as to what you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

</p><p>Under the View tab there are 3 Arrangement groups. One that corresponds with Mail controls, another with Calendar controls, and a third (Tasks maybe, I don't use it). The first Arrangement group only shows up on the View tab in Mail, the third only in Calendar.
 When you make a custom Arrangement group, it shows up on all windows, Mail, Calendar, Tasks.</p>

<p>This is the View tab for Mail. The Arrangement tab is showing Calendar commands.<br />

</p>
<p>This is the View tab for Calendar, showing the same Arrangement commands. The Color group is working and only showing on Calendar because it's not custom. The Arrangement group is custom so it shows up everywhere.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way to get it to differentiate custom Arrangement groups like it does with default ones?<br />

</p><p>No, unfortunately I have still not found a solution to directing which ribbon tabs show up in Mail, Calendar, Tasks windows etc. Hopefully someone out there knows (and this reply will bump the thread), but there may not be a way to do it!</p>

<p>Thanks, i started using Emoze last night and i like it, very well integrated.</p>
<p>The only problem i'm having is that when i compose an email, there doesn't seem to be a way of writing an email address besides the physical keyboard (using n97), if i tap the screen to open the dialog box to type an email address nothing happens. Is this
 normal or is there another way of doing it?</p>

<h3> theorist9  say:</h3>
<h2>            If I have multiple Headings with the same name, I can only create a Hyperlink to the first one.</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the built-in Headings. &nbsp;My document's Heading structure looks something like this ("Units" is Level 1, "Metric" and "Imperial" are Level 2, etc.):</p>
<p>
</p><p>V. Units</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; A. Metric</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Mass</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [text......]</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Length</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [text.....]</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; B. Imperial</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Mass</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [text......]</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Length</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [text.....]</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do Insert-&gt;Hyperlink -&gt;Headings, and select "Imperial", I'm able to create a Hyperlink to the "Imperial" Heading. &nbsp; However, if instead select "Mass" under "Imperial", it doesn't create a Hyperlink to that Heading, but instead to the first instance
 of "Mass", under "Metric". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug, and is there a work-around?</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />As per Microsoft article Note: In order for a project task to display in Task Board view, the Show on Board setting for the task must be set to Yes (the default setting).
<br />
<br />What is your setting for the task?

            Hello Jim,
<br />
<br />my name is Manuel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />As far as I know all the agile project management features (kanban board, scrum etc.) are currently only available for Microsoft Project Online.
<br />
<br />Greetings,
<br />Manuel

<p>Hi, here is the screenshot.&nbsp; As you can see the option doesn't seem to be available in the drop down.</p>

            Hello Jim,
<br />
<br />thanks for your reply.
<br />I am not sure which version you are using or if you are doing the administration by yourself.
<br />The following article describes the functionality of the task boards and features like the "show on board" flag. It also says that a lot of features are released gradually and the administrator can choose the release options for specific features:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-task-boards-in-microsoft-project-online-desktop-client-1b9b44d7-fd8e-4b3b-ab94-2b97deb9945b#tbcards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />if you are using the correct edition (Project online) but the feature is still missing it may be the case that you are not using a release with the "show on board" flag feature.
<br />To verify this you can search for "show on board" on "File" -&gt; "options" -&gt; "customize ribbon". In this menu you can look up every function of MS Project. If it is not listed there it is not present in your current Project installation.       
        </p>

<p>It looks like you're on an older build of Project. Try using the field "Agile" instead of "Show on Board".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
