<h2>            Hotmail account won&#39;t receive mail from certain senders</h2>
                    <p>I've been awaiting the receipt of a reply to an email discussion I started days ago. &nbsp;I've checked and double checked all relevant settings related to junk, blocked, spam or safe lists. &nbsp;All people are listed as contacts already, and have been for years,
 and yet still nothing is coming in from these senders/recipients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I'm experiencing serious difficulty with receiving email, other than marketing communications, sent from Member Services @ Sam's Club.com &nbsp;I've spoken with their CSRs on at least five occasions in the last few weeks. &nbsp;They can't seem to get a password
 reset email to land into my email inbox for this account. &nbsp;I'm also experiencing issues with their internal account login information which I understand is outside the venue of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide specific instructions as to what I'll need to do next to regain confidence that I'm receiving all the mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />

            Unfortunately, the Outlook.com mail servers seem to have this problem with multiuple domains.&nbsp; The Instagram domain is an example.&nbsp; Many people can't receive mail from Instagram.&nbsp; The same is true for others using their corporate mail addresses.&nbsp; It's
 really inexplicable.

            <p>Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;However, I'm a bit confused why the outbound servers authenticate and allow trafic to originate from a hotmail.com/outlook.com email user. &nbsp;Meanwhile, a reply to the same message doesn't return to the original sender. &nbsp;It would seem
 to be a DNS issue or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What's further mindboggling, is how I can receive messages from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but not user2. &nbsp;Especially if the email account, already has a history of performing satisfactorily with specific users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Will this issue or similar issues at least be elevated to the attention of the appropriate Microsoft admins for their review and resolution? &nbsp;It wouldn't speak well if MSFT ignorred the issue and customer base altogether since it is systemic.</p>

<h2>            I use Outlook 2007. I love the single inbox for multiple emails. Now, almost everyday it resends every email to my inbox. Have changed settings online</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with 2007 Professional Office suite for years. It started when I tried using the send/recieve button in Outlook. All of a sudden every email, still on the server, gets resent to me.</p>
<p>Now, I will all of a sudden get them all for no reason at all. Happening with the two email addresses I use the most.</p>
<p>If I don't get some help I will have to find another suitable email browser. Live mail has a seperate inbox for each email, and I have 6, so not useful to me.</p>
<p>I am hesitant to use this forum as I still have not had a satisfactory reply to my Media Player 12 issue back in November 2011.</p>
<p>Please give me some useful suggestions, rather than read from the first page of the "support manual for dummies".</p>
<p>I am not a novice and have plenty of experience troubleshooting and installing new operating systems and software.</p>
<p>By referencing my email addy, you should be able to find my Media Player issue, where I was given basic suggestions. I actually hoped it would make you aware of the problem and maybe even creat an update for same.</p>
<p>Would appreciate some real help this time.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><br />
I can well imagine that if you're using POP to access your Hotmail account, whether Outlook markes a message as read or not won't have any effect on whether the server sees the message as read or not when using a web interface.&nbsp; I can't see any reason why the
 server would care what the client does with the messages it has downloaded.</p>
<p>An internal problem on MY end???&nbsp; I don't have anything to do with Hotmail.&nbsp; I don't work for Microsoft.</p>

<p><br />
This and the statement you made, "it will resend all the emails in my inbox again", are no where near the same thing.&nbsp; One talks about sending and the other about receiving.&nbsp; Those are completely opposite actions.&nbsp; Please don't confuse the issue by using inaccurate
 descriptions.</p>
<p>If you are receiving the same messages each time you perform a send/receive, then you have something interfering with the send/receive process and either Outlook or your server are not receiving acknowledgement that the send/receive process has completed
 properly so that OOutlook and the server don't agree on what's new and what has been received.&nbsp; The usual cause is an add-in like an AV program scanning mail, but there could be other causes.</p>
<p>Once thing you can do immediately to prevent the old mail from downloading each time is to get it out of the server-side Inbox.&nbsp; Log into each of your accounts (whichever of them contains the redownloading messages) using a web browser, create another server-side
 folder, and move to that folder all of the old messages still in the server-side Inbox.&nbsp; If the messages aren't in the Inbox, Outlook can't see them and won't download them.&nbsp; Now see if new messages you receive behave properly.</p>
<p>You can also enable diagnostic logging (see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831053</a>) and review the receive portion of the send/receive cycle to see what transpires between Outlook and the server.&nbsp; It may lead to what's missing in the transaction.</p>

<h2>            IE8 Setting &#34;Open links from other programs in&#58; a new tab in the current window&#34; Does Not Always Work</h2>
                    
<p>I have IE8 Tab Settings configured to "Open links from other programs in: a new tab in the current window". In spite of this setting, links from other programs<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sometimes</span> open in a new window anyway. In other
 words, the setting does not always work. I have also tried changing "When a pop-up is encountered:" from&nbsp;"Let Internet Explorer decide..." to "Always open pop-ups in a new tab", but&nbsp;this has no effect on the problem.</p>
<p>Is this a matter of other programs overriding my setting? The latest example was an upgrade to Conceiva Mezzmo. A link to release notes was available in the upgrade dialog.&nbsp;I clicked it and the page opened in a new window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to get off topic, but this is annoying in part because IE8 is poorly designed IMO when it comes to remembering and opening the last session.&nbsp;For one thing,&nbsp;when you click "Reopen Last Browsing Session" IE8&nbsp;remembers the most recently opened
 window instead of the last session that was open when&nbsp;your browser is closed. That means anything opening a new&nbsp;browser window wipes out IE8's memory of your&nbsp;main session--even if you close the new window first! I<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">really</span>
 hope this is&nbsp;fixed in&nbsp;IE9. (BTW, yes I do know you can get the tabs IE8 forgets from history or manually save&nbsp;current tabs, etc. These are all just workarounds for a poor design.)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Embedded videos play fine when not connected to a TV or projector, but won&#39;t play on my laptop or tv&#47; projector when connected. &#34;Cannot play media&#34; error.</h2>
                    I have a Powerpoint presentation that has several videos embedded in it. They play fine when I'm not connected to any type of monitor, but when I connect to a TV or projector, they will not play in Presentation mode or in edit mode when connected. I taught
 a class the other day that was centered around these videos. I've checked "Disable slideshow hardware graphics acceleration" and "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" to no avail. I need to get this resolved ASAP. I have another class in a few days. Any
 help is appreciated. Thanks. Running Windows 10.

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the concerns that you may face while working with Microsoft‚Äôs PowerPoint application can be audio and video problems. PowerPoint users report, sometimes, that when they send their presentation through e-mail, the recipients are unable to play the
 presentation. It just refuses to load. Although the problem is rarely experienced it can be a cause of concern in certain cases. If your Audio and Video does not play in PowerPoint then this post will walk you through the process of troubleshooting audio and
 video playback and compatibility in PowerPoint. To sort out the concern, kindly follow the steps provided on this

</p><p>ok, OneNote Diagnostic not working for me, so a few details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did full shut down and waited 10 minutes</p>
<p>2. Signed in with full MS account (not four digit quick pass) and admin not user account</p>
<p>3. First install stalled (no sign of progress, at all)<br />
4. Cancelled, tried right click but no admin option for&nbsp;OneNoteDiagnostics.exe</p>
<p>5. Install went through anyway (with no further input from me)&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Task completed as outlined above</p>
<p>7. Files to attach appeared, but not clickable</p>
<p>8. Random little white square appeared mid-low area of dialogue box</p>
<p>9. Send button does not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>See screengrab (happy to help, OneNote great product :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps: now submit button not working on this page! Red circle with slash appears on submit button when clicked ! Will try without screengrab (nope) ... trying reloading page ... (edit: that worked!)</p>

<p>The ‚Äúget-remotedomain | fl‚Äù was set to&nbsp;MimeText</p>

    <title>MS Access 2010 adp performs poorly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt trost  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2010 adp performs poorly</h2>
                    My Microsoft Access adp performs poorly when connected to DatabaseB, hosted on Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2. When the same adp is connected to a different database, Database A, hosted on the same SQL Server 2008 R2 instance, it performs as expected. I'm
 trying to figure out the difference, but have come up empty. I've run many traces, have applied the recommended indexes from the SQL Server Performance Tuner, but still no significant improvement in the MS Access user interface when connected to DatabaseB.
 I'm using Access within an MS Office 2010 environment. The difference between DatabaseB and DatabaseA is substantial in the "row" data, but the table and column structure is identical. DatabaseB is about 0.25 as large as DatabaseA, so DatabaseB should perform
 faster from that standpoint. When I use MS Access in Office 2002, installed on a different server, to connect the adp to DatabaseB, it performs as expected, as it does when connected to DatabaseA.&nbsp; Is there a config option I

            <p>Was able to correct simply by changing how the .ade file is opened.&nbsp; For some reason, the .ade is querying all the views in the database, using a "schema" query that must be getting generated by Access because the VBA logic is not causing it, per se.&nbsp; I
 found that after every use in the VBA code of DoCmd.RunSQL "some valid sql statement", these "schema" queries are kicking off, selecting all the views where the username has permission (using the system permission function).&nbsp; It's actually that call to the
 system permission function that slows the .ade down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the .ade is opened via a Shell() call that uses "msaccess.exe [file location + file name] /runtime", and that causes these add'l queries generated by Access after each DoCmd.RunSQL "" to cease.&nbsp; The .ade is performing much better now...still no reason
 determined for why this was only happening when connected to one database, but not another.</p>

            <p>It seems that the slowness regards to Permission function doesn't exist for sysadmin users. Are you using same user for running both applications?
</p>
<p>and what's the database compatibility setting for these two databases?</p>

            <p>Yes, it was the same user for both databases, configured as a "dbo" in both databases.&nbsp; The reason determined for the poor performance of the app when connected to one db vs. the other was the number of views that had to be enumerated by the permissions
 lookup caused by using the DoCmd.RunSQL command.&nbsp; The "slow" db had many more views than the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided that launching the app with the /runtime switch was not the best approach, so I finally solved the problem by doing a find-replace in all the VBA code, and replaced each DoCmd.RunSQL with my own RunSQL procedure which uses the command Application.CurrentProject.Connection.Execute.<br />

            <p>Thanks Matt for sharing your experience. </p>
<p>Can I ask what was wrong with /runtime switch as if it really ommits that extra query which is&nbsp;getting generated by Access then it should be easier to just use&nbsp;this switch rather than change the code entirely specially if the application code is huge.</p>

            The environment that the app is deployed in is/was not reliable, in that it didn't always honor this switch or allow it to be used. (Office is deployed on terminal server w/ remote desktop client connections.)&nbsp; This became evident in the beta testing after
 this change was made to use the runtime switch.&nbsp; It always worked for me, since my account is a sysadmin on the AD, but for the users it seemed that their varying levels of permission/security were causing a problem.&nbsp; The method for invoking the instance of
 msaccess.exe was to initially open a "login" .mde file for authenticating the user's credentials, then launch the .ade file after authentication.&nbsp; It's possible that my code for launching the .ade with the /runtime switch had a flaw.&nbsp; It is a legacy app, and
 I didn't have time to figure out the customer's server environment, just needed to "make it work".&nbsp; Find/Replace was very quick, and writing the RunSQL "override" procedure was simple.<br />

<p>Hi Raju,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same issue occured to me, and creating a new profile doesn't solve it at all. Yesterday it stopped, but just came back so I cannot receive any new email from my Hotmail account on my Outlook (I'm using Outlook 2010 version too). It really sounds like
 the Outlook Hotmail Connector is faulty here, as in the past I haven't any Connector's window popping up and prompting for my password.</p>

    <title>Product function is not ignoring empty cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janetmitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product function is not ignoring empty cells</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up a formula to sum up cost totals for a number of cookie boxes. &nbsp;I have empty cells, but the product formula is not ignoring them. &nbsp;I don't know if it is a typo in my formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(PRODUCT(4, SUM(Inventory[@[SAVANNAH SMILES]:[THIN MINTS]])), (PRODUCT(5, [@[TOFFEE TASTIC]])), (PRODUCT(4, [@[DONATED COOKIES]])))</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first product is coming out correctly (I think) and the next two cells are blank but adding 9 anyway. Since I can't post my sheet, there is only 5 boxes in the Thin Mints column. All others are blank. The result coming out is $29. &nbsp;What am I doing wrong?</p>

            <p>I haven't checked your formula, but I suggest you check to verify that the "empty" cells are truly empty, i.e., Clear Contents.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the cells actually contain a space character so they appear empty, but most functions treat the space character as text, and that might explain the behavior you're seeing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no mystery here.&nbsp; Nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, you misunderstand what "ignore" means.&nbsp; It does <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></em> mean "interpret as zero".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arguably, the help page is misleading, if you do not read the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the one hand, it states (<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">over-simplifying</span></em>) that "PRODUCT(A1:A3, C1:C3) is equivalent to A1*A2*A3*C1*C2*C3".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, it <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">clarifies</span></em> that: "If an argument is an array or reference,
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only numbers</span></em> in the array or reference are multiplied. Empty cells [...] in the array or reference
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">are ignored</span></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in your case, PRODUCT(D17:F17) <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is equivalent</span></em> to PRODUCT(D17), which is 75.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But D17*E17*F17 is effectively 75*0*0, which is zero.</p>

<h2>            Changing Default SMS App on Skype</h2>
                    I use skype on my Alcatel tablet.&nbsp; Skype is using the hangouts app as the default sms app but I would like to change the default to my text messaging app.&nbsp; Is there any way to do that?

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What‚Äôs the Skype and Android version you‚Äôre currently using? Skype supports sending SMS feature and it does not use other application when you‚Äôre sending
 SMS through Skype. Changing the default messaging app on your device, depends on the app settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should mark this problem as solved but I still do not know how I solved it.&nbsp; Now the&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;shift + ' can now normally give a " output without&nbsp;doing anything else.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>After the install of "Dell XPS15 9560 BIOS update" 3 days ago, I can not reproduce the issue. But I am not sure if it is the only change I made to the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Attached is the screenshot for the hotkey setting.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to get further details about your concern, is it the same with Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer? Have you tried accessing other websites through different browsers? If you haven't tried any steps yet, what you can do first is clear the cache and
 cookies of the browser. Also, check the internet connection. An intermittent internet connection can cause issues with the web browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how this turns out for you.</p>

<h2>            How to run shell script from VBA on MAC OS</h2>
                    <p>Hello MAC support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on a VBA project for MS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using MAC 10.11.3 and MS Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue in running a shell script from my VBA code.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>I have tried below code:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
<span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">Dim</span>&nbsp;script_<span>path</span>
<span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">As</span> <span style="color: rgba(1, 25, 147, 1)">String</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
<span>script_</span><span>path&nbsp;</span>= ActiveDocument.Path &amp; "/idsbatch.command"</p>
<span>script_</span><span>path&nbsp;</span>= ActiveDocument.Path &amp; "/idsbatch.command"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
Shell <span>script_</span><span>path</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It gives an error "<strong>idsbatch.command can't be opened because Microsoft Word is not allowed to open documents in Terminal</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Please give me an example to run a shell script <span>
in background</span>&nbsp;which takes some arguments.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Will MS office 2016 VBA code also work for older version of MS Office?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Thanks,</p>
<p>

            No, sorry, I stay away from Java, so I have no experience with it. If you Google
<strong>run java from vba</strong>, you'll find many people searching for this information. Most of the solutions depend on the Shell command or Windows components like Windows Script Host Object, so it may not be possible with Office 2016 for Mac.

            <p>VBA has a MacScript() function that might work. The syntax looks like this:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">This calls AppleScript to run your file. I haven't tested this in 2016, whose version of VBA is still incomplete. Here is a page from Ron de Bruin about using the MacScript command:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rondebruin.nl/mac/mac017.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Select
 Folder with VBA/Macscript in Mac Office</a></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Due to Word 2016's sandboxing, the script should probably be located in the user folder of the person running the macro.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'm sure you have reasons for using a script to read Word documents, but I need to point out you're running this from Word, which already does that.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">June 25 update: I was reading on Ron's site that MacScript doesn't really work anymore because of sandboxing. However, there is a new VBA command AppleScriptTask that may allow you to work around the issue:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rondebruin.nl/mac/applescripttask.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AppleScriptTask

<h2>            Keeping Skype Running</h2>
                    I will be working remotely from home soon and my boss and I are trying to find an outlet where we can have a video connection for the both of us running all day - almost like i'm at the office.&nbsp; Can we log into our skype accounts in the morning&nbsp;and just
 keep it on our iPad's on our desks all day until the workday is done?

            Hi Deslandres81 
<br />
<br />No, you will not be able to do that, there is a fair usage policy on Skype - All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 4-hour duration
<br />
<br />Here is that Fair Usage Policy:

<h2>            Lumia 640 LTE - Windows 10 Mobile update to build 10.0.10586.218 keeps failing</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've update my Lumia 640 LTE to Windows 10 Mobile via the upgrade advisor, but I cannot seem to go beyond this version. In phone update it says there is an update available however every time the update finishes downloading, then installing it throws
 an error.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I can't remember the exact error code but I have seen other posts suggesting to perform a hard reset, though that didn't work. I tried downloading this update multiple times at various locations (including cellular data) yet it always fails. Now I'm starting
 to wonder if there's something wrong with the file integrity on the servers side, and if so, would it be possible to skip the official update and change to an insider fast ring build?<br />

<p>It's something that just started happening, updates had been going fine for years then all of the sudden&nbsp; . . . maybe a registry cleaner misshap&nbsp; . . . see above, upgrading to w-7 and off-2010 so will probably deal with it via upgrade process.</p>

            I spent most of the day online with Microsoft trying to solve this issue. Turns out that when my email is synced with any other device, it marks all new emails on my pc/laptop as "read"...just by syncing! Yet emails on my mobile are still "unread" until
 opened on my mobile, never from opening on my pc/laptop. Seriously, WTF??? With the previous version, I could open and delete emails on my mobile, and they would still be "unread" on my pc/laptop. I have no idea why they changed that. It's terrible! I want
 the old version back!!!!!

            I solved it myself by deleting the account on my mobile and installing a few different email apps. So far, Blue Mail has my vote, but I'm looking for one that doesn't have those hideous icons/logos to the right of all emails...they are pointless as I know
 how to read who the sender is, they take up too much space, and make it look childish in my opinion. The search continues, but at least the "read/unread" issue is no longer a problem.

            <p>The problem you were facing was this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are reading email from the account serving your primary computer/PC. It's a lot like you are reading it from the computer because your mobile account is not your PC account. so it is like reading your PC mail from your mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had two or more computers on the same line and all viewing the email page. all of them would show the messages as unread until you read and they either refresh themselves or you did. Same thing for having multiple instances of the webmail opened on
 the same computer...you can go to the other window/tab and&nbsp;likely find it as it was before, although when you open it that message will update and may produce an error message., say if you had deleted it prior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your PC and device may have different versions of your email queue depending on what their servers or the device&nbsp;has loaded.</p>

    <title>Web based outlook mail issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom webbin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Web based outlook mail issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft Outlook 2010 but I hardly ever use it.&nbsp; There was not a category to choose for Outlook mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always use my web based Outlook mail and that is where I am having issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Firefox as my browser and my homepage is MSN.com&nbsp; When I logged in to my Outlook mail most of my mail folders have disappeared.&nbsp; The folders that remain have been renamed back to past folder names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have mail that is in the "Focused" category and "Other" category and I can't move mail from either one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I change the name of a new folder that I create or a current folder it reverts back to the original name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My "draft" folder in ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My "Sent" folder is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my contacts are ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked in to my "draft" folder to see if any of my other folder are in there and they are not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have signed in to my account using a different browser and I have the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have optimized the browser by clearing the cache, cookies, and history and still have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this happened three days ago and I don't know why it happened and that is why I need your expertise to solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Microsoft support and they are no help at all.&nbsp; All they want you to do is self diagnose they problem.&nbsp; If I could do that I would not have contacted them in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Tom,<br />
<br />
For us to better assist you, we need to identify first as to why your folders in your account keep reverting back to the original name even if you have changed it. Have you tried signing in to another web browser on your computer? Also, have you tried signing
 in to your account on another device?

            Thank you for the information. Normally, it shouldn't revert the folders back to its original name when viewing your account through Outlook.com. In this case, we recommend that you email our Outlook.com Support team on this
<em><strong><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/outlook.com/ts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> for further assistance and to raise this issue with them.<br />

            Hi Melody, you need to deactivate your previous Installation and then re-install Office 2016
<br />
<br />On the New Laptop, go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />Select Install 
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate the old laptop which Office was installed on 
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation 
<br />
<br />Then, click Install to install Office
