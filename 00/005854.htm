<p>Did you setup the Mail app after you installed Win 10? It works good and can have all accounts in one place.</p>
<p>The printer makers need to get their drivers setup for Win 10 correctly and those things happen with a new OS.</p>
<p>Try Imgburn to burn&nbsp;or Virtual Clone Drive if you just are trying to install a game, program, or app just mount and install it works great and can view files if you are trying to watch movie or play music no burn needed.</p>
<p>Favs can added to Edge and the desktop or just create a folder in this PC called favorites then click and drag them in.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>There is no Office 2012, so&nbsp;that eliminates one possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For PCs, Microsoft currently sells only Office 2013 (aka Office 365) so, unless you can find a vendor selling Office 2010, that's what you'll be upgrading to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, given that Excel 2013 on its own costs US$110 but the Office suite is only $30 more for the Home &amp; Student edition (if you qualify) and $110 more for the Home and Business edition, I'd be inclined to go for the suite, which gives you the latest versions
 of Word, PowerPoint and OneNote as well (plus Outlook in the Home and Business edition).

<h2>            Microsoft Users - Ditch Logitech</h2>
                    <p>Recently I purchased a Logitech UE Boom speaker for use with my Windows Phone. The sales woman at POS stated to that an app could be downloaded to enable dual pairing and stereo. Arriving home I attempted to download said app only to find that Logitech only
 support Apple and Android. There is no support for Windows 8 PCs and Laptops either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that as Logitech made money for many years selling webcams, keyboards, mice and many other peripheral&nbsp;PC devices that they would surely have something it the works to address this oversight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response received from Logitech was nothing short of a belligerent snub. There is nothing being developed, planned or even considered. In a reply e-mail I suggested that many companies are developing WP apps for third parties, and that replication of
 their existing apps could be available in the short term. The cost of app development would be pittance compared to the expanded market potential. Their reply was the same as before, only more abrasive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have they forgotten the loyalty&nbsp;of PC owners in the past? Don't they want the extra sales from Windows and WP owners?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I for one won't be purchasing another Logitech product until they address their attitude and&nbsp;level of mutual support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. There is market potential for anyone who wants to develop an app to emulate the blue tooth stereo function for portable speakers available on the UE Boom app.</p>

            <p>I also got the same answer when I tried after buying mine around the same time.</p>
<p>Although it has to be said, the only thing we miss, is being able to check the battery levels. But that is also a function I miss a lot.
</p>
<p>It is for instance easy to pair 2 UE Booms without the app, if that is what you are on about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems like Logitech is in agreement With Google not to develop anything for Windows, be it Modern apps for Windows 8/RT or for Windows Phone 8.x. Let's hope things change with the Universal Apps for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I will not buy another Product without making sure my preferred platform is supported by the producer. Too bad, cause I would probably buy more of the UE booms and also the bigger one they just released if they would've supported us.</p>

            <p>Hi Riel,</p>
<p>thanks for your response.</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled OneNote several times. Afterwards it worked for a while but then the same problem returned. I'll try to use the procedure indicated in the tread you refered to even if it sound more like magic than a real solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I switched to OneNote from Evernote when I purchased my Office account even if Evernote worked fine. Now, to tell the truth, I am a bit tired of OneNote. When I'm out of office or home and depend on my smartphone OneNote
<p>No better solution to propose?</p>

<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled OneNote several times. Afterwards it worked for a while but then the same problem returned. I'll try to use the procedure indicated in the tread you refered to even if it sound more like magic than a real solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I switched to OneNote from Evernote when I purchased my Office account even if Evernote worked fine. Now, to tell the truth, I am a bit tired of OneNote. When I'm out of office or home and depend on my smartphone OneNote
<p>No better solution to propose?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've office 2016 installed on Windows 10. It shows the message that updates are available.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to handle &#35;Error return on Query&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob schneider  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to handle &#35;Error return on Query&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>In have a query which returns a column based on a call to a bespoke function in a module which returns TEXT. &nbsp;In the query, some of the other columns are passed to the function for the function to do its thing (complex alogrithm). &nbsp;When the passed columns
 are empty (I presume they are NULL), the function returns #Error to display in the query answer table. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm ok with getting an error return as thats true. &nbsp;The algorithm can't compute unless all fields available. &nbsp;However, I'm trying to append these query results to another Table and the field where there function result goes is a Text(255) field. &nbsp;However,
 Access will not allow the append of what looks to be text into this text field. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the form of this #Error "text" that get's returned? &nbsp;How to turn it into real text that can be saved?</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>: use an IIF to test for True/False on the return</p>
<p>: use an IIF to test for =#Error</p>
<p>: put On Error error handling in the function to go to a part of the function to set the return value = "ERROO!" which I know is text</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

<p>You do not need on error. Having no values available is just a situation you have to handle.</p>
<p>However, you do have to define both the parameters as the function as Variant to make sure nulls are accepted. The function could look like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Function YourFunction(A AS Variant, B AS Variant) AS Variant</p>
<p>IF IsNull(A) and IsNull(B) Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; YourFunction=Null</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>End Function</p>

    <title>Excel 2010&#58; Reading&#47;opening Lotus 1-2-3 .123 files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dorischmetterling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010&#58; Reading&#47;opening Lotus 1-2-3 .123 files</h2>
                    <p>Shortly&nbsp;we shall acquire a Windows 8 computer in our family, which will also act as a test bed to see what old programmes will run on it.&nbsp; Our other machines are XP SP3 and WIn 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case I am forced (or wish) to drop Lotus 1-2-3 altogether I was wondering if there is a way of opening/reading these Lotus 1-2-3 files&nbsp;in Excel 2010, which only supports OpenOffice among 'foreign' file formats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My query relates to&nbsp;my Win XP SP3 machine and the planned Win 8 machine&nbsp;(and Excel 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many Lotus 1-2-3 files, in both .wk4 and 'newer' .123 formats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for info, I have successfully converted a number of current (i.e. in regular use)&nbsp;Lotus 1-2-3 files to Excel 2010, also with help from this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1 of the pathway is to Save As xls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this is impractical for the dozens of Lotus files I still have, and which I am still keeping for reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excel 2000 (which I still have but do not fancy using) can open .wk4 files but not .123.&nbsp; I do not need to work on these, just need to be
 able to view them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a fairly recent thread (about Jan 2013) somebody had a similar problem but mentioned only .wk files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution given was to download&nbsp;the open-source spreadsheet app, gnumeric:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming this works in Win 8 and Lotus 1-2-3 (dated approx 2000) does not, I could use it as a viewer.</p>
<p>Regrettably, it also mentions support for only Lotus 1-2-3 .wk1 format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other references to file conversions in the MS support forums also&nbsp;refer to wk4 and older files, and older versions of Excel.&nbsp; I found one suggestion to export the unknown file type as a CSV and open as xls:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2671933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2671933</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this is no improvement over exporting from Lotus to .xls (or printing to PDF...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;&nbsp; I am wondering if anyone has come up with a simple way of viewing -- if not opening -- Lotus 1-2-3 .wk and .123 files using Excel 2010 without having the Lotus app available.</p>

                    I have windows 7 home premium, installed Microsoft office pro 2013. When I launch Outlook 2013, the new account wizard did not launch. I proceed to click on the FILE Tab, and click on the "Add Account" button, but nothing happens. I even tried to access

<h3> zsolt_93  say:</h3>
<h2>            5630 Question</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently bought a Nokaia 5630XM from an online store.I've got a few problems with it.</p>
<p>1.)&nbsp;It has only 2versions of chinese+english languages.I've updated the firmware to the latest version but no change. What should i do?</p>
<p>2.)I've downloaded the PhoneInfo app from Ovi store and it shows only 192MHz CPU frequency instead of 600MHz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. I've checked if it's genuine and yes, it is.&nbsp;</p>

            the phone info program does not always read the stats correctly so i would not rely on it so much. now it sounds like you could have purchased a version for a region that uses those languages instead of language pack that could be used for your region.
 you can add a language at nokia care for a small fee but also understand that if you update your phone your language you have added might be lost and you will have to do it all over again.&nbsp;

            Thank you for your fast reply.And yet another question: Is there a way to free up some phone memory by removing temporary files.I tried to install every application that needs lots of space on the memory card, but the space in my phone memory is decreasing
 too.&nbsp;

<p>make sure that your messages are being saved to memory card&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>messaging - options- settings - other - select 999 for count and memory card for storage</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also make sure you clean your web browser cache regularly &nbsp;</p>

<h3> tap17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Space or line below page header</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a quick glance, my page headers can be momentarily confused with the top line or two of the page body. Is there a way to create more space between the header and the body? Or put say a dotted line between them? I note that Layout &gt; Page Setup does
 not seem to allow this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to define a header style with 12 points below it. I can put 12 points below any header but when I made it a style, the header got messed up.</p>

            <p>The best way to do this is to increase the distance between the header margin and the top margin, either by reducing the header margin or by increasing the top margin. But if you want to add space only for specific headers, then it is better to add Spacing
 After.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have modified the formatting of any of the headers (especially some but not all) without updating the style, then updating the Header style to add Spacing After may have unpredictable results (that is, the formatting of all headers will be affected,
 which is likely not what you want).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Word uses the single Header style for all headers by default, if you want different formatting in, say, Odd and Even headers, then it will be more practical to define a new style for one or the other (or even two new styles, avoiding the built-in
 style entirely) and apply the styles systematically to the appropriate headers.</p>

<p>You do it the same as you edit (modify) any of the built-in styles. Header and Footer are built-in styles.&nbsp; I like to have the Style Pane displayed with the list of all styles in alphabetical order. I find the style I want to modify and right-click on it
 in the list, then select Modify.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e94ea411-d99b-4bef-b509-817930b7a7db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e94ea411-d99b-4bef-b509-817930b7a7db" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally try to keep my headers and footers away from text. I also distinguish them by making them wider than the page with left and right indents outside the margin and a corresponding right-tab setting. The page header is almost always in<em> Italics</em>
 as well. I will often put a bottom border on the Header style and a top border on the Footer style. Generally, I will have the Footer style based on the Header style. That way if I change the font in the header, I get the same font in the footer. Unless you
 are doing something very different, you almost certainly want to modify the header and footer styles rather than create your own.</p>

    <title>Dropdown compatibility issues for IE 9 to IE11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sai kushal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dropdown compatibility issues for IE 9 to IE11</h2>
                    <p>I am making compatible my Asp.net 4.o web application from IE9 browser to IE11. some times as per program logic I have only one item to display in the dropdown list. I am using &lt;asp:DropDownList ID="DropDownList1" runat="server"&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IN IE9 Browser:</strong><br />
when I click on the dropdown , the list is displaying in the browser as I mentioned in the screen below (We can observe that for one&nbsp;item&nbsp;the&nbsp;list is appearing)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a08035f4-207f-484c-9c63-c8ed6b51d5a5" height="166" width="386" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>IN IE11 Browser:</strong><br />
When I click on the dropdown, the list is not displaying for one item in the browser and it is appearing as it got stuck. In screenshot we can observe the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66045254-43ad-4e02-ac9a-7735ec5bcc25" /><br />
Now the client wants the functionality of IE9 dropdown list to appear in IE11. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>should not force from the application to use IE9 browser compatibility.</p>
<p>Please suggest how can I get the functionality of dropdown in IE11 as same in IE9.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            It means they are old-style raster/bitmap fonts rather than vector fonts such as TrueType/OpenType. You would see this kind of font if you installed an old-style dot matrix printer such as an Epson FX80. (versions of Windows before around 3.1 did not have
 any support for vector fonts at all and used "bitmap fonts" for the screen and for those printers that had no font support of their own).

<h2>            How to change name on Outlook people pane&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2010 installed on Windows 7.&nbsp; Until today, the People Pane has showed up with my name Rob *** as my contact name/detail.&nbsp; However, today (or possibly the last couple of days and I've only just noticed) this has now changed to a username that
 I use on a football fan forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've NEVER signed in the people pane to any social networking site, so Outlook has obviously taken it upon itself to look at email notifications I've received from this fan site and decided that is what I want to be called on my people pane!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click onto People Pane account settings then it shows that I don't have anything connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to remove off any connections that Outlook has decided to make, and also to remove off/restore my contact name from this username to my own name!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the new Microsoft Edge browser or IE11? If you are using Edge, it does not support Silverlight so switch to using IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE11 can be found by searching for <strong>Internet Explorer&nbsp;</strong>from the&nbsp;Search box at the bottom of the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip - If you are in Edge and viewing a page that needs Silverlight, you can switch to&nbsp;Internet Explorer by selecting the 3 dots (<strong>...</strong>) near the top right then
<strong>Open with Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in IE11's <strong>Manage add-ons </strong>section ensure that Silverlight is enabled.</p>

<h2>            Problems with Nokia 7373</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have just noticed that when ever i get a text i can hardly hear it and the swivel noise is very quiet. When the phone is called i hear it fine but not when a text comes through.<br />
<br />
The phone is nearly 18 months old and i have never had any trouble with it (most problems are either fixable or i can put up with it).<br />
<br />
If anyone can help me solve this as i don't want to get a new phone cos i really like this one (after modifications) i'd really appreciate it<br />
<br />

if you try it,you should reset your phone by typing *#7780# in standby mode.<br />
dont forget back up your phone and micro SD card.(all data and duc. will remove)

    <title>New downloaded emails do not appear in Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New downloaded emails do not appear in Inbox</h2>
                    
<p>It seems there are others who are having similar problems to mine.&nbsp;</p>
When I am out of my office and download email I am able to see all the email downloaded to my junk email folder but my inbox does not show any received email (it does not list the number of emails on the folder list pane and they do not show on right pane either).&nbsp;
 The send/receive status shows that it downloaded more more emails than what were in the junk email folder (i.e. if it downloads 60 messages I see 50 in my junk email folder and the other 10 do not appear anywhere), so I did a search for an email I knew should
 be in the inbox.&nbsp; The search view shows the missing email and has it listed as being in my inbox, but when I close the search and go back to the normal folder list view it does not appear in the inbox.&nbsp; I do not have this problem when I am in my office (connected
 with Exchange Server).&nbsp; I've tried removing the spam filter and turning off my A/V program, but neither fixes the problem.&nbsp; I do not have caching selected for the Exchange Server.&nbsp; Any ideas on what is causing this problem and how to fix it?

            I have found a way around my problem even though it doesn't explain why Outlook is hiding the new messages messages in my Inbox but allows me to see new messages in my other folders.&nbsp; I tried quite a few setting changes (including having all my email sorted
 into a temporary folder) and found that setting the Exchange Server to cached mode allows me to see the new emails without causing any new problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still would like to understand the mechanism of what happened so I can prevent a recurrence, but figure
 I will have to solve that one myself as well.

<h2>            County lines in Excel map charts extending over bodies of water</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a county map of the state of Michigan using Excel's map charts. However, when I do that, the county lines appear to extend over Lake Michigan, making the map look odd. Any way to prevent this? Screenshot attached.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95261f79-7c8b-4173-b53e-ac1f66fe3378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95261f79-7c8b-4173-b53e-ac1f66fe3378" /></a></p>

            <p>Sorry to be the bearer of ill tidings, but there most likely is not much you can do. In a properly created form designed for multiple platforms the user should be able to complete editable areas without having to remove any protection. Protection not only
 prevents users from making unauthorized changes but also is a part of the mechanism that makes the form operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without seeing the actual form it's impossible to be sure, but in all probability the form was created using a Windows version of Word which supports 3 types of fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legacy Form Fields</strong> which also are fully supported in Mac Word. If these had been used there should be no problem completing the form using most any version of Mac Word,</li><li><strong>Content Controls</strong>, which can be <em>created</em> only in a Windows version but will
<em>function</em> in&nbsp;Office 2016 programs if the installation is fully updated. Confirm that your software is at version 15.31 or later, &amp;</li><li><strong>ActiveX Controls</strong>, which are wholly <em>un</em>supported on a Mac. If these have been used you may be able to complete the form using Word Online, but probably will have to use Word for Windows.</li></ul>
<p>The only other option is to print the form, complete it by hand &amp; mail it in. If it needs to be submitted electronically, scan the completed form as a PDF, then attach to an email or upload to the site.</p>

<h2>            Why do I change sites when I hit Backspace on my keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone know why I am&nbsp;changing sites (always? sometimes?) when I hit <em>Backspace</em> on my keyboard? It happens to me on this site and I think it also happens to me on other sites and it is very disturbing. As I am typing in a question or a reply,
 if I want to back up on the sentence and I hit the Backspace key on my keyboard, I lose anything that I have already typed in as my Internet Explorer changes sites back to the previous site. I'm sure that there must be some setting that is set wrong, either&nbsp;in
 my IE or in my software for my a<strong>ViewSonic Viewmate Office Keyboard KU312</strong>.</p>
<p>And please, keep any of those <em>virus-spyware-adware</em> ideas out of this. I just would really like some real answers.</p>

            Tom. I do run XP. I put the CD in and installed it. It all seems to be working good. Now there is a program called Kensington MouseWorks. I'll let you know if I have that issue anymore with the keyboard. The manual said that my mouse would basically work
 without the program installed but it might not do certain things. It said that the mouse will work only as a basic mouse.

<p>The Backspace key is the equivalent of the Back button in IE. But, if your&nbsp;prompt (flashing cursor) is in the Reply box, you shouldn't be exiting the box and going back one page in IE. Do you have your mouse set up to change focus when the mouse cursor rests
 in one place for a set period of time?</p>
<p>I used the Backspace key numerous time in this reply, and didn't have a problem leaving this page. I don't think it's your keyboard that's causing the problem, but I can't say for certain what is.</p>
