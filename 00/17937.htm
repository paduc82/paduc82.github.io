</p><p>I have a question I posted that has been locked without an answer.&nbsp; Apparently it was locked by a moderator who made a suggestion relative to a problem, but her answer obviously shows she did not understand the problem.&nbsp; Now that it is locked, I cannot reply
 to the moderator who locked the thread or made the suggestion thus I am left with the problem, with no answers even close to resolving the issue.</p>

    <title>Outlook and hotmail.com blocking mail from our business - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook and hotmail.com blocking mail from our business</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm hoping someone from MS can assist me on this as I am having great difficulty getting a resolution. I am the IT admin for an accounting firm, we run Exchange 2003 on premise here and for years have had no mail flow issues. We arent on any blacklists
 etc Our IP is 83.70.156.37</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A few weeks ago outlook.com/hotmail.com/live.com email accounts started bouncing mail from our exchange server. It turns out one user had tried to send a mass mail about the recent budget in Ireland to approx 500 recipients, our clients, some of whom have
 hotmail, live and outlook.com email addresses. I know she shouldn't have done this and sue our third party mailchimp subscription instead, it was however a once off. I thought after a week or two the restriction would be lifted but not so.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft flagged this I have discovered as name space mining. 3 weeks have passed now and we are still unable to send email to our clients using hotmail addresses. this is now a serious issue for our business and for our clients. The income tax deadline
 in Ireland is looming and email correspondence to clients is crucial. Clients are annoyed also as they don't understand why hotmail wont allow them receive mail from their accountants.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This person here seemed to have a very similar issue although we weren't actually listed on a blacklist&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/6c9a38cf-ea5f-4b1a-990e-a02d960bc823/messages-blocked-by-outlookcom?forum=exchangesvrsecuremessaging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/6c9a38cf-ea5f-4b1a-990e-a02d960bc823/messages-blocked-by-outlookcom?forum=exchangesvrsecuremessaging</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>how can I get this block lifted? We arent spamming anyone, our mail server is fully patched and secure,, running Symantec Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange. No other ISP or mail recipient is blocking any mail from us except MS. On dnsstuff.com we arent
 listed on any blacklists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have completed this support form multiple times now but I just get the same response every time telling me we are blocked for namespace mining.</div>
<div><a href="https://support.live.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl3&amp;ct=eformts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.live.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl3&amp;ct=eformts</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems we are banished indefinitely by MS and its a big issue for our business now as it is dragging on and on. Ok, a user sent one mail she shouldnt have to a large group of recipients, but it seems we are being punished an inordinate amount for this.
 I need to find a way to get this block lifted urgently please.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help much appreciated!</div>
<div>Thank you</div>
<div><br />
</div>

 with the Microsoft Sender Support Team because they are the ones that can best address your query since they have the appropriate resources to assist you and they're the experts in your field of inquiry. You can contact them using the link to the e-form that
 you indicated in your post. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Karla,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply, I left this issue for a few weeks and hoped it would resolve itself but it still has not. Is there anyway I can contact a person in the sender support team instead of filling out that form which I have done about 50 times at this
 stage!</div>

            <p>We have the same issue; We have reverse DNS, SPF, everything correctly set up.</p>
<p>We are on NO blacklists at all, for months.&nbsp; However, for two weeks, my customers cannot send mail to hotmail users.&nbsp; Filling out the form results in "your IP's are mitigated." however, when I check the SNDS page, our IP's are still blocked:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>First IP</td>
<td>Last IP</td>
<td>Blocked</td>
<td>Details</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176.9.179.200</td>
<td>176.9.179.207</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Blocked due to user complaints or other evidence of spamming</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But there is no actual spamming from our site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep asking hotmail staff, all I get is "we cannot discuss details."&nbsp; </p>
<p>Therefore I cannot get the IP's removed from the blocklist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculous business practice; My customers can email anywhere in the world but to poor hotmail users. Since hotmail offers no clues, we cannot "correct" anything if there is anything to correct.</p>

    <title>Adjustment to a macro please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelly_996  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adjustment to a macro please</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a file with 2 sheets - one called "Report" and one called "master list" that has each client's name and ID number. I want to recreate the "Report" page for each client. I have this macro makes a copy of the "Report" sheet and changes the client name
 by using a named range, and it works well. But my Report page is full of formulas that pull from other files, and it is based on cell P1 on the "Report" page which is the client's ID number. Can we adjust this macro to change that ID number in cell P1, and
 then make the copy of the sheet, then change the ID number in cell P1, and so on and so on?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sub CreateReports()</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim c As Range</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim c As Range</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In Range("First_Customers")</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In Range("First_Customers")</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Sheets("Report")</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Sheets("Report")</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Range("A2").Value = c.Value</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Range("A2").Value = c.Value</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Copy After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count)</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Copy After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count)</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Name = c.Value</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Name = c.Value</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next c</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next c</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>End Sub</span><br />
<span>End Sub</span><br />
</p>
<p>Then one last thing - after all the sheets are made, I might need to make some manual adjustments to a few of them, and then when they are all ready, I would like to do a simple copy and paste special, values to remove the formulas in each page. So easy
 enough to record a macro of the copy and paste special values, but i don't know how to do it so it does each sheet, can you help with a separate macro for that please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h3> alex_0502  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Microsoft give support to Office on Bootcamp&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just had a support call with Microsoft. I use Win10 on a Bootcamp partition (mac), and the support agent said he cannot give support to Windows on a Bootcamp. The guy said they are being trained to identify if you are running Windows on another platform
 - if they access remotely your machine running on another hardware, they have to disconnect otherwise they get a penalty. WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I doubt that exception would be on the terms I signed when I subscribed for Office 365... please prove me wrong if you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to get an official answer here, thank you.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can move your question to the proper forum, but I can't tell if your focus is support for Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office in Boot Camp is no different from Microsoft Office on Dell, Toshiba, or any other brand of hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support for Windows on Apple hardware seems to be the central point of your question, but I want to be sure before I move it to the Windows forum.</p>

<p>Yes, support for windows on Apple hardware is the central point, thank you for that!</p>
<p>I was informed by the support agent that he could not connect remotely to me because I am running windows 10 on bootcamp, on an Apple computer - he even said he would get a penalty if he did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This regards Microsoft Support in Brazil, my region, but I guess the policies are global, so it could happen to more people globally. It is really not fair from Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please move this conversation? I could not find the right topic.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to pester you again, but when I move your question to the Windows 10 forum, I have to park it into one of these subcategories. Can you tell me which seems the best fit for you?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9216bc5c-89d0-418f-b59d-3aefa27bfe4e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9216bc5c-89d0-418f-b59d-3aefa27bfe4e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I rather like the sound of the topic "Mixed Reality."&nbsp; Some days are like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind these forums are primarily user-to-user, but sometimes Microsoft support chimes in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, if you have a question about Microsoft Office in Windows 10, it's not necessary to mention that you're using Boot Camp. Boot Camp has no effect on the operation or support of Microsoft Office and bringing it up could confuse Windows users who otherwise
 would have no problem answering your questions. Just go ahead and post your Office questions in the appropriate Office for Windows forum.</p>

            <p>As I said, this will require VBA. One of the issues to consider is: once the box is checked and data is added to the other sheet, what should happen when the box is unchecked? Should the data be deleted? Where was it added? Did it's addition when the box
 was checked affect any other data? How should that be handled when the data is deleted due to the box being unchecked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the problem is probably not as simple as you have envisioned it. VBA will be required to add the data when the box is checked as well as handle what ever should happen when the check box is cleared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to contact me off-line, with more complete specs, I will be happy to provide a price quotation for the VBA to accomplish your needs. My email address is in my profile, just click on my name.</p>

<p>Hi Md,</p>
<p>The local network that’s protected from the Internet by a firewall can result the issue, could you try by passing the “office15client.microsoft.com”(no quotes) under network settings to see if the issue will occur? Refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH13981?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=zh_CN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/kb/PH13981?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=zh_CN</a></p>
<p>If the issue persists, to narrow down it, I would like to confirm the following things.</p>
<ol>
<li>How about changing to another network environment? </li><li>Confirm if other users under the same network environment encounter the same issue.
</li><li>Besides his MacBook, iPad, can he repro the issue on another PC machines? </li></ol>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Bottom line is that&nbsp;Forward&nbsp;Contact As a Business Card worked AND fixed the consistent issue I experienced forwarding as Outlook Contact.&nbsp; Perhaps some permissions are set when you import anything to into Contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, thank you for the suggestions, which got me to thinking and experimenting.</p>

<p>Hello Juan,</p>
<p>I have a long list of contacts in Skype 12.1803.279.0 (all normal numbers, not online contacts!) which has grown in the last years. When I make a call to someone and I wanted to remember that number I added a contact to my list. This was very convenient.</p>
<p>I still can't image any softwareengineer who will discard this function! It's really very stupid, because the
<p>I can add chats en bots, but these are functions I will seldom use, but the most import function is discarded!??? I still can't believe this.</p>
<p>Maybe I am very oldfashion, but I still talk to people!</p>
<p>I wonder which manager of MS had this idea.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar Schedule Issue - Time Zone</h2>
                    When scheduling a meeting the time shown to the recipients is different from the time we set up ...generally by 3 hours.&nbsp; Checking the Time Zone&nbsp; in "Options" we are set up as Eastern Time which is correct.&nbsp; Why is flipping to another time zone to recipients?
 We are using Outlook 2010

            If everyone has his or her Windows and Outlook time zones selected properly and all have applied the Windows updates for DST, then Outlook will handle events across time zones properly and each person will see the event in his or her local time.&nbsp; Thus
 if a person in the Eastern time zone makes an event for 9:00 AM and sends it to someone in the Pacific time zone, the time will be 6:00 AM and if they send it to someone in London, that person will see it at 2:00 PM.

<h2>            applications don&#39;t close after use although back arrow is pressed</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;Apps ,&nbsp;in my&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 550 - Windows mobile 10- &nbsp;remain open in background , after their use is finished &nbsp;, although back arrow is pressed . &nbsp;As a result , battery is rapidly discharged&nbsp; .The only way to close them ,&nbsp;is to keep the back arrow button pressed
 and close them individually &nbsp;by pressing the "x" &nbsp;button .</p>
<p>Is there a way , or a setting , for the apps to be shutdown , right after the back arrow button is pressed ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance </p>
<p />

<p>I just bought a Nokia E5 and I noticed that on my microsd card the phone</p>
<p>has written a file: M:\private\101ffc31\glxmdstn</p>
<p>the problem is that the file is 420Mb in size.... this is just too much for me to accept.</p>
<p>I deleted the file 2 times but the phones makes it again :(</p>
<p>Is there any way to disable the creation of this file?</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>The folder you mention apparently contains the thumbnails of your pictures, so if you delete it and then go to the gallery, the thumbnails will be re-created.</p>

    <title>Sony Vaio SVS1512Z9EB again - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vienna10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony Vaio SVS1512Z9EB again</h2>
                    <div>Since a previous upgrade from Windows 8.1 failed (as reported), decided to clean install build 10162 from the ISO on a separate 500 GB partition. All went well. Installed Vaio Care software, which then updated drivers from the Sony site.</div>

<div>
<p>All ok until yesterday, where windows decided to download and update the Synaptic PS2 Port Touch Pad. Had to reboot, as I had lost the mouse. On reboot, the mouse worked sort-of - no three finger swipe and no left and right click.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Uninstalled the Microsoft driver and reinstalled the Vaio, which then worked again. However, Windows updated the driver again, with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>The same happened to the NVidia graphics driver, where the existing one was replaced. This caused Adobe PS to keep crashing, until the original was replaced.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Nokia N8 still doesn't work. The Nokia X6 worked on the previous build, but now this has stopped working as well.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Lastly, although I am on fast build, no sign of build 10166, which downloaded on my VM two days ago</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per your description I understand that the driver update is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First I would suggest you to update the drivers from the manufacturer website in Compatibility Mode and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the steps to install a driver in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span>a. <strong>
Right click</strong> on the setup file of the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Select
<strong>Compatibility Tab</strong></span></p>
<p><span>c. Place a check mark next to Run this program in Compatibility mode and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list</span></p>
<p><span>d. Let the driver to install and then check the functionality.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If still issue persist then I suggest you to follow the steps to avoid driver update to reinstall:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>System</strong> and then.</span></li><li><span>On the top left corner click on
<strong>System Protection.</strong></span></li><li><span>In the <strong>System Property Window</strong> click on
<strong>Hardware Tab.</strong></span></li><li><span>Then click on <strong>Device Installation settings
</strong></span></li><li><span>In the Device Installation settings window</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Do you want Windows to download driver software and realistic icon for your device?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Choose</span></strong><span> option
<strong>No, let me choose what to do</strong> then <strong>select</strong> option
<strong>Never install driver software from Windows update </strong>and click on <strong>
save changes </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps and let us know the status of the issue we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>thank you for the answer. If I go to the driver website, they advise me to download the driver from Sony's site. The reason being that some notebook manufacturers add features to their hardware, which are not available elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already disabled the device installation settings, but that didn't stop Windows from installing its own driver</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Tech Preview error code 0x0000605</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the Tech Preview since November with minimal issues. Unfortunately, I booted up my laptop this afternoon and received the 0x0000065 error code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your PC/device needs to be repaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A component of the operating system has expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \WINDOWS\system32\winload.exe</p>
<p>Error code: 0x0000605</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media contact your PC administrator or manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Enter to try again.</p>
<p>Press F8 for startup settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I press enter it reboots and goes into automatic repair, then I receive the same error message. When I try F8 the screen blacks out for one second then displays the above message. No other options are presented, and I'm unable to get to the BIOS to
 change my boot order to use a bootable USB. Any ideas would be most welcome.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue with build 10049</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS date was incorrect at year 2017</p>
<p>I changed bios date at boot and booted windows with same error.</p>
<p>I verified bios date and was changed back to year 2017</p>
<p>I changed bios date again and booted into safe mode with error and bios date changed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then changed bios date and booted to command line with networking.</p>
<p>The date was correct, and rebooted to Windows with same error and bios date was changed back to year 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many different recovery fix modes without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks as if Windows changes bios date to last seen on bootup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not want to reinstall Windows and loose programs and updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the bios date and rebooted.</p>
<p>I booted into recovery mode and chose to restore to a previous installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brought me back to build 10041</p>
<p>This fixed the issues but there are no updates and longer to bring me back to build 10049</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other computer is booted onto network with build 10049</p>
<p>Both machines are set to receive Updated automatically and set to receive using other computers on network and Internet.</p>
<p>Both machines are also set to receive Updates using Fast method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other machine is receiving a new update but the original machine with build 10041 always states all updates are completed and no more available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have an ISO for the new build 10049 as was updated using Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is OK, however I am concerned that any new builds will not be installed at a later date.</p>

            If the manufacturer of your windows mobile device provided an update to WM6.1 for it, you can find it on their website.&nbsp; Microsoft does not distribute generic upgrades to end users. Microsoft provides upgrades to device manufacturers who customize the
 OS to run on the device, if they decide to create an upgrade for an existing line of devices.

<p>When I click 'open windows defender' in Update &amp; Security under Settings so I can perform a scan I get an error message reading C:/Program Files/Windows Defender/msascui.exe &nbsp; Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the
 appropriate permissions to access the item. Why is this and how do I get defender open?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you post a screen shot of the error you are seeing?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't sound like Defender is disabled, but just in case can you try executing the following command (from an elevated command prompt) : "%programfiles%\windows defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -wdenable</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let me know what 'Virus Protection' is displayed in the 'Security' section of Security Center.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Windows Defender will not launch if there is a 3rd party registered.</p>
