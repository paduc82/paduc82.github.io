<h2>            Update to Outlook deletes the Send to OneNote feature.</h2>
                    <p>It seems&nbsp;an automatic update for Office 365 has made a change to Outlook.&nbsp; On the Home Tab, Send to One Note&nbsp;WAS available in the Move Group.&nbsp; It is now gone and when you go to the customization window it is greyed out.&nbsp; The old version generated an immediate
 popup to select where in OneNote you wanted the e-mail sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the upgrade, you can add a new version of Send to OneNote in a new Group.&nbsp; HOWEVER, it opens a window in OneNote, slowly displays the OneNote notebooks which are open (in Non-Alphabetical order) and then, if you use SharePoint you get this error (even
 if you have less than 5000 items) after selecting a notebook:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Error when expanding notebook. One or more of the document libraries on the user or group's OneDrive contains more than 5,000 OneNote items (notebooks, sections, section groups) and cannot be queried using the API. Please make sure that none of the user
 or group's document libraries contains more than 5,000 OneNote items.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Has MS fixed something that was not broken?</p>

<p>I figured out the problem.&nbsp; Despite making no changes in my domain authenticated profile, it some how became corrupted.&nbsp; When I logged in at machine level, I had the Send To button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I changed the name of the User file to add a BAK&nbsp; I then deleted the profile (from the local machine login) , followed by&nbsp;a regedit&nbsp; of HKEY-Local_Machine\software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList&nbsp;&nbsp; to eliminate the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I logged in authenticating from the domain, let it make a new profile and after re-opening Outlook, presto, the button was there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIXED!!!</p>

<h2>            Email Messages to VIP Clients &#40;Can&#39;t use Outlook Rules&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to setup my email so that I will receive text message alerts whenever I receive an email from a VIP client.</p>
<p>While this can be accomplished through Outlook rules, our company has opted to turn then off due to security reasons.</p>
<p>So, I need either a solution that is not established by Outlook rules, or a third party program that can accomplish this! I am open for ideas!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>

<p>It is probably easier to make a business case to allow the use of Outlook Rules.</p>
<p>But, this code will pop open a message box when a specific sender's email arrives, if Outlook is currently open: Put the code into the ThisOutlookSession codemodule, and restart Outlook</p>
<p>Dim WithEvents colItems As Items</p>
<p>Private Sub Application_Startup()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim NS As Outlook.NameSpace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set NS = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set colItems = NS.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox).Items<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set NS = Nothing<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Private Sub colItems_ItemAdd(ByVal Item As Object)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Item.Class = olMail Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Item.SenderName = "Deitrick, Bernie" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Bernie sent you an email!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>You can use similar code to send a text message (an email to your phone number at a phone provider server) but you need to bypass the automation security of Outlook - that entails a bit more, and your company security folks will be upset.&nbsp; See, for example,</p>

<p>When I entered this info and attempted to run the Macro, I got the error "Compile Error;Only Valid in Object Module"</p>

<p>Only change I made to the code was to enter my name into the "deitrick, Bernie" in an attempt to test the Macro. My VB is VERRRRY sub-par, aby ideas as to what I'm doing wrong here?</p>

<p>You can only run the Application_Startup macro - the other is an Outlook event. The code does not go into a regular codemodule, but into the codemodule of the ThisOutlookSession object - double click the object, and the window that opens should be its codemodule.</p>

<h3> robbie p.  say:</h3>
<h2>            SAVE FEATURE HAS STOPPED WORKING IN 2010 MS HOME STUDENT PROGRAM &#40;USING WIN 7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Can't "Save" or "Save As" in Office Student 2010 (particular problem is in Word): I am assisting my 80 year old Mom to fix her MS Student 2010 program (using Windows 7 laptop).&nbsp; I have to read her step-by-step instructions by phone (she is out of state).
 I have already gone to the Programs and Features, chose "change" &amp; then "repair" and still can't save a Word document.&nbsp; Her CD/DVD drive is not working either (that's a whole new question), so we can't simply uninstall and reinstall the Office Student 2010
 using the disc since the drive won't read/open the valid, licensed disc.&nbsp; After I had her repair it, a couple of things are happening that I have never run into: when she clicks "Save" it says "Compatibility Mode" next to the file name, and the saved file
 goes nowhere.&nbsp; If she tries to "Save As" it does not give her any options for the location to save it in (no drop down location/window or a side panel to choose "Desktop, Documents, etc." - it appears as though her Windows navigation pane has disappeared as
 well, so she can't simply "Save As" to the "Desktop."&nbsp; So I just had her use whatever it was defaulting to with the File Name "Test 1", then did a "Search" for "Test 1" and it is nowhere.&nbsp; Obviously it is not actually "saving" the file anywhere.&nbsp; I am hoping
 the fix will be as simple as a "check box" in one of the settings, but I don't know where her "Options" tabs in the 2010 to check either the "Save" tab, "Compatibility" tab or "General" tab, so she can read off what is checked or unchecked in each tab so I
 can see if there is one or two boxes that need to be checked or unchecked.&nbsp; Does anyone know what the next step(s) would be to fix her Office program or maybe wipe all her settings out?&nbsp; She does not know how to use any of its other features OTHER THAN JUST
 SIMPLY SAVING A FILE - so I could care less if all the settings go back to its factory default.&nbsp; If I can get it to just "Save" a file, that will be a HUGE help - we don't care about anything else at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other question(s):&nbsp; is there a link that I can have her use to troubleshoot and fix (or check for updates) for "compatibility" issues in the program itself?&nbsp; Last resort: Where is the factory default setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I have also tried to update and/or install drivers as well (from the manufacturer's website), with no success.&nbsp; Anyone care to comment?&nbsp; Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How to make my facebook contacts stop appearing on my phone&#63;</h2>
                    When I've already entered my facebook account, it automatically syncs my facebook contacts though I don't want it to. Sometimes, when I received an incoming call, the contact appeared to be someone, including his or her avatar and nickname in my facebook
 account but the information was totally wrong! Now I just want to get rid of those facebook sync without deleting my entered facebook account on my phone.

            Open up each of those contacts, the two friends,&nbsp;and see if there is a little link,&nbsp;infinity (sideways 8) icon at the bottom with a number in it. That is the link icon. tap it and see if somehow some contacts got linked incorrectly. If they did, just tap
 one of the linked entries and you can unlink them. This will also tell you where the info came from, twitter, facebook, etc.&nbsp; Hope that helps.

            Err... That's the point of the Facebook integration. If you don't want it, delete the account from the phone and just use the Facebook app. Otherwise, the most you can do is filter Facebook contacts out from the People Hub.<br />
<br />
Note that you can link contact together so you can correct information. If the information -&gt;from Facebook&lt;- was wrong, that means your friend gave Facebook incorrect info no? Otherwise, it might have gotten automatically linked to the wrong contact. Check

<h2>            I need help with a formula, please.</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet detailing employees, their years of service worked, and am calculating what is called "longevity pay". Basically employees are compensated additionally for the&nbsp;length&nbsp;of service they have. Previously employees with 5+ years of service
 were awarded $3.00 per month for every month worked. Now, in addition to that, if the employee has worked 10+ years, they are awarded $4.00 per month for every month worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spreadsheet looks like this:</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out the formula for the 5th column,&nbsp;YTD Longevity pay. The current formula reads:&nbsp; =IF(D3&gt;=5,ROUND(D3,2)*36,0)&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I need it to say is if the Years of Service (D3)&nbsp;are greater than or equal to&nbsp;5 but less than 10 you multiply by 36 AND if the Years of Service (D3) are greater than or equal to 10 you multiply by 48.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried typing it out like it sounds, but when I do this, I get the VALUE# error. If someone could please help me, it would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            Hi jbtrumbull,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Well, I don't know your local rules but I would not calculate the <b>seniority </b>
by subtracting 2 dates.<br />
<br />
=IF(DATE(YEAR(D1),MONTH(C1),DAY(C1))&gt;DATE(YEAR(D1),MONTH(D1),DAY(D1)),YEAR(D1)-<br />
YEAR(C1)-1,YEAR(D1)-YEAR(C1))<br />
<br />
Should give integers.<br />
<br />
Next I would use<br />
<br />
=LOOKUP(&lt;<b>seniority</b>&gt;;{0;5;10};{0;36;48})*&lt;value&gt;<br />
<br />
HTH<br />
<br />
Wkr, <br />
<br />
JP Ronse<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
Is is not easy to reconstruct a copy/past from a worksheet.<br />

            <p>In OL 2007 it still works the same way it did in previous versions. If the office was a contact or another DL, open the DL, click Select Members, choose the correct address book, then the office from that address book.</p>
<p>If the address book the office is stored in is not listed, right click on the corresponding contact folder, choose Properties, Outlook Adress Book, and tick "Show this Folder as E-Mail Address Book".</p>

<h2>            Stop BING from hyjacking my address bar</h2>
                    How do I stop BING from hijacking my address bar when I type in a specific address? If I wanted to search; I'd Google my question. Since I know the address of the website I want, I don't need/want BING to add its icon to the bar and send me to a useless
 page of BING&nbsp;suggestions of other websites.

<h2>            sort multiple columns largest to smallest for each column&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to sort each column of a multiple column selection at one time so that each column's data is arranged from largest to smallest within that single column? I have a class of &gt;30 students and I'd like to arrange their quiz data for each student
 from highest score to lowest score so I can continue calculations using only their top 8 quiz scores. I'm using Excel 2011 w/ Mac OS X 10.6.8.

            Yes, I want to&nbsp;<span>independently sort &gt;30 columns at one time. What I ended up doing was converting each column to an Excel Table, then sorting each table, then converting back to a range of data. That was probably
 just as many mouse clicks as directly selecting and sorting each column individually.</span>

<h2>            Windows Defender turned off due to another AV working, how to turn it back on.</h2>
                    So my windows defender has turned off. I have another AV working in the background, but WD has never turned off before, but now it is turned off and I can't get it back on. It was on and working just fine, even when I had this other AV program on. So how
 do I get that corrected without having to remove the other AV program? It is not Norton' either, Nortons is terrible.&nbsp;

    <title>The legend of a chart in Word won&#39;t update from Excel workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebven  say:</h3>
<h2>            The legend of a chart in Word won&#39;t update from Excel workbook</h2>
                    I have several charts in Word and am trying to make the legend entries consistent throughout the entire document. The supposed way to do this is by right-clicking the chart and select Edit Data. In Excel, I then change the legend entry (i.e. series titles),
 but this is not updated in Word. This is only the case for some charts, while others do seem to update. All charts have been added to the Word document with a simple copy-paste.<br />
I would hate to have to copy-paste these charts into Word again, as much work has been performed formatting their style in Word. Would there be any other way to edit the legend entries or "post-humously" linking the chart to the Excel workbook if this is not
 the case.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

            After messing around I have a solution to this issue. In stead of selecting Edit Data, select Select Data in the Design ribbon. This will open the Excel workbook and the legen entries can be easily changed.<br />
<br />
Know idea why Microsoft has implemented it this way. Smells like a bug.<br />

    <title>Windows Defender not updating by rules engine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bullticky1960  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender not updating by rules engine</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a nightmare of a time with Windows defender the past 2 weeks in Windows 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For two days I couldn't get defender to even start and I found that uninstalling the MS provided Logitech gaming update allowed defender to run again. &nbsp;But then..</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I can't download any virus definitions. &nbsp;There are no errors, only this entry in the event log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Successfully scheduled Software Protection service for re-start at 2116-04-27T20:26:23Z. Reason: RulesEngine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is this? Why is it referring to a date that is nearly a month in the past? &nbsp;While defender is running and I can scan I can't do updates via the 'update' button. &nbsp;When I was having troubles before this one, this message was also intermixed in the log
 file, so it really isn't a new issue I'm thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded the&nbsp;Windows defender update program mpam-fe.exe, and while that worked sometimes and sometimes not, it is not working now.</p>

</p><p>As the defender updates were not showing up in the widows update and one optional update that I had not installed was no longer showing up it appears that windows update was messed up.&nbsp; I keep doing the "trouble shoot&nbsp; a problem" and it says that the windows
 update had to be fixed.&nbsp; But, as MS never says what was fixed I don't know what it thinks that it fixed.&nbsp; Nor did it fix anything. :(&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually there is a windows update database&nbsp; error detected 080070490 and Windows update component needs repair, but neither works even though it says that if fixed it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've done a Sfc /Scannow and the following (always in an Admin shell):</p>
<pre><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth  and</p><pre>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /scanhealth</pre></pre>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A strange coincident?&nbsp; After all of the SCF, DISM, messing with the Tasks, I'm now getting the message every 30 seconds. AND, the date time listed for the restart is interesting.&nbsp; The minute and seconds of when to restart match the time of the event log,
 but the hour is "00".&nbsp; Also, the date has changed from 04-27 to 04-28.&nbsp; It's almost as if the data file is off a byte or two and it is reading the wrong data.&nbsp; Related or not?&nbsp; Just a SWAG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I got the windows update to show me the optional update I installed it to see what would happen.&nbsp; It installed fine.&nbsp; I uninstalled it then as I didn't want it. But I'm thinking that since that worked the rest should be working.&nbsp; I was wrong. :(</p>

            <p>Ignore my comment.&nbsp; I just searched and found that MS in it's great wisdom doesn't record log events in the systems time zone.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; How stupid.&nbsp; So the time being wrong in the event log is another beautiful
</p>
<p>feature of Windows. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Here is something VERY strange.&nbsp; THis is the details from the event log.&nbsp; The date recorded is not today, nor what my system is set to&nbsp; but tomorrow or 3 hours faster than my system clock is showing.&nbsp; I'm starting to think that there is a timezone issue
 somewhere.&nbsp; I did try to reset it today in trying to fix this problem but only by selecting a different timezone (off by 1 hour) setting it and then setting it back.&nbsp; But something is definitely out of wack time wise.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>5. Is KB3154070, KB3156013, KB3156016, KB3156019, KB3155178, KB3156059, KB3153171, KB3153704, KB3153199, KB3156017, KB3142030, and/or KB3155784&nbsp;listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the ones not listed as "yes" I didn't see them.&nbsp; I didn't go back past March looking for updates as my eyes were giving me fits. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO KB3142030 .Net 4.5 update, KB3153199 Windows 7 scan issue, <br />
</p>
<p>Yes, KB3156019, KB3156059, KB3156017 KB3156013, KB3155784 KB3154070, KB3153199 KB3155178, KB3156016 KB3156017
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. How about KB3138615, KB3123862, KB3035583, KB2976978 and/or KB3044374?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO: KB3138615 Windows update client.&nbsp; KB3044374 Windows 10 nag? May have been installed but later uninstalled.</p>
<br />
<p>Yes to kb3123862&nbsp; KB3035583, KB2976978 customer compatibility,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Correction:&nbsp; 3862 is a Windows 10 compatability/nag update.&nbsp; I have installed it and uninstalled it as it is the optional update that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was originally not installed when this problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>KB3138615 Windows update client for 8.1 but when I try to install it, it says it is not for my system. I'm running Windows 8.1 Pro 64bit.&nbsp; I'm looking into what is going on here.</p>

            <p>This is so bizzare.&nbsp; Okay, I think that windows updates are working and it is just defender that is messed up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what changed?&nbsp; I saw that I didn't have KB3138615 and I tried to install it.&nbsp; Even though I got the Windows 8(there is no 8.1 listing) it was 'not for my platform'.&nbsp; Not a 32-bit vs 64-bit problem.&nbsp; Just won't install.&nbsp; So I looked up that patch and saw
 that it was considered a replacement for KB 3135449 according to an article in Infoworld.&nbsp; So I installed the prior patch as I didn't have that one.&nbsp; Strange that I didn't have it.&nbsp; Then, immediately I got my virus definition showing up in Windows Updates.
 So I install it and great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except not. The 'update' via defender may or may not be working and I'm still seeing the "Task -rescheduled for (April 28th - 3 weeks ago )" error message every 30 seconds.&nbsp; I'll find out more tomorrow when there are more Defender definitions to download.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just wish MS would allow us to uninstall and reinstall software rather than going through this nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well, tomorrow I'll review Ubuntu and see how well along it has come as a replacement for Windows, as Windows 10 and having ads in my face is going to be the final straw, I think.</p>

            <p>Half of the problem solved. &nbsp; Installing the update kb3135449 is now allowing me to dismiss and install defender virus definitions. &nbsp; I'm still getting the event log entries &nbsp;every 30 seconds , &nbsp;but at least the updates are working again.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Print Preview macro does not take until I select the wallpaper.</h2>
                    <p>The Macro in Access 2013 that does RunMenuCommand, Command PrintPreview will not let me navigate the Print Preview unless I change the focus to the Windows wallpaper, and then go back into Access.&nbsp; Any idea why this happens? Is there a way to fix it so I
 can when I'm happy just go to selecting Print from Access without having to change the focus of the program?&nbsp; This is a problem running buttons that run this command in the Reports of Access.</p>

            <p>You should not have to move focus away from Access to fire a menu event of any sort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this happen only on one database, or does it happen on ALL of your databases?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's just the one database, then you may have some corruption. To fix that, first make a backup then do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Compact the database</p>
<p>2. Compile your VBA code - from the VBA Editor click Debug - Compile. Continue doing this until the Compile menuitem is disabled.</p>
<p>3. Compact again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to decompile the database. To do this, make a shortcut with this as the Target:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"full path to msaccess.exe" /decompile</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run that shortcut, then open your database. Access will decompile it when opening. After doing this, perform the 3 steps above again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to create a new, blank database and import everything from the old db into the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this happens on ALL databases, then you may have a bad or corrupt installation of Office. Try a reinstall of your Office program. If that does not work, then an uninstall-reinstall might be in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, be sure that your Office and Windows installations are fully up to date, with all relevant hot fixes applied.</p>

            Software rarely is forward compatible. That's why we say that you should do all your development in the lowest version of Access used by your users. Anything else is asking for problems.

            If that's not possible, and the only side effect I've noticed is this Print Preview issue, is it worthwhile to compact the database, or would that introduce potentially more problems?

            <p>You should ALWAYS make a backup before compacting, so compacting isn't going to impact your backup at all.</p>

<h2>            Saving a custom cover page directions didn&#39;t work for me. I need more suggestions.</h2>
                    I tried this and I can't get it to work...When I insert the page it moves image and text to the second page as opposed to giving me a blank second page to start my document AFTER the cover page. I have tried multiple times and either everything moves to
 the second page or the background image separates from the text and I can't get it to rejoin.

<div>Any help will be appreciated.</div>

            Hi Scott,
<div><br />
<div>You mentioned that images and text are pushed to the second page. Is this content already existing in the document or is it a part of the cover page?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'd open your cover template in Word, display nonprinting characters and see if there's an extra page break that needs to be removed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To display nonprinting characters, such as paragraph markers (¶), click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Show all nonprinting characters</span>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmac2.microsoft.com%2fhelp%2fGetOpenContent.aspx%3fassetid%3d1a930cde-81db-4cc8-9236-02602b26f524%26amp%3blocale%3den-us%26amp%3bproduct%3doffice%26amp%3bversion%3d14" />&nbsp;on
 the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Standard</span>&nbsp;toolbar.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>
<p>To</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Do this</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Delete a page manually</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Double-click the page break at the end of the page to select it, and then press DELETE&nbsp;⌦.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Delete a blank page at the end of the document</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Double-click the page break or any paragraph marks (¶) at the end of the document, and then press DELETE&nbsp;⌦.</p>
<p>If your keyboard does not have a DELETE&nbsp;⌦&nbsp;key, hold down SHIFT and press the right
 arrow key&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmac2.microsoft.com%2fhelp%2fGetOpenContent.aspx%3fassetid%3de529f483-31d1-4667-8740-b7e46b507483%26amp%3blocale%3den-us%26amp%3bproduct%3doffice%26amp%3bversion%3d14" />,
 and then press DELETE.</p>
</td>

<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try the three procedures in this article:<br />
Why are some webpages blank or incorrectly displayed in Internet Explorer 9?: <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-do-some-webpages-look-incorrect-in-internet-explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-do-some-webpages-look-incorrect-in-internet-explorer-9</a></p>
<p>If unsuccessful with those steps...<br />
1. From&nbsp;Safety on the IE Command Bar (you may have to right-click the IE toolbar and enable the Command Bar) uncheck ActiveX Filtering.<br />
2. Also from Safety, try turning off SmartScreen filter.</p>
<p>3. If still unsuccessful, see if a browser add-on is causing the problem.<br />
Note: Running IE in no add-ons mode may disable a needed add-on such as Flash Player.</p>
<p>Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
If the problem goes away,&nbsp;an add-on is causing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine which add-on is causing the problem see:<br />
