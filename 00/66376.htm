<h2>            Keyboard and mouse freezing in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop on Windows 7 and am finding the mouse and keyboard are freezing and becoming unresponsive. I have tried using a usb mouse but this is also becoming frozen resulting in me having to crash the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mouse and keyboard drivers are up to date, I don't know how to fix this problem and it is happening several times a day which is beyond ridiculous.</p>
<p>my Norton antivirus is up to date and there are no threats on the laptop. Can anybody recommend a resolution.</p>

            <p>Are you seeing a blue screen with codes?&nbsp; Give us the first 8 digits of the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not, it is likely a hardware problem.&nbsp; How old is your laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you need to rule out infections.&nbsp; Norton is not the best choice.&nbsp; Try running ADWcleaner:

<em><strong>Which Antivirus product to choose?</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><em><strong>The “Security” software installed on your computer may be causing problems that can not be diagnosed or fixed.&nbsp; Try removing it temporarily.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Download and read the 2015 summary report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.&nbsp; A view of this chart will illustrate this point quite well:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are ANTIVIRUS-ONLY products</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have good reason for this. Over the years and hundreds of PCs, I’ve learned a lesson well.&nbsp; That it is very difficult to diagnose and fix the problem(s) when components of an Internet Security product are actively working to prevent that diagnosis.&nbsp; The
 software sees the technician (me in this case) as a threat.&nbsp; I discovered that if I uninstalled that software, I am able to much more likely and&nbsp;quickly discover an fix the problem.&nbsp; Antivirus ONLY products do not behave like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the Antivirus software that you need.&nbsp; It is actually <em><strong>all</strong>
</em>that you need with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the big name suppliers much prefer to sell their all-in products because they can sell them for a higher price.&nbsp; Some do not offer an antivirus only product.&nbsp; Some push their all in ones and still sell the AV only product, but you may have to look
 for them.&nbsp; There is at least one and it is either the best or close to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware of products that try to actively engage you in the security process by asking your permission to run a program named xd43_45d*.exe, or the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better</strong>.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk.
<strong>Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections</strong> or claims to make your computer run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection product installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new.&nbsp; Some products will conflict with one another, causing yet more problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove

            <p>A&nbsp;124 code is a hardware problem, not software.&nbsp; It could mean overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should never use your laptop while it is on a soft surface.&nbsp; The underside of the computer has slots/slits in it that is the source of air that is pulled in by the fan in the PC.&nbsp; Using a laptop on a soft surface is the most common cause of over heating.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could get on of those cans of pressurized air and try to blow it into to the vent.&nbsp; There could be an accumulation of dust there.&nbsp; BEFORE you do that, remove the power cord, remove the battery.&nbsp; Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds. Then try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Statistically,&nbsp;your 6 year old laptop is past its prime.&nbsp; about 70% of laptops that age are no longer usable for some reason or another.&nbsp; Typically repairs of a laptop are expensive and many times unsuccessful.&nbsp; Desktops last much longer and are much easier
 to fix.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, you should be considering a replacement soon.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, if you happen to be one who does not want Win7, you only have a few more months before you will no longer be able to find one.&nbsp; Win7 new PCs are still available but you have to call the small-business group of the OEM to get them.&nbsp; Win7 will be
 supported until Jan 2020.</p>

    <title>Blank screen after logo at startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blank screen after logo at startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a Lenovo Flex 2 15 Model 20405. Yesterday, I decided to reformat my laptop to Windows 8. On the near end of the installation, it prompted me to restart the computer (it restarted itself after 10 seconds), but after the Lenovo splash screen, I
 get a blank black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently came from an Ubuntu OS, not sure if it changed the BIOS settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following instructions bellow. I was successful in rebuilding the BCD, but &nbsp;when I restarted my computer I am still stuck at blank black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</strong></p>
<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<p><strong>cd boot</strong></p>
<p><strong>attrib bcd -s -h -r</strong></p>
<p><strong>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</strong></p>
<p><strong>bootrec /RebuildBcd</strong></p>
<p><strong>bootrec /fixmbr</strong></p>
<p><strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Remove the Rescue CD and try rebooting now.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Other things I have done so far:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I've checked the hard drive from BIOS, it's reading it properly.</li><li>I have tried resetting BIOS to defaults.</li><li>I changed the boot order priority (HDD first), I tried other boot order as well.</li><li>I switched between UEFI and Legacy Support</li><li>Pressed F8 (or FN + F8 ) to bring up Safe Mode, but nothing showed up.</li><li>I can boot from Windows Installation disk. I tried all troubleshooting options like Refresh and Reset, but I get the message "This option is not available in the OS you selected" - must be because Windows did not finish up during installation so there's
 nothing to refresh or reset</li><li>I have tried installing other Windows OS like Windows 7 but still getting the same black blank screen.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has a built-in battery which is why I couldn't remove it to reset CMOS settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working on this for 2 days now, any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            If the computer is restoring from a factory image, which is how its usually done, then no, it can only go back to exactly the same way the image was set. But once you perform a few of the windows updates in 8, the 8.1 update will show up in the store (from
 everything I've read and from personal experience).

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you able to install all other updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is specific to this particular update, I would suggest you to refer to the article listed below and run the FIXIT tool mentioned in Method 2 and perform the steps mentioned over there. If you are not able to install other updates as well, I
 would suggest you to perform all the troubleshooting methods mentioned there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Didn't see any solutions for hiding, only for un-hiding. There is a place in settings to hide it, but it does not work while browsing. I can hold my wheel down and scroll, not sure why the bar has to show.&nbsp;

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Seasonal Greetings!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba laptop&nbsp;with Windows 7 Home Premium. The laptop is running correctly, but I find the various&nbsp;add ons&nbsp;installed by Toshiba rather irritating. I also&nbsp;own a retail copy of Windows 7 Home Premium - not OEM - which I have installed on a home built
 computer. Is it acceptable to use my disk to reinstall on the Toshiba laptop - provided I use the Product Key attached to the laptop, not the one supplied with the disk? I assume that the laptop Product Key will never have been specifically activated, as Toshiba
 is a large manufacturer with special arrangements, but, as I would not be recovering the original installation, would the Product Key be accepted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanking you in anticipation of your help. (Not urgent)</p>

            After installing Home Premium from the disk you will need to use phone activation with the laptops product key to activate.<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note:</span><span> if you are still installing Windows and at the Enter Your Product Key page, do not enter your key and uncheck "Automatically Activate When Online" then click OK/Next to finish the installation</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>1. Open Windows Activation by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, clicking Properties, and then clicking Activate Windows now.‌<br />
2. Click Show me other ways to activate.<br />
3. Type your Windows 7 product key, and then click Next.<br />
4. Click Use the automated phone system. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
5. Click the location nearest you from the drop-down list, and then click Next.<br />
6. Call one of the available phone numbers listed.</p>

    <title>Surface Book keyboard and mouse pad go dead. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnshepherd1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book keyboard and mouse pad go dead.</h2>
                    The last few days, my Surface Book Performance Base has started to have issues. The computer will be working fine and I'll go to move the cursor and the mouse pad won't move it. I'll then either touch the screen to put the cursor in the "type to search"
 area and the keyboard won't type anything. The keyboard will back light off and on and once in a while when everything is locked up the windows button will still open the start menu. Sometimes detaching the screen (that button works) and reattaching has activated
 everything, but not every time. Also, today I plugged in my external hard drive into the usb port and that cause the mouse and keyboard to go dead. Twice, while restarting to clear the issue it has taken a long time "shutting down" and eventually give a blue
 screen issue and mentions a 'power driver' error. Microsoft store had me do a reset. Haven't done a total wipe. If it's hardware, that aint gonna help.

<h2>            HP Laserjet 5M Drivers for Print Server</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I work for a small private college and we have several old HP LaserJet 4, 5 and 5m printers on campus. &nbsp;There are all network printers that are managed by a central print server. &nbsp;We have started to deploy Windows 7 - 32 and 64 bit. &nbsp;We have not been able
 to find a driver to install on the print server. &nbsp;I know that if the printer were connected directly, it would automatically install, but we need an .inf driver.</p>
<p>Has anyone been able to work around this kind of problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please
 post your question in the <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpronetworking/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> estj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cisco Anyconnect 3.1 Client will not install on Win Surface Pro 2, with 8.1 O&#47;S</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to install the Cisco Anyconnect 3.1 client after downloading from Cisco CCO.&nbsp; No issues installing on the PC, but it will not launch on Win Surface Pro 2, running 8.1.&nbsp; After pressing &lt;cr&gt; on the file to launch the install, I receive a DOS Window
 with the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Local policies have already been configured on this computer.&nbsp; Do you wish to continue and overwrite them [y/N]?"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After responding "Y", the DOS Window disappers and the download folder with the files displays again.&nbsp; No installation occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; I disabled Defender and the Firewall temporarily, but that did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; Also did the regedit update reference,
 but no success either.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have no other issues installing other downloaded .exe applications on the Win Surface Pro 2.&nbsp;
<u>Does anyone know what is causing this problem to get the client to simply launch?</u>&nbsp; Critically need to have remote VPN service to work functioning from the tablet like my other devices...</p>

<h2>            Problems with WLANSVC</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>After the last automatic Update of Win 10 1511 (I run Win 10 Pro x64 from Original Win 7 Pro x64 (not OEM), I have had some (Little) problems, partially solved.</p>
<p>First, update KB3122947 was installed without problems, but update KB3116908 altough correctly downloaded it was necessary to install manually using cmd console (thanks to an old post of Win 7 at this support.microsoft site).</p>
<p>Well, after these updates I have two problems:</p>
<p>- Automatic Windows Update services seems not run and I need to start manually.</p>
<p>- WLAN Services (WLANSVC) suffers continuous turn-off, losing my network and Internet Access. I need to Restart manually the WLANSVC though Services at Host Adminstration.
</p>
<p>Can you help me to fix these issues, overall the WLANSVC problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your time and help.</p>

            <p>Hi everybody.</p>
<p>At least on my PC the problem was serious. Hence, important files and dependencies of the OS were corrupted and repair was not possible.</p>
<p>Finally, Answer Desk @ support.microsoft&nbsp; solved all issues using several specific tools and now everything runs very well.
</p>
<p>I hope that the update quoted by K 1.87 has fixed the WLANSVC bug.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody. Thanks to Answer Desk and Assure program of MS. You are the best.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

<h2>            Getting error message &#34;driver is unavailable&#34; using  lexmark prestige pro805</h2>
                    <p>Original title: lexmark prestige pro805</p>
<p>Windows 8's compatibility tool said my printer was supported and even Lexmark's own website says to "Use Windows 8 drivers" for my Lexmark Prestige Pro805 printer, yet in the devices list it shows "driver is unavailable".&nbsp; I have tried to install Lexmarks
 drivers for Windows 7, but the installation exits upon stating that the driver isn't compatible for my version of windows.&nbsp; I have tried Windows troubleshooter which is of no help on this issue at all and the compatability web site for Microsoft shows 1 person
 saying the printer is compatible and 1 person saying it's not.&nbsp; Anyone know of how to resolve this issue or not having problems with their similar printer?</p>

                    <p>I want to know is there a way to stop Windows Explorer refreshing the list-view automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I selected files and then move or unzip some files in that folder, Explorer shuffles all those files and I lose my previous selections.</p>
<p>Also, when I search files and select a file while the search is still in progress, Explore *again* re-shffles them everytime new files are found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop that, or is it impossible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>It's not really designed to be possible.&nbsp; But you can make it less annoying.&nbsp; When you use "sort alphabetically", it will keep everything alphabetical anytime something changes.&nbsp; So if you unzip a lot of files, they all go to their proper alphabetical location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sort by something else, it will put them in a more predictable location.&nbsp; Sort by "date modified" for example, and all the unzipped files will show up at the bottom of the list together, because they were all modified at the exact same time.</p>

</p><p>Now I wonder why they could mess up things this awful... I believe nobody thinks the coercive auto-sorting&nbsp; is user-friendly nor intuitive :-(</p>

<p>I suggest you go to Settings, Display and Sound, Video Output. Make sure that the display settings match the capabilities of your television. If the settings are correct, run "Calibrate HDTV" from the same area. &nbsp;It will allow you to adjust the aspect ratio
 used by the Xbox.</p>

<p>Your Xbox One console supports a variety of display settings. It's easy to select the settings that are best for your television (your tv should be able to support at least 720p though). Here's how:</p>
<p>Scroll left on the Home screen to open the guide.</p>
<p>Select Settings.</p>
<p>Select All Settings.</p>
<p>Select Display &amp; sound, and then select Video output.</p>
<p>Choose the display and picture settings appropriate for your TV.</p>

<h2>            Unable to send or receive messages from&#47;to my live.co.uk account using Windows Live Mail on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Live Mail on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of today 11 July 2016 I'm unable to send or receive messages from/to my live.co.uk account using Windows Live Mail on Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Windows Live repeatedly asks me to sign in. I've done this, repeatedly. I've signed out and signed in again. I've sent emails from my browser, but cannot send them from Windows Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not impressed that MS cannot make their own software work on their own platform. And before you advise me to switch to Outlook, Outlook is unable to handle my other accounts. That's why I am sticking to Live Mail, which worked ok until yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need yet more bells and whistles. I just need the basic things to work, efficiently, all the time.</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail will no longer support connecting to&nbsp;Outlook.com. You can either connect your Outlook.com email account through IMAP in Windows Live Mail which will not sync Calendar and contacts but you can view your emails or you can use a different
 Mail client to connect to Outlook.com. I would recommend you to refer the article below.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live Mail 2012 will not connect to Outlook.com</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Windows-Live-Mail-2012-will-not-connect-to-Outlook-com-45453b92-373b-4bbb-88ca-f8ec74f8e8fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Windows-Live-Mail-2012-will-not-connect-to-Outlook-com-45453b92-373b-4bbb-88ca-f8ec74f8e8fd</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set up&nbsp;your Outlook.com&nbsp;account&nbsp;using IMAP you may refer to the suggestions by iFiredog from the link below.</p>

<h2>            Rise of Nations Multiplayers</h2>
                    This is driving me nuts. &nbsp;I purchased and downloaded Rise of Nations Extended Version on a PC with Windows 10. I can play the game fine, but for some reason, I cannot figure out the Multiplayer mode. &nbsp;Everytime I click on Multiplayer, I get the following
 message: “You do not have permission to access multiplayer services”. Please help!

            I already tried that. &nbsp;They refer to their forum, which then refers me to Xbox stating that permission rights are an issue with Privacy Settings in Xbox/Live/Microsoft account. &nbsp;So I am not sure anymore what to do.

<h2>            Where can I find a USB receiver for a 1011 keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased a used Microsoft Wireless Desktop Elite Keyboard (1011) but I need the Mouse (1007) and USB Receiver, any idea where I can find one?

            I doubt that you will be able to find a match since each Keybooard/Mouse is uniquely paired with the receiver.
