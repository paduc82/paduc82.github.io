            <p>If that message was "sent by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007", then I don't believe it has anything whatsoever to do with outlook.com.&nbsp; I think it has to do with a mailbox you have on an Exchange server where you work.&nbsp; Do you use Office Outlook where you
 work? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might also be from a hosted Exchange service you might use for personal mail.&nbsp; Do you use such a service?</p>

            Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
So, let me verify this.&nbsp; You had an installation of Microsoft Publisher on your computer.&nbsp; You installed a Trial version of Office 2007 and then when the trial was over you uninstalled the trial version and now your Publisher is gone?<br />
<br />
If you upgraded Publisher by using 2007, then it would uninstall with the rest of the trial software.&nbsp; What version of Publisher were you using originally?

    <title>Lumia 920 Charging Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stealthknight15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 Charging Problem</h2>
                    Hi, I have a problem with my 920 charging.<br />
<br />
It all started when I had to send in my 920 Christmas eve after having it since day one (I tried doing a factory reset and got stuck on the cogs with no solution known to the internet working)<br />
<br />
I was anxiously waiting for it to come back and when it did I was over joyed, it came back like brand new. Apparently Nokia replaced the entire motherboard and so things were fine.<br />
One night approximately mid January I was using a wall charger that I've used many times before and went to go use my phone when i noticed the part that plugs into the phone was crazy hot. I immediately went to go unplug the cable and burnt my fingers as a
 result, the end of the cable was hotter then a stove top! I got some oven mits and pulled the cable out and looked at the connector for my phone, well there is now a little convex bump all around the charging port. Since then I've tried using 8 or 9 different
 cables and none have worked, wall, computers, nothing. The only way i can charge my phone is through my JBL Powerup.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>You should send your phone for repair. As you know it get's very hot during charging I would highly recommen to avoid charging until its repaired or swapped. If you send it for repair you should send it including your charger. Maybe the problem was caused
 trought faulty charger.</p>

            Thanks for taking the time to reply, but unfortunately having tried your recommendation - still nothing is working!<br />
I know that it is something silly that is preventing the connection, because everything is in place. So I'll just continue uninstalling and reinstalling with mobile cable connected until I get tired.<br />
cheers

    <title>Can&#39;t read emails in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> notmad1911  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t read emails in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I have long ago resigned to the fact that I have to refresh if I want to see if new mail has come, refresh again &nbsp;if I want to read it and the same &nbsp;if I want to search.Annoying but no other way to read,check or search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it says on the top that there is one new email,it does not appear anywhere,cannot be found even when I filter for Unread. Long last I went to my mobile and hey presto it was there and I read it without having to refresh anything or perform any annoying
 and to my mind unrelated action. Half an hour later the situation is still the same,notification for one new email at top,nowhere else.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it is waste of storage capacity to have Outlook.com on my PC,it just does not do anything any and all other email services do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the best MS can come up with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody else had similar experience? Have you found a solution?</p>

<p>I had already tried this, but BING is already the default on my IE, and I cannot see the Amazon in the list for me to remove. I have opened the Home Page dialog box and replaced Amazon with other web pages, but the Amazon page keeps reloading each time IE
 restarted. And each time the Home Page is reset automatically to the Amazon site. I have decided to turn IE off using the Windows Features dialog box. I am replying to you using Chrome! Help please.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding to issue present, I also have the same problem on EliteBook x360, windows 10, there is no sound from Airpods, but other side can hear me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On last laptop, everything was ok. Looks like there is a problem only with app that include microphone and headphones and are for meeting or conference.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try all steps in help and forums. I am confused because on my last laptop, with the same version of skype and windows everything was working fine. When i change laptop, at first Airpods didn't work at all, then i manage to get sound from youtube and similar
 programs, but in skype or Blackboard other side can hear me, but i cannot hear anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably know that is very frustrating when something working very well and then doesn't.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail stopped working in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;use Outlook 2010 and one of the email accounts I use is my old Hotmail account which I have had for 10+ years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two weeks ago, it stopped working. Outlook gives me an error when synchronizing and refuses to get any email from that account. This is the error I get:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have replaced my actual login with 'email' in the above messages.</p>

<h3> ericsnijders  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Office 2016 ODT&#93;Shared Computing Activation not working on RDS 2012 R2</h2>
                    
<p>We are having issues at 1 customers. The setup is as followed:</p>
<p>- 2 Server 2012 R2 servers configured as an RD Session Host server<br />
- Profiles configured as UPD<br />
- Office 2016 installed with ODT and SharedComputerActivation set to "1" (i checked the registry settings on both servers and it's set to 1)<br />
- All Users are licensed with E3</p>
<p>The problem is as followed:<br />
1. User logs on to the RDS01 server and starts an Office application. First time activation is started. Activation is OK (i can see the tokens in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Credentials)<br />
2. Users logs out<br />
3. If the User logs back in to the RDS01 there are no problems<br />
4. If the User logs on to the RDS02 the user receivers the attached error.<br />
5. If the User just clicks OK and enters credentials Office is working fine again (tokens are updated in %APPDATALOCAL%)<br />
6. If the User logs back on to the RDS01 the same issue happens again.<br />
<br />
The problem exist with ALL the users. I already completely removed Office 2016 on both RDS servers, restarted them and installed Office 2016 via ODT but that didn't work. I already tried the solution proposed in:&nbsp;<a href="http://microsoftplatform.blogspot.nl/2015/04/office-365-activation-issue-on-rds.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://microsoftplatform.blogspot.nl/2015/04/office-365-activation-issue-on-rds.html</a>&nbsp;but
 that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Can somebody please help with this one?</p>

    <title>Cannot Change Password in Outlook&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Change Password in Outlook&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook was sending spam to contacts so I assumed it had been hacked into.&nbsp; I was told to change my Outlook password, which I did, but then it kept saying the password was not correct.&nbsp; When I changed it back to my original password, I could get in to
 Outlook again.&nbsp; I NEED to change my password to stop whatever or whomever is getting into my Outlook and sending bogus emails from my account!&nbsp; Any ideas as to why it is not letting me change my password?&nbsp; Could whatever hacked in, have blocked my ability
 to change password?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help you can give me!</p>

            <p>Outlook itself doesn't have a password. Outlook is simply an email client. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your ISP however would have a password to pull your mail from their servers and to send mail (POP3 &amp; SMTP). If you need to change your password, you need to change it with them, not Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same applies if you're using Hotmail, Gmail, etc. You have to change your password with them, not with Outlook. So go to their websites, log&nbsp;in, and then change your password there. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office 2013 not responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrpilcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 not responding</h2>
                    I have a problem with both Microsoft Office 2013 Outlook, Word not responding. When I first open them they work for a few minutes, however they then jam up and come up with 'not responding'. This is becoming quite annoying as it is taking up my precious
 work time restarting the programs every 5 minutes. I have looked at other forums, but none of the solutions seem to work. If somebody could help me it would be great. I have a windows 7 computer. It is a new computer, I only got it 2 weeks ago and it was working
 fine for the first week but it has been playing up for about a week now.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can you bates number pages in Word&#63;</h2>
                    I have googled and you-tubed how to create bates numbering in Word (I actually want the pages to be numbered) but all I find is how to use Excel and Word to create bates labels. I don't want labels. I want to number the bottom of each page with a bates
 number. I don't think there is anything built into Word to do that but thought I would ask here to make sure.

            There is nothing built into Word to do this.
<br />If you convert to pdf, Adobe Acrobat can do it.
<br />
<br />A real problem is that pagination of Word documents is dependent on the version of Word, the printer driver, and the operating system. A Word document opened on a different computer is likely to have different pagination.

            When entering your password, apps built for Windows 10 and webpages will have a little eye icon on the far right of the text box to temporarily reveal your password. If you don't see the eye, the app has disabled that feature or you've tapped away from
 the password field (you can only reveal the password the first time you type into the password field)

<p>
</p><p>On Windows 8 there are 20 Accents (colours) which can be overlayed on a dark or light background</p>
<p>
</p><p>Icons need to retain "universal" recognition so despite every especially Synthetic Person / Android phone having different Homepages you can navigate the Android phone, just like Android user can navigate Windows&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore there is not going to be icon many variants so little need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the accent more they throw up some 'delightful' tile combos &nbsp;/ change you lock screen... enjoy that you have offline maps</p>

<h2>            VBA RunTimeError &#39;91&#39; - copy and pasting error</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>Hello, I am new to this forum and was wondering if anyone could help me. I am using one workbook (1)&nbsp;to open a file (workbook (2)), search for a label, which is listed on a sheet in workbook (1),&nbsp;and copy all the data relating to that label into the sheet.
 However the issue that I am having is when the label does not appear in workbook (2) then I get a run-time error '91'. I have tried using "On Error Resume Next", but the wrong data gets copied into that column for the missing label. All I want is for the cells
 to be left blank corresponding to the missing label, and the code to continue copying all the other data correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code below&nbsp;looks for label name and then copies it and loops through.... Please will someone help me out! Will be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your quick reply. There is however a runtime error with the FoundCell.Select. I want to insert blanks into these columns.
</p>
<p>If I remove FoundCell.Select then there is an error at ActiveCell.Offset(-1, 1).Select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>If Not FoundLabel Is Nothing Then</strong>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FoundCell.Select ' so it becomes the ActiveCell</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Change <strong>FoundCell </strong>to <strong>FoundLabel</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>Hello mate, again, thank you very much for your help. Now however the code just loops without picking up the next label. If I sent you the workbooks would you please have a look at where I am going wrong? I have spent so many hours on this, I am losing my
 mind‚Ä¶. Can I send it to you remotely?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Changing portal language from employers default</h2>
                    <p>My employer uses Office 365 for Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, Office etc, and being a Finnish company they have their overall account settings set to Finnish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an English speaker I want the same, non-customised, web portals in English. My own account settings are all set to English, yet all the portals and associated menus, navigation etc all appear in Finnish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get everything to default to English from my own personal account level?</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our instance there are a number of different settings. The one we didn't know about was number 3 in this list which has given us an alternative English language across all the site apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We followed these steps to get it to work across our tenant (just in case anyone else runs into this issue).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span><strong>1.</strong></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span><strong>Outlook Web Access</strong></span></p>
<p>- Select app (right hand side)</p>
<p>- General &gt; Region and time zone.</p>
<p>Change to English.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2.</strong></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><strong>Personal SharePoint language preferences</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>profile picture</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>about me</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>edit profile</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span>Select Language and region&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Advanced and add english to the languages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>3.</strong></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><strong>OneDrive for Business personal site alternate languages</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>onedrive for business</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>site settings under the cogwheel from up right</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>site settings/language settings</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>allow english as an alternate language</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This shows the default language is Finnish but by adding an alternative language English you get the setting site wide if the specific apps in the next section 4 are set.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>4.</strong></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><strong>Office Online gallery</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>choose any Office Online app from top left menu</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>change language (bottom left hand side)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So to be fair this statement you made earlier &gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Since the tenant is subscribed in Finland, the default language in every user‚Äôs interface. So now there is no way to change everything to English for a user. We can
 only change the language of some buttons to English via Office 365 Settings.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Was just a lazy answer. Because it's clearly not true. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
We ignored the laziness and just kept digging till we found the information we needed. We shouldn't have had to. We shouldn't have to ask support for this stuff anyway it should be intuitive. This kind of thing should not require four steps to rectify. There
 should be a simple settings function that says "preferred language" that works for all parts of the system. We wasted a day. Who do I charge for the time I'll never get back? :)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Steve</span></p>
