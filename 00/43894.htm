    <title>Windows 7 Homegroup printing-- will not print until a restart has - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Homegroup printing-- will not print until a restart has occured</h2>
                    Before I get into my issue I should point out that I am an experienced computer user and have tried&nbsp;ALL of the fixes recommended by Microsoft in this forum, including reinstalling drivers, resetting print spoolers, checking firewall settings and resetting
 homegroup sharing settings&nbsp;etc.<br />
<br />
I have three computers running Windows 7, two laptops and one desktop, all are joined to the same Win7&nbsp;homegroup, all run Windows firewall.&nbsp; The desktop is connected to a USB printer - an HP color Laserjet 2600n.&nbsp; The laptops are wirelessly connected to the
 network via Netgear 802.11g router.&nbsp; Homegroup file, media sharing between these machines works fine (ie all docs, music etc can be shared) and the LATEST hp printer driver is installed on all three computers.&nbsp; I can print fine from my desktop, but cannot
 print from either laptop, despite the HP printer being visible in the control panel of both machines as default printer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Firewall settings are all OK for print sharing (I have checked), print spooler service on all machines is OK.&nbsp; Files for printing&nbsp;show as "printing" (on both the sending laptop and the desktop), but do not print unless the computers on the network are restarted.&nbsp;
 Homegroup print files cannot be deleted, but will STILL print (despite attempted deletion) on restart.<br />
<br />
Can you please acknowledge whether this is a bug, and if so when the patch will be released to fix it.<br />
<br />
thanks

<p>I also have had the same&nbsp;problem with my&nbsp;printer when I was trying to&nbsp;print&nbsp;to it from my laptop using the HomeGroup sharing of printers. I had the same symptoms: I could send the document to the printer, but it would not print until I restarted the&nbsp;computer
 &nbsp;that the printer was physically connected to. The only way I was able to solve the problem was to&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>disable Bidirectional Support</strong>. Once I disabled that, I could print from my laptop to my printer that is connected to my desktop.</p>
<p>The way you disable the Bidirectional Support is to right-click on your printer icon in the control panel and select Printer Properties, select the Ports tab, and remove the checkmark next to Enable Bidirectional Support.</p>
<p>This is not the perfect solution because I will not get the notifications from my printer when the printer is out of paper or when a particular toner cartridge is low, etc. But at least I can share the printer with my laptop without having to physically
 unconnect the printer from the desktop and then&nbsp;connect &nbsp;it to my laptop each time I want to print from my laptop.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Issue as such may occur due to broken Windows Update components on your device. For us to identify if Windows is already unresponsive, we'd recommend pressing the
<em><strong>Num Lock</strong></em> key on your keyboard to check if the light will turn on or off. If the light is changing, it means that the system is still in the process. If not, we recommend that you press and hold the power button to shut down your PC.
 Once done, try to boot your system again and check if it loads the Windows environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After booting to the Windows environment, we'd recommend performing troubleshooting steps to repair any broken Windows Update components. Having said that, we have an entire support article dedicated to repair
<em><strong>Windows Update issues</strong></em>. To check this article, click on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix Windows Update issues">link</a></strong></em> and perform steps under
<em><strong>Windows 10</strong></em> path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back for an update with the outcome and let us know if you need more help.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft for Windows 10 code stolen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to redeem my Minecraft for Windows 10 code, but it says that it was already redeemed about a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't redeem, nor was I attempting to last week. This is the first and only Windows 10 account that I have. The only causes that I can think of is that this is an error, or worse, my code was stolen somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can find out what happened to it, and if I can get a replacement?</p>

 that you may utilize. </p>

<h2>            Grace period over 24 hours</h2>
                    When we rent a movie, it's usually after the kids go to bed. Some movies are too long to watch in one night, so we would like to be able to finish the movie the next night, without repaying. Can you please change your policy to either a 30 hour rental
 period or allow a movie that is restarted inside the current 24 hours to extend past 24?

<p>A number of my friends have the game,but are not always on at the same time as myself. Most of the others are playing some other gun modern shootie game. Just wondering if there was any others struggling to find people (with a mic). I play to win,but mostly
 to have fun. Oh and i still havent learnt how to fly anything yet !</p>
<p>Please send me a friend request,as it would be great to have a few more people to play what i think is the best game on live at the moment&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Speaking of battelog and joining a platoon, is there anything I missed? I find it incredibly hard to find platoons if you don't already have a foot in the door, as you have to type the platoon name into it rather than just browse.</p>
<p>I mean of course there's browsing their forums and joining platoons that way but still. I think it'd be more of a strain for non-techy people to find a platoon.</p>

<p>Yeah, wish they had a better interface that allowed you to browse. Where the platoon leader could set the status to public, open, invite only, brief descriptions, ect, ect. The battelog is awesome but it's easy to tell they didn't put much love into the
 platoons.</p>

<p>No need to download Windows 10, use the built in recovery options that came with your Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows
 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9,
 F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This is how the recovery
 partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

 F11 directly after powering up the computer </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The MCT USB Flash is a bootable media. I agree that the recovery partition would be the first choice.</p>
<p>Is this video true?? This is the way I learn new things. Not trying to be APITA!.

    <title>Skype and Microsoft Accounts&#58; How to unlink - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpssantos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype and Microsoft Accounts&#58; How to unlink</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am with an issue now for more than one year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Office 365 and I setup an account for me and for my wife. At that time i did not linked my Microsoft account with my already existent Skype account. Somehow my wife logged in on her skype account and linked with my Microsoft account. Which means
 that her Skype account is connected to two Microsoft accounts (her and mine). Because of this, i cannot link my skype account with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to fix this? I find it very strange why something that was possible in the past (unlink the skype account) now is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why it's so easy to link the skype account, but then once is linked is not possible to un-link? Is planned a fix for a close future?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and Regards</p>
<p><br />

<p>This is definitely a problem. I updated 3 computers to the Fall Creators update with very mixed results.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Surface Pro 3 - Upgraded without any issue. Computer and Internet still very responsive. This was my test before moving onto the other workstations.</li><li>Alienware Desktop - Internet speedtest slowed down dramatically after upgrade if they'll load at all. Only getting .5mb/sec download or timeouts. Usual speed is 150mb/sec. No browser gets good internet speed. Task manager says all is well, but everything
 crawls for no reason.</li><li>Lenovo Laptop - Starts and fits of usable and not. Edge is consistently slow while Chrome seems ok.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It's not my network. All three devices are going through the same router. Wired or wireless have the same results. The reason I'm pretty certain this is an OS bug is I installed the Hyper-V roles onto the Alienware Desktop and spun up a VM running regular
 creators update instead of Fall Creators. This VM, using the same NIC and network as the borked Alienware PC mind you, is getting 120-140mb/sec download speed and isn't experiencing any problems.</p>

<p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; Some programs now open more slowly.&nbsp; When they open, you can't click on the menu for a couple of seconds.&nbsp; Happens in many apps like UltraEdit, Nitro Pro, Paint Shop Pro, etc.&nbsp; Other apps work fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is something in the Fall&nbsp;Creators&nbsp;update&nbsp;that is causing some programs to start&nbsp; slowly and in some cases run slowly.&nbsp;

<p>Ridiculous. I am on a lenovo laptop that started with Windows 7. I updated all the way increasingly over the years to 8, 8.1, 10 and not once there was a drop in overall performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I update to Creators Fall Update and the computer is completely unusable. Any single thing lags and is delayed, even the mouse pointer goes to a crawl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will uninstall this update and try to revert to yesterday's Windows version hoping that it will undo this mess until Microsoft finds a solution to this mess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried various "soft" solutions that can be found on the internet like deactivating certain processes etc., but they obviously don't work.</p>

<h2>            Skype security web rumors claiming Skype has &#34;unfixable&#34; bugs that let anyone have system level access&#63;</h2>
                    I was browsing the web, and searched using Google for "Skype Security". Among the hits came lots of frightening results up that claimed there were "unfixable security bugs that gave system level access". Could that be true or is this yet another web scam
 wave? When I search on Microsoft or even here, nothing like that comes up. The thing is, back in May the last year, there was actually something like that, but these hits appear to be recent, like a few days old. Could those pages be scam pages or have they
 somehow been changed so that Google Spiders report them as "a few days old"? If these claims are true, then Microsoft should mention it, but it doesn't or have I missed something? ("Gaining system level access" sounds serious enough. In the Linux world there
 is a "sin" saying: You never _ever_ run a program&nbsp; as root, Let alone especially a communication program like Thunderbird as root. "root" is the Linux world for "System account"). So the question is, is this true? And if it

</p><p>We prioritize our <span>users'</span> security, and if there are issues like this, we will immediately fix it. As you have mentioned, none of those "unfixable security bugs that gave system level access" were mentioned on any of
 Skype or Microsoft forums or blogs, it only means that the source is unreliable. As long there are no posted announcement on any of our legit forums, those
<span>websites</span> you viewed and the information they provided cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those websites probably pertains to the removal of the classic Skype. It's correct that we've recently removed the classic Skype, but it's&nbsp;due to the&nbsp;installer issue.&nbsp;There was an issue with an older version of the Skype for Windows
 desktop and Mac&nbsp;installer  version 7.40 and lower. The issue was in the program that installs the Skype software  the issue was not in the Skype software itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions and clarifications.</p>

<h2>            Streaming Forza 4 with OBS is broken.</h2>
                    <p>Old news but OBS game capture crashes Forza 4 and monitor capture performs like a 1995 dell even though my main build runs an i7 7700 with 32gb of ddr4 on x264 encoding. This is a Forza 4 specific issue, if I use the same settings in Assetto Corsa, Assetto
 Corsa Competizione, Black Ops 4 or any other game I play this issue doesn't exist (both game and monitor capture work perfectly fine in other games). Fun fact, OBS NDI on the gaming pc, while not even encoding, OBS struggles to keep up even though the game
 is running 80+ fps at all times, and none of my hardware is thermal throttling or being pushed anywhere near its limits.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi. It usually depends on what you have for your PC hardwares. If you get the post powerful upgrades, no more lag should occur. And definitely never use OBS on laptop PCs.

            Try following -
<br />
<br />1. It may be due to some program. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br />How to boot in Clean boot mode - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />3. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall the Driver 
<br />Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer &gt; The driver will be installed automatically when you restart
<br />
<br />C. Update the driver
<br />Click Update Driver Software &gt; Click Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Click Let my pick from a list of device drivers on my computer &gt; Choose the driver &gt; Click Next to update &gt; If this does not work, select Search automatically for the updated driver in place of Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />D. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the display adapter's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, you click Update Driver Software, in place of this, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

            Hi DL, more than likely that would be caused by your Display driver . . .
<br />
<br />Please try this:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />If the Roll Back options is grayed out, right click your video card and choose Uninstall, when asked, confirm deletion of the driver files
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC once done . . .       
        </p>

            Does it vary depending on which photo viewer is displaying the photo?&nbsp; Try right-clicking the picture file icon, choosing "Open with" and selecting a different photo program.

            <p>That's why I asked about other programs, since the Photo app tries to enhance.&nbsp; But if other programs show the same problem, then we can already conclude that the auto-enhance isn't the problem.&nbsp; Logic :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my next thought is that it may be the system-wide color settings.&nbsp; I'd try this to restore the default color settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Go to Control Panel then Hardware and Sound then Color Management.<br />
b. Select your display device.<br />
c. Check the box Use my setting for this device.<br />
d. Click Add.<br />
e. Choose sRGB IEC61966-2.1 <br />
f. Set it as default.<br />
If the issue still persists, go to Method&nbsp; 2.</p>

<p><span>Hi je4n4,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The cause of this error is due to the fact that the version of wmp.dll in the registry is out of sync with what is installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The wrong wploc.dll version error is a common problem that usually happens when the original wmploc.dll file in C:\Windows\System32 folder is
 replaced. You definitely cannot download Windows Media Player 12 on a computer running Windows 7 except for N and KN editions of Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To fix the incorrect wmploc.dll issue, follow the two Methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to Start and type cmd.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-Click
 on cmd and select Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;In
 the&nbsp; Command Prompt type the following and press&nbsp; <span>Enter</span>: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>UNREGMP2.EXE /UPDATEWMPVERSION</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp; Close the command prompt after running the above command.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;Re-register the wmp.dll file</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Heres how:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Command-Prompt-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>elevated
 command prompt.</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type <strong>regsvr32 wmp.dll</strong>without the quotes in the command prompt and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See if Windows Media Player works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Disable and re-enable the player</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This should fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Start and in the search bar type "Turn Windows features On or Off".</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browse to Media Features and place a check mark in front of Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart the Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That should be it.</span></p>

    <title>Unable to unistall Daemon tools on Windows 10 after installing Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jiyoung kim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to unistall Daemon tools on Windows 10 after installing Windows 10 Anniversary update.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 Version 1607</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop is HP Envy 700-414. I'm using on Windows 10 and I updated it to the version 1607.</p>
<p>But, it seems that the version is not stable yet. I have installed Daemon tools, but the app is not working at all after the update.</p>
<p>I tried to uninstall the program, but I couldn't do that. I tried to do it manually, but it didn't work, as well.</p>
<p>The message is appeared whenever I log in the Windows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't have an idea how to remove it. Do I need to rollback the update to the previous status?<br />
Are there any solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the booting speed might affect. It is kind of slower than the previous.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your answer. I tried the instructions you suggested, but it was still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked troubleshooting, but there weren't any issues, and I restart on Windows as a safe mode either general one and one with networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I cannot still uninstall the software. Once I try to uninstall, the action center displays the message that the app is not compatible with this version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked all the drivers are updated.</p>
<p>I'm wondering that rollback will be only the solution.</p>

            For what it is worth, I get the exact same error. After login, Windows tells me that "Daemon Tools does not work with this version of Windows". If I try to run the uninstaller, from the installation directory of Daemon Tools, I get the same error message
 again.

            <p>The files may be corrupted, hence the message. Have you tried doing it in safe mode with networking? Have you tried reinstalling a fresh copy, then use revo uninstaller to remove it completely?

                    I can Skype out successfully. My incoming call rang and the receive screen appeared,&nbsp;but when I tried to pick it up&nbsp;by selecting either of the green receive buttons&nbsp;they were&nbsp;inoperable and the call kept on ringing. Why is this happening.

<p>I uninstalled Skype from my laptop and tried the download you suggested and it reinstalled correctly. Unfortunately I had the same problem again when I received a skype call ringing in, but the green buttons did not work. I then used this new Skype no problem
 to skype out to a mobile cell phone and it was perfect. We will try to take the same action and reinstall skype on the remote machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered that&nbsp;Skype fails in the same way&nbsp;both ways PC to PC, but works fine PC to Mobile or landline.&nbsp; This is to say that If I call someone, they can see it coming in, but cannot pickup (their green buttons do not work). I have reinstalled skype
 to no avail. I can only see the version when I try to uninstall. I appear to&nbsp;have loaded&nbsp;version 7.38. Is this Classic? If it is, how can I change it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is URGENT and is experienced on multiple PC /&nbsp;laptops. Further to the above, although the green pickup buttons don't work, (they appear to depress but nothing happens), the Red button does work and switches off the incoming call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO fix has been received and the problem persists. Can anyone HELP please.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that your notification for incoming calls is turned on. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Skype, and sign in to your account.</li><li>Select <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34670_1.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><span>Under </span><strong>Notification Settings</strong><span>, toggle Incoming calls&nbsp;</span><strong>On</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, check if there is an update available for Skype on the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest trying the classic version of Skype which can be downloaded using this link:
<strong><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></strong>. And locate the
<strong>Download </strong>button.</p>
<p>Please monitor the behavior of the two applications, and check&nbsp;if the problem will happen for both or for the Skype for&nbsp;Windows 10 version only. This will help us isolate the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be waiting for your response.</p>

<h3>   say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor keeps turning off</h2>
                    I had this problem when I upgraded to Windows 10 and the problem is that even when I turned off the setting that let's your monitor never turn off, it stills turns off by itself. I have turned off that setting everywhere but it still keeps happening. This
 is a problem because when I don't touch the keyboard for 2-3 minutes the screen turns off, and this really irritates me since if I am playing a video game and I go away from the keyboard the laptop turns off the screen, minimises the game, and has the windows
 welcome screen show up, and it takes ages to get back into the video game since my laptop is not great.

</p><p>Here is a possibility that is very easy to checkout. Click on the start button and type screen saver. Click on "turn screen saver on or off". Verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No screen saver is selected (None).</p>
<p>2. The "On resume, display logon screen" checkbox is clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the screen saver is set to none, and the on resume display logon screen checkbox is checked it will act the same as if the screen saver is turned on but not display anything, just dimming the screen.</p>

    <title>Wi-Fi adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodneyjensen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wi-Fi adapter</h2>
                    <p>yikes, the dreaded wifi adapter disfunction, common symptoms (usb device descriptor request failed, wifi direct adapter #2 not connected). Recommended reinstall drivers, recover, full recover, registry edits, have no affect. Oh, and its a Surface pro 3 running
 windows 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, no wireless, no Bluetooth, is it a hardware fail? How can I know definitively. Viewed many posts from over the years, hoping there's a more definitive fix out there. Just a piece of circumstantial symptoms, waking up after a sleep historically is twitchy,
 but a two button reset has addressed any issues in the past (not this time). This time it powered down after a long plane flight, by the time we reached San Diego, the failure to connect was observed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>cheers.</p>

            I ran a complete restore to factory settings, is this different from restoring from a recovery drive? If the restore is equivalent to recovery, and I still get the usb device descriptor&nbsp;request fail&nbsp;and the failed wifi that seems to be associated with
 it, does this mean there is a hardware fault?

so, I upgraded to windows 10 via a usb wifi adapter, unfortunately the original problem exists. Blue tooth not functional, and the usb device descriptor fail shows in the device manager. Any ideas? cheers.

<p>The issue is most likely hardware. The only way to know for sure is to do a complete wipe and reimage from a downloadable recovery image
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a> - if you have this issue after doing the reimage, it is definitely hardware. At that point, you can decide if you want an out of
 warranty exchange (running about $450 US) or if you want to keep using the USB adapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it IS hardware and you are in the US, go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store and discuss options with them.</p>
