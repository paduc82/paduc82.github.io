<h2>            BSOD haunts my dreams &#42; Resolved</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have been pouring through lots and lots of posts all over the net to see if I could figure this out on my own, but no luck. I get the BSOD whenever it feels like it. From what I can tell it has to do with the Kernel.&nbsp; The link below is my dump file
 if someone wouldn't mind taking a look.&nbsp; I am all out of ideas at this point.&nbsp; I am running Win7 64 SP1 on a Lenovo Tiny M93.&nbsp; I have had the pc for about a month and sometimes the issue happens daily sometimes not for several days.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Too much Gamerscore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derrkadurr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too much Gamerscore</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
Not quite sure where this is supposed to go, so I took a shot<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>A few days ago, when I was playing some <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em>, I joined a modified Zombie-lobby. Sure as hell, I was enjoying the mods, flying about like the boss, and having a hovering car above my head. But all of a sudden, my game froze,
 and I was disconnected for a brief time. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
It turned out my Xbox was overworked unlocking all the game's achievements. I remember only obtaining one achievement in the game, and now I have every one except for some DLC-related ones.<br />
<br />
</span></p>

<p><em>So I wondered if there is any way to remove this from my Gamerscore?</em> I don't really care that it's there, but I don't want Xbox LIVE staff to apprehend it as me cheating, and therefore bann me, or perhaps reset my G. I E-mailed and discussed the
 issue with the Swedish support for a couple of days, but they redirected me here, since they were not allowed to answer those kinds of questions.<br />
<br />
</p>

<p><em>Kind regards,</em><br />
<em>Andreas Håkansson</em></p>

            <p>I wouldn't be worried so much about the gamerscore as I would be about the fact that you just came onto the xbox forums and admitted to taking part in a lobby that is explicitly against the ToU and CoC.</p>
<p>Achievements rung up would have only meant a reset of your gamerscore. &nbsp;Knowingly taking part in a modded lobby can result in a gamertag ban and loss of all DLC./MS Points/Gold membership on your account.</p>

<p>Before patronizing me, I must add that I didn't join a modified lobby on purpose (perhaps it's no excuse, but I am merely human). It's just that EVERY single game on World at War is modified today. I urge you to go online yourselves and try to play a few
 games without stumbling across one. Eventually, you just go "aww, hell with it", and play whatever lobby you join.</p>
<p>I remember this being an issue with Modern Warfare 2 as well, but at the time I played MW2 seriously, so me and my friends always disconnected from the modded games. Then, due to a patch, I think, the issues of modded lobbies were no longer present.</p>
<p>However, they are in WaW. And you find them at a far higher rate than you ever did in MW2. Seems as if Treyarch simply doesn't care about their game anymore.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for your response. I did not know about it being a violation (though now that you mention it, I recall one of my friends saying so whilst disconnecting from a modded MW2 lobby), because honestly, I didn't read the entire Terms of agreement.
 Your response won't help me sleep at night, (considering I have hundreds of dollars (thousands of Swedish Krona) worth of DLC accumulated during several years, and of course the fact that I'm a student without the income to purchase it all over again. But
 at least you replied, and that has to account for something. </p>

<p>"Don't intentionally play with someone who is using unauthorized software or methods to help inflate your game rank or gamerscore. "</p>
<p>The word intentionally is quite ambiguous. I had no idea it was even possible to "inflate gamerscore". Perhaps your own, if you were the one modding, but not other people's.</p>
<p>Oh, all I wanted to do was play some World at War... and now I'm facing these risks? Life's fair, huh?</p>

<h3> naomi_d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating windows 7 error code 0xc004f061</h2>
                    I have a Dell Laptop that came pre-installed with Windows Vista, over time it was upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium (have the disc &amp; box but can't find the product key anywhere) and then to windows 7 ultimate (downloaded and have the key).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My machine got infected with a virus where the only option was wipe and start again. &nbsp;I reinstalled Windows 7 from the Home Premium Disc that I have and selected Windows 7 ultimate as the version to be installed as that is what my finally upgrade was.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However when I enter my Windows key I get error code 0xC004F061 which tells me that my key can not be used for installs, only for upgrades.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried a fix that said to change the&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/ to 0 via regedit and then do slmgr -rearm from an&nbsp;administrator&nbsp;command prompt, reboot and then re-enter key.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also tried using SLMgr commands to insert the key.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So in summary</div>
<div>I have Windows vista key, but no software disc (preinstalled)</div>
<div>I have windows 7 home premium upgrade disc, but no key (lost)</div>
<div>I have windows 7 ultimate upgrade key, but no software disc (anytime upgrade download)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            <p>You can't use Anytime Upgrade if the base license is not activated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would first have to ensure the base license is activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its a upgrade version (not anytime upgrade), you can try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>If your computer came with a previous qualifying license such as Windows Vista or Windows XP and the Certificate of Authencity is still attached to the machine in good condition, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.</p>
<p>How to do a clean install with the upgrade disk:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />

<h2>            No one can hear me through headset mic, kinect works fine. Can hear all other sounds and party.</h2>
                    <p>Ok so before we start no it is not muted.</p><p><br /></p><p>Last Monday afternoon everything worked fine, come the evening my mic wouldn't work but&nbsp;I could hear all the party and game sounds. I tried my Kinect and as this worked presumed it was the headset. Next day i purchased a new headset but found i had the same problem so i got in touch with chat support who advised me of all the basic trouble shooting steps opening the correct ports, making sure NAT type is open, opening DMZ, etc.... still no joy. They then advised me it was a hardware fault and that i would need to pay £110 to have it repaired (weird as no one could tell me the fault). Having the xbox since day one I traded it as working with fault and got a new Xbox One S. Guess what, same issue. So now I'm out of pocket and no one can help me</p><p><br /></p><p>I have been back and forth with Xbox support managers and 'engineers' telling me to retry troubleshooting steps. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p><p><br /></p

    <title>Hiding devices from Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitch13212412  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hiding devices from Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media list</h2>
                    In my Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media list both my internal SSD and storage drive are listed. I want to be able to hide/remove these drives from the list. After a lot of searching all I could find was a registry trick for Win7 which no longer applies
 in Win10. All the other suggestions have been to shut off hot swapping but that is something I use. This is a work machine that I am often connecting and disconnecting drives from. It seems like it should be a simple thing to mark certain devices to not be
 listed. What can I do?

<h2>            Stickers not available on my phone</h2>
                    <p>Just a quickie, really.&nbsp; I have been sent a sticker and apparently the version of Skype on my Windows 10 phone does not support it.&nbsp; I have clicked on the "learn more ........" and it doesn't really tell me anything I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live without the stickers on my phone, as I can view them on my PC at home, but with a Nokia Lumia 435 running Windows 10 and version of 12.1815.210.0 I am surprised that they are unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of any technical reasons or is it just that, as usual, Microsoft favour Android and Apple over their own Microsoft products.</p>

                    <p>Hallo, Ich hätte mal eine Frage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Könnte ich mein Xbox Live Gold von meinem Kontosaldo bezahlen, weil immer wenn ich es mir kaufen möchte steht dort das es gesperrt ist, da sich das überschritten hat und nicht abgebucht werden kann, obwohl ich es 3Tage vor Ende gekündigt habe. Kann man das
 irgendwie freischalten, ohne es mit Lastschrift, Kredit- oder Debitkarte oder Mobiltelefon zu bezahlen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>LG</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Translation: </strong></p>
<p><strong>[</strong><strong>HI, I would have a Question. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Could I pay my Xbox Live Gold off my Account balance because whenever I want to buy it is there it is locked, as this has passed and cannot be debited, even though I have terminated it 3 Days before the End. You can somehow unlock that without paying
 for it with Direct Debit, credit or Debit card or Mobile Phone. </strong></p>

<p>Hi there Lucien Ernst<br />
</p>
<p>Are you meaning something is stoping you from purchasing online when you have the credit available?. Normally they ask for either gift card of xbox live or a place to do a subscription payment plan rather than credit on the account. If you are having trouble
 purchasing it I suggest checking there is no outstanding balance which you can check out on the www.mircosoft.com Logging in to your email address linked to your gamer tag, Pressing the icon on the top right hand corner going to "my mircosoft account" subscription
 tab on that page there.<br />
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Translated&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haben Sie damit zu tun, dass Sie beim Kauf online nicht so etwas haben, wenn Sie das Guthaben zur Verfügung haben?. Normalerweise bitten sie entweder um eine Geschenkkarte von xbox live oder um einen Ort, an dem sie einen Bezugs-Zahlungsplan statt eines
 Guthabens auf dem Konto erstellen können. Wenn Sie Schwierigkeiten haben, es zu kaufen, schlage ich vor, zu überprüfen, es gibt kein ausstehendes Guthaben, das Sie auf der www.mircosoft.com sich auf Ihre E-Mail-Adresse einloggen können, die mit Ihrem Gamer-Tag
 verbunden ist, Drücken Sie das Symbol auf der oberen rechten Hand, gehen Sie zu "mein mircosoft Konto "Abo-Tab auf dieser Seite gibt&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Code 45 &#40;not connected&#41; yet webcam is inbuilt</h2>
                    Webcam has worked fine until now.<br />
Suddenly&nbsp; the camera won't open.<br />
Reason: "Webcam initialization failed. Please check your camera device..."<br />
<br />
Code 45 which refers to the device not being connected, however the webcam is an inbuilt component of this Toshiba L500 Satellite Laptop.<br />
<br />
Device manager has no adverse icons against the camera.<br />
Nothing unusual has happened to the computer (no strange download/infections/etc ... all systems clear).<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Or if this has happened to you how did you resolve it?<br />
<br />
appreciate yr input<br />

<h2>            Remote desktop connection - Tiny folders on remote machine</h2>
                    <p>My wife is trying to connect into her school network over a remote desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works fine through her desktop but when she tries to do it over her Surface Pro 4, the icons on the remote machine are tiny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is something to do with the different resolutions between the two machines - Changing the screen resolution on the SP4 doesn't help. A partial fix is to change each folder, on the remote machine to extra large icons but it seems that if she
 doesn't change it back then the next person to log into the remote machine sees large icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this article on Answers -&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro3-surfnetwork/remote-desktop-connetion-displays-very-small-icons/f904fdb4-a3b6-4337-abdb-77db3685e8c6</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the application is no longer on the Microsoft download site. I have tried remote desktop client and remote desktop from the Microsoft Store and they both have issues because the remote machines address contains invalid characters</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Is it just the folders or is everything tiny?&nbsp; We've seen behavior where everything is tiny because the local system has a very high resolution screen that's scaled to make things seem larger (and thus readable), however the Remote Desktop session doesn't
 scale so everything is running in the native resolution of the local system and looks tiny.&nbsp; If we run Remote Desktop in a Window (rather than full screen) there is an option in the menu for Zoom.&nbsp; Right click on the icon in the title bar's left end, and click
 Zoom.&nbsp; Hopefully that helps.

<p>We've had the hardest time through Browser based sessions (like Citrix, and Remote Apps) because those often fully control the session.&nbsp; Options like what
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3c48b1ec-f517-481a-ad7b-8cdd9ce0e5f4" title="Emmylou Gac">
 on the client to better deal with high resolution screens.&nbsp; At my company we've decided that all developers who frequently remote into other computers will only get "low" resolution screens (1920x1080) that are large enough to read with a native 100% zoom
 setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the resolution of the local system does help, but often makes things look blurry so we shy away from that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I know none of that helps you.&nbsp; maybe some combination of what <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3c48b1ec-f517-481a-ad7b-8cdd9ce0e5f4" title="Emmylou Gac">

<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try, tonight when the wife gets home, changing the resolution - RDC Manager is out due to the invalid characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The school won't do anything as getting an engineer in will cost money that they don't have. If the change in resolution won't work than she will not be able to use her SP4 and will be left with only using her desktop, which is&nbsp; apain</p>

The computer name is blank or it contains invalid characters. Try typing it again.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Immediately signing out of standard user accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d simpson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Immediately signing out of standard user accounts</h2>
                    I have one administrator and two standard accounts on Windows 8.1 pro. The admin account is a Microsoft account and the standard accounts are local accounts. Immediately after signing in to one of the standard accounts, it goes from "welcome" to "signing
 out". Changing a standard account to an administrator account solved the problem, but I do not want those two users to have admin privileges. It seems to have started happening 7-10 days ago (user reported it to me yesterday). I have been on Windows 8.1 since
 last fall and no user account issues until now.

            Further to the above. I re-installed skip metro suite and then uninstalled it again. That seems to have solved the problem. thank you for pointing me in the right direction on this.

    <title>Bios Password&#47;System Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gillacutte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bios Password&#47;System Password</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am wondering if there is a way to have a Bios Password set but have Windows start without having to enter this Password? Seems a little strange that without the password Windows will startup usually to where you enter a User account.&nbsp; Where if you have
 passwords set you will have to enter them first. Maybe I do not understand that this is not actually the Bios password or they are both the same being the System password? Maybe I should be asking how do you get a Password for each even if they are one in
 the same? Is something wrong with the Password setup on my system?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer is a Toshiba Mini Notebook NB255-N245 using Windows 7 Home Premium SP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Okay that I understand but the funny thing about this Toshiba computer there is a setup utility called HWSetup. It gives you the ability the set a password but I do not know if that is the Bios or System. Maybe it is both which has me confused a little
 bit. What do you think about that RAJU.MSC?

<p>I successfully loaded about&nbsp;one hundred&nbsp;45's into my iTunes library.&nbsp; Then the audio started repeating endlessly.&nbsp; This continued even after the needle was lifted from the record.&nbsp; I uninstalled the EZ software and then reinstalled it, but the problem continued
 - even with different records being recorded.</p>

            Yea, I'm getting that problem, too. I installed it correctly, and tried the troubleshooter. All I get when start the flight is this black screen. Audio and controls work, but the display doesn't. Do I need to install the program in Windows XP mode, or
 will it not work there either?<br />

            The greeting was unexpected. That is what happens though with insufficient knowledge sometimes.&nbsp;😊 It's cool (😎). When you think about people long enough, you start to become like them, right? 😉 I want to be married to and share the rest of my life with
 Daisy. I love her and want the best for her. She means a lot to me. That was an aside. In regard to the Scrabble players' dictionary, I tried downloading an updated version of the application and it returned the same error. I have contacted the developer about
 the problem. I sent the e-mail not long ago.
