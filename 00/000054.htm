<h2>            Build 10586 - HP 5100 Printer fails</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else run into this?&nbsp; HP 5100 Printeron LPT1, previously working, fails after Build 10586 update / upgrade.&nbsp; The driver previously was PCL 6, 5100 specific.&nbsp; The new driver is the HP UPD PCL6.&nbsp; The message is that the printer state is failed.&nbsp;
 So I installed HP UPD PS.&nbsp; The same message.&nbsp; I also went through the whole process of completely removing the printer (via REGEDIT and pnputil) and reinstalling but no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have backed out Build 10586 on my production Windows system 10 and it works again, but not on this Win 10 Insider system where it still fails without reason.</p>

            <p>Hello Garth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the issue might be with the incompatible printer drivers. You would have tried installing the drivers in compatibility mode to see if it works.
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Download the driver from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<strong>‚Äòproperties‚Äô</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Click on the
<strong>‚Äòcompatibility‚Äô</strong> tab and check the box <strong>‚ÄòRun this program in compatibility mode for‚Äô</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer
 and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Yashwanth:</p>
<p>I am up against a deadline for Monday night (especially after losing 10 hours yesterday on this), but will (1) try your approach (2) provide more specifics on the drivers in question (version, etc.), when I get a chance., and (3) report on my success / failure.</p>

            <p>Notes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; This PC is a multi-boot with the following systems, </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Win 7 Pro</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Win 10 Pro - Production -- (removed Build 10586 a.k.a. "Fall Roll-out)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Win 10 Pro Insider -- Test (Built 10586 installed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; There are two printers, which both would use the same HP Universal Print Driver</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The HP 5100 PCL6 which is a shared, work-horse, large format (up to tabloid+ sheet size)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The HP 2605 Color LaserJet which is for specialty work.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it appears that you cannot change the HP Universal Print Driver without affecting both printers.&nbsp; There is also a HP5100 Class driver which I am using on systems a., and b., but which will not install on c.,
</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Followed instructions to install in Windows 8 compatibiliy mode (did as Administrator) -- version 6.1.0.20062</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First time: got message "Unable to Install Printer"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second time: cleaned up all the printer remnants and it installed; try to print test page and got the message "Printer in an error state".</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Win 10 Pro Insider machine now gives message that its security settings prevent insider updates, with a button&nbsp; "Fix It".&nbsp; Well pressing that button which then requires a restart does absolutely nothing (have done 3 or 4 times).&nbsp;&nbsp; I AM QUITTING
 ON THIS PROBLEM.&nbsp; Will reinstall the Win 10 Pro Insider system from scratch.</p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>If Win 10 Pro insists on reinstalling Build 10586 (or a successor) at some time in the future, and it fouls up the HP 5100 printer again, then I shall have no choice but to abandon Windows 10 completely.</p>

            <p>Have completely reinstalled win10 as upgread to win 7; thought it would be build10586 because it downloaded, but is build 10240 -- on that system the existing (carried over from Win7) HP 5100 PCL6 still works.&nbsp; The upgrade created a second printer object
 "Hewlett-Parkard LaserJet 5100 series" which on printing a test page results in page headed "XML error" &amp;c.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Will wait until Build 10586 flows through and see if HP 5100 PCL6 then fails.</p>

            Ya' HP 5100 is an old printer...it's the wide format right?..and the 2600 color I worked on those&nbsp; and many other Hp printers...they are becoming dinosaurs...I don't think even Windows 8.1 would work with them...we used XP at work...unless you get lucky
 finding drivers for them , guess you have no choice but to go back to Windows 7 or buy a new printer...I know those old printers are work horses but it's hard to keep them going with new technology.*john<br />

            <p>Yes, these are old printers, but both are in good working condition.&nbsp; The 5100 is relatively economical to run, and the cost of a new tabloid size laser printer is daunting.&nbsp; Moreover, HP says that its drivers for these work on Win 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the 2605 does
 work fine on Win10 all builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, while the 5100 works fine on Win 10 Build 10240 using the Win 7 driver, it does not with the new printer object it creates (see above).&nbsp; I have forced update / upgrade to Build 10586 and it added yet another printer object, making a total of three.&nbsp;
 The new one does not work, nor do either of the others, for now the Win 7 driver fails.<br />
</p>
<p>If HP cannot come up with a working driver, I shall put the printer on another Win7 PC or Ubuntu Server PC and try installing it on Win10 as a network printer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possible hardware glitch I can think of on the currently connected PC is that the BIOS LPT1 Bidirectional support may be incompatible with Win10 1511 Build 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put this on the community forum to see if anybody has a 5100 that is working on Build 10586 and what their setup is.</p>

            <p>Had an inspiration after HP Print and Scan doctor could not connect to LPT1 under Windows 10 Pro 64 1511 (Build 10586) which could affet other parallel cable connected printers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to device manager and looked at Properties==&gt;Port Settings.&nbsp; It was set to "Never use an interrupt".&nbsp; Changed it to "Use any interrupt assigned to the port".</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this change</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HP LaserJet 5100 PCL 6 driver, Type 3 - User Mode - Version 61.74.561.43 worked</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HP Universal Printing PCL 6 dirver printed a page (so now, at least it communicates to printer) as follows</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCL XL error</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsystem:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KERNEL</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnsupportedProtocol</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operator:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Position:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>so this is at least a bypass for the problem under Build 10586</p>
<p>

            Ya'...I remember that PCL-6 driver for HP....so o.k....I could figure out stuff usually when I work on them my self it's called troubleshooting...been an Electronic Technician since 1988...nice to see the old sets still working....and I love older color
 TV's...sometimes people give up and throw away a lot of electronic equipment...what a waste...anyways &nbsp; good luck and keep on experimenting.*john

    <title>How do I make Access display a Yes&#47;No field as a checkbox, rather - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I make Access display a Yes&#47;No field as a checkbox, rather than &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    <div>I'm not exactly a newbie, but I haven't used MS Office for much of anything in two years. Just FYI... Here goes...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I create a table in Excel. Just headings and one row of data.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I decide that Access would be a better way to accomplish what I want.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I make a new DB in Access and import the Excel sheet, setting eight of my imported columns to be "Yes/No" data (the rest are text or integers).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I see my newly imported sheet in Access, and <b>all the Yes/No fields are displayed as numbers where I was hoping for checkboxes</b>. I had entered them as "0" or "1" in Excel, so fine, I guess that's to be expected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I click on one of these yes/no cells and in <i>Table Tools</i> &gt; <i>Fields</i>&nbsp;&gt;
<i>Formatting</i> &gt; <i>Data Type</i>, it is set to <i>Yes/No</i>, but just beneath that,
<i>Format</i> is blank. I change it to <i>Yes/No</i>. <b>Now it appropriately converts the numbers to the corresponding "Yes" or "No"</b> with a "0" or "-1" behind the displayed name. Great.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I add a new Yes/No column by clicking on&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Table Tools</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>Fields</i>&nbsp;&gt;
<i>Add &amp; Delete</i>&nbsp;&gt; <i>Yes/No</i>. I now have a new column with... <b>checkboxes! Hey!</b> That's what I wanted for all of my yes/no fields!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So.... I want to convert them... hmmm... click click.... no..... no that's not it.... click..... not that either.......</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>((google, google, goolge))</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No, that's not it... no....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So my question:&nbsp;<b>How do I make Access display a Yes/No field as a checkbox, rather than "Yes" or "No" when I already have the fields in place?</b> Do I have to delete each column and re-make it in Access to get an actual checkbox? (&lt;-- This was the best
 answer I was able to find in my search, but I would really rather not have to do this, even though it's only eight columns in an 'empty' database.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any help you can offer, and sorry if I was a bit too verbose; being concise with Google didn't seem to get me anywhere... ;)</div>

            While I entirely agree with Duane that the interface with the data should always be via forms or reports, never in a table's raw datasheet view, you can set the DisplayControl property of the column to Check Box in table design view on the Lookup tab of
 the column's properties sheet.&nbsp; This will then carry through to forms or reports as the default control type for the column.

<p>We need to know the exact software version you're running together with the platform on which the error is occurring. Also, when did this start to happen?

<p>Hi Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am allowed rather than starting another case, I have exactly the same issue with skype, I cannot send any messages, but can receive messages and also I can even make voice calls to the contact.&nbsp; But cannot send any messages, just shows sending on the
 contact.&nbsp; It happens for all contacts.&nbsp; &nbsp;The version of skype I am using is Windows 10 skype 12.1807.264.0.&nbsp; I am using it on a dell optiplex 7010.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also have the exact same version of skype on my laptop and all works perfectly fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be very glad if you can resolve this</p>

<p>The action you took is, in fact, the "fall back" solution to your issue and is one which we suggest if the user is running the latest software version. I'm glad that your issue is now resolved.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Find User in SharePoint Online but has valid E1 subscription</h2>
                    
<p>We have been using O365 for over 2 years. &nbsp;I have a user that has a valid E1 subscription but when we go to add him into a SharePoint security group in our SharePoint Online environment, I cannot find him when I go to add him to the security group. &nbsp;I have
 searched by full name, by his UPN/email address and it comes up with 0 results found. &nbsp;When I look in the O365 Admin portal, I see him fine and see that he has a valid E1 subscription.</p>

<p>Any ideas on what could be causing this problem?</p>

<p>hi roxanne,</p>
<p>you can check the threads above, and also perform the following steps to narrow down the issue:
<br />
-. can you expand the e1 license and check the details licenses included? (in the picture, i just take an example with my office 365 business premium plan)<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=946defb9-05f1-4848-beda-dd51b956c69b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d946defb9-05f1-4848-beda-dd51b956c69b" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
-. can you edit members to add this user after the group has been created? <br />
-. how long has the user account been created, also for 2 years or a newly created user?<br />
-. has this user ever changed the user name? if so, please also try the original user name.&nbsp;
<br />
-. what if you create an office group and add this user? <br />
-.&nbsp;is there any error message? if so, what does it say?</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

            In VBA there is a way to open documents but keep them invisible. The 4605 error can occur on these type of "invisible" documents when you use certain VBA commands, so I thought maybe that was the case in your situation.
<div><br />
<div>However, you have the document open and it's in the active window when you go to the Developer tab and run your macro, then obviously the error has nothing to do with the document being invisible.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another way that this could occur is if this document is a Protected Document, such as one setup for Read Only. Could that be the issue in your case?</div>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having issues with the Outlook app on Android. I have one account setup which is an office 365 account, emails are coming in as they are received but I am not receiving any notification for new messages. I have checked all notification settings within
 the app, they are all turned on. I have also checked all notification settings within my device settings, again all turned on, nothing is being blocked. My device (Samsung Note 9) OS is up to date, the outlook app is up to date. I have also tried removing
 and reinstalling the app to no avail. I'm not sure what else could be the problem. Please assist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately your suggestions did not work. However, the suggestion made by someone else to add another account to the app did. Strangely as soon as I added in my personal account, both accounts started to produce notifications correctly. I later deleted
 my personal account and the business account seems to have since continued to function correctly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            BT Yahoo mail &#38; Outlook 2010 on Windows 7 not synchronising - BT message says &#39;No longer works with Internet Explorer 11&#39; &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had an issue on 7 March when my emails stopped coming through to Outlook 2010 on my desktop. I use BT Yahoo mail to synch through, but BT say they're not to blame, speak to MS. I could see my messages in Yahoo.mail, but they were just not coming through
 to my Outlook. </p>
<p>I complained to BT at the time and they escalated my complaint to their R&amp;D team. Then quite suddenly last Friday 22 March (16 days later) the messages started to come through., 100's of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All seemed to be&nbsp; synchronising ok, since the 22 March then, yesterday 28 March the situation repeated itself and kicked off again, but this time BT had a message on their Yahoo login page which stated that, 'they would no longer support Internet Explorer
 11 and I was to use Chrome as default browser'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been using Chrome, so why this issue keeps recurring I can't fathom?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've changed the password on Yahoo, also changed it in Outlook account settings. Sent a test msg from BT Yahoo mail, which doesn't synch through to my Outlook. Tried Repair and Change in Outlook account settings, but nothing seems to want to connect to the
 server.&nbsp; Error msgs come up 0X8004210A.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, if anyone can help let me know.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word - &#34;Endnotes&#34; question</h2>
                    
<p>i have been typing up a document using "endnotes" in microsoft word 2010. For those of you that don't know what that is, instead of footnotes endnotes just puts all the references on the last page of the document instead of at the bottom of every page. My
 question is how do I get rid of the line that comes up using endnotes? it is a line that appears at the top of the page. I want to make the document look professional and don't want a line. i think this may be a problem in all versions of word but since I'm
 using 2010 please guide only with that program version. thanks</p>

<p>Switch to Draft view.&nbsp; View, Draft</p>
<p>Then goto References, Footnotes, Show Notes</p>
<p>If you have both footnotes and endnotes you will need to choose which at this point</p>
<p>The Footnote/Endnote pane should open at the bottom of the screen</p>
<p>Choose Endnote Seperator from the drop down list at the top left of the pane</p>
<p>Change or delete the seperator</p>

                    <p>Trying to add a pop3 Verizon account to windows 10 mail. It wont sync and when I go to fix it always shows more dots in the password than what the password is. It seems that it is seeing an old password that I used when first trying to add the account. The
 info and password are good but windows 10 mail wont sync to it. Anyone know how to add this account?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JCS</p>

            I am having problems with my POP3 and the mail app too. &nbsp;I find it hard to believe that the mail app in Windows 10 doesn't support POP3. &nbsp;The option to setup your account manually allows you to pick IMAP or POP3. &nbsp;

<p>When you replace your Motherboard, Win 10 see's that as a NEW PC and activation is NOT carried over. &nbsp;</p>

                    I have 2 email accounts connected to my Outlook. The hotmail account sends emails to Outlook. The bigpond account hasn't for 3 weeks. The hotmail email is a MAPI server. The bigpond email is a POP/SMTP server. When I am in Outlook my default email is bigpond
 and I can send emails. How can I fix my bigpond so it will send emails to Outlook?

            Hello. You are having trouble receiving emails in Outlook but you can send them? Are you certain that your "bigpond" SMTP server information has not changed? I would try to reset up the bigpond account. Is this problem with your phone or PC? You can also
 get more specific Outlook help in the Outlook Answers forum:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contributing to the Microsoft community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand your Zune 80Gb is not recognized by the Zune software when connecting it to your PC via a USB cable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please have a look at the following Microsoft Knowledgebase article which describes some troubleshoot steps to resolve this issue:</p>

<p>Log into your PC with the new admin account and connect your device. If the device should be recognized then, it should also work with your current account, so you can delete the user account you created for the troubleshoot afterwards.</p>

<h2>            Windows defender updates have gone crazy</h2>
                    <p>I try to update windows defender and it keeps downloading the same update and installing it and never actually completes. I downloads straight from 0 to 100 and then installs in the same manner. But never actually ends up installing for the last time. The
 update it installs is 'Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.25.1621.0). No error codes are shown. As mentioned earlier, they seem to be installed properly although they keep installing repeatedly each time I check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additional Information: <strong>Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) 1803 build 17134.286; 4 GB of RAM, Intel core i3 8100 3.6 GHz</strong>. Windows was installed by me manually through an installation media. I have never faced this problem before on my previous PC.
 The new PC was assembled with every part bought and configured individually. The hard disk had no Windows version installed as I formatted all the partitions as well as deleting them. Another strange thing is that a Microsoft support representative had suggested
 me to perform an in-place upgrade however the media creation tool keeps telling "The language or edition of the version of windows<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;currently installed on your
 PC isn't supported by this tool".</span></p>
<p>

<br />If that does not work....
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<p>Hi Yusuf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have received very good advice, but if your problem stems from a condition</p>
<p>that I recently ran across, your problem is likely to re-occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were attempting to check for definition updates from within Windows Defender</p>
<p>itself, and the progress dots would never stop. Your update history never showed any</p>
<p>change. Your definitions remained the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experienced this symptom, and it was resolved by performing a scan that was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
pending</span>.</p>
<p>The WD definitions were promptly updated as soon as the scan completed. When a</p>
<p>scan is pending, the Virus &amp; Threat Protection Icon in the Security Center is flagged</p>
<p>with an exclamation mark in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">yellow</span>. It&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">appears</span> that definitions can only be downloaded,</p>
<p>when the Icon is checked <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">green</span>. If you experience this in the future, check the Icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp; Glen</p>

            My question is that why do i even need to do these things when i have brand new PC with no unauthorized software downloaded or installed except Microsoft Office and Affinity Photo. (Now don't say there might be any corrupted files because I installed windows
 the day right before I posted the question) also, No in-place upgrade worked.

            The issue might not be the local software but a network issue delivering the definitions from Microsoft servers. This rarely happens, I personally haven't experienced it in a while back.
<br />
<br />In fact, I booted up a laptop I haven't used in over 6 months because the fan stopped working and it gets hot. I was able to install 6 months worth of updates which includes Defender definitions. So, this could just be a temporary glitch you are experiencing. 
<br />
<br />The steps I provided are not normal of course, but can be used as a means to overcome them.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the prompt, type: slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Take a screenshot of the resulting dialog then post in a reply here.

            Look in the same folder as the file is located in, for a file that has had the first 2 char of the problem file name replaced by ~$......DOC
<br />
<br />
Word uses this file to store the name of the person who currently has the file open. If you do not close Word properly, ie with the file open in word you turn off the power or Word abends, this file gets left behind. The next time you try to open it you get
 the message you are complaining about.<br />
<br />
Delete the temp file, then you should be able to open the main file.<br />

<h2>            Adding a conference room to the Outlook 2016 calendar NOT WORKING</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>We are a medium sized company with three different meeting rooms that is configured as resources in Office 365.</p>
<p>Users that want to make a room booking can't add the shared calendar to the their own calendar in Outlook 2016 on OS X. The window only says "Checking permissions". The permissions have already been configured and everyone should be able to access it without
 any problems. The "Checking permissions" could be running for hours without any success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a known issue or is something configured wrong? I could provide screenshots, but since this is just a simple error really, it would not make any difference.</p>
<p>If someone got any idea of what the problem might be, I would really appreciate it. :-)&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc337829-823f-4c5c-8cd6-b83fa690d352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc337829-823f-4c5c-8cd6-b83fa690d352" /></a></p>
<p>back to your issue, i‚Äôd like to collect some detailed information:<br />
1.&nbsp;as you said the permissions have already been configured, what permission is assigned?
<br />
2.&nbsp;screenshots of the detailed steps about how you assign the permission.<br />
3.&nbsp;what is the version of outlook for mac? to check it, navigate to preference&gt;account<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e37c9c1-67f5-42ca-93ae-8ad664be449c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e37c9c1-67f5-42ca-93ae-8ad664be449c" /></a>&nbsp;
<br />
to upload screenshots, click use rich formatting &gt; insert\ edit media.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ce17f2c-c28c-4293-bc1e-71d03f3bb0d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ce17f2c-c28c-4293-bc1e-71d03f3bb0d0" /></a></p>
<p>in addition, if you only want to book a room, it‚Äôs a simpler way to create an item in your calendar and add the room than add the whole room calendar.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef577b54-8311-433e-a647-ab0931f63b76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef577b54-8311-433e-a647-ab0931f63b76" /></a>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I'd like you guys please&nbsp;to tell me which is the best antivirus for Windows 10 or&nbsp;whether I can&nbsp;&nbsp;just leave my Windows without an antivirus (in trust of windows defender)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way&nbsp;to scanning for viruses with windows defender, I mean for &nbsp;each file I want to scan?</p>

3. Do all users accounts have the same issue or just some randomly ones.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Enforce a Specific Amount of Digits in a Number type Form Field</h2>
                    <p>A field in a form requires a 4-digit number (0001 to 9999); not more, not less.</p>
<p>Is it possible to format the field such that even if the user enters only e.g. '12', that the field changes it to '0012' on exit.</p>
<p>In the Text Form Field Options, I have stipulated a Maximum length of 4 and a Number Format of '0000'.</p>
<p>With this, it works fine when I just go from unprotected to protected to test these settings, but if I close the form and open it again, the '0000' in the Number Format field has disappeared and one can enter any amount of digits between&nbsp;0 and 4.</p>

            The same approach works with the docx format, so there may be a fault in your Office installation at work. Try repairing the Office installation (via Add/Remove Programs &gt; Microsoft Office in the Windows Control Panel).
