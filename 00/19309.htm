                    I am working with windows 8 64 bit and Office 2013 Home and Business.&nbsp; This is a new computer and the Windows Easy Transfer moved my files from the old Vista computer running office 2010.&nbsp; Everything moved over great except the address book.&nbsp; I'm using

            <p>This is a common issue caused by transferring your Outlook mail profile via Windows Easy Transfer. You'll have to recreate your mail profile via the Mail applet in Control Panel.</p>

 2010, it will run under reduced functionality mode which will not allow Outlook to send emails.</span></p>
<p><span>Outlook Express is a part of Windows XP and it will remain intact on the computer, however the data stored in Outlook cannot be accessed

<br />
Firts of all there is no trial of Outlook 2010 or any other Outlook. It is only included in an Office suite. The trial will expire and nothing will happen other than the Office suite will become useless. Outlook Express is a dead product and has no relation
 to Outlook.

<h3> ritzybiscuit7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Android Auto&#63; &#40;and the radio function on groove&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have used groove for so long and I recently got a Android tablet (6.0) </p>
<p>I have used Windows Phone (and Windows 10) for about 3 years and it is a really good system. (I hate Android FYI lol)</p>
<p>Although it seems that Microsoft could be missing out on a few things that could make them get more users.</p>
<p>I was comparing Groove Music and (Google) Play music and noticed a few things. One radio was actually free for users of Play music. It was weird seeing this because of Microsoft having people pay for the radio service with the music pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while thinking about this when using Android Auto, I noticed I could switch music apps but Groove was not one of the apps I could choose. (which makes sense because Google)</p>
<p>But it got me thinking, Because Microsoft does not seem to be making a Microsoft Automotive OS or&nbsp;having Ford's SYNC system being made by them anymore ("how do you get beat out by blackberry MS?")
</p>
<p>Should Groove&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;work with Android Auto or Apple car play? Try to beat Google at their own game?</p>
<p>Just thinking out loud...</p>

            <p>Totally agree!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm loving the Groove service. It's clients are neat, tidy, clean and pretty fast in comparison to Spotify or Google Play on all devices. Although I've seen mixed reviews on the Google Play store, Groove has been pretty smooth for me... except for the downloads,
 on my PC and my phone they seem to never finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android Auto is pretty nice and almost the only of it's kind. Just tried it today and did a quick search to see if anybody thought as me, and here I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sad to see Android be kind of neglected by Microsoft. In Android you can't choose to download music into the SD Card, no Android Wear download either (but I get it, it's almost dead), no Android Auto, no artist art on the lock screen... after all these
 years since Xbox Music launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll switch to Spotify.</p>

    <title>Main email account disconnected from Outlook 2016 after updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikki0417  say:</h3>
<h2>            Main email account disconnected from Outlook 2016 after updating Office</h2>
                    <p>I haven't been able to access my main email address from Outlook since I updated Office about a week ago. At first, when I click on the account's inbox, there was some kind of "Fix account" message in the bottom right corner. After I clicked that and walked
 through all the steps (which, I believe included typing in my email address, password, and verifying my account with the authenticator app), the message changed to "Disconnected" and has stayed that way since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a hotmail account, and it works fine if I check my inbox from outlook.com or the Windows Mail app. So, there's nothing wrong with the server. It's been getting emails everyday, but Outlook hasn't updated the inbox since 6/3/2019. Here's a list of things
 I've already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Switched "Work Offline" on and off</li><li>Restarted Outlook</li><li>Signed out of account</li><li>Restarted computer</li><li>Repaired Office (both Quick and Online Repair)</li><li>Reconnected the account using the Connection Status window</li><li>Ran MS Support and Recovery Assistant</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I haven't tried is removing and re-adding the account simply because I can't.&nbsp;When I right click on the account in the Folder panel, the option to remove it is disabled. I think that's because it's also my MS account and the default email
 address I have setup with Outlook.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to get new Windows 10 bash to work as reported at Build 2016&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w3sz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get new Windows 10 bash to work as reported at Build 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Build 14295.rs1_release.160318-1628.</p>
<p>I of course find lscore.sys and lxss.sys in my Windows\System32\drivers directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have long had installed MSYS and more recently MSYS2-64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was excited by the Build2016 blogs and videos re: the Windows Linux Subsystem awith functioning bash, apt, etc.</p>
<br />
<p>But when I try to find the new bash by typing "bash" in the Start&gt;&gt;Search window I get only my old Msys bash and apt is not a recognized command.&nbsp; Similarly, typing bash in either the standard command terminal or in PowerShell gives me only Msys and not
 available apt command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look under Windows 10 "Optional Features" I don't find a Linux feature to enable; the only optional features that I have under Settings that I haven't enabled are various fonts, and the only optional features not enabled under Control Panel also are
 unrelated to Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also find no &gt;&gt;AppData&gt;&gt;Local&gt;&gt;lxss directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is all of this really available now to those of us with Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Builds, or did I misunderstand the reporting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is available, how do I activate/access it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not now available with Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Builds, then with what Builds is it now available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to why I might want to do this since I have a functioning Msys system, the answer is that I would like to trial it for my group and then provide instructions for them to move to WLS when it becomes generally available this summer.&nbsp; Also, I just "miss"
 having apt-get available to me while working with c and cpp apps, etc. under Msys under Win10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>"Bash for Windows" as shown in the build 2016 conference </p>
<p>is currently planned only for the retail "Anniversary build" - version 1607 (due in July 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be release earlier to Insiders but it is not available yet in the latest Insider build 14295.</p>
<p>Bash maybe in the 143xx or higher builds hopefully one is released soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bash is now ready for build 14316 just released to the fast ring</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/04/06/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14316/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/04/06/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14316/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here’s what’s new in Build 14316 </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run native Bash on Ubuntu on Windows:</strong> In this build, you can natively run Bash in Windows as announced last week at Build 2016. To do this, you first need to turn on Developer Mode via Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; For developers. Then

I think you should go to the Bing toolbar support for this. <br />

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, it would be appreciate if you can provide the message in Console to us, it might be helpful for the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, if it is convenient for you, you can try reinstalling Office applications. You need to follow the steps in this article to uninstall first:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Warning</span>: Outlook data will be removed when you move the three folders listed in this step to Trash. You should back up these folders before you delete
 them.</p>

<h2>            One note not syncing after changing location</h2>
                    Due to space issues in one drive, I moved all my one note books to dropbox, I clicked file, setting, property and change location. I used onenote 2016. When I tried to sync other devices, it failed. I tried onenote app also in the desktop, it also refused
 to sync. I then moved the files back to onedrive using the same menu, it is still refusing to sync. Previously I use to see a one note icon in one drive for each of my notebook, now a folder appears for each book, inside the folder I can various sheets as
 a separate file. I tried onenote online, it is empty, could not find any of my books. can someone help.&nbsp;

<p>I dare to say you made two mistakes:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Moving the notebooks to <strong>Dropbox </strong>(works only with OneNote 2016 and with a good chance to ruin your notebooks)</li><li>Moving the notebooks to the <strong>OneDrive folder </strong>on your computer (this is possible but useless, it omits the necessary conversion to another format)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>What you need is the only working way to move notebooks to OneDrive: The <strong>
File -&gt; Share </strong>feature of OneNote 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So move your notebooks manually back to your hard disk and then <strong>Share </strong>
it.</p>

<p>If you mean the automatic backup in OneNote 2016, yes.</p>
<p>But why ?</p>
<p>You can move your notebooks (notebook = folder) from the OneDrive folder on your computer manually (with explorer) to the default place for local notebooks

            Your not going to believe this. Before I received your last reply I thought I would try reinstalling Windows 7. All the programs work now. There is no longer the configuration and set up pop ups process and the programs including Project open straight
 away. I'm not sure why, but the initial Windows 7 installation would not allow me to choose the upgrade option, I had to do a clean install, using Windows easy transfer etc. This time I was able to choose the upgrade option. You know the procedure from there.
 I am wondering whether something went astray during the first Windows 7 installation. Thanks for your advice. Will keep you posted, but so far so good.

            I'm not sure I understand the problem. &nbsp;Are you trying to use Helvetica to type Georgian? &nbsp;I don't think that is possible, as that font does not contain Georgian characters, so another font is used instead.

    <title>Store Autocorrect Entries in Word 2013 Custom Template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasm516  say:</h3>
<h2>            Store Autocorrect Entries in Word 2013 Custom Template</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Word 2013.&nbsp; I've used templates a fair amount in previous Word versions, but would like to increase my knowledge in this area and use them more in Word 2013.&nbsp; Toward that end I setup a Science template that I intend to use for making notes
 when I watch science programs or read science articles (I enjoy writing fiction and like to absorb as much as I can from various science sources).&nbsp; I want to create some autocorrect entries that are available ONLY in documents based on the Science template
 so that I can avoid conflicts with other kinds of documents.&nbsp; For example, in my Science template "ag" should autocorrect to "anti-gravity"&nbsp;whereas in the template that I use for non-scientific material I might want "ag" to autocorrect to "Attorney General."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with this and my results are not consistent.&nbsp; First, I created a new macro-enabled template called Science.&nbsp; I then closed Word and opened the Science template by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; I added my autocorrect entries
 and when exiting Word I saved the Science template.&nbsp; Again, I double-clicked the Science template in Windows Explorer and my autocorrect entries were all there.&nbsp; So far, so good.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I decided to try a few experiments to verify that the entries were actually stored with the Science template, and I have been unable to get that confirmation.&nbsp; Every time I end up with the autocorrect entries available when the Science template does not
 appear to be loaded, or in my effort to remove the entries from the Normal template they end up being removed from the Science template as well.&nbsp; So, either I am doing something wrong, or autocorrect entries cannot be saved to custom templates as I would prefer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way in Word 2013 to save autocorrect entries to a custom template and make them available only in documents based on that template?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any information that you can offer!</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            There are two kinds of AutoCorrect entries, "Plain text" and "Formatted text", indicated by the option buttons in the dialog:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c789ad2-ccb8-495b-ae6b-e5e386b990b9" /><br />
<br />
The formatted ones are stored in the Normal.dotm template (regardless of what template you have open). The plain text ones are stored in MSO*.ACL files, where the MSO is followed by a numerical language identifier, depending on the proofing language applied
 to the text when the entry was created. In neither case are the entries stored in your custom template.<br />
<br />
There's more detailed information in <a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Customization/ExportAutocorrect.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Customization/ExportAutocorrect.htm</a>. Although the article is very old, most of it is still accurate.<br />
<br />
The sort of classification you want might be available with the AutoCorrect manager offered at
<a href="http://www.clockworksoftware.com.au/Products/AutoCorrectManager.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.clockworksoftware.com.au/Products/AutoCorrectManager.aspx</a>. I haven't used it, so I don't know how easy it might be.<br />

<p>What's wrong with your Autocorrect which works just&nbsp;exemplary and I've tweaked just a little. I just checked this out and IMHO it is dismissal. Did you know that in Australia we use ACN or can if you use default autocorrect - well golly gosh in the legal
 world we actually use ABN in Australia these days - fancy that! </p>
<p>It slightly irritates me that those with no experience put&nbsp;such&nbsp;rubbish&nbsp;together. We can all resave our templates in the ACL language and one needs to be creative with names having&nbsp;2&nbsp;or more&nbsp;acronyms for one definition is more confusing that having useful
 acronyms:</p>

<br />
The kind of by-template customization you want is available for AutoText (Building Blocks) but not for AutoCorrect.
<br />
<br />
I have not tried the commercial product that Jay linked to. I have used the AutoCorrect utilities offered on the MVP site and on Jay's site
<font>(<a href="http://jay-freedman.info/AutoCorrect2007.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">utility for Word 2007 - 2013</a>) and they work fine, but do not tie AC entries to the attached template.</font> These utilites would allow you to edit your AC lists for a particular
 project, but those edits would be for Office as a whole, not simply one document or template.<br />

The OP wants AutoCorrect that works only in documents attached to a particular template.&nbsp; Jay's addin does not do that. The commercial product does not do that either but is apparently set up to load/unload different AC sets through an interface. Jay's utility
 will let you do the same thing but you have to understand what it is you are donig.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what ACN and ABN refer to.<br />

            <p>Hi Charles, I thought it was a messy product.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If one sets up autocorrect properly there is no need to load/unload. In order to make autocorrect useful the user has to be able to use it and know the naming conventions&nbsp;- so while you may have a base autocorrect setup a user can add their own entries as
 they like and all that is needed is to back it up and Jay's utility does just that. It really is a user's autocorrect to which I can make available a base configuration that they can add to, backup, delete and reload the backup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ACN and ABN are company numbers issued in Australia he refers to ACN because of Word's autocorrect pre-packaged entries. In Autocorrect Word's out of the box list has acn turns into can and roman i turns into I. I always delete the base autocorrect with
 my utility and replace with my own list which is done with Jay's utility which I have tweaked a little. Quick and simple.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The answer to the OPs question is "no". If you can't create a purposeful autocorrect with formatted and non formatted entries then get someone who can.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think of Word as a tool Charles that works quickly and simply when configured properly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And as you have stated Charles Autotext and the Building Block categories are quite able to achieve this. His Building Block entries can be attached to the template that would be efficient and simple.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thank you for providing the first article which explains the structure of the ACL entries. My difficulty is due to the linkage of the ACL entry to the proofing language code at the time of entry.</p>

    <title>After hard reset of Lumia 950, The Groove and Movies &#38; TV apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johndotkay  say:</h3>
<h2>            After hard reset of Lumia 950, The Groove and Movies &#38; TV apps won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>I had been having issues with Continuum connecting to a wireless display that I finally solved by doing a hard reset/reinstall of my phone. That is all now working, but since the reinstall the Groove and Movies &amp; TV apps (that were previously working fine)
 now won't reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The store shows I own both products, however when the apps try to install, they start the download, squire the license, then display "downloading..." followed shortly afterwards by "Error, see details". When I click on that, it goes through the same sequence
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only happening with Groove and Movies &amp; TV. Everything else reinstalled correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A hard reset doesn't fix this - I have done that twice now with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP? I'd really like to be able to play my music and use the Groove subscription I have paid for on my phone!</p>

            <p>A phone reset uses stored operating system on the phone to reinstall. The Windows Device Recovery Tool downloads the operating system. Use the WDRT.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for my emails that is synced through hotmail, the time stamp when i receive them is a 3 hour time difference from my phone. i checked my hotmail account on the computer and i set it to the correct time zone and my phone is set to the correct
 time zone also, i dont know why the emails it self would be marked as with a different time stamp though. also any solutions?</p>

            In regards to your reminders not firing, it sounds to me like an issue with the notification queue in your device.&nbsp; There are probably duplicate and/or erroneous notifications that are clogging up the notification queue.&nbsp; You'll need to review the notification
 queue and delete the ones that should not be there.&nbsp; I've written an article about this issue that you may find useful:<br />

                    The narratives in prior years don't work. &nbsp;Never did. &nbsp;But we will try again.&nbsp;Word 2016 in Table of Contents bolds the paragraph number but not the text. &nbsp;How do I unbold the paragraph number. &nbsp;You can try style for TOC 2 and modify all to be unbold. &nbsp;You
 can go to references TOC and custom, and modify level 2 to unbold and select color as black. &nbsp;You can manually go thru the TOC and unbold the paragraphs. &nbsp;In the document you can highlight the assigned paragraph numbers and select unbold....none of this works.....

            Based on your description, bold formatting has been applied to the paragraph number itself, for example in the Multilevel List dialog box. Open the dialog box and have a look at the settings.

<h2>            Plotting multiple data tables of respective X and Y data points in one Scatter Plot</h2>
                    I have nine tables of data from a engineering lab.&nbsp; I need to take all nine tables and plot them in one Scatter Plot Graph.&nbsp; For each table, the first row corresponds to the X-values and the second corresponds to the respective Y-values.&nbsp; However, I am
 only able to plot one table at a time, and when I do, the data is plotted wrong.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Excel will only plot the Y-values against their respective Row Numbers, not against their respective X-values.&nbsp; I have tried to go into "Select Data", and put the first row data into the X-values and the second row data into the Y-values, but either nothing
 will happen or Excel will once again plot only the Y-values against Row Number.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How do I get Excel to plot one set of table data as X-values against a second table set of respective Y-values?&nbsp; And second, how do I take this and combine multiple table sets into one graph?

            I just now constructed an XY Scatter chart with two separate data series using Excel for Mac 2011 update 14.2.4.
<br />
<br />
The usual method is to create the Scatter chart with one data series (X and Y values) and then in the Select Data Source dialog box click Add to specify another data series (using the range edit boxes for X values and Y values).
<br />
<br />
Check to be sure you are using the Scatter chart type.<br />

</span></p><p><span>Outlook.com no longer offers support for <strong>custom domain management</strong>. To manage custom domains, use Office&nbsp;365, the premium online service from Microsoft, which includes enterprise-class mail, collaboration and communication tools.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Windows Live Admin Center</strong> and the domains.live.com website were retired in July 2014. Custom domain administrators can no longer use Windows Live Admin Center to add or remove email accounts in your domain. Custom domain account holders
 can continue to use Outlook.com and other Microsoft services with their existing email accounts unless the MX records have changed.. No data has been lost.</span></p>
