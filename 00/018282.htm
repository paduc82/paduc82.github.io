<h2>            Teaching Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>I would like to offer some basic skills classes - mainly to retirees and anyone else who may need to have a basic skill set for Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to offer skills training in Word, Excel, and OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any certifications that would be required by Microsoft in order to teach these classes on a personal level? &nbsp;My ultimate goal is to teach these classes in a clubhouse for condo associations or other various locations in my community. &nbsp;Participants
 in the classes ideally would be bringing their own personal laptop to learn the skills, however I plan to have a small bank of laptops that will be available for those users that only have a desktop computer at their disposal. &nbsp;Each computer used will have
 its own licensed version of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This project is in the beginning stages, and I wanted to first make sure that I would not be infringing upon any licensing regulations that are held by Microsoft in order to offer these classes. &nbsp;My next step will be to check with my local jurisdictions
 to inquiry about any required licensing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a background user, I have over 20 years experience in using Microsoft products, and am currently enrolled as a degree seeking student in the IT field where I have had to take classes on the Microsoft products.</p>

            <p>I am not aware of any requirements for teaching the use of any Microsoft programs--certainly&nbsp;none imposed by Microsoft. I have taught (free) Word classes at the local public library, and no one ever asked about my qualifications or certifications. It might
 be that students would be reassured by some kind of certification, but I suspect if you're marketing your skills to retirees, you won't get much pushback, especially if you are offering the classes free. You didn't say whether you plan to charge, but even
 if you do, you might start by offering free classes to build up some word-of-mouth reputation, then start charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're wise to check with local jurisdictions, but again I suspect you'll find there are no requirements. In my town, in addition to Continuing Education classes offered by the university, there is the Eastern Shore Institute of Lifelong Learning (ESILL),
 which offers classes provided by pretty much anyone who wants to teach something (everything from literature, foreign languages,&nbsp;and music to various kinds of crafts). There is a charge for these classes, and computer-related classes are very popular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure you realize that, if your students bring your own laptops, you'll need to be able to teach a variety of versions of Office. Those with new laptops will have the latest version, whereas those with older models may have almost anything. As long as
 they all have at least Word 2007, they'll be pretty much on the same page, but if some have Word 2003 or earlier, you'll have a much harder task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also find, if you are teaching basic skills, that your students need to be taught basic Windows/computer skills as well. When I was teaching Word, I stipulated as a prerequisite that students have completed the library's basic computer class, but
 I found that many of them were very clumsy with a mouse (and I'm hopeless with a touchpad, which didn't help) and ignorant of the Microsoft terms for Windows elements (window, toolbar, menu, radio button, check box, etc.). Given that most of the students were
 retirees, you'd think they might have had some typewriter experience, but I had one who had never used the Shift key and didn't know where to find it (he had apparently just been toggling CapsLock when he needed a capital letter and was quite unable to use
 any of the other shifted characters).</p>

</p><p>For me both of those formula return the number 42404 and when I format that as a date I get the date of 4 Feb 2016</p>

</p><p>If you have a properly formatted date in B5 then it should do the same for you. See the snip.</p>

            <p>I'm guessing that the answer to that question is no. A monitor or a TV will work fine (I tried it last night on my TV and was quite impressed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I say that is because you need to plug the adapter in and the welcome screen from the adapter needs to appear and as far as I know there is no way to have that occur on your Surface</p>

    <title>Unable to save changes in existing Excel files on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen gerrard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to save changes in existing Excel files on Mac</h2>
                    <p>We have a number of Excel log files on our network share that are accessed by a whole team working on MAC and PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is one of the MACs cannot overwrite/update those excel logs in this folder - Unable to save to this location as file with the same name already exists- please save to a different location or rename the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when we try to save, excell appends on a string of alphanumerical to the name of said file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can save as original name to local device and then move file to share drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could impact workflow, meaning the file transferred to the share drive file could overwrite a more up-to-date copy of said file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated above, this is only affecting one of the devices with access to this folder, nothing has been changed in the device or its&nbsp; permission settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing the experience with us.</p>
<p>Since the issue only happens to a specific Mac, you may try following to check the outcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Ensure the Office is up to date. Click Help&gt;Check for Updates. Now the latest version is 16.26(19060901).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Compare the differences between the affected Mac and working Mac, see if there is any program only the affected Mac has.</p>
<p>(For example, antivirus program. You may receive an error message because some antivirus programs quickly scan any new files that appear on a computer. This scan can sometimes disrupt the Excel save process. This interruption may stop Excel from saving the
 file correctly.). </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3.Try </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>reboot the affected Mac in safe mode</span></a><span> and see if the error message appears when saving changes in the existing files.</span></p>

<p>Excel is designed for sharing on OneDrive and SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a file system (Windows, Mac OS, OneDrive, Google, etc) then characteristics of the particular file system you are using come into play.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your particular situation, it sounds like permissions are not properly set to allow Excel to read and write to all the locations it expects to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a description of how Word makes and uses temporary files. Excel also makes temporary files.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately that is not possible as the file needs to be accessed and updated by a vast majority of the company and can be updated a couple of time a minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the MAC's in use were setup by my predecessor and nothing has changed in the config for the IT management of these devices or the permissions to access the Share drive, only this one machine has started to give errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read a post where you suggested to boot MAC into recovery/safe mode and reset permissions but I cannot seem to find it again, any chance you have the link to it and I'll try see if it works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response by the way.</p>

<p>Though I'm not sure about the post you read about "boot MAC into recovery/safe mode and reset permissions", you may also refer to these articles and see if they are helpful for you:</p>

    <title>No response when I click add attachments paperclip icon - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No response when I click add attachments paperclip icon</h2>
                    <p>I have been created an email address at work. When I open the email service "microsoft outlook web app" is in the top left corner.</p>
<p>I can receive and open attachments that have been sent to me.</p>
<p>I can not however add attachments. There is a "add attachments" paper clip icon on the tool bar when I create a new email but whenever I click on it nothing happens. This is also true of the add picture icon. I read on another thread that clearing cache
 etc might help and have tried this and it didn't.</p>
<p>I currently use google chrome and have 2 other email accounts through gmail and I can add attachments on both these accounts on this computer. I do not have access to another computer to see if this account works on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/advice gladly received.</p>

    <title>Paste Special Causing Workbook Corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael miller &#40;michaelm&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paste Special Causing Workbook Corruption</h2>
                    My company is in the process of changing to Office 365, and one of my users has run into an Excel issue that I can't seem to overcome.<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
User exports a report to Excel from our accounting software. &nbsp;The spreadsheet contains several columns that has numbers set as text. &nbsp;The user's solution to this is to multiply the spreadsheet by 1 and convert the cells and text to numbers. This is a<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/convert-numbers-stored-as-text-to-numbers-40105f2a-fe79-4477-a171-c5bad0f0a885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/convert-numbers-stored-as-text-to-numbers-40105f2a-fe79-4477-a171-c5bad0f0a885">
 Microsoft </a>solution, although, I had never seen it used before. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem is that once the file is saved and reopened Excel reports that the workbook is corrupt and needs to be repaired. &nbsp;The repaired book has removed all of the letters from the spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
Diagnostics:<br />
<br />
Is replicated with several different reports and multiple computers<br />
Does not occur with Office 2013 Pro Plus or 2016 Pro Plus (even on systems that crash with 365)<br />
No error messages in Event Viewer<br />
All Windows, driver, and Office updates have been applied<br />
Office has been reinstalled <br />
Excel cache and all temp folders have been cleaned out<br />
<br />
The first option in the link to use the text to columns function, but one of the columns uses a merged cell so it won't work for the entire spreadsheet.

<p>Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Thank you for all the completed information you provided.<br />
I tried to convert my text numbers by multiply by 1 using Paste Special in office 365 Business but it seems did not convert my text to numbers.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75de3e88-1759-4a90-882f-35ea11466801?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75de3e88-1759-4a90-882f-35ea11466801?upload=true" /></a></p>
So could please share the steps how to multiply the spreadsheet by 1 and convert text to numbers?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are the same steps I am taking.&nbsp; The program he is using exports the numbers as text, so the cells show the small green error triangles at the top corner.&nbsp; You can see the difference by setting your test cells to x.xx and then multiply those numbers
 by one.&nbsp; </p>

I tested here, when I copy the text-number to a new sheet, and I click them, the &nbsp;small green error triangles at the top corner shows up, when I hover, it let me choose to fix the cell and convert to numbers.<br />

<p>Thanks for checking that and I am able to get that to work.&nbsp; However, with some of the larger workbooks this solution adds several minutes to a job that would otherwise take 30 seconds.&nbsp; Would you care to try the paste special operation and see if that causes
 your test book to corrupt as well?&nbsp; Assuming that you are using Office 365.</p>

<p>Hi Micheal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all my test in Office 365, and the data I use to test only has one sheet. As you metioned, if your file has huge amount of data, when you process in Excel, might cause some problems. If it possible, could you share your file with me to test here through

            Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
I tried to paste the original date to tables full of 1s and 1.00s, and that erased all the letters after pasting. Then I tried to paste the 1s and 1.00s to original data. Regrettably I got same outcome like you did. So this can not be a solution anymore, unless
 you use Office ProPlus again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you just want to convert the text to numbers, you could just select the whole table, and set the Number Format to General. That will make all the numbers calculatable. Hope this could help.

<p>Hey Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still looking for solutions that will not take as much time as the other options.&nbsp; I contacted O365 support they referred me to here; luckily I was able to point them to this thread, but they want me to escalate to the paid support.&nbsp; I may have to&nbsp; switch
 this user off of the subscriber office and to an OEM version, as I don't know if the paid support would have any more answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

Is this something that needs to be fixed? Should I allow the installer to continue installing the update? The file name of the install package that is going to be installed is 47be10f.msi. There is also a reference to another file named ultimaterww.msi. Does
 anyone know what these packages install?</p>

<h2>            How do I update a Word document with data from a cell from Excel&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Word document that I would like to update with data from a cell in my Excel document. Is it possible to do this and have the data update in my Word document whenever there's a change to the cells in my Excel document? I've searched around and tried
 several things but I can't seem to get it to work correctly. I've tried Paste&gt;Paste Special&gt;Paste Link and tried all 7 of the formats and the data from the Excel cell will paste but doesn't update when I change the data in the Excel cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>James</p>

<p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the answer:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Are there any issues with regard to student use (or misuse) that we need to be aware of?</span></p>
<p>No, these users assigned Office 365 Education license can use the Teams normally. The license looks like: Education, Education Plus and Education E5, as well as existing Education E3 suites.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Is it possible for students to create teams without a teacher?</span></p>
<p>No. Each team should be as a classroom, and teacher as owner of this team. So, teacher can assign and review work and create channels and files. For detailed information, please see:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ae/help/4022018/microsoft-education-create-team-for-classes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a team for classes in Microsoft Teams</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">How do you monitor for bullying and harassment?</span></p>
<p>Based on my experience, there is no direct way to monitor this situation. However, you may let admin turn on the Multi-Factor Authentication to make sure the account security. Meanwhile, you can get some information from the audit log search, like who created
 a team, added channels etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Anything else that we need to be aware of?</span></p>
<p>Maybe you need know the<span style="font-weight: bold"> FAQs</span> in the link below:</p>

            Hi Terry, 
<br />Do you have access to the hacked account? If so, you can export the notebooks in onenote.com and import them in the new account. (You need to use a desktop computer to do this). 
<br />
<br />If you no longer have access to the old account, are the only copies of the notebook on the ipad? If they are in the desktop app, you may be able to move them to a notebook in the new location, although onenote may want you logged into both accounts.

<br />What is the error?

<br />I was able to connect a second OneDrive account, create a new notebook in that account, select several pages and move them to the new notebook... but I have full access to the first notebook. You might have problems since the notebooks aren't synced - it might work to Copy, not move.

            If you require that type of solution you will have to use a different service as it would be incompatible with Skype's service and topology. &nbsp;Skype has been transitioning from peer to peer over to a cloud-based service. &nbsp;The cloud-based service along with
 signing onto the service requires WAN connectivity

    <title>Excel&#58; Use button to hide&#47;unhide rows based on cell value. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve averbach  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel&#58; Use button to hide&#47;unhide rows based on cell value. Change&#47;toggle button name.</h2>
                    <p>After almost four hours of trying to cobble together my own solution (I obviously have failed), I'm turning to the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario: a worksheet used to track cost-saving actions includes plan and actuals. The value in Column G is either "Plan" or "Actual". The first "Plan" row is Row 11 (and then every other row is a plan row). I'd like to enhance the worksheet where:</p>
<p>- the default view does not show the plan rows</p>
<p>- a button above Column G is named "Show Plan"</p>
<p>- when the user clicks the "Show Plan" button, the plan rows (11, 13, 15,...) appear AND the button name changes to "Hide Plan."</p>
<p>- -when the user clicks the "Hide Plan" button, the plan rows (11, 13, 15,...) are hidden AND the button name changes to "Show Plan."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your guidance</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Go to the 'developer' tab and click on 'Insert' and then click the command button icon in the
<strong>ActiveX </strong>toolbox. On the worksheet hold down the left mouse button and drag to draw a button on the sheet in the appropriate place. Right click the button and view code and paste the code below into the editor. Back on the worksheet click the
 button and the rows will either hide or unhide depending upon the current state and the button caption will change to the correct one.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Mike, for responding so quickly! If I had another four hours, I still wouldn't have arrived at the solution on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The button works as expected (i.e., it hides/unhides the "Plan" rows); however, the button name does not appear on the button (neither "Show Plan" nor "Hide Plan"), leading me to wonder what I did wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I suspect has happened is that the command button you've put on the worksheet isn't called CommandButton1, it's something else. The name of your command button can be found in the code shown in bold below. If it isn't commandbutton1 then change the
 name in the code; also in bold italics to the correct name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub <strong>CommandButton1</strong>_Click()<br />
Dim x As Long, LastRow As Long<br />
LastRow = Cells.Find(What:="*", After:=[A1], _<br />
SearchOrder:=xlByRows, _<br />
SearchDirection:=xlPrevious).Row<br />
For x = 11 To LastRow Step 2<br />
Rows(x).Hidden = Not Rows(x).Hidden<br />
Next<br />
If Rows(11).Hidden Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>CommandButton1</strong></em>.Caption = "Show Plan"<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>CommandButton1</strong></em>.Caption = "Hide Plan"<br />

            <p>Hi, Mike.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to make a private tutorial public, but I hope this helps others. And I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there somewhere else I need to assign the button name. (By the way, I changed "11" to "13" in the script because I moved the first Plan row to Row 13. If the original "x=11" wasn't meant to indicate &nbsp;the first Plan row, let me know.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hello GarySanchez1. I would use the ROW function in Excel for this. The Row function simply shows what row you are in. Examples: If I'm in B6, =Row() will return 6. If I'm in D15, =Row() will return 15. One screenshot attached to help. Thank you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93e3ec15-a12b-4e65-bdde-2ec2bcf9a61d?upload=true" />

<h2>            Cannot Set Flag to Completed State in Emails</h2>
                    <p>I recently just purchased a Lumina 940XL. I have the OS Build 10.0.10586.29 installed. I am still learning many of the new features, but it appears that on this OS version I have lost the ability to set a flag on an email and or a calendar appointment invitation
 to the state of being completed.&nbsp; I can toggle it on or off just fine. I have been using&nbsp;this feature for many years and it would be nice if someone can explain to me how to use it or if Microsoft brings it back.</p>

            <p>On older devices such as Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 Phones, do have the option. I am using a Windows 10 phone. There is no option to complete under the ellipse (<em>three dots</em>)</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Mark as unread</li><li>Set flag</li><li>Move</li><li>Archive</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on Set flag toggles the state between flagged and no flag. There is a third state supported by Microsoft Exchange and it is completed. This option has been available on all prior Windows Phone OS releases but does not seem to be a current feature
 of the OS version OS Build 10.0.10586.29 as I listed above.</p>

            <p>Respectfully this feature <strong>IS</strong> in Outlook Proper. It is a current feature of Microsoft Outlook 2013, 2016, Microsoft Exchange 2013 and a feature of the Office 365 Web interface. Organizing email into folders has nothing to do with my request/statement.
 If I want a workaround, I will jump on a computer and mark the email completed and then perhaps move it into another folder.

<h2>            Another case of incoming email blocked by O365 but no record in Exchange logs</h2>
                    
<p>Since moving to O365 a couple of years ago I've had a number of cases of blocked email from certain senders.</p>
<p>Recently when using a large UK online electrical retailer (ao.com) I found none of their emails would arrive at my O365 inbox. &nbsp;There is no record in quarantine or message trace. &nbsp;So I was forced to switch to a back up email account with another provider
 and emails arrived as expected.</p>
<p>It's not acceptable that emails are rejected without any way to know this has happened. &nbsp;When I've asked before I was told this is because the filtering occurs ahead of our O365 account, but its making O365 unreliable.</p>
<p>So are there any plans to improve visibility and control of what is filtered in this way?</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>It's true that Exchange Online Protection will filter emails before they are delivered to users' mailboxes in Office 365. But if a message is blocked by EOP, normally a non-delivery report (NDRs) with some information will be generated and sent to the sender.
 Then the sender can check whether they can make any improvement to pass EOP filtering. In this case, usually an entry should be recorded and can be checked in message trace.</p>
<p>So I would like to confirm whether the senders get NDRs. If yes, please go to <b>
your details &gt; Private messages</b> to reply to my PM and share a copy of the NDRs with me. By checking the NDR, we can identify whether the messages have reached Office 365 or why they are blocked.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang</p>

<p>I don't have NDRs for the missing emails as they were sent by the e-commerce system for the supplier. &nbsp;I know they failed as &nbsp;using my O365 email address I never received any new account registration emails etc. &nbsp; As for the message trace there are no records
 on anything being rejected when I run a report..</p>
<p>The only possible evidence in O365 is the &nbsp;Spam detections graph shows a number of IP blocked entries on those days. &nbsp;I cannot know if they're the emails in question though.</p>

<p>Sounds like an spf issue. Do you know if the incoming emails are sent using your domain? Something like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Seems unlikely but has to be ruled out first.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>As Henry mentioned, by checking the NDR, we can identify whether the messages have reached Office 365 or why they are blocked. Since the missing emails are&nbsp;not delivered to Office 365, and the sender side server canâ€™t establish the connection with Office
 365, there is no resource for us to troubleshoot this issue. Hence, I suggest you contact the sender side to verify this issue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can try to add the sender IP address to Office 365. Please refer to the following steps:<br />
1. Sign in to your portal (<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/</a> ), then click admin -&gt; Exchange.<br />
2. Click protection -&gt; connection filter.<br />
3. Select and double click Default.<br />
4. Click Connection Filtering in the new window.<br />
5. Click â€œ+â€ to add the sender IP address in the IP Allow list.<br />
6. Click Save.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Gary</p>

<p>The emails were all sent from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". &nbsp; </p>
<p>The problem is I've had this type of issue with a number of different senders and that's just the ones I am aware of.
</p>
<p>In each case I've switched to using my Pobox account or Gmail and immediately start getting the emails. &nbsp;So whatever filtering MS are doing its more aggressive than those. &nbsp;I have a high level of spam filtering on the Pobox account especially and yet no
 such issues.</p>
<p>I regularly see other emails dropped in the filtering graph but no records of what they are and some of those could be potential clients.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>If there is no record in message trace , it means the message never being delivered/â€touchedâ€ to Office 365 server. If this is the case, we can do nothing on Office 365 side.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you can provide more details about Office 365 rejecting the message like an NDR, we can do more further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>I am stuck then as all recent emails that I know were reject came from large organisations where I cannot simply phone them up and ask it their IT team can happen to find NDRs or emails sent to me by their automated systems.</p>
<p>So as before its the same answer of these being &nbsp;filtered/rejected by MS systems ahead of O365 and that means there's nothing I can do. &nbsp;GMail, FastMail, Pobox all manage to receive these emails. &nbsp;Using my general O365 email address also fails so its also
 not specific to my domain based email address.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>I have read through the thread and I understand your situation. However, as you mentioned above, the corresponding message cannot be traced via a message trace. Given the situation, we need to collect the NDR message to check and diagnose the issue. Otherwise,
 we may not be able to move forward on this case from our side. Your understanding will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is the only effective way to do it in <em>any </em>version of Word.
</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://shaunakelly.com/word/templates/attachtemplate.html?p=2207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What happens when I attach a new template to my document? or How do I copy content and settings from a template to a document? by Shauna Kelly MVP</a>&nbsp;The key is
 what templates do and how they act in Word. <em>Attaching </em>your template in the Windows version or the Mac version will
<em>not&nbsp;</em>give you any of the following from the template: </p>
<ol>
<li>Headers or Footers</li><li>a table or other <em>text </em>anywhere in the file </li><li>Page numbers</li><li>Margins</li><li>Page Orientation</li><li>Columns</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>None of those come to the existing document by attaching the template. I ask you to look at my web page on templates, written for the Windows version, which details what you get by attaching a template to an existing document.&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>You can import by attaching:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Macros</li><li>AutoText (and in Windows versions, building blocks)</li><li>Keyboard shortcuts</li><li>Toolbar or QAT modifications</li><li>Styles </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This has been true since Word 3 on the Macintosh and Word 97 on Windows.</strong><br />
It likely was true before that, but I am speaking only to my own experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe there are programs where you can attach what that program calls a template and get the results you want. Those programs are not Word. In PowerPoint or Publisher, I believe there are ways to change the layout by changing the master slide or template.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I do not speak for Microsoft, I am not a MS employee. I am a fellow user. If you choose to rate my responses to you, please rate them on their completeness and correctness, not on what you think Microsoft should do.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can certainly suggest this to Microsoft using UserVoice, I would be amazed if they would&nbsp; change how applying a template acts. It would require a complete rewrite of the program and cause all sorts of other programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, creating a new document based on the template, pasting in content and saving, is not that onerous a procedure.</p>

<h2>            OneNote error - Sorry, we can&#39;t seem to get your notebooks right now.</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office365 access from work. I use a MacBook Air. I am trying to create my first OneNote notebook but am getting an error on onenote.com (see below). I am also unable to create any new notebook in the OneNote application - it doesn't give me an
 option of Where to save the notebook and I am unable to create. Is it possible to save to the desktop instead to avoid these sync issues?</p>

<p>Hi Steph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing the detailed information. </p>
<p>As I mentioned before, to create notebooks in OneNote for Mac, it is required to save notebooks in online location: OneDrive for business or personal OneDrive. Since you have an Office 365 account, I suggest you firstly check if you can access OneDrive for
 business on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the first screenshot, you only have Office desktop application license. </p>
<p>However, to be able to use OneDrive for business, you will need SharePoint Online license (OneDrive for business is a site for personal use.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second screenshot you shared, it is not your OneDrive for business page.
</p>
<p><span>To check if you can access your OneDrive for business, I suggest you </span>
<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>sign in Office 365 portal</span></a><span>, then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OneDrive</span><span> from App Launcher. </span>
<span>Or please directly try accessing this URL </span><a href="https://portal.office.com/onedrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://portal.office.com/onedrive</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>OneDrive page should be like following:</span></p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc06e27e-8028-4da2-97b0-48d3c1b9fa4a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc06e27e-8028-4da2-97b0-48d3c1b9fa4a?upload=true" /></a>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you cannot access OneDrive for business page, it means you do not have SharePoint Online license. Therefore I suggest you contact your Office 365 admin to get the license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to access OneDrive for business page, feel free to post back and I will help you do further troubleshooting for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h2>            Syc Incomplete</h2>
                    I have been using Myphone to back up all my contacts, Calender and Text Messages and found that not all the data have been synchronized. E.g I have 696 names in my device contact list but after syncing with Myphone, I notice that there are only 690 names
 (56 missing ) in Myphone website's contact list ; I tried to check through all and see what was missing but found that the contact name list in my device is sorted by the last name, while Myphone list is sorted by First name. ... its frustrating!

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I am having the same problem as celestepreorius above. When I open Microsoft Office a banner comes up and says "Updates for Office are ready to be applied, but are blocked by one or more apps." Then there is a sign that is next to it that says update now.
 After clicking it a window comes up that say that you first have to close out of all Microsoft applications to update. After closing out of the applications a orange icon comes on my toolbar and upon clicking on it this pops up "Something went wrong. We're
 sorry, we ran into problem while updating Office. Please try again after restarting your computer. If you continue to experience problems, repair Office from 'Programs and Features' in the control panel. Go online for additional help. Error code 30169-26"
 When I went to my control panel there was not the option to fix office which is why I am on here. Hopefully this was enough information for you to help me. Thanks in advance.</p>
