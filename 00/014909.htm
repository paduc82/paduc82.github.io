    <title>stop contact birthdays from being entered in calendar with reminder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            stop contact birthdays from being entered in calendar with reminder active</h2>
                    
<p>options&gt; reminders are not checked to be set. yet outlook insists on setting birthdays in calendar with 0 minutes reminders.&nbsp;&nbsp; how can i get outlook to obey its own settings, or better, not automatically put information (ie birthdays) from contacts into
 the calendar?&nbsp; this current behavior results in unwanted reminders popping up on my desktop and beeping in the pda, as well as duplicated entries.&nbsp; really bad design.</p>
<p>is there not a registry setting to turn off these features/bugs?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>jeffrey</p>

            What PDA do you sync with? The usual cause of this is syncing with a pda.

<p>Hi diane, thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>i sync a palm E2,&nbsp; using Beyond Contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>outlook adds entries to the calendar, with the reminder active (0 minutes). there is no doubt about this.&nbsp; again, options&gt;calendar&gt;default reminder is not checked.</p>
<p>i am sure that there some interaction with syncing, since the double entries come after syncing, sometimes, not all the time, and not always for all birthdays/anniversaries.</p>
<p>i don't want reminders active on b'days/anniversaries.&nbsp; i don't need the popups or pda beeping.</p>
<p>i have gone through the entire year deleting duplicates, more than once, finding sometimes that after a sync all entries on both desktop and pda are then gone, or again doubled.&nbsp; there may be a way to rectify this, eg by deleting all b'day/anniversary entries,
 and entering them manually (an awful amount of work to compensate for bad software design) but, if outlook will re-establish&nbsp; calendar entries with reminders active again anyway, there doesn't seem to be a solution.</p>
<p>i just don't see a way to coordinate this.&nbsp; all the blame shouldn't be placed on the sync. it isn't the sync that makes the reminders active.</p>

<p>i have played with the registry a bit, and found a place or two that influences the reminder settings.&nbsp; but i can't figure out how to force reminder to set to "None" within each new b'day rather than the current 0 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice on which registry key to use, or create, and what value to use to force "None"?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

<p>re: multiple entry issue: i tried deleting the multiple entries on desktop. reentering them manually, so that they weren't coming from the contact birthday field listing. i then deleted the BCcalendar folder on the palm, to get rid of the palm data. i then
 did a one way synch to the palm. reinstalled the beyond contacts program to palm and&nbsp; checked the palm entries. found 2 entries for some people. some were clearly the Outlook entered along with the one i entered (different format). while on the desktop the
 same date would show only one entry.&nbsp; clearly additional entries were hiding somewhere, and being entered only on the palm for certain dates.</p>
<p>a search on desktop revealed my entry, along with an Outlook entry from a year or more ago, with a recurrence period of 12 years . searches on other multiple entries showed the same thing, 12 year recurrences. how 1 year became 12 year on a number of entries,
 and not on others, i don't know. so, i am guessing that during the synch, current entries as well as those from 2 or more years ago, which were considered to be current because they had the 12 year period were also entered on the same date. deleting all of
 the 12 year recurrences, and doing another one way sync, seems to have eliminated the multiple entries. don't know for sure, since i haven't clicked through each day, only looked at a few of past problem dates. i've been through the year several times today.&nbsp;
 more than most people would have put up with.</p>
<p>i now know to not put any useful data in the Outlook notes field for any recurring calendar entry, since i may have to delete it some time in the future, if it gets corrupted, after outlook/sync screws it up.and search for past entries to explain double
 entries in the future.</p>
<p>there remains the issue of finding a registry hack to force outlook to not set 0 minute reminders for new birthday/anniversary entries.</p>

This is not outlook's problem - its the result of syncing and your pda is setting it. Outlook will not set 0 min reminders on its own (unless you have it configured for your default reminder time.)</p>

how about this - remove Beyond Contacts program and clear the palm, then see if the problem recurs.

<p>diane, thanks for the info.&nbsp; i downloaded and tried to install the update. it informed me that it was already installed. as for chapura update mentioned in the slipstick article, i am currently using palm 6.2 software, so that i can sync through bluetooth
 in win 7 64 bit., which has no mention of chapura anywhere that i can seen.</p>
<p>re: outlook and 0 min reminder. i go into a contact without a birthday set. i set a birthday .&nbsp; i then go to the calendar and check the birthday.&nbsp; set for recurrance with 0min reminder. no synchs, doesn't exist yet on palm since it wasn't synched.&nbsp; this
 is all within outlook.&nbsp; i could sent you a pic of the&nbsp; outlook&gt;tools&gt;options&gt;calendar&gt;reminder unchecked, but i don't see an easy way to do that here. i don't see any other explanation for it than something is screwed up in outlook. i should also mention that
 problem existed also when i was using OL07 in xp. this is a new installation of OL07.</p>

i believe that deleting the BCcalendar from the palm did remove that section of beyond contacts from the palm. before the next one way sync, it needed to re-install bc software, then did the one way sync.<br />

What is your default reminder set for? (screenshot: <a href="http://slipstick.me/jing/reminder_003.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://slipstick.me/jing/reminder_003.png</a>) I get 30 min with reminders off (my default) - i get 3 hours with it set to 3 hours, so it looks like reminder time is set based on the setting in that dialog, ignoring the on/off by default setting.

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From&nbsp; the issue description, I understand you are get German and French spell check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need better clarity on&nbsp;this issue so that we can proceed with the next step. Spell check differs based&nbsp;on the mediator how&nbsp;you are accessing the Outlook.com account. If you are accessing Outlook.com through Internet Explorer. You can check below article
 which will let you know how the spell check works in web based application;</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know how do you access Outlook.com? Is it through Office and Outlook 2016&nbsp;or Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spell check also differs if you are accessing through Office and Outlook&nbsp;mail client.

            I am accessing my outlook.com respectively hotmail.com&nbsp;using various browsers; mostly Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and occasionally Firefox.
<br />
I have not noticed any difference using these different browsers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I am not going through Office or Outlook 2016. The spell check for French and German works on these two programs.<br />
But&nbsp;I cannot access these two programs unless I use my own Windows 10 computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The question of course is why the French and German spell check works in my Windows 7 computer and not in my Windows 10 computer for outlook.com respectively Hotmail.com. Or to put it differently why do I not get a language choice when right clicking on an
 underlined&nbsp;spell checked word when writing e-mails.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks<br />
Hans

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said it was working fine in Windows 7. It seems you are referring to language pack for Windows 10. You need to install German and French&nbsp;language pack for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow this Microsoft article which talks about How to add an input language to your PC;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-add-an-input-language-to-your-pc#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-add-an-input-language-to-your-pc#v1h=tab01</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done installing the&nbsp;language you can use Windows key+space to operate the language.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thanks much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did download the French and German language packs when I first customized my new Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>Following the Settings &gt; Time Language &gt; Region Language trail to Add Language I receive confirmation that the German and French language packs have indeed been installed "French&nbsp;Language Pack Installed" "German Language Pack Installed".</p>
<p>When I click on e.g. German &gt; Options it allows me to change the Display Language to German, which is not what I want. I only want German spell check.</p>
<p>When I go to Default, it allows me to change my Key Board configuration to the German key board configuration. This is not what I want, because it messes up my typing, because I am not familiar with the German key board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same applies to French.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this happens on my Windows 7 laptop that just lets me change language when the English spell checker underlines a French or German word (typing messages in Outlook.com / Hotmail.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for the inconvenience&nbsp; caused to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are writing an email in Outlook.com and want spell check. It will work in based on the language what you are using while writing an email. For example- if you are writing an email in English , it will try to correct in English itself. If you write
 in German and French, you can give you the choices in German and French itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spell check works based on language what you use in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said it was working fine in Windows 7. We need to know how it used to work in Outlook.com through browser. If you were using the same browser in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned earlier spell check differs based on the browser. For Example: Google chrome has automatic spell checking built in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>It does not matter what browser I use to access Hotmail.com or Outlook.com or Gmail.com on my Windows 10 computer. Once I am typing a message in the E-Mail in e.g. German, the English spell check underlines every not English looking word as misspelled. When
 I right click on such "misspelled" words the drop down menu only offers me other English words to correct to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By contrast on my Windows 7 Computer, when I right click on such a "misspelled" word in my E-Mail program, I get a choice of language in the drop down menu, which then allows me to Switch the spell check to French or German.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I wrote before I did download the French and German language packs. They do allow me to Switch the Computer Display language to German or English and also allow me to Change my Computer key board to German or English, neither one I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am typing this text on my Windows 7 Computer, the German spell check is active changing known nouns to capital letters and underlining all not German looking words.</p>

            <p>Have you looked at the recordings I sent you? You may have seen when I write e-mails in Outlook.com or Hotmail.com and typing a French or German text, in Windows 7 and Windows 10 the spell checker underlines each French or German word. When right clicking
 on the underlined word, Windows 7 gives me a drop down menu, which allows me to change the spell check language. In Windows 10 I do not get this drop down menu when right clicking on the underlined word. This leaves me without French or German spell check
 and without French or German lettering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously downloaded the French and German language packs on Windows 10 computer. But it seems they do not come into play other than for changing the computer display language or French or German keyboard configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I stuck with no German and French e-mail spell check on my Windows 10 computer?</p>

<h2>            powerpoint advances to the next hidden slide</h2>
                    In office 2010, when I create a ppt and hide&nbsp;consecutive slides i have an issue where using n or p or the arrows I am able to navigate forward through my hidden slides instead of skipping to the next non hidden slide. This is not an issue until I am in
 a hidden slide because otherwise it does what it is suppose to, not view it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example: 1 slide, not hidden, 2-10 are hidden, 11 not hidden. using arrows i can go between slides 1 and 11 but nothing else, as soon as I use a hyperlink to get to any slide between 2-10 then i can use the arrows to see all hidden slides. if I go from
 slide 10 to 11 then I no longer can to hidden slides unless clicking a hyperlink.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background reason for this: creating a choose your own adventure story for students in which they choose the path the character takes. This doesn't really work if they can just use the arrows.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any suggestions.&nbsp;</div>

            This is a feature, not a bug. PowerPoint has always advanced from hidden slide to the next slide (hidden or not), but only to the next non-hidden slide from a non-hidden slide. You will have to use hyperlinks on each slide.<br />

            I have seen reports that a new bug has been introduced into Excel (I am not sure if it is&nbsp;version specific or not) that Select False fails to work unless at least two sheets are already selected. I cannot find anything from Microsoft about this, but I
 have seen several people acknowledge its existence.

            <p>Hi Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>yes, currentworkbook was previously defined</li><li>yes, it was actually Sheets(n).select (false), my post had some typo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>actually, situation goes as follow:</p>
<p>me, office 2013, macro file worked, works.</p>
<p>coleague A, office 2013, macro file worked, does not work now.</p>
<p>colleague B, office 2007, macro file worked, works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suspect if it is update related.</p>

    <title>Blurry text in Office 2008 products on my mac retina display, why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fbcpastorbrandon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blurry text in Office 2008 products on my mac retina display, why&#63;</h2>
                    I just purchased a new macbook pro with retina display. When I put my backed up version of office 2008 for mac on this computer all of the text is blurry in the interface and on what I type. The resolution for the other applications and computer itself
 is nice and crisp. It is only on office products that I am having the problem. When I try to run the updater for the office 2008 it says I have the latest version.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So my questions are, how do I correct this so my text appears normal? And if there is no solution, was this corrected for retina displays on the offce 2011 programs?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Hey Jeffrey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What application are you using to download this file? Assuming you're using a browser, try using another application to download the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like this error is being generated before you even reach the point of opening the file with Word. That being the case, there's not much we can do to help from the Office end. You might consider zipping the file and trying the download again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

 I print now, I first get 15 sheets of 'blank' labels and the last two sheets have the first address and the 31st address printed singularly on the first (top left) label on the 16th and 17th sheet respectively.&nbsp; Admittedly, I must have done something differently
 between the first print job and the next (three attempts), does anyone know how I can remedy this "blank pages" printing problem?&nbsp; Thanks...Earl

<p>The problem probably isn't the mouse.</p>
<p>Office 2003 doesn't work properly with the new aero display features in Vista and Seven</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this: Locate the PowerPNT.exe file (ProgramFiles\Microsoft Office\Office11 probably)</p>
<p>Right Click it and in Properties&gt;Compatability &gt;Disable DeskTop Composition</p>
<p>You will find that the theme will swap to Vista Basic when you open PPT but the problem should be eased.</p>

    <title>Strange Picture Behavior in Word 15.30 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artgoldberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange Picture Behavior in Word 15.30</h2>
                    <p>Pictures are no longer visible in a Word document I created last month, and they act strangely in new Word docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The month-old Word doc (WD) shows picture frames but not pictures. View -&gt; Print layout is set, as is Preferences - View - Show in Document - Drawings. If I grab the picture handle containing a circular arrow, &amp; rotate the picture it appears. When I let
 go, it disappears. PDF printouts show the pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new WD also shows invisible pictures. Grabbing the handle also makes the picture temporarily visible, but the picture has been rotated about a vertical axis. That is, it's a mirror image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These pictures are emfs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inserting a pdf into a new WD produces the behavior above of the old WD. Of course, pdfs are problematic in Word, because the resolution stinks when pdfs use transparency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Word for Mac 15.30 (170107). (It's unbelievable that MSFT doesn't realize that the About Word screen should support Copy.)</p>

            Hi ArtGoldberg,<br />
<br />
Please check the following option to narrow down the issue:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Click File&gt; Properties &gt; Summary. Tick the Save preview picture with this document option.&nbsp;<br />
2. Right click on the picture and select Format picture &gt; picture. Check if you format it correctly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to clarify the scenario and find the root cause, I would like to confirm the following details:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Do you insert the picture in the Word document via copying and pasting pictures or clicking Insert &gt; Picture?&nbsp;<br />
2. Does the issue occur on all Word documents?&nbsp;<br />
3. Could you share with us some screenshots about “The month-old Word doc (WD) shows picture frames but not pictures. ” and “the picture has been rotated about a vertical axis. That is, it's a mirror image.”?&nbsp;<br />
4. Could you share with us the problematic Word document with invisible pictures? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You could check and respond to it via

            <p>Hi Shirley</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re:</p>
<p><span>1. Click File&gt; Properties &gt; Summary. Tick the Save preview picture with this document option.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This was not selected.</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot reproduce this behavior. I don't know why, &amp; am not aware of any software change which would have changed it:</p>
<p>Pictures are no longer visible in a Word document I created last month, and they act strangely in new Word docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The month-old Word doc (WD) shows picture frames but not pictures. View -&gt; Print layout is set, as is Preferences - View - Show in Document - Drawings. If I grab the picture handle containing a circular arrow, &amp; rotate the picture it appears. When
 I let go, it disappears. PDF printouts show the pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new WD also shows invisible pictures. Grabbing the handle also makes the picture temporarily visible, but the picture has been rotated about a vertical axis. That is, it's a mirror image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have your attention, do you plan to fix these problems? If so when?:</p>
<p>The resolution stinks when pdfs use transparency.</p>
<p>The About Word screen should support Copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I insert an image in a new WD, it's rotated. Screenshots of the original emf and the emf inserted in a WD are in pngs (which this doesn't upload!) at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h14amlu1oh6ikyp/AAARSSRGSCPb8bpp4WbXlcK8a?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I don't have free time in which I can continue volunteering to help MSFT resolve these bugs.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Art,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't work for Microsoft, but I did peek at the screen shots. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In a different question regarding emf files John Korchak speculated that Office handles emf files poorly if they were generated in anything other than a one or two specific programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Smile button in Word to alert Microsoft that there is a problem with emf files made by Open Office. When you use the smile button the issue is brought to the attention of the Word team at Microsoft.

<h3> ialander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Decodes .WAV email attachment as all zero bytes</h2>
                    <p>We are experiencing an intermittent problem with Outlook receiving .WAV files which cannot be played when they are downloaded from the POP email. &nbsp;This probably happens to 3 out of 5 emails with voicemail attachments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same .WAV files function fine when accessed via webmail or downloaded directly out of the storage on the voicemail system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In comparing a working version and a 'broken' version of the file we have determined that when downloaded by outlook the broken file is somehow coming through as all 0 bytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not AV related as we have replicated the behavior on a PC with no AV installed as well as others with it disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a known issue based on the links below, has anyone found a solution?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running outlook Version 14.0.7173.5000, which I think is the most current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .WAV files are new, generated by our voicemail system. &nbsp;The problem is inconsistent, i can leave 3 test voicemails and after downloading into outlook 1 or more is usually corrupted and when I look at the file its all zero bytes.</p>
<p>

 &nbsp;The problem does not exist in Outlook 2007, that version is able to download attachments without damaging them.</p>

<p>As per our understanding you have already tried to reconfigure (uninstall and reinstall) Outlook 2010 and it did not work. Upgrading to latest version, which is Outlook 2016, is our last resort to resolve the issue.

<p>Hello DS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can perform a workaround by storing the files you wish to be viewed on your computer's local storage:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download the files from the AWS cloud.</li><li>Save files on your PC.</li><li>Open https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx on your preferred web browser.</li><li>Upload a document.</li></ol>
<p>For other options through AWS, you can contact their support for assistance.</p>

<p>I am asking again because I already tried the John Peltier's version and it will not work because I need to put specific values in after 100.&nbsp; Peltier, as far as I can get it, will only continue the values in the same succession.&nbsp; I need to cout by 5's to
 100 then by 100's.&nbsp; I can do this using pivot tables and charts but, I'm not to sure how.</p>
<p>How so I segment the "y" axis. I need specific "how to".&nbsp; I have to make my "y" axis look like this...</p>

<p>I am trying to chart individual production for oil wells (barrels per day). The values for my&nbsp;"y" axis need to reflect the production (like I have shown above) and the "x" axis reflects the months.&nbsp; Not all of the wells will chart between the 0-500 some
 never fall below 100 and some never above but, they will be on individual charts and the "y" axis and the "x" axis must be identical for all the chart inorder for them to be compared. I need help or a place where I&nbsp;can watch a tutorial; meaning step by step.</p>
<p>Please Help,</p>

<p>Mr. Liengme,</p>
<p>Is there anyway you can put a tutorial of how you did this on excel?&nbsp; Maybe, I'm over thinking it, but I still am not getting the result I need.&nbsp; I put the formula into the cells as you stated but, when I select the data I need to chart in a line graph I
 still get the same result.&nbsp; The "y" axis in default depending on the data, not what I'm putting in as values.&nbsp; I have no problem creating the values I want for the "x" axis but tremendous complications with the "y".&nbsp; I guess what I'm asking is can you "dummy"
 it down alittle further?</p>

<h2>            Extract data from the end of a cell</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a column of data that includes an address, phone number and email address for a contact, all in one cell. I want to extract just the email address from the text. Since the email addresses are all different sizes, I can't use a Right function on
 it's own, but I think that's the start. (They do not show up as hyperlinks, just text at the end of the cell data.) The consistent thing is that there is a space before each email address, and the email address is the last thing in the cell.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how I can extract just the email addresses?&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've looked through the posts, but not sure any met my needs.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any suggestions!</div>

            You seem to be having problems based on your data set up.&nbsp; I provide two VBA User Defined Functions, one of which should work.&nbsp; The first extracts from your original string, the first substring that "looks like" an email address.&nbsp; That is defined as a
 bunch of allowed characters, with an "@" in the middle, and with a termination of "dot" followed by 2 to 6 characters.<br />
<br />
The second function merely extracts the last "word" in the string, where words are delineated by spaces or their equivalents.<br />
<br />
To enter these User Defined Function (UDF), &lt;alt-F11&gt; opens the Visual Basic Editor.<br />
Ensure your project is highlighted in the Project Explorer window.<br />
Then, from the top menu, select Insert/Module and<br />
paste the code below into the window that opens.<br />
<br />
To use this User Defined Function (UDF), enter a formula like <br />
<br />
=EmailAddr(A1)&nbsp; or<br />
=LastWord(A1)<br />
<br />
in some cell.<br />
======================================<br />
Option Explicit<br />
Function EmailAddr(s As String) As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim re As Object, mc As Object<br />
Set re = CreateObject("vbscript.regexp")<br />
With re<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Pattern = "\b[A-Z0-9'._%+-]+@(?:[A-Z0-9-]+\.)+[A-Z]{2,6}\b"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ignorecase = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Global = True<br />
End With<br />
If re.test(s) = True Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set mc = re.Execute(s)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EmailAddr = mc(0)<br />
End If<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Function LastWord(s As String) As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim re As Object, mc As Object<br />
Set re = CreateObject("vbscript.regexp")<br />
With re<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Pattern = "[^\s\xA0]+"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Global = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .test(s) = True Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set mc = .Execute(s)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LastWord = mc(mc.Count - 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End With<br />
End Function<br />
