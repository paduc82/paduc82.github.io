<p>The formula in which I am using INDIRECT is&nbsp;=IF($J$2=INDIRECT(O2&amp;"!D2"),INDIRECT(O2&amp;"!E2"),)</p>
<p>The cell O2 contains 'Sheet Name'</p>

</p><p>I get no error message. The formula above appears in its cell as though it were text; none of the references have been resolved. Thank you for responding to this problem. The text strings in $J$2 and in 'Sheet Name'!B12 match, so I expect to see the contents
 of 'Sheet Name'!C12 in the cell which contains the formula.</p>

    <title>How do I completely UNINSTALL Office&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonmbehr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I completely UNINSTALL Office&#63;</h2>
                    OK, I&nbsp;have&nbsp;been having an issue with Outlook for over a month now, I have posted it in here and got only one reply and it did not work. So I tried something different today and found a new issue that might be related to my old issue....... The first issue
 I had was with sending e-mail, it just all of the sudden stopped, I could get all my mail but I could not send any. I called my service provider and my settings were all correct. Just out of the blue for no reason mail would no longer send and I made no changes
 or upgrades to anything.....&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But I am not here to talk about that as I have found a bigger issue that could be all in one, so let me tell you what I did.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Office 2010</div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<div>I uninstalled it from add and remove programs.</div>
<div>I went into program files and removed the Office folder (after having to rename a few files that would not delete and then reboot the computer).</div>
<div>I went into Program files (x86) and removed the office folder from there as well.</div>
<div>I used a program called RegZooka to clean the registry after the&nbsp;install. I rebooted.</div>
<div>I re-installed office from scratch and when it was done I launched&nbsp;Outlook. Only it never asked me for my profile info at all, it had it all already set and in place (how is that after I deleted it all and the folders?) And same issue, it pulled in my
 new mail but would not let me send any.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>REPEAT ALL STEPS TWICE - same result......</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>REPEAT one last time, only this time I installed Office 2007 (my old copy) and guess what? Yup. Same result, when I launched it it knew it was Jason Behr, even my contacts where already in the contacts folder. However the difference is, it is letting me
 send mail now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How is this possible, what am I not removing when I un-install it to make sure I get a clean install?</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            <p>Uninstalling - re-installing Office for the problem you are describing is a complete waste of time and serves no purpose since the information is contained in the Outlook profile which persists.</p>
<p>If you want to start "from scratch" in terms of setting up your email accounts etc - then simply use the &lt;Mail&gt; applet to create a new Outlook profile and make it the default

</p>
<p>As for the sending issue - there are any number of reasons that could cause that such as (but not limited to....)</p>
<p>- SMTP account no longer set to authenticate correctly<br />
- SMTP port change<br />
- trying to access your SMTP server from outside your E-ISP area which would require a different authentication method
<br />
- a PST file containing errors (if it's a POP3 account)<br />
- a corrupt Outlook profile<br />
..................</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mentioning a problem where you got a response that "did not work" without providing any details regarding that problem (i.e. at a minimum the URL link to the post for the original problem) - makes it very difficult to make any kind of assessment and counter-productive
 to make any assumptions. </p>
<p>As for "Just out of the blue for no reason mail would no longer send and I made no changes or upgrades to anything......." - unfortunately something did change, just may not be something that you are aware of&nbsp;so the question is "what changed"

            As stated I spoke with my service provider and all settings were correct (as far as SMTP and post changes and such), that was/is not the issue.
<div><br />
<div>I have gone into "Mail" and deleted my profile and re-created it, sorry I should have mentioned that in the first post. But it has been done, more than once. And still the issue persisted.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Just looking at the first post&nbsp;
<div>- you have iCould2 installed (if that's what was meant by "Outgoing messages are stuck") in the response to Diane - unclear if the answer to the actual question was yes or no<br />
- is Avast installed as an Outlook addin?<br />
<br />
<div>Original post also indicated that Outlook would not start in safe mode so begs the following questions</div>
<div><br />
<div>#1 - Actual message encountered in its entirety when trying to start Outlook in safe mode?</div>
<div>#2 - Type of email account involved (POP3, Exch, Imap, Mapi etc)?</div>
<div>#3 - If you do not have iCloud2 installed - do you sync with anything else (either mobile or with any other software app)?<br />
#4 - What other software was installed at the point that Outlook went from working to non-working? If none installed - which ones may have been automatically updated?</div>
<div>#5 - What other addins are installed (beyond those that are included with Outlook by default)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you open a message (or its status is somehow changed to "read") while in the Outbox - it must be "re-sent" or be deleted. No item will be sent automatically once its status has been changed to "read".</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you configure Outlook on another machine with the exact same settings - does the problem still exist?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want to completely start from scratch and ensure that the underlying Windows Messaging Sub-system doesn't have an issue (based on the description - seriously doubt that to be the case but.....). You should have a complete backup of your system as
 a normal standard precaution</div>
<div><br />
<div>#a - Uninstall any and all 3rd party Outlook addins<br />
<div>#b - Close Outlook &gt; click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Run</div>
<div>#c - Type regedit.exe into the Run window, press Enter</div>
<div>#d - Locate the following registry key (either rename it to something else or delete it):</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows &nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Messaging Subsystem\Profiles (specifically referring to the &lt;Profiles&gt; portion of<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this key - not the entire key)</div>
<div>#e - Repair Microsoft Office using the Programs and Features in Control Panel</div>
<div>#f - Create a new profile using the Control Panel &lt;Mail applet&gt; or start Outlook and enter the required information for your email account</div>
<div><br />
<div>The above steps will result in any existing profiles being removed. Note - the above approach is not intended as the first recourse for people to take any time an issue is encountered involving an Outlook profile. The cause for Outlook not opening properly
 in Safemode is probably the first place to start since that indicates an unidentified issue -&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to re-emphasize - a common problem report encountered is "absolutely nothing changed on my system - the program (whatever that program may be) just stopped working or no longer works properly". A contradiction in terms since something definitely changed
 that has impacted the program in question (in this case Outlook). Theoretically, any other email client should work with the identical email account settings especially given that there is no way that any Outlook addins (or any other kind of Outlook related
 3rd party software) would have any impact on it.</div>

            I do not have ICloud installed. I did but I removed it weeks ago......
<div><br />
<div>Avast is not installed as an addin, it is it's own stand alone version......</div>
<div><br />
<div>#1- Yes the error message is only when I tried to open Outlook in safemode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>#2 - POP3</div>
<div><br />
<div>#3 - I sync with ITunes yes.......</div>
<div><br />
<div>#4 - I have had this PC for over 2 years, there is lots installed, to long a list to type out. Not sure if you are looking for&nbsp;anything&nbsp;more specific or not.</div>
<div><br />
<div>#5 - No Office addins are installed, my Office install is basic.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your line that started with "If you open a message" I am not sure what you mean or how it relates to what I am saying at all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did not configure Outlook on any other machine but as I said in this thread, I un-installed 2010 and installed 2007 and the problem went away.....&nbsp;</div>

            first thing I'd suggest is create a new Windows userID and see if you can get Outlook working on it.<br />
<br />
You can use Method 2 or 4 in the following tip to do a more thorough uninstall. After uninstalling reboot the computer before trying to install again<br />
<span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span><b>2010<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have 64 bit windows, download the tools to your HD before running them
</b></span><br />
<br />
When you do an uninstall from Programs and Features the Office uninstaller does leave registry entries and configuration files that are picked up by the next installation. That is probably why your problem is carrying over.<br />

            <p>By your answers - you do not have a clean configuration so impossible to guess what any possible ramifications may be based on the sequence of events</p>
<p>#1 - You still have not indicated what the error message is when Outlook is started on safemode so there is no way for anyone to remotely guess&nbsp;to what a potential cause may be (or whether or not it may be a related issue)</p>
<p>#2 - You mention that you do not have any Office add-ins -&nbsp;yet at the same time indicate that you sync with iTunes - so by that alone - it is not a basic configuration</p>
<p>#3 - "iCloud" was installed weeks ago but then uninstalled.&nbsp;Was that before or after O'2010 was installed? Did the problems start around that time?</p>
<p>There are too many unknowns and based on that - can't offer any suggestions. My guess is that if you configured a clean system with O'2010 - no issues would occur making this a configuration problem in some way related to the sequence of events of things
 that have been added/deleted during or after the O'2007 to O'2010 process. </p>

<p>That's a good question! I have right now&nbsp; the C5-00 and I am not very happy with the GPS accuracy or the whole Nokia GPS.&nbsp; So I can't recommend this device for true navigation so far. But this may be because I can't use all the navigation options&nbsp; properly.
 Furthermore, I don't know whether the problems are due to&nbsp; satellites or depending on the phone itself or because of its maps. I have not installed Nokia suite to download all maps (i need) to the sd-card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well the accuracy of GPS system itself, what's that 100 meters??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>N8 could have the fastest processor and&nbsp; most memory of all Nokia phones so far. Perhaps it is powerfull enough to run map application properly.&nbsp; Don't know how fast is the C5-00 processor. Some one mentioned 600 Mhz but that is hardly true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you see the Gadget review of N8? The reviewers were happy with N8 Navigation.&nbsp; GPS may work better in the States than in Europe!??:smileymad:</p>

<p>With the A-Gps enabled and the extra features, the initial precision is within a few hundred meters. But it quickly gets better when it gets a lock on the satellites. The precivied precision for my N86 is about 10m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried it with a bluetooth GPS also, and the precision gets a bit better, and the time to fix with both a bluetooth and the internal GPS plus extra features is even a bit better. But not that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when the extra features were turned of and I only used the internal GPS the time to fix was a couple of minutes (most frustrating).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My perception of the few tests I've done with a E-series (E51) is about the same as with the N-series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunalty I haven't tried the C-series, so I can't compare.</p>

<p>In my work we've tested a bunch of GPS units. We've then tested them against each other and compared the accuracy from a fixed point (that we know the exact coordinates of).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of these phones were part&nbsp;of these tests. But based on the information from those tests, and compared with some of the GPS-units that was part of these tests. I've then fieldtested the phones with a collegue and checked the accuracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it's not the correct sientific way of doing it. But we never had any intention of testing the GPS in the phones for anything other than personal use.</p>

<p>There are no huge differences between the GPS hardware used in Eseries and Nseries phones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to be aware of is that the GPS received used in phones are not as powerful as those in standalone GPS devices because there ahs to be a balance of all the types of signals in use so that no one feature is interfering with another. This is why extra
 services like A-GPS were developed for phones, if you have a decent data plan and your operator supports A-GPS you are best to use this, especially if you live in a city with lots of tall building which hinder GPS signals or if you live somewhere prone to
 poor weather conditions which can have a similar effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I use Maps a lot in Brussels where we have tall building s and lots of road tunnels; I prefer to user an external Bluetooth GPS receiver (LD-4W) which regains signals very quickly when I come out of a tunnel ot out of the shadow of large buildings.
 The initial outlay of the extra kit more than pays for itself by letting you switch off the network-assisted positioning methods, espeically if you travel abroad - roaming data rates are an absolute rip-off on most networks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely; if good GPS is a concern, definitely go external.</p>
<p>After reading this thread I checked my "GPS data" and it reports:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accuracy: 7m</p>
<p>Alt. (Altitude) Accuracy: 8m</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(it deviates by a few metres now and then)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I'm indoors, it's raining and overcast and this thing (external bluetooth GPS receiver) still picked up a signal in about 30-35 seconds with no assistance whatsoever.</p>

            Well, Phillip is correct so far as <b>ActiveX</b> <b>Controls</b> are not supported on a Mac in OS X... Technically they will
<i>work</i> on a Mac if you're running Win Office on a Windows VM :-) ActiveX is the less likely possibility, though, because you have to go into a special dropdown [<b>Legacy Tools</b>] on the Developer tab in Win Word to get to them.<br />
<br />
The more likely devices used are those created by the tools displayed openly on the Developer tab. Since they are the ones most readily selectable (as well as being the newer, flashier kids on the block) they are probably the ones that were used. They create
 what are called <b>Content Controls</b> which, also, are unsupported in Mac Office.<br />
<br />
The devices supported on both platforms are what are created by the <b>Legacy Forms Tools</b> which are also accessed from the top row of the Legacy Tools dropdown mentioned above -- the ActiveX Controls tools being on the bottom 2 rows. Those are the same
<b>Form Controls</b> tools provided on the Developer tab in Office 2011.<br />
<br />
As for the lack of notification, most of the Content Controls &amp; the ActiveX Controls do not require the use of Macros or VBA. They can be saved in .docx format if no VBA is used so there would be no reason for the notification. You can also save in .docm format
 even if the file contains no Macros/VBA, in which case there would still be no notification. Another possibility is that even if there were VBA, saving the file in .docx format effectively strips the code out -- Again, that would eliminate any notification.
 Of course, if the file is saved in .doc format Content Controls would die as well.<br />

</p><p>If I have the end date the 31st of a month, than it calculates correctly the 1st of the next month. Unfortunately this doesn't happen with the 28th of February. Instead to calculate let's say the 29th February, it displays the 27th of February. (see image
 attached)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when opening the document I receive in the background an error message stating that an error occured.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could please some tell me you to amend the variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>It should help if you copied the field construction from Paul Edstein's Date Calc tutorial, which you can get from
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm#Third_party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm#Third_party</a> &nbsp; and with the&nbsp; field construction displayed use Word's replace function to replace DATE with MERGEFIELD v_aktverszeitende. Change the Delay to 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should ensure you don't get any transcription errors.</p>

    <title>2-step identification with Hotmail and Mail System on a Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            2-step identification with Hotmail and Mail System on a Mac</h2>
                    <p>I have a hotmail account which I was accessing via the mail system on my Mac. I have recently changed the hotmail account to require 2-step verification. I am now unable to access email through the Mac's mail system. The online directions apply to the iPhone,
 etc., but not to Mac OS. The Microsoft phone support and chat service were both unhelpful so I'm hoping that someone here might have a thought about how to solve this problem. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your answer Brian. You're suggesting that simply creating the second password and entering that for the password to access the hotmail account via the Mac mail system will work (i.e. will allow access) even though none of the directions on the
 page you inserted the link for deal with this directly? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it appears to have worked, so thank you very much for your help. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you said you can assign that user into other tasks, that means this issue may be related to the issue related tasks settings.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot this issue, please move to one task, that you
<strong>can assign your user</strong> normally, remove your user and then change settings (e.g. start time) to issue related task one by one to check which one caused this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also <strong>
create a new task</strong> and add settings as issue related task one by one to check which one makes you can't add a resource. Besides, please also share with me a screenshot of some tasks that you can assign that user normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Thank you for reaching us here to inquire your issue and we are pleased to help you with this matter. As I reviewed your post, you are having problems signing
 in to your account because you are unable to recover it.<br />
<br />
Our recommendation in this matter is for you to take the account recovery process to regain access to your account. We take account security seriously and we need to establish the account ownership first before we send the password reset link. Also, this process
 is to prevent hackers from using support to socially engineer access to your account.<br />
<br />
To make an account recovery request, kindly go to https://account.live.com/password/reset/ and follow these steps that I will provide:<br />
<br />
1. Enter your Microsoft account and type in the characters you'll see in the pictures<br />
2. Hit Next.<br />
3. Click "I can’t use any of these options".<br />
4. Enter a working email address where we can contact you.<br />
5. Click “Next”.<br />
6. Fill-up the form and click “Submit”.<br />
<br />
In this method, you will be asked to provide a contact email where a password reset link will be sent after you validated your account. I suggest that you provide a working email for you to receive the password reset link.<br />
<br />
If this workaround does not work, I suggest that you try the SMS validation. Please verify your account with a mobile number. Kindly check this link: https://sms.live.com.
<br />

            You do not understand. I doesn't give you that option. instead of putting a red square with white pages as the attachment(a standard icon for a PDF file), it puts a gray square with a zipper in the middle the standard icon for a ZIP file and when you click
 on the gray square it opens it as a zip file. Not by clicking on the download as a zip words. It is truly attaching the PDF file as a ZIP file instead.

<p>
</p><p>We greatly appreciate your time and effort for getting back to us and for providing additional information regarding this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the recipient doesn't have a PDF reader that's why he/she don't have an option to open the file other than ZIP files. If that's the case, we suggest to your recipient to install an Adobe Reader so that the system will provide other option when
 opening an attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still persist, we'll try to isolate the issue by verifying the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the issue happening to a specific contact?</li><li>Have he/she tried using different computer? Is the issue the same?</li></ul>
<p>We ask that you take your time to try the suggestion and let us know the results at your earliest convenience. If anything is unclear or if there is anything we can do for you, feel free to let us know.</p>

            that's not correct, i've tested the issue on my system sending an email with pdf attachment to one of my 2nd email addresses and i have acrobat, full version and adobe reader on my system.&nbsp; Outlook is converting either (if only one attachment, or multiple
 attachments) the one attachment to a *.wmz file, and or the first attachment of multiple attachments to an *.wmz file.&nbsp; this is not a zipped file.&nbsp; the wmz extension should be a media file or a zip photo, but its not.&nbsp; its just the wmz extension. This started
 with the 2016 upgrade.&nbsp; <br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I replace Lync 2010 with Skype for Business&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been try to extrapolate the answer from the deployment and migration guides but I'm not quite getting it</p>
<p>We have Lync Server 2010 deployed on a single server</p>
<p>All the clients are Lync 2010</p>
<p>We have users synchronised to Office 365 and have ADFS in place in order to shortly begin an Exchange migration</p>
<p>We have multiple custom domains in use on Office 365 and our on premise Exchange</p>
<p>Lync doesn''t appear to be accessible from an external network</p>

<p>What would we need to do to simple replace Lync 2010 for Skype for Business?...No migration; just straight swap</p>
<p>We've not used it a great deal but what would we loose by not migrating?</p>
<p>What would the requirements be of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lync client </li><li>AD User Account </li><li>DNS Entries </li><li>Anything else.... </li></ul>

<p>Hi utco_itsupport,<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, if we want to replace Lync 2010 with Skype for Business, we should create the accounts in Office 365 and then assign the Skype for Business license.<br />
<br />
Since you have synced the users to Office 365, we should just assign the license to the accounts.<br />
When you do that, here are the requirements you mentioned:<br />
1. Lync client - we can keep use the Lync 2010 client, you can also install the latest Skype for Business client.<br />
2. AD User Account – the accounts can be synced from the local AD.<br />
3. DNS Entries – we should set up the DNS record point to Office 365, here is the link for you:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-your-network-for-Skype-for-Business-Online-d21f89b0-3afc-432e-b735-036b2432fdbf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-your-network-for-Skype-for-Business-Online-d21f89b0-3afc-432e-b735-036b2432fdbf</a><br />
4. Anything else.... – the Conversation History and the Skype for Business contact cannot be migrated during the process.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi utco_itsupport,<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you mean minimum requirements for the Skype for Business client? If yes, please see
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg412781.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Business client software support</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Based on my experience, the values of the attributes below may need to be cleared in order to make sure all the online services will be available:<br />
<strong>&gt; msRTCSIP-DeploymentLocator</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; msRTCSIP-FederationEnabled</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; msRTCSIP-InternetAccessEnabled</strong><br />

<strong>&gt; msRTCSIP-PrimaryUserAddress</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; msRTCSIP-UserEnabled</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; msRTCSIP-UserPolicies</strong><br />
After removing them, run a force directory synchronization.<br />

<h2>            Problem with Windows Phone 8.1 and Fixed Dialing Number</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 920 with WP 8.1. I have a problem with fixed dialing number (FDN) feature.</p>
<p>When I go to Phone-&gt; Settings-&gt; Turn on FDN. Then I can't make any call and there is no item to add the prefix of FDN list.</p>
<p>How can I solve that.</p>
<p>Please help me. Thank you!</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e9531c24-6792-43ff-bebf-2e552e4c37c7" title="TânLê">
TânLê</a>. We advise contacting your network operator to confirm if this feature is supported by your Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card. You need the Personal Identity Number 2 (PIN2) code for this functionality and you can get this from your mobile operator/service
 provider. Once you have activated this feature, you can only call those phone numbers and FDN contacts that are included in the Fixed dialing list. Make sure that the
<strong>"Restrict outgoing calls and text messages to FDN contacts"</strong> box is ticked. We'll wait for your response.

            Dear @EAsonA, I tried this feature on Nokia 107 and it worked properly. The problem belongs to WP8.1, I add phone numbers and FDN contacts into in the Fixed dialing list, but WP8.1 doesn't save the number when I restart the phone, so I can't make calls.

            <p>Try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also see the end of my reply about dual booting XP and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>The .ISO file for the standard Windows 10 Tech. Preview build 9879 is now available. Download the appropriate ISO version.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso-update?os=win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso-update?os=win10</span></span></a></p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>2) After downloading the correct .iso file install HashCalc and validate the SHA1 hash value is correct.</p>
</strong>
<p>HashCalc: <a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm</span></span></a></p>
<p>(Note: If the download is not corrupt, the value HashCalc returns will match the SHA1 value I posted, hash values are not case sensitive; Example: an upper case letter A is the same as a lower case letter a)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>a) Launch HashCalc and navigate to the location of the .iso file you downloaded.</p>
<p>(The default download location is: C:\Users\User account name\Downloads)</p>
<p>b) Remove all check marks from the list of HashCalc options except for SHA1.</p>
<p>c) Click the ‘Calculate’ button and wait for the SHA1 string of letters and number to be displayed.</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>3) Next use ImgBurn (or Gear ISO) to create a bootable DVD.</p>
</strong>
<p>ImgBurn: <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/imgburn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/imgburn.html</span></span></a></p>
<p>Note: When installing ImgBurn, choose the "Custom Installation (advanced)" option and remove the check mark(s) to eliminate unwanted options, including Optimizer Pro (I do not accept) which is not needed.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Burning ISO Images with ImgBurn article: <a href="http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/G/Burning+ISO+Images+with+ImgBurn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>(The steps are the same for Windows 7 or Windows 8), except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Skip to step #4 to create a bootable Flash / Thumb drive.</p>

<p>Hi Leonard,</p>
<p>Thank you for the information.</p>
<p>SharePoint can’t recognize the pages in a OneNote notebook file, so the minimum level where we can set permission control is the file level. Therefore, if you need to control the permission for each page, we suggest you created separated OneNote files to
 store each page.</p>
<p>Regarding your specific requirements for the permissions, I suggest you create custom permission levels to control the permission in a more granular way. A permission level is built up from the basic permission such Read, View, Delete, etc. Please refer
 to this article for more details: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Understanding-permission-levels-in-SharePoint-87ecbb0e-6550-491a-8826-c075e4859848?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Add Exchange Account &#40;error 0xcaa82efd&#41; - Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to add my account (work related) to my new Lumia 950.</p>
<p>By selecting "Add Account" -&gt; "Exchange, Office365" it will start searching for the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after awhile I receive a "Something went wrong Error 0xcaa82efd" message.</p>
<p><br />
Does anyone know what it means?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is some network/WiFi clash issue - when on the company's public WiFi hot spot the device thinks it is inside the company's protected/local network, which gives some resolution problems.</p>

</p><p>Solution: turn off WiFi on device, using the cellular network when adding the exchange account.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 730 Display</h2>
                    It has been around few months now that my Lumia 730 display was broken. and instead of paying 8000. I had to go for a new android device. because it was more affordable. How can you charge 8000 for a display when phone costs only 10000rs now. &nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>In budget&nbsp;of lumia&nbsp;730 category. Android phone display costs around 4000-5000.</p>
<p>that is better than 8000. &nbsp;</p>

            what you forget is that the lumia 730 didn't cost 10000 when it was launched, and the display is usually the most expensive component on a device. apples and oranges.
