<h2>            Outlook 2013 and 2016 randomly hang when connected to Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hope someone has seen this before, I have multiple users who are on a mix of Outlook 2013 and 2016 all on Windows 10. Randomly on their computers Outlook will just hang for minutes, until you have to kill and relaunch outlook. None of them are connected
 to a domain, I have tried repairing and reinstalling Office as well as new profiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are all in cached mode, syncing the default 12 months of emails. Anyone see this before?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I disabled Hardware Graphics Acceleration, and the issues with outlook hanging for at lest the time being appears to have stopped.

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Dear Community:&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Last week Sunday Microsoft downloaded my Windows 10 Home 64 bit onto my HP Compaq nc6400 notebook.&nbsp; My prior posting of not having the applications
 to the right of START, has been resolved, with the Task Manager, using Power Shell as an Administrator.&nbsp; Today, 11/24/15 I went to copy and paste data into word, that I only use with the entire Windows Office Software installed.&nbsp; I notice that my Microsoft
 Office was changed from 2007 to Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Version 14.0.7051.1000, and advising me to change keys, being that I have 29 days left.&nbsp; (Strange things happen with computers going all the way back to IBM, I always think there is a
 ghost in my laptop or desktop, because some things that happen have no technical logic).&nbsp; This is a good example of how my Microsoft Office HOME 2007 was upgraded to 2010, plus the resolve issue with START, there were no applications, settings,&nbsp;ability to
 search, or any applications to the right. No real logic how this happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When I had 2007 Microsoft Office,&nbsp;the only software I ever used related to Microsoft Office 2007 was WORD,&nbsp; All the rest I have no use for.&nbsp; \never
 once thought of looking at the key. Anyway would not help, being I have a new version by default.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Same for Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010, I only have use for word.&nbsp;(I use word extensively in my medical work, being that I work in, Japanese,
 Mandarin, Korean, Arabic, and Russian.&nbsp; A little bit of English.&nbsp; I always copy and paste into word, to save as documents that I burn onto a CD before I sign of for the day and place in my safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With 29 days to go, and no key I have the option other then&nbsp;remove the entire Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 and install Apache Open Office,
 because I must have, WORD in my work.&nbsp; The rest I have no use for.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft Community advise is always appreciated&nbsp; Should I just unstill 2010 before 29 days expire and install Apache Open Office.</span></p>

            <p>It could be that the upgrading to Windows 10 has woken up a trial version of Office 2010 that was dormant on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the first things that I would do would be to download the free Belarc Advisor and use it to make an inventory of your system.&nbsp; That inventory will include details of all of the applications that are installed together with their Product Keys where
 applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, assuming that it reveals an installation of Office 2007, make a note of the Product Key, and you could then go to the Windows&gt;Control Panel&gt;Uninstall a Program and if you see&nbsp;Office 2007&nbsp;there, you could use Change and then Repair.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you could
 uninstall Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if the inventory includes a Product Key for Office 2010, you could try using that to activate the Office 2010 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another alternative would be to go back to Windows 7.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span><span>To see how to go back to your previous version of Windows, take a look at:</span></span></p>

            <p>Dear Doug</p>
<p>I always have Belarc Advisor installed in my computers, going back some twelve years.&nbsp; I will check all the inventory that is installed in my laptop and see what my alternatives. Will&nbsp;not go back to Windows 7 being that I had excessive problems getting my
 invitation for my laptop because the HP was pre installed with Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit with a OEM # that Microsoft validation tool&nbsp; said was valid and downloaded a free Microsoft Essential anti virus.&nbsp; Then when Microsoft downloaded their Windows 10 their
 validation tool said that my platform was not legal.&nbsp; (The problem was resolved and I have a valid Windows 10 installed).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse comes to worse I will use Apache Open Office, being that I have used their software before.&nbsp; Was having problems with Microsoft Office Home 2007 Word, ability to copy and paste via keyboard or mouse.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>

            <p>Hi, Doug:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked my installed Belarc&nbsp; Advisor, and reviewed my applications&nbsp;Microsoft when they updated my Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit to Windows 10 64 bit they installed a thirty day evaluation of &nbsp;Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Version 14.0.7051.1000
 in the same folder as my Windows Office&nbsp;Home 2007.&nbsp; The key is a thirty 30 evaluation.&nbsp; Plus Microsoft created one big mess, related to my Windows Office Home 2007 by installing&nbsp;into the&nbsp;same folder.&nbsp; End results&nbsp;I&nbsp;have good&nbsp;state of the art uninstaller software.&nbsp;
 My Uninstaller software also advised me that there were two Microsoft Office software in the same folder, and I may have complications removing all of the registry&nbsp;related keys.&nbsp; All went well and every registry key was removed along with both&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Office
 software programs.&nbsp; (I saved all of my documents by burning&nbsp;to a CD, prior to uninstalling).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will&nbsp;install, Apache&nbsp;Open Office. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for&nbsp;your support.</p>

            <p>There is NO way that an update of Windows to 10 would have installed Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software was probably always there and because it had not been used or activated, when you did start to use it, your received the message about activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing is that Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 was only available to corporate customers and users with an MSDN subscription.</p>

</p><p>I degree with you 100%.&nbsp; I am an expert in computers going all the way back to IBM.&nbsp; Belarc Advisor I always use, and one of the applications installed shows Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 with a thirty day key evaluation.&nbsp; I used Windows Home Office
 2007 always for WORD.&nbsp; Plus when I used one of my very best uninstaller software, the software said that there is 2010 and 2007 installed in the same folder, to take care, what registry keys I allow to be deleted.&nbsp; I deleted both, including with the same deletions
 and installed. Adobe Open Office that is now the default for Microsoft Office.</p>

            Hi Vikky,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the WhatsApp is still not working on your Lumia 650, try to soft reset your phone by pressing and holding the power and volume down buttons at the same time until your phone restarts. Once your phone is up and running, try adding contacts again.
<br />
<br />
Your update is important to us. <br />

<p>
</p><p>That seems odd, indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you <em>do</em> have an Skype or Microsoft account, sign on to your Skype account dashboard immediately to review the charge, check your account details (such as registered email address), and re-set your account password straight away.&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1170/how-do-i-contact-skype-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Skype Customer Service</a> to report the unauthorized purchases - or do cancel the subscriptions that may have been renewed in the case you overlooked cancelling them, and then contact Skype Customer Service to request refunds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you <em>do not</em> have an active Skype account or if you <em>had an old account that you no longer use</em>, try to recover access to it and follow the steps, above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you<em> do not </em>use Skype at all, contact the payment method issuer and report the charges as unauthorized.&nbsp; This is a last step because if you simply dispute the charges, and you have a Skype account that you use regularly, you may find your account
 will be permanently suspended as a result of <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA341/what-is-a-chargeback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Report of a bug in Excel</h2>
                    In cell formatting, when I format a cell as £ currency with 0 decimal places, it returns as a number format with 0 decimal places. I then have to re-format it as £ currency before it finally accepts the format. Trivial perhaps, but annoying.&nbsp;

            If you feel that this should be classified as bug, you should report this to Microsoft so that Microsoft developers should look into this. There are 2 ways to give this feedback -
<br />
<br />1. Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Feedback &gt; I have a suggestion
<br />
<br />2. Through Uservoice - Click the following link to see the feedback of others and to provide feedback - <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://excel.uservoice.com/</a>

    <title>License options get unticked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas_za  say:</h3>
<h2>            License options get unticked</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a client running in hybrid mode with On-Premise Exchange 2010 and Office 365. User accounts are synced from AD with DirSync and some users have been migrated to Exchange Online.</p>
<p>A weird issue arose where the Exchange Online option on the assigned license get unticked (automatically it seems) leaving the user unable to connect to their mailboxes. There are only a select few of us that have access to add or remove licenses and it
 happens randomly to random users. It is also only the Exchange Online option that is unticked and not the whole license.</p>
<p>Has anybody something similar before, or have any ideas as to why this is happening?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Thomas</p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>To have a further understanding of the issue, I would like to confirm the following information<br />
1.&nbsp;Do you mean you assigned the entire license which including Exchange Online service but the Exchange Online option is getting unticked? If so, are you able to tick it again?<br />
2.&nbsp;Regarding “<strong>the Exchange Online option on the assigned license get unticked</strong>”, can you share some related screenshots for us? To upload images, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then select the<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.<br />
3.&nbsp;Under the circumstance of the Exchange Online Option is unticked, do the users have Exchange Online mailboxes? Are they able to sign into OWA via
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a> ?<br />
4.&nbsp;Do all migrated users encounter this issue?</p>
<p>Generally, in Hybrid environment, when users are migrated from on-premises Exchange to Office 365 via Hybrid remote move, they will be able to be provisioned Office 365 license so that their&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;Online&nbsp;service&nbsp;for the migrated mailboxes can be activated.
 So, can you let us know how you migrated the users and mailboxes to Office 365?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ran</p>

<p>hi ran,</p>
<p>to answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. yes, only the exchange online option gets unticked, but i am able to tick it again, after which the user is able to connect to their mailbox again.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0273df39-7c27-4685-af4d-90b3f71c016c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0273df39-7c27-4685-af4d-90b3f71c016c" /></a></p>
<p>3. yes, the user have exchange online mailboxes. we did not test the owa logon during the time that the exchange online option was unticked, but under normal circumstances the are able to log in via owa.</p>
<p>4. not all users have encountered this issue, it is random users at random times. it is actually the second time it has happened. also, the issue doesn't seem to be recurring, as users affected the first time&nbsp;have not yet experienced the issue again.</p>
<p>all the migrated users have been migrated via hybrid remote move and have been working without any issues. the first time the issue appeared we put it down to finger-trouble on our helpdesk, but this time it is more users experiencing the issue and we have
 cut back on the amount of people that have access to add &amp; remove licenses.</p>

<h2>            EMAIL ALIASES - adding, then deleting, then...stuck&#33;</h2>
                    I used to have five MS Outlook email aliases, the maximum allowed.<br />
<br />
I then deleted two and wanted to add anlother one, but the system logic says I have used the maximum number, when trying to add another.<br />
<br />
What to do? :))<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let’s define the term “alias.”<span>&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p>An alias is a secondary email address added to an already existing Microsoft account address. To put it another way, you have a mailbox with an existing email address created when you signed up for your Microsoft account and sometime later you added another
 email address going to the same mailbox.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you can’t sign in with it, but you can send and receive email with it, it’s an alias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you will need to know how to remove an alias from an account before you can use it for you primary mail address and sign-in for your Microsoft account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is how it’s done:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>In your browser go to <a href="https://account.live.com/ManageAssocIds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/ManageAssocIds</a>. You may need to sign in.</li><li>Under <b>Other email addresses</b>, click <b>Remove </b>beneath the address you want to use as your primary sign-in address.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you don’t see your alias here, you are probably signed in with the wrong account.</li><li>Click the <b>Remove</b> button on the confirmation message.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s change the old alias address into your new primary sign-in address.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a> and sign in to your mailbox.<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></li><li>With your Outlook.com mailbox displayed, click the “cog” icon next to your name in the upper right corner of the page.
</li><li>In the menu displayed, select <b>More mail settings</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Managing your account</b> section of the page, select <b>Rename your email address</b>.</li><li><span>In the <b>New Microsoft account </b>box, enter the address you used previously as the alias address.</span></li><li><span>Click the <b>Save</b> button.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you received the error in step 6, “youraddress@outlook.com isn't available”, verify that you are signed in with the same account you used in the alias removal steps above.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the alias you removed was associated with a different account than the one you sign-in with for steps 1-6 above and you are signed in this way on purpose, you are not going to be able get past the error right now.<span>
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">When alias addresses are removed from accounts, they are immediately available to be used again only by the account they were removed from.&nbsp; Only after being removed and not reused by the original account for 30 days will the
 removed alias address be available for any Microsoft account owner to add as an alias or rename their primary sign-in address to, as in the process above. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />

            <p>The same rules apply to outlook.com and hotmail aliases.&nbsp; You can <strong>create
</strong>five aliases each year up to 15 aliases.&nbsp; Deleting an alias does not mean that you can create another alias if you have reached the limit.</p>
<p>Readding an alias is considered to be adding the sixth alias.</p>
<p>You are stuck with 3 aliases for one year from the creation of the first alias.</p>

<h3> grantyounger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Social Connector and Outlook 2016</h2>
                    Is anyone else having issues with connecting Facebook with Outlook to sync contacts? I tried connecting my Facebook profile to Outlook, and it gave me a "Invalid Username or Password" error. &nbsp;I logged into Facebook to see if maybe some privacy setting
 is interfering with connecting the two, but I could not see any setting that would interfere. I do know that the two are communicating, as I have a new app listed on Facebook called "Microsoft Outlook Social Connector". Any ideas to get the two to connect?

            You need a miniSD card (not microSD) of a capacity of up to 2GB max. A miniSD card of 4GB or greater is necessarily an SDHC card and the 6280 is not compatible with that technology, only basic SD.<br />
<br />
Speed should be 80x at least in order to avoid corruption due to the phone being faster than the card. I recommend the SanDisk Ultra II (and have several of them).<br />
<br />
You won't find a micro-to-miniSD adapter on its own. Some microSD cards, however, do ship with both microSD and full-size SD adapters.<br />
<br />
I do think you'll find it less trouble to copy the data from one card to another using your PC. It's no more than 2GB of data and you only have to do it once.

<p>So which is it Office 97, Office 2000 or Office 2002/XP?</p>
<p>I think the bottom line is going to be that you are going to have to buy&nbsp;a new copy of office. If you want to stick with a menu version of Office you will have to buy it from an online vendor, MS no longer sells those old versions.</p>
<p>Do you have the original installation disks? The Product key is on a sticker on the installation disk packaging. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How did the fix it, re-install windows? If yes, you are SOL without a Product Key.</p>
<p>Did they do an image copy backup before re-installing windows? If yes, in a best case situation you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>do an image copy of current setup, </li><li>restore the old image copy, </li><li>use one of the product key retrieval tools to get your Office product key, </li><li>restore the "fixed" backup </li><li>re-install office with the retrieved product key </li></ul>
<p>One of the tricky parts is going to be finding installation disks for old versions of office.</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />I understand that you want to create a hotmail.com account and not hotmail.it right?
<br />Hotmail (now Outlook.com) is a free, fast and secure email service. To create an email Hotmail, you only need to set up a Microsoft account. This will allow you to log in to all the services offered by Microsoft such as Outlook.com, Skype, Xbox Live and OneDrive.

    <title>Copy multiple records into same table in Access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curiouscathy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy multiple records into same table in Access 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I am working on a database that tracks trips taken by clients on various vans.&nbsp; Many clients repeat the same trip throughout a given week.&nbsp; Often the same people are assigned to the same van from week to week.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to display a trip history for a given van and be able to select the multiple riders that are making the same trip the following week.&nbsp; Once I have selected multiple riders from a van history I would like to copy those records to my
 trips table and have the user provide the new dates, etc.</p>
<p>I am imagining that I can do this using VBA or the new Macro - I am just not sure how.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing any ideas!</p>

<p>I don't think either VBA or Macros are the appropriate tool - an Append query (well, perhaps launched from a macro) would do the job. But I'll need to know more about your table structure to help construct one! What is the structure of your trip table? You
 clearly have many-to-many relations from Vans to Trips, from Trips to Riders... what tables do you have and how are they related?</p>

<p>I currently have tblClient which contains all my client-related information - ClientID, First, Last, Street Address, etc</p>
<p>Also, I have a tblTripRequest table which is used to enter data&nbsp;when a trip request is made.&nbsp; One client may make many trip requests on a given day.&nbsp; It contains RequestID,ClientID,RequestDate.&nbsp; RequestID is Autonumber, ClientID links to the tblClient.</p>
<p>The 3rd table involved is tblTrips which actually contains the individual trip information.&nbsp; TripID (Autonumber), RequestID (links to tblTripRequest), TripDate, TripTime and lots of other demographic information that needs to be tracked.&nbsp; I have often wondered
 if I have overnormalized (is that possible?) by keeping the tblTripRequest and tblTrips table separate.&nbsp; That could probably be a discussion in and of itself.</p>
<p>At any rate, I would like to create a form that shows van history.&nbsp; From the van history I could see all of the clients that rode on a particular day.&nbsp; I could then do a multi-select for those riders that would be copied into the tblTrips (and tblTripRequests)
 tables to make those same trips on a future day.&nbsp; I would need to provide the updated trip date and time.&nbsp; It is the desire to copy these history records that makes me wonder if I should merge the data in the tblTripRequest and tblTrips into one table.&nbsp; It
 would violate normalization rules but it would simplify the ability to copy history records into one table rather than two.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need additional clarification.&nbsp; By the way, the van information is recorded in the tblTrips table also.&nbsp; It is a foreign key to the tblVehicles table which holds all of the relevant vehicle information.</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance!</p>

<p>I don't think you're overnormalized at all: a Trip is one kind of entity; a TripRequest is a different type of entity, and they have different attributes. They should certainly be in different tables!</p>
<p>The van history should be very straightforward: you could have a query based on the Trips table, using an unbound form combo box selecting the van as a criterion. Similarly, you could create an Append query copying the relevant fields - ClientID and&nbsp;I'm
 not sure what else - into the requests table based on the same query. I'm not sure I understand why you would also want to populate the Trips table until the trip is actually taken.</p>
<p>Actually I think you can normalize one step further: there's clearly a many to many relation from Clients to Trips, is there not? Shouldn't there be a tall-thin table with fields for TripID and ClientID to indicate which clients took which trips?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply John</p>
<p>We actually record the trips before they are actually taken so that van schedules can be run for the various drivers.&nbsp; This organization provides trips to those who need to go to doctor's appt's, jobs and everyday errands.&nbsp; Normally the client calls in in-advance
 to make arrangements for their respective trips.&nbsp; What we have found is that many people make the same trips over and over so the ability to copy that information will really cut down on data entry.&nbsp; We have several clients that go to dialysis every other
 day so it will be nice to just select a trip from history and then plug in the new date and time information.&nbsp; I will try your suggestion and just automate it from a command button.&nbsp; We actually go in after the fact and note whether the trip was taken, cancelled
 or if the client was a no-show.</p>
<p>As far as the Client &gt; Trips table, that actually goes through the Trip Request table.&nbsp; In the initial data entry point we enter a Trip Request when someone calls in.&nbsp; We record their ClientID and the date of their request(s).&nbsp; The RequestID that comes from
 the TripRequest table links to the actual Trips table because one request from a client could actually reference multiple trips such as a round trip (which is actually logged as two distinct trips).&nbsp; If it seems that I am missing something on the normalization
 front in this instance, please let me know.&nbsp; I am quite the novice.</p>
<p>I'll try your suggestion and we'll see how it works.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            I don't think you need amend your tables in any way.&nbsp; You can use an unbound form to insert rows in to the tblTripRequests and tblTrips tables by including a multi-select list box in the form based on a query which joins the two tables and returns the
 TripID as its (hidden) bound column and the ClientID as its second (also hidden) column.&nbsp; Include whatever other columns from the query you need to identify the client/trip visually.&nbsp; Sort the query by trip date and client for instance to group the rows logically.&nbsp;
 To restrict the list to a specific van, reference an unbound combo box in which each van is listed, as a parameter in the list box's query, and requery the list box in the combo box's AfterUpdate event procedure to restrict the list to the selected van.<br />
<br />
Include unbound text boxes on the form into which the date and time of the new trip to be inserted into the table is entered.&nbsp; I'll assume the current date will be used as the trip request date.<br />
<br />
To insert rows into the two tables you'd execute code along the following lines in the click event of a separate button on the form:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngClientID As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngRequestID As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngTripID As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstTrips<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngTripID = ctl.Itemdata(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngClientID = ctrl.Column(1,varItem)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get new RequestID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngRequestID = Nz(DMax("RequestID","tblTripRequests"),0)+1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' insert row into tblTripRequests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO tblTripRequests (RequestID, ClientID, RequestDate) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "VALUES(" &amp; lngRequestID&nbsp; &amp; "," &amp; lngClientID &amp; ",#" &amp; Format(Date(),"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' insert row into tblTrips<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO tblTrips (RequestID, TripDate, TripTime,&lt;rest of column list&gt;) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT " &amp; lngRequestID &amp; ",#" &amp; Format(Me.txtTripDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#, " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "#" &amp; Format(Me.txtTripTime,"hh:nn:ss") &amp; "#, " &amp; "&lt;rest of column list&gt; " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM tblTrips WHERE TripID = &amp; lngTripID<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No trips selected", vbInformation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
I've not been able to test the above of course, but I think I have the logic right.&nbsp; It might need a little debugging, however, if I've there's anything I've overlooked.<br />
<br />
A couple of points worth noting:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; The yyyy-mm-dd date format follows the ISO standard of YYYY-MM-DD, so makes the date literal unambiguous, regardless of the regional date format in use on the system.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be wondering why a value is inserted for the RequestID primary key column of the trip request stable if this is an autonumber.&nbsp; The reason is that by inserting a known value it is then possible to easily insert the same value into the foreign key
 column in the trips table.<br />

<h2>            Wallet not in Apps list</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I don't have the wallet icon in the App list.</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 625 with WP 8.1 Black dev preview.</p>
<p>if i search for wallet in Bing in the phone, i see the settings for wallet, i can access it , add a pin , etc,, but i Just don't have the App in the App list. I can't add anything except accesing the settings of the .</p>
<p>I already did a hard reset a week ago, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>And consider doing an App for this forum!! Please!</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Wallet isn't showing up in the apps list, the most likely cause is something not processing and installing correctly during the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already tried a hard reset, that skips the majority of troubleshooting we'd normally do.&nbsp; The only other thing I can think to try would be to use the Nokia Software Recovery Tool to reinstall the OS on your phone.&nbsp; It installs the most recent OS
 version released for your phone model, so it&nbsp;might even install Cyan for you.&nbsp; This does end up doing a hard reset on the phone so make sure you've backed everything up first.&nbsp; Once it's done, you would need to reinstall the Preview for Developers app to get
 Update 1 back on the phone.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player Automatically Changing Title and Artist for Personally Made Music</h2>
                    Hi. I make my own music and about 20 minutes ago I queued one particular track to Windows Media Player, and it's title, album and artist were automatically assigned to it. I am unable to remove this. How can I get rid of this and change this so it doesn't
 happen again?
