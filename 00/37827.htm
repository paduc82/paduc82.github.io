<h2>            Design lab sent me a faulty controller and now I&#39;m stuck with it</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a custom&nbsp;made&nbsp;controller and when I&nbsp;received it, I noticed that the top of the front faceplate was slightly coming off. I brought it to the Microsoft store where the employee completely agreed with me that this product was faulty and informed me that I would need to contact Microsoft directly. When I&nbsp;contacted Microsoft, they told me they could fix it but they were only allowed to send me back a black or white controller, which completely defeats the purpose of my custom made controller. All I wanted was to either&nbsp;send in&nbsp;my controller to have to fixed, or have them send me a new controller with the same design, but&nbsp;customer support was&nbsp;anything but helpful. I understand the reasoning of a no refund, but that was under the assumption of receiving a working product.&nbsp;They kept insisting that the only thing they could do for me was to have me send in my controller, only to get sent back&nbsp;a regular black or white one. I asked why

<h2>            Direct Sunlight on Surface Book 2 - throttling down to 0.4 GHz</h2>
                    <p>Just yesterday I noticed that during some mild browsing, my SB2 was getting slower and slower.
</p>
<p>The sun was shining, I was feeling good, but the Surface Book must have gotten some sweat. The sunlight met at the back portion of the tablet, causing an increase in temperature of the casing (Mg I guess).<br />
A quick check with throttlestop revealed that the CPU was indeed at 400MHz, but the CPU temperature was quite low (60 °C).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SB2 is my 4th exchange and so far it is working good in every other condition, as long as no direct sunlight is bothering it.
</p>
<p>In my former devices that I exchanged, the throttling (often down to 400-600MHz) would happen without direct sunlight in medium gaming or benchmarks that are not even using all cores/threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I wonder if throttling in sunlight is normal behaviour and if other users did experience the same.</p>

<p>Hi outwright,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be a display issue, where the light sensor on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 increases the display to max brightness. Perhaps you could try toggling the brightness setting to 50% and avoid using the 'suggested' setting in the drag out menu at the
 system tray area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, although cumbersome, and without any functionality allowed to the keys, Studio mode does provide more power to the Surface Book 2 in general, making the system more 'confident' to maintaining a higher CPU speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, it could be a battery setting issue. Navigate to the battery icon in the system tray and select for higher performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Xbox One turns off TV, Soundbar &#38;amp&#59; Cable box randomly after last update</h2>
                    
<p>This keeps happening randomly, sometimes after hours of inactivity (so first I thought it had something to do with the automatic shutdown after 6 hours), sometimes randomly while just playing or watching tv. Xbox one itself doesn't shut down, which is also
 kinda weird, it's like it's sending out the "xbox turn off" kinect command, but just to devices connected to it.</p>

<p>This does sound strange mate,</p>
<p>I'd suggest running through the guide found here first:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/system/console-turns-off-unexpectedly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../console-turns-off-unexpectedly</a></p>
<p>Could be the power supply is faulty.</p>
<p>If that doesnt resolve your issues then try sending a tweet to @XboxSupport</p>

<p>Thanks, actually it probably is a power supply problem, but the console isn't to blame. Just checked now and the tv/cable box/audio are on a different extension cord than the xbox itself, oops...

<p>Mine did this exact thing twice today. &nbsp;Receiver, TV and cable box all turned off while Xbox stays on. &nbsp;When I turn everything else back on individually, my video is a little bit stuttery. &nbsp;If I do a hard reboot, everything goes back to normal until it all
 shuts off again. &nbsp;Power supply light remains white throughout.</p>

<p>This happens to me quite a bit. However it's only my TV that turns off. It's so random. Sometimes it does it 2 or 3 times a day, and sometimes not at all. It's only on 1 TV in my house. I have 3 different Samsung TV's, and on both the 46", and 52" I have
 no problems with it, but on the 60" LED is where it happens. The LED is where I play the most, which sometimes turns into a big problem. I've checked all of the settings on the TV, found nothing. Then I thought that maybe it was the Kinect picking up something
 from the TV, but nope. TV only turns off randomly when I'm using the Xbox One. If I play the 360, PS4, or Wii U, it doesn't do it as long as the Xbox One is not on.</p>

My case review has been upheld even though I shouldn't be banned in the first place. I was playing Rainbow Six Siege with my friends and got kicked off because the opposing team all spammed me with reports for being good at the game. I have pre-ordered fifa 18 for £80 and can't even play it when it comes out because of my suspension. I shouldn't be banned and it's unfair how Iv'e been punished for doing nothing wrong.</p><p><br /></p><p>PLEASE UNBAN ME, Iv'e done nothing wrong,</p>

<h2>            Print Queue doesn&#39;t accept all dropped files to be printed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm working to print more than 200 files everyday, as Windows 10 doesn't allow more than 15 files at a time, I'm using Print Queue to do that, but Print Queue doesn't accept all dropped files to be printed.. for example if I drop 15 files into print
 queue, only 1 to 4 files print windows show up instead of 15 print windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>note that I was using windows 7 before and&nbsp;I had no problem, print queue accepts whatever number of files I drop into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also note that I had make Print option appears when selecting all files to be print out, but it doesn't actually print all selected files, so no need to give me this suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there is an issue with Windows 10 regarding printing.</p>
<p>

            Hi mofajr.,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; On the right side, Click Printer &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />If you have HP Printer - HP provides a tool for HP printers to troubleshoot - HP Print and Scan Doctor. Download it, launch it and follow the onscreen directions to locate problems and fix them
<br />
<br />Download Link - <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe</a>
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Windows Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Windows Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hello , Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not actually printing documents on a printer, I'm trying to print out documents on ScanSoft PDF Create which&nbsp;comes with Nuance PDF Converter Enterprise V8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used before on Windows 7. my colleagues are using it also but no issues as their windows is still Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this with actual available&nbsp;printers but the same result comes up... Print Queue does't hold all dropped files into it... only few files' print windows come up.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB4038788 Problems</h2>
                    <p>After Windows installed KB4038788, I have had problems when waking two of my computers from sleep. The problems are similar, but different. When one wakes, it get a blue screen error and reboots. It works fine until the next time it is put to sleep. The
 other boots to the desktop, but it is locked up until you manually shut it down and restart it. It works fine as well until you put it to sleep again. I uninstalled and blocked the update and both computers have worked without any problem for about two weeks.
<br />
<br />
I had read where this update was causing issues with some HP computers and Microsoft was creating a fix. One of them is an HP, so when they released KB4043292, I downloaded it and installed both KB4038788 and KB4043292 in hopes it might fix the problem. It
 did not help either computer. I uninstalled and blocked KB4038788 again and everything works good. AMD Athlon II X4 Processors are the only common hardware between the two computers. Does anyone have any ideas of a fix for this problem?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues while updating your computer could be due to system conflict. It could be also due to device driver issue, especially if you suddenly got a blue screen error, but there's a solution on this. You can simply download and run the

            I tried what you recommended, but the same issues continue. I have dual monitors and the second monitor is set with just a black background. I didn't notice at first, but after installing the update the primary monitor loads the desktop but locks up. The
 second monitor doesn't power up out of sleep until I do a restart and then everything works fine until it is put back to sleep. It seems something is preventing some of the services or drivers from loading. The video card is an older Radeon HD 4870 which has
 the last drivers they released for it.

            The display settings are correct. Thank you for your assistance, but we don't seem to be making any progress. I think I will just keep update KB4038788 blocked and hope that a future update from Microsoft corrects the problem.

<p>It caused two problems for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, my two printers stopped printing text. Second I have been getting blue screens and the computer needs to restart. The printer problem was resolved when I uninstalled the update. No blue screen since uninstalling, but it has not been much time since
 the uninstall.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is that windows is reinstalling the update as I type this.&nbsp; I hope this time no problem.</p>

            If you have problems after the update re-installs, you can download Microsoft's "Show or hide updates" tool to keep it from reinstalling. Unfortunately, that is the only option I have found yet for my problems.

            Fortunately, the reinstall of the update did not result in the printer problem.&nbsp; So, the uninstall of the update and then reinstall of the update seems to have fixed the printers problem. Whew!

    <title>Problem installing Windows 7 on Macbook from MSDN download - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem installing Windows 7 on Macbook from MSDN download</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install windows onto my new macbook pro to run certain programs that I need for school that mac os does not support. I downloaded the windows 7 Professional 32-bit from the MSDN website through my school. When I try to install it I get to
 the page where it says install now. I click on it and it brings me to the next page and says that it cannot find certain windows drivers. I know that you can download drivers once you've installed windows but I can't even get to that point. It won't even let
 me start the installation without these drivers. I took it into a mac store to ask them about it and they told me that anything that comes up once the windows installation has begun is not a mac issue but a windows issue which begs the question, why then would
 you need to install additional drivers once you have downloaded windows? Anyway they told me that the reason it wouldn't work was that I had a disc downloaded from MSDN and not an original windows installation disk. I can't imagine what the difference would
 be but I would like to know if this is a problem with my computer or if it's a problem with the windows 7 download from MSDN. I have heard that there should be a set of basic drivers on your mac that will allow windows to be installed and run initially and
 then you can download additional drivers from apple to allow your trackpad and stuff like that to work. So either my mac is missing these drivers entirely or the drivers it is looking for are supposed to be included in the windows installation download files
 and I just don't have them for some reason. Are there things on an official windows installation disc that are not included in an MSDN download or is the apple tech that I talked to crazy?</p>

<p>Did you prepare your computer using the built in Boot Camp software in Mac OS X? Boot Camp should create a FAT32 partition which the Windows 7 setup program should format and install. The Boot Camp wizard should also prompt you to create a driver disc. If
 you didn't create this special disc, you might encounter problems. Because maybe, all you would need to do is provide the Boot Camp driver disc during the installation where it is prompting for certain windows drivers. Windows 7 would search the disc and install
 the appropriate driver, and continue with the installation.</p>
<p>Which model MacBook Pro is this by the way? Have you applied the latest firmware update if there is any available?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X doesn&#39;t stay connected to Wi-fi in instant on mode</h2>
                    <p>I've got two Xbox One X's and the one connected wired is fine. It stays connected to Xbox Live and updates games and the firmware when ever updates are available.</p><p><br /></p><p>But my second machine is connected via Wi-Fi and whenever there has been a firmware update, the machine has simply disconnected from Wi-Fi and not updated itself. So when I go to use it, it inevitably has a lot of game updates to do as well. </p><p><br /></p><p>Any reason that it doesn't just stay hooked up to Live waiting for either firmware or game updates?

Are both Xbox One X consoles you own connected to the same home network/router? It seems possible that the console featuring the wireless connection&nbsp;could essentially be getting kicked off the network in that case.</p><p><br /></p><p>Are you able to test out the Xbox One X console with the wireless&nbsp;connection while the Xbox One X console with the Ethernet cable connection is offline?

            Hi Rcaldwell125_976,
<br />
<br />If you have a webcam, the simplest way would be to use the Camera App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type camera and hit Enter to open the Camera App
<br />
<br />With that you can record yourself
<br />
<br />If you need to edit the footage, save it out of the Camera App, open the Photos App and click 'Create'
<br />
<br />Please note both these apps are basic in their functionality, there are good free apps available online that would provide more functionality!

    <title>Wifi connectivity is very faulty &#34;The default gate way is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sardy_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi connectivity is very faulty &#34;The default gate way is not available&#34;</h2>
                    My wifi cuts off intermittently and trouble shooting ( if solves the problem) always gives me the message "The default gate way is not available". Under device manager my Realtek adapter software is up to date. I have a strong feeling this might be a hardware
 problem for I've previously sent in my HP PC for repairs for similar issues. Using the wifi next to my NetGear router, theses issues aren't as prevalent but using my PC in the room directly above the router the problems are more frequent.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you have any third party security software installed on your system?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some troubleshooting steps&nbsp;that you can try to resolve this problem.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><strong> </strong><span>Manually assign the default gateway and the IP address and check if it works fine. Before assigning the IP address and the Default gateway manually, make<br />
a note of the IP address on the computer. To do this open Command prompt and type<strong> ipconfig
</strong>and press enter. This will display the IP address, make a note of it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To assign the IP address and default gateway manually, follow the steps below:<br />
a. In system tray, right click network icon. Choose Open Network and Sharing Center.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Change adapter settings</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right click on Wireless adapter connection and click on Properties. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>d. Double click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and assign the IP address manually.<br />
Example: Old Ip address is 192.168.0.1<br />
Change the IP address to 192.168.0.50<br />
e. Let the Subnet mask and default gateway be the same.<br />
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0<br />
Default gateway, usually would be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1<br />
f. Click on Apply and Ok and restart the computer and verify if it helps to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span> </strong></span><span>I would suggest you to try the steps from the link given below:</span></p>

<p><span>(Holds good for windows 10)</span></p>

</p><p>Please reply us back after performing the steps. We would be happy to assist you further on the issue.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x803f900a and game dissapearing.</h2>
                    <p>Last weekend I sat down to play some Forza Horizon 4, but the error message&nbsp;0x803f900a popped up, even though I was using the same profile as I bought the game with, and being subscribed to Xbox Live Gold. Browsing for ways to fix it but not getting anywhere
 made me not play it until today. I still got the same error message, trying to clear cache and restart my Xbox multiple times. I ended up trying to uninstall it, to see if that would fix it. When I went to "Ready to install" to install it, it was gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quickly went to Xbox Store to check if I could install it from there, but there is only an option to buy it - once more. I checked all the versions of Forza Horizon 4 available to buy, and none of them had the option to install. I also tried heading into
 other apps to "start" the game to see if it would make it install, but it just sends me into the Xbox Store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These bugs are making me go crazy, this is the Day One edition and through all the years I have played on it I have not had a single problem - until these. If this doesn't get fixed, and I get Forza Horizon 4 back (which I paid $79 for), I probably will
 just sell the Xbox , because these are problems I can't "live with."&nbsp;</p>

<p>=====================================================<br />
Something to try...<br />
<br />
Insert the DVD in your DVD drive and go to...Start / Computer.<br />
<br />
Right click the drive letter for the DVD drive and choose...Explore.<br />
<br />
This should display the directory of the DVD.<br />
<br />
If this is a Data DVD you can open the folders and find your photos.<br />
<br />
When you see the photos displayed...go to...Edit / Select All...then go to...Edit / Copy...<br />
<br />
Now right click your Picture folder and choose...Paste.</p>

            Hi, JuicyDeuce,
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Type Msconfig &gt; Press Enter
<br />Select Boot Tab
<br />Select Safe Boot
<br />Select Networking
<br />Click Apply, Ok
<br />Reboot and Windows will load into Safe Mode with Networking
<br />
<br />Try downloading/installing chipset
<br />
<br />When finished go back to Start &gt; Type Msconfig &gt; Uncheck Safe Boot
<br />Click Apply, Ok
<br />Reboot and Windows will load normally.
<br />
<br />I'd Also advise to Right click on Start &gt; Select Event Viewer
<br />Select Windows Logs &gt; Application Log
<br />Look for Hang Errors that coincide to the time Windows Hangs/Freezes

            Hi Juicydeuce,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

<p>Like Ive already said, I get an error when trying to install the chipset driver in safe mode so that's not going to work. However, after work today I'll try installing the driver during a new install of windows 10 with another USB.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, a friend told me trying to install windows using an older version of the creation tool (1803 or even better 1709) I might have a better chance. Any way to get a download to one of these versions?&nbsp;</p>

            Well, I reinstalled windows, downloaded and installed the chipset driver, and restarted.&nbsp; . Things were looking good but then it did its normal thing and eventually froze. Just restarted again and it froze before even signing in this time. Stuck at the

<p>
</p><p>First try fixing Windows 10 and if that fails, you can download the Windows 10 ISO image free of charge, create installation media and perform a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please try this first:</strong><br />
Start your System, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down<br />
<br />
<strong>Do this Twice</strong><br />
<br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.<br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore, see if you have a recent restore point you can revert to<br />
<br />
If you do not have a recent restore point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Settings, click restart.<br />
Upon restart press 4 to boot into Safe Mode, if you can get into Safe Mode, backup your data, reboot and see if your system boots normally<br />
<br />
If all this fails go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC, choose to keep all your files and Apps<br />
This will re-install Windows 10 whilst keeping your data and applications</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Finally if all the above fails, download the latest Windows 10 ISO and clean install Windows 10</strong></p>

            <p>If your computer came preinstalled with Windows 10 installed, then it likely has a recovery partition for reinstalling Windows 10. There would be no need to purchase a new license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows
 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9,
 F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>hi</p>
<p>i've managed to resolve it by installing an older version of the modem driver, one for vista.</p>
<p>now, what seems to be weird is that i installed the modem on a different windows (ultimate for 32bit) and when i got back to my original one (home premium x64) it worked just fine with the included driver - same i had before the problem occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so it works..but i have no idea why. anyway thanks a lot for the support!</p>

<p>
</p><p>It looks like you&nbsp;may have to contact Samsung about this problem.</p>
<p>But see if this assists you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is information about "beep" codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"beep" codes normally&nbsp;indicate a Hardware problem / failure.</p>
<p>Go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and look up your PC's specs to see what BIOS you have</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then read this about the "beep" error codes to try and see what has failed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to ascertain the Hardware&nbsp;problem yourself, contact&nbsp;the Manufacturer&nbsp;if under Warranty.</p>

<h2>            windows 8.1troubles shooter says wireless network security key is incorrect but it isn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>Almost every time that I start up my Dell Latitude D830 laptop, I connect and then immediately disconnect from wireless network. I run troubleshooter and it fixes system and then I am connected. I look at the diagnostics and it says that the wireless network
 security key is incorrect. even though it isn't layer 2 security ugi. I have uninstalled network adapter driver and re-installed. I have checked the linksys router and every setting is correct. We have two other laptops in house and neither one has any router
 connection problems. The issue has to be with windows 8.1. This problem didn't start until I installed 8.1 in May of this year. If the troubleshooter fixes the problem every time then some smart tech should be able to fix problem. The ones I have used from
 MS don't know how to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have chated with 3 different MS techs and they want to keep uninstalling the adapter and reinstalling it. That's not the problem unless there is a flaw in the driver.</p>

            <p>Windows doesn't control the wireless adapter so it isn't going to be the OS it self. It could be a 3rd party update that was included in the 8.1 update however.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The easiest way to test if it is the wireless NIC or the driver is to buy a wireless USB dongle. They cost around $25 and chances are that will solve all of your issues until the wireless card maker can get up top speed and fix the driver. If that is the
 issue. BTW make sure you let them know there is an issue just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I mentioned these earlier but I don't know if you got all of them. The first to will help narrow down the cause and I had a few questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q1.</strong> When it won't connect it is from a cold start or waking up from sleep?
</p>
<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Can you only not connect to your network or can you not see it too?
</p>
<p><strong>Q3.</strong> When it won't connect can you connect to another network?
</p>
<p><strong>Q4.&nbsp;</strong> Does it randomly start working again or is there some action that fixes it temporarily?
</p>
<p><strong>Q5. </strong>Once it works does it break in the middle of use or only on a startup&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Load using <strong>Clean Boot</strong> - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Load using <strong>Safe Mode</strong> - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong>Disable 3rd party programs from turning off the Wireless Adapter. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Windows
</strong>+<strong> X &gt; </strong>Hit the<strong> W key &gt; Double click</strong><strong> wireless connection &gt;&nbsp; Properties &gt; Configure &gt; Power Management Tab &gt; uncheck</strong> "Allow Computer to turn off this device to save power" then restart (You can wait to
 do this of course)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Delete wireless profiles </strong>use this article to remove your wireless profile and any unneeded ones.
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-networking/delete-wireless-network-profiles-in-windows-81/58e024ee-cd3b-4f6d-ada0-806ee2990637">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-networking/delete-wireless-network-profiles-in-windows-81/58e024ee-cd3b-4f6d-ada0-806ee2990637</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Try a different router to see if you have the same issue. Maybe you can borrow a neighbors WiFi connection for a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Change the security type on your router. The issue may only relate to certain security types. When you can't connect the next time remove the security from the router using a different computer and refresh your network connections to
 get the unsecured version of your network to see if it will connect</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Go to the Wireless adapters website and download the last 3 or more&nbsp;drivers (There may only be 2)&nbsp;and install them newest to oldest. When the issue shows up again switch to the older one. If it continues with all install the latest one.&nbsp;Make
 sure you download the newest one to your PC so you can install it when you have to internet connection&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong>Get a USB dongle to see if it fixes the issue and stay in contact with the Wireless adapter maker for new drivers so you don't have to use the USB dongle forever. Or you can buy a new NIC and install it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what the result of those are after you do them or if you already did them</p>
