<h2>            sync second partion e&#58; to onedrive in win10</h2>
                    I just purchased a laptop with windows 10. I created a partition e: on this harddrive to match my other systems that have two harddrives. i would like to sync the entire partition e: automatically to one drive. Onedrive works fine on the c: drive.

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />If you need to change the location take a look at this.

<br />
<br />But, it has to be C or D, it can't be both.

            thanks .. that worked. I moved the onedrive folder to my drive D: ... now do i have to move the library from C: to D: as well so that i can save files to a Document folder and have it sync to onedrive. My other computers have Drive D:, I moved the Library
 to D. <br />

    <title>My old email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spamnews  say:</h3>
<h2>            My old email address</h2>
                    When Outlook required that I reconnect my hotmail account, I had a terrible time and thought I had reconnected twice but then email quit coming to my account. &nbsp;I followed the instructions which said I would have to delete the account and then sign back
 in again. &nbsp;Well, you probably guessed that I cannot sign in again. &nbsp;I have had this address for over 30 years and have had to weather all of those problems when hotmail was new and so was I (new to email that is).<br />
<br />
So when I try to sign in I get the message "That Microsoft account doesn't exist. &nbsp;Enter a different account or get a new one."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So when I try to create it over again, I get the message "Someone already has this email address. &nbsp;Try another name or claim one of these that's available.<br />
<br />
So how can it not exist yet belong to someone else?<br />
<br />
I finally got it set up for my other address and it works fine, but this one will not be fixed.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
The responses I gave you were the ones I received when I tried to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<br />
If I am supposed to reactivate the e-mail account for 60 days, I have only been unable to connect it for a couple of weeks now and if reserved means I should be able to reactivate it, then why am I getting those error messages and how can I go about getting
 it back other than the recovering account way that will not work for me?<br />

            <p>Asking again - Microsoft Community sent me an email asking if my problem had been resolved.... and it hasn't. &nbsp;I check every day or two. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I am asking it again, perhaps a little more clearly this time.<br />
<br />
It would appear that in complying with the new outlook, I had to reconnect to it. &nbsp;My spamnews email was my first effort and somehow the account was deleted. &nbsp;Since I've had this account and have used it for over thirty years, I'd like to recover it. &nbsp;I have
 been assured by different people that the account is not deleted for 60 days and that I should have time to recover it (it's been 3 weeks or so now).<br />
<br />
In attempting to recover it I've been through the check list and received a reply that the account doesn't exist. &nbsp;So then I went into open account and tried to sign up for my old account and get the message this account is owned by someone else.<br />
<br />
 those error messages and how can I go about getting it back other than the recovering account way that will not work for me?<br />
<br />
Your moderator then asked what browser I am using to try to connect and what version of Office (2013) I have. &nbsp;I replied I am using Chrome and my Outlook came as part of Office 2013. &nbsp;That was on Feb. 24th and the last post on my thread.<br />
<br />
So the answer, my problem is not resolved. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I thought there might be some other way to do it, but no one seems to know. &nbsp;Is there?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you,</span></p>

            <p>Sounds like either the bootable USB you created with the installation files are corrupt or the .ISO file you used to create it is corrupt. Try downloading a fresh copy and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to download the .ISO file for Windows 10 Technical Preview:</p>
<p>Download Direct Links: <a href="http://iso.esd.microsoft.com/W9TPI/FD54DF81A4CCF4511BA1445C606DDBA2/WindowsTechnicalPreview-x86-EN-US.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Determine whether 64 bit or 32 bit is right for your needs:</p>

            It is likely corrupt. So try again with the .ISO you downloaded, if the problem persist, download a fresh copy and try again.

    <title>Embedded image in email shrinks after sending - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 4wbperez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded image in email shrinks after sending</h2>
                    <p>Our HR sends out these Week In Review graphic that she puts together in Powerpoint and she saves as either JPG or PNG. She inserts them into an email and sends it out to the company.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Upon inserting the image, the picture looks fine and correct in size. When an employee receives it, it has shrunk and difficult to read. This happened after an updated a couple of months ago. She does the same routine with editing and sending out. I've already
 tried unchecking the Disable Accelerated Graphics and it did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A workaround that we have tried is sending the email as Rich Text instead of default HTML. Is there a way to fix this so we are not stuck sending as RTF as we have users that do not use outlook as their primary email client? Please advise. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi 4WBPerez,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to post in community. Based on your description, an employee happened to receive images in abnormal format. Since you didn’t provide a detailed screenshot about it, I guess that most of your employee are using Office 365 account
 and the problem occurred in Outlook client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under this situation, I I’d like to recommend these suggestions for her that she can have a try:</p>
<p>1. The Outlook also support send a slide as attachment, you can send her with the images or the slide then check if she can receive images normally.</p>
<p>2. Sign in <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000&amp;redirect_uri=https%3a%2f%2foutlook.office.com%2fmail%2f&amp;resource=00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000&amp;response_mode=form_post&amp;response_type=code+id_token&amp;scope=openid&amp;msafed=0&amp;client-request-id=1bdac1a6-6b34-4ef0-8e6d-7edb228dbc54&amp;protectedtoken=true&amp;nonce=636967965328913543.dcf97f7e-63ea-4d99-83a0-a7e0bf364452&amp;state=Dcs7EoAgDABR0NKzIEggIccJAjPM-Gk9vinedmuNMatalA0aQwjISIwZYuEDcoK9nYNpUHcIXVxqzK6ABCfUQx2AKeVo9d38LfPy86nv9wM&amp;sso_reload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OWA</a> (Outlook Web App) to check the results. If she cannot open images normally, images may have broken while sending.
</p>
<p>3. If she can open the images normally in OWA, try to open Outlook in
<strong>safe mode</strong> to check whether add-ins affected normal function. For your reference, see this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode+" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>4. During my test, received images can be previewed, saved as and opened directly, you can try to save as to check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If problem persists, I’d like to collect more information from you for a further analysis:</p>
<p>1. As you mentioned, just this employee suffered this problem, did other people report this dilemma?</p>
<p>2. What type of her account? Exchange/ POP/ IMAP /Others?</p>
<p>3. The version of Outlook. <span>Click <strong>File &gt; Office Account &gt; Product information &gt; About Outlook</strong>, then you can get that information.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. If it’s convenient, please offer me a screenshot of the error page so we can better understand your concern.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your cooperation and kind understanding.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Shawn</span></p>

<p>First of all, Thank you for your help with this. I appreciate it greatly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I've tested with OWA and it came out with the correct (and readable) size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I've tested sending from Outlook (safe mode) and got the same results<br />
<br />
<strong>Supposed to look like this:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0ffc829-da54-4292-b39f-9b622ff9755a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0ffc829-da54-4292-b39f-9b622ff9755a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>But looks like this after is it sent:</strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We are currently using Office365.</p>
<p>Outlook version is 1905 Build 11629.20246</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's definitely multiple users it is happening to.&nbsp; Also, there is no error. Just the size of the image scales down instead of staying the same size after being inserted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Person Asking Question,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I felt so sorry to reply you in such a long delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your problem hasn’t been resolved yet, please try to turn off compression in Outlook to check the result..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option to turn off picture compression in Outlook is available only after you have added a picture to an email message as an attachment. In the email message to which you have attached a picture, click
<strong>File &gt; Info</strong>. Under <strong>Image Attachments</strong> at the top, select
<strong>Do not resize images</strong>.</p>

    <title>With Windows 10 Creators Update, Word 2003&#47;Office 2003 crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dworskye  say:</h3>
<h2>            With Windows 10 Creators Update, Word 2003&#47;Office 2003 crashes</h2>
                    <p>Although Office 2003 Pro was NOT supposed to work with Windows 10, it has been just fine until Windows 10 Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I go to save a new document in Word 2003 in a different subdirectory from the default one, the dropdown freezes, and Word crashes with a message "Microsoft Office Word has stopped working". The document is rescued, but still can't be saved elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried almost EVERY one of the compatibility modes (win 8, 7, xp, 95, etc.) with essentially the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot open .docx any more when I could previously in Win10 mode and I think compatibility mode too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't open some spreadsheets in Excel, but using a compatibility mode seems to work. Could open a newer .ppt, but it crashed soon after. Compatibility mode seemed to work at least for that one ppt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP... any ideas? &nbsp;I don't want to upgrade (I love the old interface), but feel I am going to be forced to get Open Office or similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

</p><p>Yes, I am using it, but turning off Winword, etc., in Malwarebyes' settings did not solve the problem unfortunately.</p>

 not had any problems.</p>

<p>I don't know if you already found a solution for your Office 2003 problem, but today I encountered exactly the same issue on a Windows 10 machine with Office 2003, that was recently updated to the Creators Update.
<br />
What helped for me was de-installing the Microsoft Office File Validation Add-in.
</p>
<p>After I removed the Add-in Word and Excel 2003 worked fine again. </p>

            I had the same issues with Word 2003 under Windows 10 - i.e. initially OK and then 'save as' started crashing a few months ago. I have fixed the immediate issue by setting the "save" options of 'fast save' and 'background save' to ON . Under Tools/ Options/
 Save I have the Fast Save, background save, and Save AutoRecover now all ticked, and it is working properly.

            <b>Hey&nbsp;&nbsp;CAVKAR,</b>
<div><br />
<div>I do not know of any bug or problem specific to track changes in Word 2008. So I would start by offering the learning material on Track Changes and make sure everything is set to what it should be first...</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><a href="http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/word/item/b7426c27-dabb-4ed0-b621-7308697b8aec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use tracked changes</a></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>And</div>
<div><b><a href="http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/word/item/e32f6310-eb7a-4978-9ad7-c1429e97bf77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<div><br />
<div>And should you review everything and the issue seems to be document specific and all the settings are correct, then my guess would be that the document&nbsp;may&nbsp;of become&nbsp;corrupted&nbsp;somewhere along the way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To double check that, just copy the information into a new (fresh) Word Document and try to reproduce the problem, and see what results you get. Should none of the above work properly just post back and we will go a bit deeper.&nbsp;<b>Thanks for posting!</b></div>

</p><p>i'm trying to bulk delete emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using internet explore and chrome on Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i search for example ebay, and selection all i then press delete all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It comes up with a messaging saying 250 emails deleted, and the search results change so it shows 0 results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However my inbox total stays the same and no emails are added to my deleted folder. If i search again all the emails are still there.</p>

            Hi Sam,
<br />Instead of hitting Delete all, select the first, hold ctrl and scroll down then click on the last to select all then click Delete. Do they stay deleted?

            I can bulk select emails with shift (rather than control) but it still shows a message with '11 deleted', it takes the selected emails out of the list im looking at, but the emails aren't moved to the deleted folder. If repeat the search they then appear
 again.

            Hmm. it works here. (Sorry for the typo - you are correct, Shift to select the group, Ctrl to pick and choose). 
<br />
<br />Do they delete if you select a smaller group - say 50 at a time?

            Something is goofy - did you clear the browser cache or try using an inprivate session? I'm able to delete in bulk from search results, so its more than just deleting. I know there is some weirdness - like not being able to select all using the dot and move or delete, but it should work in smaller groups. Moving won't work if the selection contains appointments and contacts - that should not affect deleting though.

                    I recently had to create a new Profile; because my outbox mail wasn't posting. In the process I lost my Rules and my Signatures.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have located the signature folder, with all the signature data, but how so I get the signatures to appear on my signature list in my new profile?<br />
<br />
btw I have a64bit system.&nbsp; Does Outlook come in a 64bit system?&nbsp; Or is compatible on both systems?<br />

    <title>Cavalier attitude of microsoft towards handling customer complaints - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parvatharajanks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cavalier attitude of microsoft towards handling customer complaints</h2>
                    <p>I am not sure whether this is the right place to post. I am fed up with microsoft support people. If anyone of you can help me please call the customer care unit with the complaint number and enquire about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using lumia 1020.My complaint number is 1340631814. Around two and half months back my phone fell down and the centercase is broken. Till now I am not able to get the center case for the mobile. First I have registered with VT communications(Nokia authorised
 service center) in Taramani for the case with a 500 rupees advance. They have dragged it saying the case will come in 1 week for around a month. Frustrated over the delay, I have cancelled the order. Then I went to Rocky Agency in Gopalapuram. As a word of
 mouth they told me that they will get the case but there have not got the case. I have called the customer care executive nearly 10-12 times for the same issue but they have maintained a cavalier attitude towards the problem. Finally one of your backend team
 member called me on May 27 and told me that you will get your case in 10 days and asked to visit the Rocky agency again. I went to the agency and paid 1000 advance for the case. They told me that by 8th june they will get the case delivered. When I called
 them yesterday, one of the employee Pandiyarajan picked up and told me that it will take 10 more days. When I asked him for the reason for delay, he told me that to know the reason I should come there and work. Also he told me that you will not get the order
 in click of a button. I came to know from your executives that the product is rammed down and i will not be able to get the case. As far as I know even after ramming down a product the parts and service for the product should be available for 10 years from
 the date of ram down. I am really frustrated with the wait and want my money back because even if somehow they manage to get the case in another 3 months or so(hopefully) if there is another problem I have to start the case again. One more thing is your SERVICE
 INCHARGE OF TAMILNADU JEEVITHAN is speaking in the most inappropriate way. He is not showing any commitment what so ever in delivering the product and is arguing with me saying that this the case everywhere. He is betting me to show that whether I can get
 the center case within 10 days in Apple. He told me that if I am able to get that he will give 25000 rupees. Could you please sent me his mail id and contact number. What I have written in this mail is just the tip of a iceburg there is lot more. It is nearly
 3 months and nothing has been done to solve this issue. I want to get my money back or provide a new phone equivalent to this one.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe the issue is related to the upgrade from Office 2010 to 2013. Can you let me know how you upgraded the Office suite?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I notice that the issue was resolved by editing the registry in your computer. Given the situation, I recommend you post a new thread on
</span><span><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/home?forum=winserverds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Active Directory Services forum</span></a></span><span> to check if it can be resolved via Group Policy Object (<strong>GPO</strong>)
 on other problematic computers.</span></p>

<h2>            Chrome browser doesn&#39;t work with outlook.com</h2>
                    I am using Chrome browser v 21.0.1180.83 m. I can't use the outlook.com website because I am unable to add attachments to emails and it doesn't display contacts (people). I tried accessing the Outlook.com website with Firefox and it worked perfectly. Also
 unable to connect at all with Chrome mobile browser on my Android epad. What's up with this? Microsoft, if you really want to capture back web-based email and want people to use SkyDrive instead of Dropbox, you might want to test your website with the leading
 browser!!

            Seems like it has been fixed. Not sure if I fixed it by importing contacts from a file instead of linking to Google/Gmail or if Microsoft did something to fix it. Probably the latter because I can now connect with Chrome mobile browser too.<br />

                    I have a code to redeem and I keep getting a message stating "Try that again. Something happened on our end. Waiting a bit might help." I waited over a week between attempts. I saw elsewhere that this was a common problem fixed with changing the "buy and
 download" settings in the Online Safety section, but that does not seem to solve the issue for me.

            Sounds like the internal board has failed.<br />
<br />
If this is the case you will not be able to fix this yourself.<br />
<br />
Book it in at your nearest Nokia Repair Centre.

    <title>Shared mailboxes with same aliases on different domains in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annziegler7822  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared mailboxes with same aliases on different domains in Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday, with the assistance of an Office 365 support tech, I migrated from Office 365 Small Business to Office 365 Business Essentials [Office 365 Ticket #
<em><strong>Removed by moderator</strong></em>]. Everything seemed fine for the users and mailboxes associated with our primary domain. However some mailboxes on our 2 additional domains are no longer accessible. Each time the tech tried to set the additional
 domain mailboxes up as shared mailboxes, we got the following message:</p>
<p>The proxy address “SMTP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***” is already being used by the proxy address or LegacyExchangeDN. Please choose another proxy address”</p>
<p>However we confirmed that referenced proxy address is not used anywhere.</p>
<p>My primary email is ann@primarydomain, and before we renewed I had ann@secondarydomain and ann@thirddomain</p>
<p>The additional domains are correctly set up, and another shared mailbox orders@secondarydomain survived the process just fine. The problem was only with the two “ann@” mailboxes.</p>
<p>The tech told me there was something he had to do behind the scenes, and said he’d call back this morning, but I have heard nothing despite repeated emails. Meanwhile, on relaunching Outlook, I see that the secondary domain mailboxes are no longer visible,
 and I cannot access 15 years/3+ gig of correspondence and contacts.</p>
<p>I backed up my ost files before we started the subscription renewal, and the tech has assured me the original ann@secondarydomain mailbox is safe and sound, but I need to get that account set up again and available in Outlook as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I found this post, which describes exactly what I am experiencing – apparently it is not related to the proxy address but that the aliases are the same (ann@1, ann@2, ann@3).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cogmotive.com/blog/office-365-tips/create-shared-mailboxes-with-same-alias-at-different-domains-in-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cogmotive.com/.../create-shared-mailboxes-with-same-alias-at-different-domains-in-office-365</a></p>
<p>I followed the process described and created a test mailbox in the secondary domain with the same alias as an existing test mailbox in the primary domain, and both test mailboxes now have the same alias, so I believe the process worked with these test accounts.</p>
<p>However I got this message on PowerShell at the last step,</p>

<p>set-mailbox testing2 –MicrosoftOnlineServicesID *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;which I do not understand:</p>
<p>WARNING: UserPrincipalName "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" should be same as WindowsLiveID "testing@ secondarydomain.com", UserPrincipalName should remain as "testing@ seconddomain.com".<br />
<br />
And I am worried about trying it with my real additional mailboxes, because they already exists somewhere (I hope!) and are full of mail, and the process described here is for creating new mail boxes.</p>
<p>Any thoughts greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On Windows 10 Technical Preview, Internet Explorer 11 we still have the ability to translate the whole webpage to different language.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right click the web page and select Translate with Bing in the menu. This will display a toolbar with a number of options for displaying the translated page. There are only few languages that are
 supported, if Bing translate cannot find the language you will get the message as “Cannot translate provided URL”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also use Bing bar to translate webpages for more information refer this Microsoft Bing article:</span></p>

    <title>Groove Music Downgrade from XBox Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> medtech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Music Downgrade from XBox Music</h2>
                    <p>I had an Xbox annual music pass from December 2014 until it ran out this past December of 2015. I was very happy with my Xbox pass and the performance of the Xbox Music App with Windows 8 and later 8.1. When I went to Windows 10 Xbox Music became Groove
 Music but my subscription continued. Groove&nbsp;Music was a much different experience. In order to get tracts to play I had to&nbsp;open the app, then close and open it again. Waiting did not make any difference, the tracts or albums simply would not play on the first
 attempt. Also, the playback would suddenly stop for at least 30 seconds but sometimes for several minutes at random. &nbsp;Never had these problems with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Xbox Music App, everything started with the "upgrade" to Groove. I wasn't sure that the problem wasn't my
 Internet connection&nbsp;so I was very frustrated. When my pass ran out I decided to shop around and tried Spotify. My what a difference. Never have any trouble playing any of the tracts . . . they start instantly. Never had a single dropout of any tract so far.
 And I think they have more selection of the classical and pipe organ music I like. I doubt I will come back to any Microsoft music streaming service as Spotify is black and white better.</p>
<p>Shame MS can't get this right on their own new operating system. Anyone else have these or similar problems with Groove Music?</p>

            <p>Groove isn't a brand new service. We simply changed the name of the old app...and ship updates to the Store every two weeks or so for Groove just like we did for Xbox Music.

<p>What we need you to do is send this information to Microsoft directly and to do that from the Smiley face control that is on the far right side of the ribbon of Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paste in the same information that you have provided here into the message. Also include your email address, there is a spot provided, and check the box, if there is one (there isn't one on my system but that maybe because I run an insider version), for
 sending the system log.</p>

<p>Just purchase this phone and found out the speaker is not working.</p>
<p>1. I can hear the incoming call ringtone but cant hear what the person on the other end is talking unless I use the loud speaker.</p>
<p>2. I cant hear the dial tone when I make a call unless I use the loud speaker</p>
<p>3. I cant listen to the music/video unless I use the headphone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seem like the lumia is in the earphone jack mode.</p>

<br />
yes it may be an issue with the earpiece. have you checked that you are up to date with the latest firmware for your device, and that you are up to date with all the latest Nokia system app updates in the Store? also try performing a soft reset and see if anything
 changes.

when you make a call, next to the "end call" button there is a button with cube shape on it, tap that and then more options will pop up, one of which is named "speaker"

<p>This just started happening to me today, and I can't figure a way to fix it.&nbsp; I think it has something to do with the software-based switching of the internal earpiece speaker on and off when going between bluetooth devices and the phone.&nbsp; I've tried everything,
 including a complete phone reset to factory conditions.&nbsp; No help.&nbsp; What the heck do I do now?</p>

<p>This happens to my phone when it disconnects from my car Bluetooth. (Cant hear the caller unless I use the loud speaker) I fix it by simply plugging my headphones in and out of the headphone jack. The phone works perfect until it hooks up to my car again.</p>
<p>I presume that that as the phone un pair's its self from the car something goes wrong and the speaker wont re engage for normal use.</p>

<h2>            Reset Account - Payment did not go through</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to purchse Office Home and Business 2016 for Mac via PayPal. This did not go through for some reason. The site says I have purchased this now, so cannot purchase again with another means of payment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The customer service tab is not working and I cannot chat or phone anyone to reset my account (it has been 24 hours since I tried to purchase this, so according to the FAQs section, my account should have been reset by now) - has anyone had this experience
 before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Have just been on the HUP customer service helpline and absolutely no use whatsoever - diabolical. Can someone from Microsoft please urgently respond.

            Is there still a problem? Have you contacted the vendor from which you purchased?

<h2>            office 365 update or uninstall couldn&#39;t close &#34;system&#34;</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running windows 8 on my Sony Duo 13. I installed windows office 365 about half year ago and it has been running smoothly. But recently, when I try to click the update office 365 option that showed up, it always gives me a list of program that needed
 to be closed before update, and one of the is "system". I can not end the "system" in task manager, and the office 365 update can not proceed. Same apply when I try to re-install the 365. I couldn't un-install it. I have tried to boot in a clean boot and update,
 but the problem still exist. &nbsp;Could anyone give me some advice on this? Thanks</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I have a clue for you, which I just figured out yesterday.&nbsp; The culprit is likely to be the Intel Anti-Theft service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Sony Vaio Pro Ultrabook, so given the family tree of our two computers, there's likely to be a link in the common problems we have (had) and the solution that&nbsp;I have very accidentally&nbsp;found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having installation problems, not only with Office 365 (couldn't close that "System" service)&nbsp;but also with two other programs (Steam and Kaspersky Internet Security).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had tried virtually everything, without success.&nbsp; When I unloaded Kaspersky and then tried to put it back, I found out that it wasn't reinstalling properly.&nbsp; Went to Kaspersky's site and downloaded the 2014 version and tried to install that, without success.&nbsp;
 Nor could I reinstall the 2013 version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that my computer was unprotected, I went to BitDefender to download their trial version.&nbsp; When it started installing, it identified the Intel Anti-Theft service as being incompatible and demanded that it be uninstalled before installing BitDefender.&nbsp;
 I bet you have the Intel Anti-Theft service on your Sony Duo 13, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled Intel Anti-Theft immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But instead of going forward with BitDefender, I tried once more to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2014.&nbsp; Voila!&nbsp; Installation without a hitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back and opened up Steam to check if the problem there was fixed.&nbsp; Yes, it was!&nbsp; Interestingly, in Steam's extensive troubleshooting tips, one of the things that they point you to is a long list of antivirus programs that could cause incompatibilities
 (<a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9828-SFLZ-9289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9828-SFLZ-9289</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;The most commonly used antivirus programs were on the list, but Intel Anti-Theft was not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Office 365, I had previously installed the current version (through a workaround of uninstallation and re-installation), so I'm completely up to date.&nbsp; The automatic update function is set to run in the background - though it would not function before.&nbsp;
 I bet that it'll work now that I've uninstalled Intel Anti-Theft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you might want to either uninstall Intel Anti-Theft completely (via Control Panel)&nbsp;or possibly use MSCONFIG to prevent it from starting up.&nbsp; I strongly suspect that will solve your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One caveat about the uninstallation through Control Panel.....&nbsp; I called Intel to let them know of the issue.&nbsp; The&nbsp;tech asked me&nbsp;whether the program was "Sync"-ing before I&nbsp;uninstalled.&nbsp; Since I could not recall, he asked me first to go back to the McAfee
 website and reinstall (it was during this re-installation that I saw that it appeared to have some anti-virus operations of its own - no wonder it interfered with Steam and other programs), then start the Anti-Theft service and click on the "Sync" button,
 then go to Control Panel and uninstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;chose to completely uninstall rather than use&nbsp;MSCONFIG for a temporary fix.&nbsp; My trial period&nbsp;for Intel Anti-Theft ends in about 19 days, and I don't think it's an important enough addition to value for me to keep it running, especially in light of its
 interference with the rest of my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once done set the Calendar View you wish to use, this should then be reflected whenever you open the Calendar</p>
