<h2>            Outlook 2016 MAC and Master Category List &#40;MCL&#41; slow upload</h2>
                    <p>In our Organization, we're working with Outlook 2016 MAC and Exchange Server 2012.</p>
<p>I do a massive use of Categories.</p>
<p>But with the new MCL approach, any time that I've to add or replace a category, Outlook need to upload the MCL file from the Exchange server. This is a very slow process, which I can not accept it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the few months, we will migrate to Outlook 365 on the Cloud, but I think we could have the same issue described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any advice to solve the problem?</p>
<p>Right now, I'm working with Outlook installed on a VM, but I'd like to go back on the Outlook for MAC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know also, how can I edit the MCL file to make a massive update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Roberto.</p>

            Hi Roberto,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If I understand correctly, the answer is yes. To avoid misunderstanding, may I know the detailed steps about how you copy/past the pst file from Exchange server to Exchange online? Do you use Outlook clients or data management feature?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Erick

            Most likely its windows related issue. Make a backup of your files &amp; do a clean install of your OS. Some laptops have a restore CD to put it back to the conditions when you purchased it.

            Display drivers have been an issue in Windows 10. Most documentation says that if you have Windows 8.1 drivers, they should be compatible with Windows 10. If that does not work, you can always try installing the drivers in
<em>Compatibility Mode</em>. That's what I had to do for my ATI Card I'm using and it seems to be working well. To do compatibly mode, first you need to locate your setup/install files through
<em>File Explorer</em>, then you need right click on the&nbsp;file and select <em>Properties</em>. You will then see a tab for
<em>Compatibility,</em>&nbsp;after picking a mode,&nbsp;run the file. This procedure works with other devices too if a suitable Windows 10 driver is not available.

            What if I did not install a drive to start with? &nbsp;I mean I did not install a driver so I don't have a setup/install file is this correct? &nbsp;I would think Intel would be making drivers for Windows 10 but maybe I am wrong.

            Yes, you can install Windows 10 without the proper video drivers. The problem is your display may not show correctly as you would be&nbsp;on the generic/basic drivers provided by Microsoft. Specific drivers from Intel or the laptop/computer manufacturer will
 usually take care of that problem if you can find the right compatible version. The manufacturer's and Intel's web sites is a good place to start looking. As you have indicated that your computer is fairly new, it might only be a matter of time before new
 Windows 10 drivers will be made available for it. Until then, the only other option is to try upgrading to windows 10 and experiment with currently available drivers.&nbsp;If you going to do that, I would advise you to create the recovery media for your computer
 and back up your data so you can go back to what you had if the upgrade does not work out for you.&nbsp;There&nbsp;should be a utility program on your computer for doing that.

            <p>My ASUS K-55A has intel hd 4000 video adapter. I have been in W10 insider program since the start in Oct. 2014. Yea, there was a problem with getting an windows update for intel adapter driver in early builds. Actually now when I install a preview build
 from iso file my video adapter will be Microsoft HD adapter and not intel. But after few hours I will get an update from Microsoft with latest intel HD video adapter. I am currently running W10 build 10130 and my HD video is using an intel 4000 adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would still give W10 a try if you really want to see what its like. But you have to accept that they may be problems with your pc on some builds. (that's what happens during early test versions). If you wait until July 31st there will be polished version
 of Windows 10 to run. If you do update to published version you will still have recovery option to go back to Windows 8.1</p>

            <p>Driver support will mature and Intel will develop Windows 10 drivers in collaboration with Microsoft, however, if you want to ensure that your upgrade is smooth, or if this is your only computer, or you need it to reliably perform important tasks, please
 wait at least 3 months after the July 29 release to do your install. &nbsp;That way you will be able to google search "C55-A5100 Windows 10" to find out if there are significant issues and whether they are resolved or not. &nbsp;The free upgrade offer will extend through
 the first half of 2016 so there's no need to rush.</p>
<p>As of July 29, although they will release it as "finished", Windows 10 is an OS that will never be finished. &nbsp;It's a work in progress, rolling release model OS, different than any other release model Microsoft has used before.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you buy a laptop, this is the situation you frequently get into.&nbsp; Most laptops are custom jobs the OEM manufactures, and generally they take a very dim view of providing new sets of custom device drivers to run in a new OS--as they'd prefer you to buy
 an entirely new laptop, instead...;)&nbsp; It's that decisive lack of general support in drivers and other things that has always kept me away from laptops in general--that and bang-for-the-buck--laptops really stink in that regard compared to desktops (and always
 have.)&nbsp; Portability is vastly overrated...;) </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering what the deal was about Win10 when you bought the laptop--some laptop OEMs offer "upgrade to Win10" incentives of some kind--do you recall anything like that when you bought this laptop? If so, then Toshiba may be planning to whip up a set
 of drivers for Windows 10--it's even possible that your existing Windows 8.1 drivers would work.&nbsp; But Intel is frequently a day late and a dollar short in the GPU department and always has been, so I wouldn't count on this being a priority @ Intel (or Toshiba)
 at the moment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best advice I can give is be patient and investigate and see how this shakes out as regards your laptop--as someone else mentioned, 3-6 months from Win10 RTM you could have exactly what you want for Win10. However, if worse comes to worse, and you have to
 stay on 8.1--it'll work just as well for you as Win10, I should think, and will be supported by Microsoft for several years yet. But laptop customers usually switch OSes when they buy new laptops, which means there's no rush for you in the first year of free
 availability since you are likely to buy another laptop before Win8.1 goes EoL, and it will include Windows 10 and all the drivers and other goodies...!</p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a Nokia Lumia 640 and needless to say I truly miss my old phone, :( but since messenger no longer works on it I decided to upgrade. This phone is quite glitchy- my most recent problem is that some screenshots and a panorama I took yesterday have gone
 and deleted themselves. I tried restarting (and a soft reset) which solved the problem for about 1 minute until the images disappeared again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stressing out over here!</p>
<p>

<p>Your router or accesspoint needs to know the pre-shared key from your N8. You can find this key in the router or accesspoint settings.</p>

            Actually it's the other way round. The N8 needs to know the PSK set up in your wireless router or WAP. We don't have this information, you do because it's YOUR router or WAP.

    <title>Keep getting signed out on Skype for Android - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keep getting signed out on Skype for Android</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying the flip out of me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep getting signed out on Skype for Android - sign in, stays signed in for X amount of time, no longer than a few hours then get message on phone that I've been signed out of Skype and to log back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been since the "new and improved" Skype for Android has been released, previous old dependable app was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted&nbsp; Cache/data etc restarted phone - same issue</p>
<p>Deleted app and reinstalled - same issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalled the old Skype app on my Fire HD tablet on the thought that it may have an issue with older version of Skype installed on another Android/Fire device ( clutching at straws on that I know but don't know what else to try)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me barmy as whats the point of having it on the phone if nobody can get a hold of you because you are signed out ......and no I'm not going to log in 12 times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smartphone is an LG G4 running Android 6.0 - permissions given for all requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice&nbsp; is much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also complained about this on Play store in reviews but don't think anyone else has an issue that I can see</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mick</p>

<p>Signed in there and to check settings to find version number but couldn't find it so went to app settings on phone to get version number. Skype stayed signed in for all of 4 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be a stab in the dark but I am using Skype for desktop on Windows 10 ....not the built in version for windows. But it is also the latest. The only other thing I can think of is that I am singed into Skype on another device but would hardly think
 that should matter.</p>

<h2>            applescript outlook2011 mac for changing&#47;adding category to date determined files</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tens of thousands of e-mails which I grouped in hundreds of folders (my easy way to work). The outlook file has become too big and I need to archive a part of the e-mails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can export and delete only a category based selection and not date determined ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to have a applescript which allows me to make a selection in my mails, based on date (for example sent/received before January 2015). This selection of mails I could add than a new category I made (for example "backup2014") and then I could
 export to archive the .olm file of all mails (chattered over all these folders) older than January 1st ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone can help me with this specific applescript ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Greetings from Brussels</p>

    <title>Counting Unique Entries in a Certain Date Rage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerhh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Counting Unique Entries in a Certain Date Rage</h2>
                    <p>I have a relatively large data set that contains dates, names, and other data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to create a formula that counts unique entries in the name column per month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to create a formula to find the unique names for the entire series:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((CUSTOMERNAME&lt;&gt;"")/COUNTIF(CUSTOMERNAME,CUSTOMERNAME&amp;""))</p>
<p>
</p><p>where NAME is the range of entries, but have not been able to find a way to have it extract from each individual month, for instance to just the number of unique names that appear in January.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was working with this portion of&nbsp;a formula to extract other data by month:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTIFS(...,DATE,"&gt;"&amp;EOMONTH(C3,-1),DATE,"&lt;="&amp;EOMONTH(C3,0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where C3 would contain a date value for the month I'm extracting data from, but I haven't been able to find a way to make these arguments work with each other.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that's clear. Any help would be great. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Excel vs VB.Net handling of Worksheet Ranges To&#47;From VB.Net arrays</h2>
                    <p>After reading up on VB.Net arrays and Excel arrays there seems to be an issue for which I request help.</p>
<p>I hope this Forum's&nbsp;Moderator realizes that an answer can come from either the Excel&nbsp;or VB.Net forum and not just&nbsp;advise me to go to the other forum for the answer which can be avoided by both &lt;--&gt;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Has any Excel Guru&nbsp;found a workaround for the fo;;owing issue?</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>No matter how I create the array in VB.Net <strong>the Ubound record</strong>
<strong>is not included in the Array</strong></u></p>
<p>-- i.e.,</p>
<p>Assume my Excel worksheet range is A1:B5</p>
<p>-- I have five records 1 thru 5</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;zero-based array (VB.Net)</p>
<p>-- I have five "records?" 0 thru 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Row&nbsp;&nbsp; Column A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BBB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;222</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 333</p>
<p>&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DDD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 444</p>
<p>&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 555</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Create&nbsp;an Array&nbsp;in VB.Net</u></p>
<p><font color="#008000"><font color="#008000"><font color="#008000">Dim myArr(,) As Object</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#008000"><font color="#008000"><font color="#008000">ReDim myArr(0 To 4, 0 To 1)&nbsp;&nbsp; - this uses the "0" based convention</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><u>Populate&nbsp;myArr</u>:</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">myArr= Range("A1:B5").Values&nbsp;&nbsp;- this uses the "1" based convention</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in VB.Net , if I query ? myArr(0,0) an error will occur (Because MS programmers decided to make VB.Net inherit Excel's Index convention)</p>
<p>--&nbsp;Therefore according to the "Index-inheriting" I do get "AAA" if I use ? myArr(1,1)&nbsp; [All seems well!}</p>
<p>-- But <strong>if I use the same logic</strong> and query myArr(5,1) I get the error "Index was outside the bounds of the array"</p>
<p>-- Thus the myArr can be accessed</p>
<p>It seems that the Lower bound and Upper Bound limits use different rules!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See this post's "picture" of code as it's author explains perfectly the issue:</p>

            <p>Hi Katie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To give you an overview, starting a Microsoft Office for Windows application in Office Safe Mode can allow you to safely use it when it has encountered certain problems. This is useful when you need to open a file that you can't under normal mode because
 the application is crashing or if you need help in identifying an add-in or extension that may be causing a problem on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you run the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool</a> (OffCAT) 2.2 to analyze Microsoft Office programs for known configurations
 that cause problems. It is a program that provides a detailed report of your installed Office programs. This report includes many parameters about your Office program configuration and highlights known problems found when OffCAT scans your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have additional questions.</p>

<br />
You can open &amp; work with your documents in the 2011 version or 2008. IMHO, though, it's generally preferable to invest in the most current version. Either way, it will be to your advantage to re-save your documents in the newer Open OXML [e.g.,
<i>.docx</i>] file format as you work with them.<br />

    <title>Defective Imprints - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banisters_mind  say:</h3>
<h2>            Defective Imprints</h2>
                    Recently, I have noticed a curious happening with my N81 SD whereby I D/L a podcast via the in built podcast manager, but when I go to play it skips the episode I have freshly D/L'ed and goes to the next in my list.<br />
<br />
When I try to delete what I assume is a defective file I get a general system error message and I cannot delete the file that I know i most certainly not there. However it still shows up in the list. Refreshing my library doesn't help.<br />
<br />
The only solution I have found, thus far, to get rid of the "phantom file" is to back up the phone to my pc, format the memory card then restore the back-up. This removes the defective file name. However this is not sustainable in the longer term.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else encountered this with the N81 or a similar model? Has anyone found a simpler way to refresh their file list without resorting to a full format of the memory card?

Try a hard reset *#7370# and back up before you do this. Hard reset sometimes frees the problem. If this does not work try upgrading to latest firmware ( if available ) or re-install the same firmware again. Again backup the data before you re-install firmware.

            I already have the latest firmware (11.0.045) - if I were to hard reset would I lose that firmware?<br />
<br />
This solution sorta seems like the same action as what I did in my first effort to solve this issue. My feeling is that the "imprint" that is being left behind is stored on the memory card because when I remove the memory card the "imprint" disappears with
 it - hence my reasoning that formatting the memory card was the way to go in the first instance.<br />
<br />
I am not sure that this is a handset problem...however the general sytem error message kind of indicates that it might be huh?

No you will not lose the firmware but only the data on the phone like contacts,messges,images,video and any data you have put in the phone.<br />
You can also try formatting the memory card through phone.<br />

Podcast management seems poor, it's great at getting them, but once listened to there doesn't seem to be any automated way of clearing them out - and the manual method is bust.<br />

    <title>Duplicate or Missing Photos Nokia 820 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephent122  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate or Missing Photos Nokia 820</h2>
                    <p>One of the more maddening 'features' of Windowsphone 8 is the sudden ability to duplicate or even bulk reproduce photos and videos on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My particular scenario tonight was that I took some pictures in a restaurant but they didn't appear in the Camera Roll. I thought it had failed to take the pictures. Other recent pictures were on the Camera Roll. In fact 3 copies of every picture. I thought
 the camera wasn't working and I gave up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back home I synced the photos with the PC. Only one of each came over but there were multiple errors showing the 'duplicate' copies tried to copy. This suggested to me there was metadata or directory entries for these non-existent additional copies. However
 in addition the pictures that I thought had not taken re-appeared during the sync.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to summarise pictures I took didn't appear in the Camera Roll but did copy to the pc and pictures that looked to be duplicated on the Camera Roll in reality had only one copy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had this effect a few times with my Windowsphone. I believe it is the SD card support. I have used two different SD cards and re-formatted them with the phone and the same thing happens. I am fairly sure this is a Windowsphone bug because after the
 sync with the error report all the duplicates disappear and I only see single copies of everything on the phone. I also find that the missing pictures suddenly re-appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like a bug in the SD storage card support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Even I am facing the same problem on my Nokia Lumia 820. This problem started recently, When I click the pictures in my Nokia Lumia 820, It saves twice In the memory card. However, It dose not happen regularly but sometimes.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I think this Is the problem with the memory card (I use Strontium 16 GB Class 10 Memory card) . I am not sure of this. I have also tried formatting the memory card.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Its not just with SD cards. I get duplicate even triplicate pictures on my phone memory, I have experienced right from when I got the phone, I have also tried using various memory cards without any joy, same problem, duplicate photos but mostly phone freezing
 with SD card installed. All the cards I have tried work perfectly in my wifes Blackberry, which points to an issue with my 820. I was hoping the Amber update would solve the issue, no joy there just a few added extras but no apparent bug fixes.</p>
<p>Please cure this Microsoft, word is getting round storage is rubbish on WP8.</p>

            Regarding this issue I have already contacted Microsoft. They said, they have already released updates and issue is resolved. They told me to contact carrier regarding the updates, i don't know when the updates will be released in India and for other country
 updates i am not sure. I suggest you to contact chat support of microsoft and check with them regarding the issue. Because this issue is frustrating and annoying. Even I have changed memory cards thrice thinking that this is a problem of memory card. But this
 is the problem of phone software. This issue started after the amber update. So try contacting Microsoft.

<h3> gta_doum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Form OrderByOn</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am facing a strange issue ! &nbsp;If I use within the VBA code behind a form a ServerFilter, OrderBy and then use OrderByOn = True, it saves the ServerFilter and Orderby with the Form, even if the form is not saved from the VBA code ! &nbsp;And those fields cannot
 be cleared with VBA afterward... So then when the form is opened afterward, the filter and orderby is effective, instead of being empty !</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any workaround ? &nbsp;I really think it is a bug in Access, anyway to report this to Microsoft without paying 259$ ?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Access tends to save the filter and sort order silently, without asking.</p>
<p>One workaround is to put a command button on the form that closes the form without saving its design:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub cmdClose_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.Close acForm, Me.Name, acSaveNo<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Please note that if the current record has been modified, it will still be saved - the acSaveNo applies to the form design only)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could even prevent the user from closing the form&nbsp;a different way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option would be to reset the filter and sort order in the On Close or On Unload event of the form.</p>

<h2>            Problem with &#34;Save As&#34; in Excel Macro.</h2>
                    <p>I have an excel macro that inlcudes a step to "save as" a constant filename.&nbsp; This works fine the first time I run it.&nbsp; The 2nd time I run the macro, I receive the message that the file already exists.&nbsp; I select "replace" the file, and then I receive a run
 time error 1004.&nbsp; Any suggestions on what I need to change?&nbsp; I have tried this with static filenames and filenames that are referenced to a cell.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;' Save file to temporary filename to avoid accidental overwrite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; '&nbsp; Sheets("Info").Select<br />
&nbsp; '&nbsp; ThisFile = Range("C3").Value<br />
&nbsp; '&nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=ThisFile</p>

            <p>I tested with the following code with Test in C3 of sheet Info and it worked every time;</p>
<p>Sub testSave()<br />
Sheets("Info").Select<br />
ThisFile = Range("C3").Value<br />
ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=ThisFile, FileFormat:=52<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Looks like your code is reading the name of another file and trying to save it. Make sure the workbook with the macro is the one which is being saved... Look at the details in the error message box... does it say something like "You can not save as another
 open book"?</p>
<p>you can change ActiveWorkbook with ThisWorkbook.</p>
<p>Try</p>
<p>Sub testSave()<br />
ThisFile = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Info").Range("C3").Value<br />
ThisWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=ThisFile, FileFormat:=52<br />
End Sub</p>

<h2>            High heat in Build 17713</h2>
                    Seems the graphics and other components are working overtime. Two builds back the heat was much less. Frame rates in games up and down, were steady fps.

            Many users are reporting that issue for them as well. I suggest just uninstall and rollback to an older version that didn't cause you that problem until Microsoft fixes it.
<p>

</p><p>Here are instructions to uninstall:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Gmail Groups Not Working Correctly&#63;</h2>
                    Just noticed that my gmail groups are no longer accurate. When sending an email I type in the name of my group and only 6 out of 9 names are listed. The only thing different is I now have Windows 10. Did that cause it? I have deleted the groups and rebuilt
 them, they still don't work. These are groups I have used for 5 years. Anyone know what's wrong or how to fix it? I do use an iPhone and iPad but don't send to groups on them.

            <p>The issue only occurs in Mail.&nbsp; Google Groups works fine if you go to the Google web page and select Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Microsoft Mail problem. I do not think that it is a Google issue as the Google Groups works fine in Windows 7&nbsp;/ 8.1 and in Gmail in Windows 10.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I posted the problem in Windows Feedback where it goes directly to the Microsoft development team. I suggest that you also post it on the feedback link. It will help escalate this issue.
