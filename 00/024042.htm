<h2>            Taking Notes in PowerPoint with presenter view</h2>
                    <p>Question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used android tablets and my ipad pro to present powerpoints or to follow along a professor's lecture in school.&nbsp; Both platforms allow me to enter notes in the presenter view while in the slideshow.&nbsp; I noticed that I am unable to enter notes in presenter
 view on an actual Window's laptop though, which is silly because I thought the full version of Office 365 would allow me to do that.&nbsp; What gives??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting I can turn on so I can do this?&nbsp; It's so unprofessional to toggle back and forth to jot down notes when you are presenting, and I don't know why Microsoft decided to discontinue this important function.&nbsp; I was even able to do it on Office
 for Mac.... please bring this back!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone let me know if it's user error, if if this function simply doesn't exist anymore!!!</p>

<p>This is a Microsoft blunder. There's no direct fix, only workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add an ActiveX text box to the slide, then type notes into during a presentation. Ellen Finkelstein's page shows the steps to take:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/add-notes-during-presentation-slide-show-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add
 notes in PowerPoint in Slide Show view</a></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>You can also use VBA. Here is an example from David Marcowitz (scroll down to 7.13):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.loyola.edu/edudept/PowerfulPowerPoint/Chapter7Examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">7.13 Adds text to an text boxes in an existing slide during
 a presentation</a>&nbsp;These VBA examples are illustrations for David's excellent book on VBA for PowerPoint, so that book gives lots of extra help implementing this.</li><li>You can start NotePad or OneNote before you begin your presentation, then use Alt + Tab to switch programs while presenting.
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you can visit these links in the PowerPoint User Voice forum and add your vote. Microsoft bases their programming priorities based on the votes:&nbsp;<a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288949-powerpoint-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/17444578-better-presenter-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Better

            Thank you for the reply. Since your Office is updated, it could be possible that you need to re-sync your Gmail account to Outlook to reconnect to the server. You can perform this by

 help us to determine if new emails will show up after reconnecting your Gmail.<br />

We look forward to your update.

<h3> bctekguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows Mobile Device Center 6.1 won&#39;t install &#40;WMDC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been installing WMDC for&nbsp;a long time&nbsp;on Windows 7 64-bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The handhelds that are being installed mainly connect via a "USB to Serial" cable to the handheld's serial port</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, for certain clients, after the program installs.&nbsp; The EULA screen doesn't pop up, C:\Windows\WindowsMobile is there but not complete, and there is no icon for WMDC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation instruction do state:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your device must be connected to your PC for the Windows Mobile Device Center to launch after installation"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However since the device is connecting via serial port, I cannot get the program open far enough to switch the settings to point to the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem first occurred a couple months ago, I have dealt with the issue by plugging in a USB Cradle and connecting the handheld that way.&nbsp; The moment th cradle is plugged in MWDC finishes installation, the EULA pops up, I have an icon, and I can go
 in and change the settings to connect via the desired serial port (and permanently put away the USB Cradle).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only guess is that it is related&nbsp;somehow to&nbsp;Bluetooth, because all of these computers that it won't work with have Bluetooth installed.&nbsp; (And an error message about bluetooth comes up in the lower right at the end of the WMDC installation).&nbsp; I have to
 mention that this is a&nbsp;guess, I do not look as closely at machines when everything installs properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have finally run into a situation where a cradle is not available.&nbsp; I've tried directly running the&nbsp;setup.exe,&nbsp;wmdc.exe and mwupdate.msi&nbsp;from C:\Windows\WindowsMobile\Drivers\Serial.&nbsp; This got me an icon, registry entries, and what looks like the proper
 files in the C:\Windows\WindowsMobile </p>
<p>directory.&nbsp; But when I click on the icon WMDC does not start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a way to force WMDC to install?&nbsp; I mainly need to know what instructions are triggered when a device is connected via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello. You can't "force" the WMDC connection to a device. You just have to have everything set up right so that the device is recognized correctly. &nbsp;The connection to the device requires that a setting on the device is correct. This setting is Start&gt;Settings&gt;connections
 tab&gt;USB to PC. There are some variations to what is there depending on the WM version. Usually 6.0 and 6.1 have "advanced network functionality" unchecked and 6.5 has "activesync" ro check . The device will be recognized, drivers will load, and WMDC will open.
 The connection also has a slew of troubleshooting suggestions (firewall, no USB hub, previous partnerships, etc. ) that you may or may not be aware of.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I doubt if BT is a problem. If you have BT activated on the PC and phone, you may get an error message because you should create the USB partnership first before trying to connect via BT. BT also has a set of hoops to jump through.&nbsp;</div>

            I am not trying to "force" WMDC to connect.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;trying to "force" WMDC to install.&nbsp; When you install WMDC, it does not (always) finish the installation process.&nbsp; In certain situations (which are not 100% clear to me),&nbsp;WMDC waits until a USB device is
 connected to finish the installation process.&nbsp; This becomes a problem when the device I want to connect is to connect via serial.&nbsp; You can't tell WMDC to look for a device on the serial port until after it is fully installed&nbsp;and the setting changed.&nbsp; When
 I use a USB cradle to get WMDC to finish installing, I immediately unhook the cradle, switch the settings to use the serial port and everything works as it always has (the cradle is no longer necessary).&nbsp; I have probably installed WMDC (and before that&nbsp;ActiveSync)
 for over 100 clients, I saw this problem the first time 3 months ago.&nbsp; Since then it has come up 3 or 4 times.

            Hello. Do you receive and error message when WMDC fails to install? Have you looked in event viewer to see if there are any clues there? Sometimes running fixmapi.exe helps installation errors. Don't think you can force any software to install unless you
 know what is stopping it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Issue with sending mail from an Alias account after Outlook.com&#39;s migration to Office 365 Exchange Online &#40;Outlook 2013, 2016&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Users have been able to send mails via their Alias account linked to Outlook.com, if they were connected via Exchange ActiveSync in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user's Outlook.com account has been migrated to Exchange Online, then there is an issue:</p>
<p>Outlook 2016 will now send the mail from the outlook.com address account by default only (eg. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding your alias account address to the option to send mail from an address also doesn't solve the issue, since then the E-Mail is sent as the following: John Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; on behalf of John Smith &lt;
<em>alias address </em>&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, having your alias address as the default "From Address" in the Connected Accounts on Outlook.com doesn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>(Gear icon, Options, Mail -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Connected Accounts)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d86eddb3-6c0d-4231-8e7a-ab9afa785baa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d86eddb3-6c0d-4231-8e7a-ab9afa785baa" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this date (5 Oct 2016), it appears that there is not a solution to this issue for migrated Office 365 Exchange Online accounts, and we have been getting reports of this issue from a few of our clients now, as their accounts get automatically migrated
 from Outlook.com. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope that Microsoft will resolve this issue soon, or that the "From Address" function as listed in Outlook.com will populate the account in Outlook 2016, and that the alias account will reflect correctly on sent mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, there is also a great guide from Roady addressing the Outlook.com migration changes, and how to change your settings:</p>

</p><p>Hi DibouLyon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you re-setup your Mail account in Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the attached address in my original post, you need to setup the Outlook Account again, and instead</p>
<p>of adding it as an Outlook.com or EAS account, you now set it up on the first account page, as if you were</p>
<p>linking to an Exchange Account. (This is where the issue I reported then comes into effect though, where the displayed address on the sent E-Mail shows the Outlook.com account, and not the alias account if you have one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I don't understand why they have changed the behavior so that external clients are treated differently to the webmail application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not just the Outlook client that is affected by this, devices using ActiveSync (phones and tablets) are also unable to send through connected accounts.</p>

            Yes, this is a huge problem and is causing me a lot of headaches. I use a Gmail account as my primary business address but have it tied to outlook.com as a connected account, and it's my primary address. It's to the point I've given up on using Outlook
 2016 for the time being and am just relying on the web interface and the Windows 10 mail app.

</p><p>As per the attached address in my original post, you need to setup the Outlook Account again, and instead of adding it as an Outlook.com or EAS account, you now set it up on the first account page, as if you were linking to an Exchange Account. (This is

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that if you want the autoconfiguration of Outlook 2016 to understand that it must use the outlook.com Exhange server, the e-mail address must be from a domain hosted by Microsoft.</p>
<p>This is not my case. There is still another domain and a mail server hosting my address (that just redirects messages to my MS account).
</p>
<p>Therefore, Outlook 2016 misunderstand the situation and configures with the parameters of the external mail server instead of the outlook.com Exchange server.</p>
<p>I wish I could configure ("force" I should say) the Exchange protocol and the address of the Exchange server I want to connect on and not let Outlook 2016 extrapolate it from the extension of the email address (that is also a login name).</p>

            <p>Just to chip in on this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After the migration (which for me was around the start of December). I lost functionality on my connected accounts within Outlook.com, and had to delete and re-add them. After this I found that connected IMAP accounts worked, but no sent mail was saved,
 so ended up configuring them as POP3 (which worked OK). Later I saw the SMTP only option (which was how they were originally configured) but this only worked for about 12 hours, so went back to POP3.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am still configured as EAS in Outlook 2016, and it is more or less working (sending email from my connected accounts). I have noticed though, that if I reply to an email using the Mail app on the desktop or phone then I get the dreaded 'sent on
 behalf of'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the reasons stated above (autodiscover does not work) I am still manually configured as EAS, as autodiscover ends up with my connected accounts details being pulled (rather than the MS configuration) when I try to do the configuration as an exchange
 account. MS solution is to remove all connected accounts, and connect using the @outlook.com account (which is a no go for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following a session with a MS engineer yesterday he stated that the EAS account would continue to work without issue, though I am a little sceptical of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with the comments above, why can't Outlook 2016&nbsp;just pull the connected account 'sent from' details (as you can select when you compose a mail in the browser in Outlook.com. Then everybody could just connect as their @outlook.com account and not
 have to worry about autodiscover not working.</p>

</p><p>Hi Marky</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has, since my original posting, come to my attention that the function of being able
</p>
<p>to send mails via your own domain&nbsp;name "only" in Outlook via the free Outlook.com&nbsp;EAS account
</p>
<p>has been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are able to use this feature if you subscribe to Outlook.com Premium, but this is only</p>
<p>available in the US and I have not explored this option further. (https://premium.outlook.com/#/Offer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have therefore already started migrating our clients over to Office 365 Business Premium, so that</p>
<p>the mail gets hosted on Exchange Online and that they have&nbsp;no further&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not aware of EAS accounts still functioning without having the "on behalf of" name in the sent mails,</p>
<p>unless the account has not been migrated yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally hope that Microsoft reverses this decision, since this decision still affects clients who</p>
<p>don't have their own domain but use a domain from another ISP (gmail, mweb etc etc) and</p>
<p>still want to be able to sync their accounts like they have been and want to send the mail</p>
<p>from their accounts as before and not their Outlook.com alias account.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I recently discovered that it is possible have message marked as sent from your own domain address (that is not @outlook.com) without "on behalf of", either from outlook 2016 in EAS mode or from outlook.com, provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>the account was migrated to the new exchange based outlook.com,</li><li>the alias (either primary or secondary alias of the MS account) used to connect to outlook.com or to setup outlook.com in EAS mode is your own domain address,</li><li>any connected account is removed.</li></ul>
<p>It means that the messages are directly sent from the MS Exchange server in charge of outlook.com, and not from the SMTP server in charge of your own domain mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, it definitely works and the resulting emails do not seem to considered as spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: before migration, proceeding that way led message to be sent from a meaningless MS address, "on behalf of" your own domain one. It is not any more the case.</p>

            I have also been having the same issues as described before with the Outlook 2016 client. As a workaround I have two mailboxes setup in the client. They both connect with the same outlook.com account but one uses EAS and the other Exchange. I can send
 an e-mail correctly with the EAS account. I also use&nbsp;Exchange because it synchronizes tasks and notes and does a better job with remembering RSS-feeds. The downside for now is primarily that I get two reminders for each appointment. I have reversed all the
 upgraded Exchange accounts on the PC's, tablets and mobiles of my other family members to EAS again unfortunately. Hopefully it will work in the future as it did before the migration.

    <title>Mergefield Formatting Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mallacoda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mergefield Formatting Issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a Word 2016 merge template that pulls in values from an external Excel 2016 spreadsheet.<br />
</p>
<p>For one of the fields the data is numeric, with optional decimal places. (named "Wt")<br />
<br />
I've updated the field code in the Word document to:<br />
<br />
{ MERGEFIELD "Wt"\# "0.##" }<br />
<br />
This gives me 1 number field followed by 2 optional decimal places if they exist in the spreadsheet data.<br />
<br />
This works, BUT:<br />
<br />
Source: 12.999 &nbsp; &nbsp;Result: 12.99 &nbsp; // As desired<br />
Source: 12.99 &nbsp; &nbsp; Result: 12.99 &nbsp; // As desired<br />
Source: 12.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Result: 12.9 &nbsp; &nbsp;// As desired<br />
Source: 12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Result: 12. &nbsp; &nbsp; // NOT as desired - decimal point should disappear<br />
<br />
How can I make the decimal point optional, based on whether there are any decimal places to display?</p>

    <title>SharePoint Online Mega Menu links do not work with IE11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil_chadwick  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Online Mega Menu links do not work with IE11</h2>
                    <p>We have started implementing the Mega Menu feature in our latest SharePoint Online sites and this is working very well apart from one scenario.&nbsp; We have a number of legacy applications which require us to use Internet Explorer 11 at present and the mega
 menu is not working correctly with this browser.&nbsp; The problem is that links do not work when set to external sites (outside the tenant) or to list views (from the same site).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to recreate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit the mega menu</li><li>Create a Header menu item called 'TopHeader'</li><li>Create a new Header menu item called 'SubHeader' and select 'Make sub link'&nbsp;so it sites&nbsp;under TopHeader</li><li>Create a URL menu item called SubSubURL' with address <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.google.com</a> (or use a list view such as AllItems.aspx) and select 'Make sub link' so it sits below SubHeader</li><li>Click the menu Save button</li><li>Open a new IE session, navigate to the site&nbsp;and click the SubSubURL link - nothing happens</li></ol>
<p>The above problem has been recreated&nbsp;with different accounts, workstations, organisations&nbsp;&amp; tenants.&nbsp; The problem does not occur with Chrome and FireFox (I've not tested Edge).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, the links can be made to work if you navigate through working menu link items but this is only for the same IE session. If you start a new IE session, the problem returns.&nbsp; Does anyone know a reliable way to get such links to work in Internet Explorer
 11.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your repro steps in details and I can repro the issue by my side(Chrome/Edge is well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, it is not a Bug but another compatibility issue with IE in SharePoint Online, and megamenu is a new feature released in 2019, we need your voice to build the feature better. You can share your experience in
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SharePoint User Voice</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present, please use the other browsers to use SharePoint online, sorry for your inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a workaround will be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>So by saying it's not a bug, you're saying it's "by design" it doesn't work in IE11? I don't think so - Msft promises compatibility with IE11, so any competent developer would classify this as a bug that needs to be fixed. When is that going to happen? And

<p>Hi Shirley,</p>
<p>I'm encountering the same issue. It only happens when I create a new Word Online document.</p>
<p>A new excel or powerpoint online file doesn't have a problem opening up to edit online.</p>
<p>Running Chrome Ver. 47.0.2526.106m. I was also able to replicate the issues in IE ver 11.0.9600.18124</p>

<p>Hi NeilCharlet,</p>
<p>From the screenshot you provided, I noticed that this is an error when opening a word file with Word Online. Therefore, may I know if you create a new document or open a file in SharePoint Online or other online services? Could you share with us the screenshots
 about detailed steps?</p>
<p>To upload images, please click<strong> Use rich formatting</strong> when replying to the post, then click the
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

                    <p>I have to import A table from another DB (as an ODBC). I must then import that table into an existing table in my DB. I know I can copy the table data into my table using Paste Append but I need to prevent duplicate records.</p>

    <title>Conditional formatting for text based on 2 variables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas haleysc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional formatting for text based on 2 variables</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to create a risk register in excel which visually ranks risks based on their frequency and impact but without using numerical data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It needs to be purely text driven, so for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dafa209d-2771-40c5-9461-2cddf34d1d27?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dafa209d-2771-40c5-9461-2cddf34d1d27?upload=true" /></a>
 If both columns D and E contain "High" it should go dark red like this but if column D says "High" and E contains "Low" it should go orange, say. How can you do this by inputting text alone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also included a heat map if you like for the different categories required:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d26312dc-1cc1-4319-9e9b-df058cf811a6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d26312dc-1cc1-4319-9e9b-df058cf811a6?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help, this is all a bit new to me.</p>

<h3> paularoney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Excel with Multiple Windows&#47;sheets</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel workbook that works well with 3 windows open - with a different sheet in each window. It would be good if all three windows would open automatically to the desired sheets when I open the workbook. At present I open the 2nd and 3rd windows
 manually [using the view window option in the ribbon] and manually reset each to the desired sheet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to automate this so that opening the workbook sets up the 3 windows/sheets the way that I want to use them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Change Record Source when Using DoCmd.OpenReport - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carrollotoole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Change Record Source when Using DoCmd.OpenReport</h2>
                    <p>I want to give the user the option of selecting one of several tables to be printed using one report. To do this I created a form on which the user selects the table.&nbsp; Then in the report On_Load procedure&nbsp; I wrote some code that changes the report record
 source based on the users selection. </p>
<p>This works fine when the report is launched using an argument of acViewReport in the DoCmd.OpenReport statement. However, when I use the acViewNormal argument to print the report, the record source is not changed.
</p>
<p>I have narrowed it down to the fact that the On Load event is not executed when acViewNormal is used. I have tried other events such as On Open and On Got Focus with no success.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Meant to add that you can use a distinct delimiter character&nbsp;suxh as ~&nbsp;to separate multiple strings in OpenArgs and then in the form/report's Open event use the Split function to separate them into elements of an array.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the Split function topic in
 the VBA offline Help for details and examples.

            You can pass multiple arguments as a tokenised string, as you suggest, and then parse it.&nbsp; In simple cases this is commonly done.&nbsp; Many years ago, back in the old CompuServe MsDevApps forum, Stuart McCall posted code for a module to automate this, but
 it only worked for passing literal values. In response to another user I developed Stuart's module to allow for named arguments to be passed.&nbsp; You'll find this in the demo file Args_2K.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169<br />
</a><br />
Note that the demonstration of passing an argument list only simulates this because, as I said, Stuart's original code only works for a literal string, not variables.&nbsp; The method for the passing of named arguments in the demo can be transferred directly to
 an application, however.&nbsp; Whether you pass an argument list or named arguments, the arguments are numbered, so can be retrieved by number in both cases, or by name or number when an argument is named.<br />

<h2>            Word 2013 - Page Layout does not match Print Preview</h2>
                    <p>I have spent dozens and dozens of hours meticulously putting my 117 page document into just the right layout, and it looks perfect in Print Layout view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I go to print it, the Print Preview sticks in extra blank pages and otherwise distorts the carefully crated work that I have spent so much effort on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get Word to print my document as it shows it in Print Layout view?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real nightmare after all this work to have no WYSIWYG -- a true nightmare, since there seems to be no way that I can control my document in Print Layout view so that I actually get what I want when I print it. I thought the WYSIWYG issue was solved
 long long ago, But the problem is alive and causing (IMMENSE) trouble in Word 2013,</p>

            <p>I have sent a copy of the file to Doug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to Suzanne's question, I have no Odd Page section breaks. I have only Continuous and Next Page section breaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Section 1 is page 1 to the upper part of page 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On page 3, there is a continuous section break, so that I can include a 4-column area, which is section 2. This area has a section break at the end of it, which I cannot read because Word does not display the full text of the section break within the 4th
 column. But I am pretty sure that it too is a continuous section break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So section 3 begins on page 3 and continues on pages 4 and following, until a Next Page section break separates the front matter from the first chapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since page 4 is itself a blank page, Print Preview is either inserting the additional blank page just before or just after it, so that there are two blank pages in Print Preview where there is only one in Print Layout view.</p>

<p>You are onto something here, but my experiments in trying to fix things are not successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Section 2 does end on an odd page, page 3. And sure enough when I put the cursor on page 4, the page numbering shows it as 5 and not 4 in the Print Layout view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what do I do to fix it?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding enough entries to the 4-column table to push the Continuous section break onto the next page. And that does eliminate the extra blank page. But it screws up the page numbering of Section 3 by numbering the blank page as "i" when what I really
 want is a completely blank page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either I can get the blank pages to show the same in Print Preview and Print Layout view OR (exclusive OR) I can get the page numbers to show correctly, but I cannot get it to do both.</p>

            <p>There is another thought here. I am wanting all my numbering to start on the odd pages. I don't know if there is some default that wants to start page numbering on the even pages, but there seems to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied the file and completely eliminated the first two sections, so that the third section (TOC and Foreword) were the first section of the new document. The page numbering is now right. But the Print Preview shows the first page of the new section as
 a right-hand page when the Print Layout view shows it as a left-hand page (which is what I want).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is maddening. I have spent hours experimenting with different magic permutations of section breaks and page numbering schemes ... all for naught.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We really need WYSIWYG, which I thought had been solved long ago but clearly has not. I don't know what Microsoft Word's developers are telling themselves to justify the way it is now, but they are deluding themselves. If you can see it on the Print Layout
 view, then you should be able to print it as you see it.</p>

<p>I would be very happy not to have the blank page in Print Layout view, IF I really could get Print Preview to show it the way I want. Eliminating the page break and thus the blank page in Print Layout view does NOT solve the problem. The resulting Print
 Preview now shows no blank page at all. I can get zero or I can get two, but I cannot get one blank page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change the Continuous section break at the end of the 4-column table to a Next Page section break, then it automatically changes the Continuous section break at the start of the 4-column table to a Next Page section break ... which is not what I want,
 since the table has to be on page 3 after the text that is still in section 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to the original configuration and replacing the Page break after the end of Section 2's Continuous section break with a Next Page section break does not work either. Now, not only am I back to two blank pages, but one of them has a page number
 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Telling me what the symptoms are confirms that you are onto the right problem, But I have no clue what you think the answer is, and everything that I try to implement some interpretation of your notes does not solve the problem. Please be very specific about
 what configuration of section breaks that I should be using to achieve what you think I should be able to achieve.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Cory,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Disable the security program and check in clean boot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>I suggest you to perform the clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the below article on how to perform a clean boot to know “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I suggest you to perform the steps from the section<strong> “Manually reset Windows Update components” from the below link and check if it helps.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</a>

 the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore

    <title>Can&#39;t search for google contacts in messaging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan t leung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t search for google contacts in messaging</h2>
                    I recently got a Nokia Lumia 521 and synced all my contacts via Google and also Facebook. In my "People" list, i filtered all my Facebook contacts and it only has my Google contacts. However, when I search for someone's name in the Messaging Thread, it
 only lets me choose my Facebook contacts (does not show my Google contacts). Since not all my friends post their phone numbers on Facebook, I am forced to copy and paste the number in order to from the People list. Is there a way to fix this? Thanks.<br />

            <p>I would suggest importing all your contacts from Google to your windowsphone account by visiting OUTLOOK.COM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest troubleshooting the Google account. Considering Google's general attitude towards windowsphone, I don't trust their account to work fine on windowsphone at all.
