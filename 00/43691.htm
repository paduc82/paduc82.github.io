<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard not responding after replacing batteries</h2>
                    <p>I've had a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard for probably 3 years or so now. I replaced the batteries in it this morning (the little red blinking light had come on Friday morning, so I decided to go ahead and replace the batteries after the weekend.),
 and the number pad still works, however now to keyboard does not. I tested the new batteries in another device and they worked fine, it's just the main keyboard part that doesn't seem to connect or do anything. I've tried putting the usb into different ports,
 download drivers, and I'm still not getting the main keyboard to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ran into this problem before or know how to fix it? I'm not seeing any sort of reset buttons, so I'm not sure how to make it reconnect.</p>

<p>Hi Holly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboards are basic USB devices, no drivers or reset buttons.&nbsp; It should either work or not work, a partial failure like what you are describing sounds like a fault with the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you try connecting the keyboard to a different computer and see of the main keyboard works?&nbsp; If the problem occurs on a different computer, there could be a problem with keyboard itself.&nbsp; If the problem is with the keyboard, I
 would suggest that you contact Microsoft Support directly at&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus</a>.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creator Update messed up Mail app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markinwpg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creator Update messed up Mail app</h2>
                    <p>On May 17, 2017, I managed to update successfully to the Creators Update for Windows 10, and my Mail app worked perfectly, up until May 23/17. On May 24/17, when I opened my Mail app, the "sync error" icon appeared at the top, along with an error message
 across the top that said: "Your Outlook account settings are out of date", with two options, namely, either "fix account" or "dismiss". When I clicked on "fix account", a window popped up asking me to sign into my email again. After I did so, the Mail app
 worked fine again, until May 25/17. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On May 25/17, when I clicked open the app, it quickly disappeared again, so I had to restart the PC, to bring it back. Then after re-opening the app, it showed the same error message along the top, so again I clicked the "fix account" option, and signed
 in again. When it was done, it showed the pop up window message: "Attention required, All Finished! Your account has been updated successfully". Immediately after I clicked on the "done" button, the same error message reappeared again, but this time, with
 a drop-down arrow. When I clicked the drop-down arrow, it showed the same error message listed 8 times, so after clicking the "fix account" button on each error message, eventually the sync error icon disappeared on the top, but now the account list showed
 9 Outlook accounts for the same email address. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I only have 1 email address, and it works perfectly fine via the Outlook.live sign in. Added into the mix, since the Mail app was started to be used, after I first upgraded to Windows 10 last year, I can only print my emails from the app. How do
 I fix it now? Delete all the accounts, as well as the app, and start over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>... UPDATE ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I researched for similar issues with the Windows 10 Mail App, I found a thread that was posted by "ccchhhrrriiisss" from May 19/17 until May 24/17. According to that thread, the individual was still using Windows 10 Pro; Version 1607; OS Build 14393.1198;
 Mail app Version 17.8126.42377.0, and was not aware of the Windows 10 Creators Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, according to Microsoft Forum Moderator "Mark Bu", a new Mail app was released on May 24/17, after one has updated to Windows 10 Creators version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My "About Windows 10" information is as follows:</p>
<p>PC: Asus Desktop PC M32BF_K30BF</p>
<p>Edition: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version: 1703</p>
<p>OS Build: 15063.296</p>
<p>Processor: AMD A8-6500 APU with Radeon HD Graphics 3.0 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 6.00 GB</p>
<p>System: 64 bit; x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail app Version: 17.8218.40507.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened the Mail app to locate the current version information, via the settings/gear symbol, I noticed that the app seemingly "fixed" itself... now only 1 email account is listed, instead of 9. However, when I updated to Windows 10 Creators Update,
 I remember that both the Mail and Calendar apps were "updated" as part of the long updating process, that for my PC, took a total of 15 hours. Also, after I checked the Store, it indicates that I have the Mail app installed, but no new "released" update is
 found. As frustrating as it sometimes can be to use Windows 10, at least its better than Apple.</p>

<p>Okay, I followed your steps, but when the Command Prompt window showed up, it just had a blinking cursor for 15 to 20 seconds, and then disappears. Immediately, the same error message popped open: "You'll need a new app to open this ms-windows-store"; there
 was an empty box, with the message beside it: "Always use this app"; and a greyed out "OK" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, I took a screenshot of the error message, to prove that I cannot click the okay button, so I had to click somewhere else on the desktop to make it disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I searched online, and discovered that lots of other people tried using the WSReset.exe tool, but also did not fix their issue. There was a video that posted options which involved both "Power Shell" and "Command Prompt" commands, but I'm not
 100% confident in trying those just yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, of the suggestions online, one included locating the WSReset.exe file via the System32 folder. Following
<strong>their</strong> steps worked at fixing the Store app, but after multiple attempts using
<strong>your</strong> steps, the issue was not resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">These are the steps that I followed:</span></p>
<p>(1) Close Store app (if running)... I opened it and closed it just to be sure</p>
<p>(2) In the Start menu search box, typed WSReset ... the name appears on top of list, with "Run Command" underneath</p>
<p>(3) Right-clicked name, and chose "Open file location"... took me directly to the System32 folder</p>
<p>(4) Scrolled down list to locate WSReset.exe file ... its highlighted with the Store icon</p>
<p>(5) Right-clicked on file, and chose "Run as Administrator" ... the screen dims, and box entitled Run as Administrator pops up</p>
<p>(6) Clicked on "Yes" button ... screen goes back to showing the System32 folder, and a Command Prompt window appears</p>
<p>(7) Within Command Prompt window is blinking cursor ... only shows up for maybe 10 to 15 seconds (maximum)</p>
<p>(8) The Store app re-launches itself, and Command Prompt window disappears ... apparently that has cleared the cache, and fixed the problem</p>
<p>

                    <p>Here's a video of the problem: https://youtu.be/Ik13FxQU3Xs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting Windows. I've tried running the troubleshooter for Windows Apps. I don't really know what else to do. This happens on every single free app in the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the third serious error I've had with Microsoft products in the past two months. The first required me to completely reinstall Windows 10. The second required me to create a new Xbox Live account and dump my existing one. I sat on the phone with
 Microsoft tech support for hours with both of those issues and neither of them were able to be resolved. If I don't get this particular error fixed ASAP, I'm just screwed. And it's not like I'm computer-illiterate here, I'm a frigging software engineer. Really
 tired of this crap. Is Microsoft even capable of developing software that works?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just discovered the same issue on the PC that I'm using (Windows 10, 64-bit, build 15063.1088).</p>
<p>Tried running the WSReset.exe file. The Store app re-opened, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try figuring this out quickly, please. It's not an acceptable bug to be deployed for users, and it doesn't help with the Microsoft Store reputation of being bad with apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Pedro, this is what ended up fixing the problem for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign out of your Microsoft account by clicking on your profile icon at the top right of the Microsoft Store</p>
<p>2. After signing out, try to download the app you're having trouble with again</p>
<p>3. It should open a window prompting you to sign in; sign back in to your account through this window</p>
<p>4. The download should now start</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likely, signing out and back in is all I needed to do, but those are the exact steps that worked for me so I figured I would be specific. Good luck, hope this helps!</p>

            Thanks for you advice.<br />
<br />
On December 10, After another crash I got a warning <br />
<br />
"SMART Failure predicted on Hard Disk.<br />
WARNING: Immediately back-up your data and replace<br />
your hard disk drive. A failure may be imminent.<br />
Press F1 to continue."<br />
<br />
So I already had backup using File History but I did another one and bought another Hard Drive which solved the problem. I did clean install of the OS and apps. It seemed to me the problem was Hard drive failure.<br />
<br />
Now everything is running okay.<br />

That other thread was a over a year ago so not relevant.&nbsp; This one was related to memory (Probably your Symantec)<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><strong>These crashes were related to memory corruption (<font color="#FF0000">probably caused by a driver</font>).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem. &nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>

<div><i>If you are&nbsp;<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">overclocking</a></b>&nbsp;(pushing the components beyond their design) you should revert to default at least until the crashing is solved. If you dont know what it is you probably
 are not overclocking.</i></div>

Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
If a known good stick fails in one motherboard slot but not another it is probably the slot<em>.</em><br />

Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition.<br />
Most times it will&nbsp;crash and it will tell you what the driver is, but sometimes it will crash and won't tell you the driver.</div>
<div>Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<strong><br />
Here is the procedure:</strong><br />
Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Start</b><span>&nbsp;</span>and type in "<b>verifier</b>" (without the quotes) and press<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Enter</b><br />
Select "<b>Create</b><span>&nbsp;</span>custom settings (for code developers)" and click "<b>Next</b>"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
Select everything<span>&nbsp;</span><b>EXCEPT FOR</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Low Resource Simulation"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>For Win 8 dont check</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Concurrency stress test, and DDI compliance checking click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers<span>&nbsp;</span><b>NOT</b><span>&nbsp;</span>provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Finish" on the next page.<br />
<b><br />
Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.</b><br />
<b>Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b>If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.</div>

<h2>            Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What update no. is causing the black screen because I want to uninstall it.</p>
<p>2. Have you fixed this problem because I want to download it.</p>
<p>My laptop is up-to-date or so my laptop reads but, really!</p>
<p>3. Is it possible to by-pass the login and just go straight to windows?</p>
<p>In the previous versions of windows, there was not anything like this and there was no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled, stop services suggested. run DISM and scannow and good news. BLACK SCREEN!</p>
<p>4. Where really is the problem on this update?</p>
<p>5. Any suggestions on how to reset to default or anything without destroying windows or my laptop or my games (especially Starwars) or formatting drive C: or watever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your brilliant solutions and thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Alden!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of uninstalling all updates because I don't know which one has the problem. I tried the steps like disabling appreadiness, NVdia web helper services, anti-virus services, malwerbyte services, etc. I tried the OS load default. I uninstalled
 both the video drivers. Did the DISM and Scannow. I was thinking that maybe the problem is the video card or the OS but when I've done all these things still the problem exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suspect that it has really something to do with the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, there was no error when i tried all the steps except for the BLACK SCREEN</p>

<h2>            Windows Installer is corrupted on my Vista computer</h2>
                    
<p>Orignal Title: Windows Installer is corrupted or deleted on my computer. I have tried re-installing/repairing Vista SP2 and Windows Installer 4.5 - neither will install.<br />
<br />
Hi PLEASE help.... I can't install anything on my '****.&nbsp; I can't run a recovery as all my disks are in storage.&nbsp; I have spent two hours talking to Microsoft support who couldn't help.&nbsp; There must be some way I can either fool the system into uninstalling and
 re-installing SP2.&nbsp; Because it's installer that's affected, nothing else can install or uninstall.</p>
<p>I tried going into Computer and Manage and Services but clicking 'start' on Windows Installer wouldn't work because it has lost the thread.</p>
<p>Most grateful for any help as I can't get my work done without the programme I want to install!!!!</p>
<p>Cheers, Sara</p>

<p>Hello Sara Star,</p>
<p>I suggest you try to run&nbsp;a SFC /scannow to fix any corrupted system files?<br />
<span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if there are corrupt files found, most of the time you are going to need your installation CD to fix the files.</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn't help, you need to do an in-place upgrade and repair the installation. If your installation CD is not available, see if you can borrow a Vista CD from a friend
 to repair. <br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Landscape and portrait images__</h2>
                    I am a photographer using Canon gear. My cameras are set to auto rotate images. This does occur in the canon software but not on the windows 7 screen. All landscape stay as landscape and will not rotate to portrait. This is a nightmare when you have a
 couple of hundred wedding files in a folder ready to edit.<br />
Any ideas please. <br />

<p><strong><span>Hi Daveche,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Are you using any program like windows live photo gallery to view the pictures in windows 7?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may use the rotate pictures on import option in windows 7 and check if this helps -</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Connect a camera to your computer by using the camera's USB cable, and then turn on the camera.<br />
2. In the <span><strong>AutoPlay</strong></span> dialog box that appears, click <strong>
<span>Import pictures and videos using </span><span>Windows</span></strong>.<br />
3. To change the settings that are used when importing pictures and videos, click
<span><strong>Import settings</strong></span> in the <span><strong>Import Pictures and Videos</strong></span> dialog box.<br />
4. </span><span>Now select the <strong>
rotate pictures on import</strong> check box i</span><span>n the
<span><strong>Import Settings</strong></span> dialog box, and then click <span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>You may also refer to the below link for assistance-

<p>I don't want to make another thread about this but, I would also like to add my frustrations over the tank! I cannot seem to kill anyone with it, yet the other day on Firestorm some dude killed me an his turret wasn't even close to my direction, an close
 to the tank on the old BF3 the only way you could kill anyone that close was by road-kill, now all THEY need to do is pull the trigger, Me on the other hand have a niice juicy target of NOT one but&nbsp;three enemy's all hiding beside a Container an I cant kill
 one of them even with three different trys, an along comes a AT soldier an one shots me with a smaw frontal shot even though I was 100% health. LOTS of stupid stuff like that happening to me on the tank, I had close to 4K in kills on BF3.</p>

    <title>Xbox one friends not showing on 360 menu during backwards - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one friends not showing on 360 menu during backwards compatibility </h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I have been playing a lot of dirt 3 on backwards compatibility and advised a friend to pick it up. When I go to send him an invite through the 360 menu he doesn't show up on my friends list, so I tried gears and it's the same. They don't seem to
 appear on the 360 friends list, is anyone else having this problem</p>

<p>must be some weird thing that happened, you can only see friends on the 360 BC games if they have been added via the 360, but i think you can also add the friends via the website, not to sure on that one.</p>

<p>Several points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disk Clean up may recover some space, but usually not very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Defragmenting recovers *no* space. What defragmenting does is *rearrange* the used space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You say "<span>there is nothing on it," but that's clearly not correct. You couldn't run disk cleanup or defrag if there were nothing on it. You at least&nbsp; have Windows on it, and almost certainly several application
 programs.<span> </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. So I assume that what you mean is there is relatively little on it. But that is almost certainly wrong too. You probably think that because when you look at the drive, you are not seeing hidden files. By default, you can't see them. Read here https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files
 and follow the instructions. Then report back to use on what is taking up the space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Also please tell us how big your drive is, and how much is free.</p>

            <p>What type of installation are you attempting, upgrade or custom clean install?</p>
<p>Do you happen to have any non-essential devices connected to the system? If so, disconnect them, they might be interfering with setup.</p>
<p>Its possible the USB Bootable drive with Windows 7 Installation files were not properly created. You might want to format the thumb drive and attempt the procedure again.
</p>
<p>you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool</a>)
<br />
This simple tool will help you convert the same image file into to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows 7 Image/DVD is stored, open

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Follow these steps and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step1:
</span></b><span>Restart the computer in safe mode and check if you receive the same error message.</span></p>
<p><b><span>‘A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP’</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> If you’re able to boot in safe mode then, start the computer in clean boot to
 check if any third party application is causing the issue. To configure your computer to clean boot refer the following link.</span></p>
<p><b><span>‘How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state’</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow “<b>Steps to configure
 Windows to use a Normal startup state</b>” from the following link to restart the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span></b><span>I </span><span>would suggest you to perform SFC scan to fix missing/corrupt file and check if that helps. The SFC /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions
 with correct Microsoft versions. For more information how to do SFC/ scan, please follow this link:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> For issues with Windows installer,
<span>follow the steps provided under “<b>Windows Installer issues”
</b>from the article given below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>‘Troubleshoot problems installing and uninstalling programs on Windows-based computers’</span></b></p>

<h2>            Reactivate windows</h2>
                    <p>When I first built my computer I bought windows 10 64bit. After a year of having it with no troubles I upgraded my mobo and its saying activate windows.</p>
<p>I went to troubleshoot and I changed hardware on the device. A screen comes up saying "Just a moment" then the screen goes blank and gives me</p>

Unable to activate Windows

<p>
We can't reactivate Windows as our servers aren't available right now. Wait for a few minutes or try adding your Microsoft account again</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I'd love to not wait an hour to call Microsoft support is there any way to fix this.<br />

<h2>            Sleep and hibernate stopped working on Windows 7 Pro 64-bit. How to fix this issue&#63;</h2>
                    From sometime last week the sleep and hibernate functions on my laptop have stopped working. My laptop was set to go to sleep when lid was closed. I initially thought there could be a problem with the switch so I tried putting it to sleep by manually selecting
 the sleep option. When I do that, the screen goes blank but the then nothing happens. The laptop does not go to sleep. After 5 minutes or so I see blue screen. Same thing happens when I try the hibernate option. Is some driver causing this crash? Any help
 is highly appreciated!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- Have you made any changes to your computer because of which the issue started?<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you to update your display drivers and check if the issue persists.<br />

            MSINFO32 shows numerous network related errors blaming <a href="http://www.carrona.org/drivers/search.php?id=ndisrd.sys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ndisrd.sys</a>.&nbsp; This appears to be a component used for network attached devices (such as a Western Digital MyBook).&nbsp; Network devices also reports winpkfilter miniport devices that are associated with the ndisrd.sys driver.&nbsp; There may also be a WinpkFilter
 Service, but I wasn't able to locate it in the MSINFO32 file.<br />
<br />
Their website ( <a href="http://www.mionet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mionet.com/</a>&nbsp; ) specifically mentions Western Digital devices - so that software may be associated with the errors (Western Digital SmartWare).&nbsp; Please uninstall it and see if that fixed the BSOD's.<br />
<br />
If you need this software <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and</span> if uninstalling it fixed the BSOD's - try downloading a fresh copy from the
<a href="http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Western Digital website</a> to see if it works properly for you.
<br />
<br />
As these are network related errors, I'd strongly suggest updating <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">
all</span> of your networking drivers - to include:<br />
<ul>
<li>Wired (Intel 82577LM Gigabit Network Connection)</li><li>Wireless (Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 AGN)<br />
</li><li>Bluetooth (Personal Area Network)</li><li>Vodafone Mobile Broadband Network Adapter (ZTE)</li><li>HUAWEI Mobile Connect - 3G Network Card.</li></ul>
