    <title>Typing delay in Powerpoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sauravsingla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Typing delay in Powerpoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have gone through numerous posts about cursor delay in Office 2016, mostly in Word and Excel. I have this problem in all the Office products once the word count reaches substantial number with the document having substantial graphs and charts and tables.
 Since I mostly work on Powerpoint 2016 my problem is specific to powerpoint 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also gone through numerous posts on solution without success. Just want to know if Microsoft is working on solving this for Office 2016 and by when the solution is expected. In the meantime, people like us can stop banging our heads against the wall
 and probably revert to the older version of Office to keep our productivity levels normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Saurav,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Charianne</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer the requisite info inline&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time that you encountered this concern? - <strong>
No, I have faced this before. I have worked on Powerpoint 2016 before but the presentation file was not more than 25 slides and the delay was there but bearable. Now I am working on a presentation file which has more than 55 slides and the delay is extremely
 bad. For example, delete one line of text using backspace can take upto 5-10 seconds.</strong></li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? -<strong> I have tried safe boot option disabling all the non Microsoft services, I have tried disabling animations from system performance window, I have tried uninstalling and installing office,
 I have tried creating a new file without any peripheral data (like header/footer/background), I have tried disabling firewall, I have tried disabling anti-virus.</strong></li><li>What is the current version and build number of your Office? To determine which version of Office you are using, click this&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a>.
 - <strong>My current version and build number are - Version 1711 (Build 8730.2127)</strong></li><li>Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling Office? - <strong>Yes tried that as well without success. And all updates seem to be already in place</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major productivity killer. Currently I am managing by breaking the presentation file into smaller files. But delay is still there.</p>

<p>Hi Charianne</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer 2.2 which gave 9 informational issues - nothing to fix.</p>
<p>After that I also tried online repair and reinstall - took about 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly the issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal experience suggests, it is some compatibility issue between Windows 10 and Office 2016. By the way, yesterday I tried Windows 10 with Office 2010 on another computer which doesn't seem to have the issue with my 55 pager Powerpoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you have some other trick to try, I think I will revert to powerpoint 2010 post Christmas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>We understand that you have already uninstalled and reinstalled your Office app. However, it is possible that the components of your Office apps were left on the computer, which could be the reason why you are still having issues even after uninstalling
 it. In this case, we suggest that you completely uninstall Office by using the easy fix tool. To do this, follow the instructions under

<p>Hi Charianne</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the previous step there has been some improvement in powerpoint performance. The delay has reduced, however it is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, if earlier it was taking 5-10 seconds to erase a line of text. It is now taking 4-6 seconds to erase a line. And while typing there is still delay, as characters appear after I am done typing. Seems like it is because of windows 10 animation.
 Let me know if there is a way to disable this animation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're still experiencing some delays in PowerPoint after repairing and reinstalling it, we suggest doing some advanced troubleshooting such as performing a
<strong>Selective Startup</strong> to determine if another program is conflicting with PowerPoint. By doing that, we'll also be able to know if it has something to do with the Windows 10 animation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please visit this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/PowerPoint-isn-t-responding-hangs-or-freezes-652ede6e-e3d2-449a-a07f-8c800dfb948d#bkmk_advanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>. You'll see all the
 troubleshooting steps that you could try. Some steps that you did are already listed on the link. At the bottom part of the support article, you'll see the directions for the advanced troubleshooting. You can also visit this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026206/windows-get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a> for more details on how to go to your startup settings in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope it resolves the issue. Please provide an update.</p>

    <title>Alternatives to Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul wolf &#40;pwolf&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternatives to Skype</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know of a good alternative to Skype for voice calls that will allow me to set a caller ID and use my contacts on my Mac (either Apple Contacts or Outlook Contacts)?&nbsp; Plain Skype will allow me to set a caller ID (which I designate as my cell phone
 number) but in version 8 I can't use the Skype spotlight to search my contacts for a person to call (I can only search the Skype directory).&nbsp; Alternatively Skype for Business will let me search my contacts but I can't designate a caller ID.&nbsp; I am using Skype
 for my home office as a VOIP solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't understand why Skype does this.&nbsp; I am a paying subscriber (regular Skype) and would happily ditch it for an alternative that actually works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I open multiple instances of Word or Excel from Office 2010 Pro 32-bit, do they each get their own memory allocation, up to 2GB each?</p>

<p>Would this apply to any well-behaved app, Adobe Acrobat, for example?</p>

    <title>A Report based on Crosstab Query asks for parameters twice, why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlm101  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Report based on Crosstab Query asks for parameters twice, why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Using the query&nbsp;wizard, I generated a Crosstab-Query that uses two parameters, [StartDate] and [EndDate].&nbsp; Running the Crosstab-Query I am prompted for the parameters (once time for each) and then the query generates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I later used the report wizard to create a Report from the Crosstab-Query. When I run the Report I am prompted for the [StartDate] and [EndDate] parameters twice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first set of prompts&nbsp;must have dates&nbsp;entered or it will fault immediately.&nbsp; Any valid dates entered for the first set of parameter prompts is disregarded.</li><li>The second set of prompts is where the parameters get the data to generate the Report.&nbsp; Entering&nbsp;valid dates for the second set of prompts lets the&nbsp;report generate.</li></ul>
<p>Functionally it works, however it is a cumbersome to have to enter dates twice.
</p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>1. How do I edit this Report so it's down to asking for parameters once?</p>
<p>2. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Access sometimes needs to requery the data source. It may also happen if after previewing the report you want to print it: another set of prompts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend you create a Criteria form with two date fields and a Preview button, and modify your query to "look back" to that form for its criteria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
1. You don't (can't) edit the report to eliminate multiple prompting
<div>2. It happens because, when using a parameter prompt query, every time Access needs to requery the data source it has to prompt for the values.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So the answer is to not use parameter prompt queries. I almost never use them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Instead create a form to enter the criteria as Tom suggests. This works because you can reference a value in any control on an open form using the syntax:</div>
<div>=Forms!formname!controlname</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some added advantages to this are:</div>
<div>a) you can use a date picker to enter the dates</div>
<div>b) you can default the date range to include all records or based on circumstances (i.e default to the previous month)</div>
<div>c) you can verify that valid data values are entered (i.e. the start date is earlier than the end date)</div>
<div>d) you can reference these values to show the date range on the report</div>
<div><br />
<div>And these advantages are just for a date range. You can use list controls to supply other criteria to ensure that valid values are entered.</div>
<div><br />

 message "Powerpoint could not finish creating video do you want to try again".&nbsp; If I take the large photo album and break it down into much smaller groups then I can create many small videos with same jpegs.&nbsp; Why can I not&nbsp;&nbsp;save all into one video file?&nbsp; (about

<p>I don't know how to set the background image to something in the workbook. It appears that Excel insists on using an external picture.</p>
<p>In addition, Word and PowerPoint support saving an embedded image to disk.&nbsp; Excel, unfortunately, does not.</p>
<p>So, I am not sure how one would use an image in the workbook as the source for a background image.</p>

If you check the documentation, you will see that an image in the header/footer is the recommended workaround for Excel's lack of a watermark.&nbsp; But, it's your workbook and obviously you know what's best.&nbsp; So, hopefully, just pasting the image into the worksheet
 will work for you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just delete/comment out&nbsp;the first Sheets("Sheet12").Select and the code *should* work for the active sheet.</p>

Well, if you've tried it and didn't like the result...like I wrote earlier it's your workbook. :)

<p>How are you searching? Can you show your code, or explain what you're doing? Searching in a form shouldn't affect the overall actions of that form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a Datasheet form, your attachment column would show as an image of a paperclip with the number of attachments in parentheses next to that. You would doubleclick that image to bring up the Attachment dialog.

            I had the same problem with my work PC running Vista 32-bit. Disabling Hardware Accelaration solves the crashing issue. Without opening IE, open Internet Options via Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Internet Options and select the Advanced tab and
 tick "Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering" and apply and restart IE9.

<h2>            Your company keeps charging my for thngs I did not approve of</h2>
                    last time i was charged for the Black Ops 3 preorder platinum edition or whatever it's called as well as the standard and I was charged over $158 for that and I had no knowledge of that transaction and was able to get a refund. Now I'm being called by
 my bank saying yet another charge has been attempted for $99, I assume it's another game that I did not download or approve of because I haven't bought any games since I bought Halo when I first got the Xbox around Christmas last year. Could this have something
 to do with my Gold subscription? Does it automatically download games without my permission ? I did not make this charges and I'm very upset and angry that Microsoft is basically stealing my money. If this happens once more I will get rid of my Xbox one and
 never buy ever again.

    <title>Cannot Sync Windows Live Email on E71 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonzap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Sync Windows Live Email on E71</h2>
                    When I go to the Windows Live icon in Messaging, then select Options&gt;SyncEmail - my E71 tries to connect, then times out. If I go to Settings&gt;Email and select Windows Live I get 'Feature Not Supported'.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I configure Windows Live?<br />
<br />
Connectivity for all other Messaging accounts is fine.<br />
<br />
The Messenger functionality of Windows Live is fine - my Hotmail address is entered and can chat no problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Ok I fixed it.<br />
<br />
In Messenger, I signed out, then did Switch Account. Then re-entered my hotmail address, and the next step is given the option to Sync Email at same time as setting up Messenger. I selected it. After completing Messenger set-up, when I go back to Messaging&gt;Windows
 Live then it has now sync'ed ok.

            Backup the phone to your PC and then format the phone's mass memory. Then restore contacts calendar life blog etc...<br />
<br />
I believe most of the files are on mass memory in a folder called cities. I haven't got my phone on me at hte moment but thats where it is. Is space that important that u to wipe maps off?

            Well then Backup as previously said then re-flash the firmware. That will wipe it clean and have no maps untill you D/L nokia maps to it. Thats my only sure fire way to do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please tell me that you already tried tools/apps manager/ ?<br />

            Nokia Software Update.<br />
<br />
It will wipe clean the phone and re-write it again. With everything the same as if it were bought new. If the firmware has been updated then you may get new added features and fixed known bugs or issues with the phone<br />
<br />
P.s dont do it if you dont fully understand how. You can destroy the phone if done incorrectly.<br />

            I believe NSU will only allow you to flash to a newer firmware version or to reflash a version that you previously updated to using NSU.<br />
<br />
I was told this recently but never got round to checking it to confirm.

    <title>Windows automatically installs a bad video driver after a fresh - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dawnpaladin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows automatically installs a bad video driver after a fresh installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone! I'm trying the January build. I formatted my hard drive and installed the build from a DVD to make sure everything was nice and clean. When setup finished, I started clicking around and playing with Cortana. Windows 10 looks great. I was
 at 1024x768 resolution while Windows auto-installed a series of drivers. Eventually it got around to installing a video driver, whereupon my screen switched to its native, higher resolution--and then went black. No mouse pointer, no nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a few things to get video functionality back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiped the hard drive again and reinstalled from scratch. Same result--everything works until Windows installs the video driver.</li><li>Rebooted in Safe Mode and disabled the video card. That doesn't seem to help.</li><li>Rebooted with Low-Resolution Video enabled. That makes no difference.</li><li>Put the laptop to sleep and woke it back up. That gets me a blank, purplish-blue screen instead of a black one.</li></ul>
<p>This is an HP TouchSmart TM2T laptop. Any advice on how to get it working?</p>

            Criteria within a condition are OR'd together. Different conditions are AND'd together. You would need to use a script to AND criteria together.

            Hello
<br />
<br />Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />In Outlook, “NOT” rules need to be set up as exceptions. This sometimes requires you to think differently about the rule or basically “reverse” it.
<br />
<br />Try with this:

            Seems a bit too complicated (I haven't done scripting), more so since, as you point out in https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/rules/outlooks-rules-and-alerts-run-a-script/, the script-running option is not available in Outlook 2016 without a registry change.
 It's disappointing since other email clients including Microsoft's have this option. I guess I'll use the workaround of using the OR connector and moving the message to the Junk folder flagged for review. I do thank you for taking the trouble to answer.<br />

<h2>            Migrate an IMAP mailbox to Office 365 group&#47;shared mailbox</h2>
                    <p>We are looking at migrating mail from an external mail server using IMAP to Office 365 Exchange.&nbsp; I have successfully migrated a user's mailbox, but attempting to migrate data to a shared mailbox fails as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The subscription for the migration user <em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</em>couldn't be loaded. The following error was encountered: A subscription wasn't found for this user.&nbsp; You wouldn't expect it to have&nbsp;a subscription, would you?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How do we overcome this?</span></p>

            Hi Stephen,<br />
<br />
You may use the workaround shared mailbox migrate to Exchange Online as a regular user mailbox and later converted to a shared mailbox through the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you can also consider working with an Office 365 partner to migrate mailboxes to Office 365. You'll find a list of partners in the
<a href="https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/en-us/pcv/search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Marketplace</a>.<br />
<br />
Your understanding will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal
