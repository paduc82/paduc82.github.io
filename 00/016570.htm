    <title>In Outlook 2007&#39;s Calendar folder, how do I display monthly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            In Outlook 2007&#39;s Calendar folder, how do I display monthly calendars and tasks next to the main calendar pane&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I configure the view of my Outlook 2007 Calendar folder so that it displays a Task list and a set of small monthly calendars to the right of the main pane?&nbsp; I had it configured to show these but the small monthly calendars and the Task list mysteriously
 disappeared.&nbsp; The View menu had no apparent way to restore them.&nbsp; But then the small calendars mysteriously reappeared, but below them was a bunch of unwanted links instead of my Task list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screen shot of how my Calendar folder appears now.&nbsp; I'd like it to look like this, except (1) get rid of everything on the lower left below the small monthly calendars and replace all that stuff with a Task list; and (2) move the small monthly
 calendars and the task list to the right side of the screen.</p>

<p>Hi Doug:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that my problem has been solved.&nbsp; When I opened a Word file I went to Properties and it said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type of file:&nbsp; DOCX File (.docx)</p>
<p>Opens with: Microsoft Office </p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed it to:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Type of file: <span>Microsoft Word Document (.docx)</span>`</p>
<p>The "Opens with" changed automatically to: Microsoft Word</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Curiously, when I changed one file like I&nbsp;mentioned above, all my other Word files also changed and were fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You asked:<em> If you start Word and then use File&gt;Open and select a file, can you then open it.&nbsp;
</em>Yes, the file would open when using that method but it would not open if I clicked directly on the file.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><br />

<p>Hi WendyAmigó,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be caused by that there are different Office products installed on your computer. For your situation, we suggest you uninstall Office 365 completely using
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
easy fix tool</a>, then install Office 2016 and check if the issue still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joshua</p>

            Ask for an image of the type lable under the battery. This should have the text Nokia Corporation and the Nokia logo.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see a better front shot and verify that it says Nokia above the display.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know where it is made, but I'd guess Finland. I doubt it would be made in Germany.

Why do you doubt that? Many sirocco's have been made in Germany and production of the sirocco ended before the factory in Germany was closed.

    <title>n96 backlight fails to come on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crystal87---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            n96 backlight fails to come on</h2>
                    right ok, i upgraded my phone on sunday 1st march to a n96. it was fine for all of 3 minutes. once the keypad had locked and i slid the top half open the backlight failed to come on. i thought i may have been a little stupid and there was settings somewhere
 that would be changed.&nbsp;So i called up Tmobile, they went through all the settings with me and again same thing happend so they sent me out a replacement which arrived on tuesday morning. Again same thing happened backing light failed to come on. now this isnt
 too much of a prob in the day but at night you try and read your text messages and see whos calling when the screen is black!! i went into the tmob shop yesterday told me becasue i had gone through the tmob helpline they couldnt replace the phone as they had
 no records of the previous one and that id have to go through the tmob helpline again! he began to suggest that it may even be my sim card thats the prob as to have 2 phone do exactly the same thing is impossible. so i called tmob and they sent me out another
 phone which i recieved this morning and as i had expected the same problem AGAIN! called them up and theyre saying its impossible as its different batches so they contacted the tmob shop and i have to go in there today for them to have a good look at the phone,
 she also said that worse case senario i would have to get the phone repaired... now where do i stand with this im getting as you can imagine extremely peed off as ive got better things to do than waitng around for phones to be delivered and unecessary trips
 to the shop. Do i have any rights here, do i have the right to cancel my contract or demand a completely different phone or what someone please help :-(<br />
<br />
many thanks in advance :-)

<p>Ok</p>
<p>For Starters what firmware are you running,&nbsp;</p>
<p>*#0000# on the phone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's v10 upgrade now, options check for updates</p>
<p>, I know T-Mobile released v11 prety promptly which fixes all manner of problems with the phone, but they were a little slow with v12, not sure if this is out yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen the back light thing intermittantly with my t-mobile phone, but not as often as you describe, and a quick swithc off, switch on fixes the problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi abuggsworld,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and see if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<b>Start</b> button, and select <b>All Programs</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<b>Accessories</b>, and select <b>System Tools.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on
 add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the “Disable add-ons” section in the following article for further instructions:</span></p>

    <title>Add a phone call to a Skype group call - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epic.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add a phone call to a Skype group call</h2>
                    <p>Often on our group calls we have members with poor internet and must switch to a phone call during the conversation to keep them in the group. When I try to add a member to the group, there is no option to choose Skype or phone as there was in the past.
 You can only add the person as a Skype caller. See screen shot below, there is a just a toggle button and no drop down option for how to call them. Once they are added, the only option is to x them off. How do I add a person to the group call by phone?</p>
<p>Skype version 8.30.0.50 (says it's the newest version)</p>

            Thanks for your reply. I know how to do this but want to get the old drop down menu where you can choose how you want to call somebody during a meeting, either on Skype on on mobile or home number, rather than having to look up the phone number for each
 persona and entering it manually. Their phone numbers are already part of their Skype profile when I open it since I've already added them. However, choosing how you want to call somebody during a meeting is apparently not possible. I'm not sure why Skype
 would make the product more difficult to use with this new version.

<h2>            Microsoft Lumina 640XL LTE &#38; Windows10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded my Lumina 640XL to Windows 10 with the result that all my people contacts are no longer there and my sms messages have all disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not too worried about the sms messages but I am very concerned about the loss of my contacts and phone numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trawled the internet for a solution and tried most of the suggestions without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contacts and phone numbers were previously simply stored under 'People' without any links to any contacts in email accounts, just added my contacts under 'People' on the Lumina.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried on numerous occasions to 'Import from Sim' but no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really quite unacceptable from Microsoft that such a situation should happen with such important data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution please? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Robertwarder,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the contacts do you want to sync? Local contacts or outlook contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I permanently fix the green camera screen that occasionally - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omarfishir  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I permanently fix the green camera screen that occasionally occurs to my 920&#63;</h2>
                    I get a green screen when using any app that uses the camera. It happens to me pretty frequently, like maybe once a day. I get rid of it by restarting my phone, but I don't want to keep doing this, it is very inconvenient. My screen when i'm using the
 Skype camera, for example, just goes green. The video does not show up to the other caller, it just ceases to work until I restart my phone. Even existing the program and restarting it doesn't work, opening up the regular camera still gives me a green screen.
 Only solution until now is restarting the phone.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another problem i have as well with my 920 is the flash. It just stopped working. for pictures or flashlight apps, my flash just doesn't work anymore, no matter how many resets I do, it just doesn't work..

            <p>Since it is happening across apps, it is an issue that is a) part of the core OS b) H/W fault thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, I can only recommend a phone reset (settings - about - reset) or even ask for a phone replacement.

            Try using a different ring tone as the one you are using may have a low volume.

<h2>            Lumia 950XL is not fully recognized by my windows 10 computer when trying to import photos with USB</h2>
                    <p>My device is attached to my computer by a USB cable. I am trying to view my photos before they uploaded. I have done this before without issue but not since the last update on my phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer shows the phone under my devices and I have run trouble shooter and it says nothing is wrong but I cannot edit photos directly from the phone because neither of my photo programs will find the device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the import button on photos it tells me to connect the device I want to import from even though sleep and charge light came on and phone is plugged in and unlocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My photos are kept on a micro sd card on the phone.</p>
<p>

<p>Don't know if it's a bug or feature, or just a safety thing but on the 950/950XLs I'm testing it only shows the data on the SD card and internal memory when it's unlocked in the file explorer on a pc</p>

            <p>I have been trying to resolve this problem and I have the solution. It's the cable. The mini end is the problem because you can insert it into the phone either up or down. Flip the mini-side if the phone isn't recognized and re-insert into phone. This solved
 my problem 100%. The mini end is not keyed so this causes problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Kera25.</p>
<p>I was unable to perform an automatic repair (failed) and could not open in safe mode since the heyboard cannot be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally went to another PC and downloaded from the following link:</p>
<p>http://support.lenovo.com/au/en/products/Tablets/Yoga-Series/Yoga-Tablet-2-1051/downloads/DS104160</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the correct file for your model you simply go to&nbsp;http://support.lenovo.com/au/en/home</p>
<p>and click on "Tablets" then state the model and series you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The downloaded file for all drivers (screen, keyboard etc.) is always contained in an Intel BYT Platform file</p>
<p>and mine was:</p>
<p>Intel BYT Platform Drivers for Windows 10 (32-bit) - YOGA Tablet 2–1051F/L</p>
<p>
</p><p>It fixed EVERYTHING! (Keyboard and touchscreen). Magic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I promptly then backed up all the drivers on the Tablet in case of need in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wish Microsoft would not remove drivers when they do updates to the operating system. &nbsp;:-(</p>

<h2>            Windows.old still linked to active Modren Apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on latest PC build, and happy that there were less app crashes and it is pretty stable. Today to free up space, I removed Windows.old folder manually (take owenership of folder, then delete).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did delete almost all the files, but only few were not deleted, I regained ~20GB on my SSD, so was happy about it. But I noticed that now Store (beta), Mail, Calendar, Music, Health etc apps crash as soon as they are started. These apps were running fine
 yesterday. The only major thing I did today is removing Windows.old folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I think the apps were linked to folders inside Windows.old, which should not be the case. For now I'm stuck. I reported it in Feedback app, which worked luckily. Also apps like Twitter and Store still work, but new Universal apps are crashing, these
 also include Office Preview apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to test by uninstalling couple of apps and reinstalling again, but then again, Store (beta) is crashing as well, so I don't know how I can reinstall if I remove an app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else had similar experience?&nbsp;Any workaround I should be looking at?</p>

            <p>So, figured it that it was not Windows.old issue, but installation of Visual Studio 2015 RC, which have messed up some DCOM reg permissions (so far what I've researched shows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS needs to create some fixing tools, which user can run as Admin, and it makes the settings back to original / correct state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I'm stuck, and have to use mail via browser. I am planning to to a clean re-install on 29th July.</p>

            I used Disk Cleanup to try and remove my old windows setup files. It mostly worked to clean up my system, but I noticed the Windows.old folder was still there with a number of files still inside. When I've tried to remove these manually, one by one, I
 get a File Access Denied error each time. As I'm setup to multi-boot, I get the same type of error when using a different Windows OS. I agree, something is keeping those files locked down pretty good when it shouldn't be. Disk Cleanup use to work 100% on these
 before.

            I was working the windows.old thing on another thread. It looks like you do not want to be deleting that folder completely. I had similar issues when I completely removed that folder, I lost the start menu and could not launch the few apps I had pinned
 to my task bar. Disk Cleanup is the safest thing to do right now and leave alone the few files left behind in the windows.old folder as windows apparently needs them.

            <p>Just last week, using Windows 10, I had the same problem with current operating files using the old files in the "Windows.Old" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, deleting Windows.old, folder...&nbsp;which was a pain to do because the installed version of Windows 10 was currently&nbsp;using many of these files in windows.old.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting windows.old on my own... left me with my current Windows 10 installation unusable.&nbsp; Windows Store Apps stopped downloading and none of the Known fixes, like wsreset, reassigning Security access rights to certain files, etc worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arrgh!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this time I had Windows Disk Cleanup of System Files do the job and twice...it failed to delete the windows.old folder when "Delete older installations of Windows" was checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now ...here I sit afraid to delete the windows.old folder..because I was forced to "Reset My PC" in order to undo my manual deletion of the windows.old folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...this tells me that the Setup of Windows 10 or&nbsp;Windows 10 Refresh &nbsp;is at fault and does not reassign permissions correctly to the newly installed Windows 10 folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this flaw squeaked on&nbsp;by and was not tested from the git go, I'll never know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I sit with my new refreshed installation of Windows 10 absolutely dependent on my windows.old folder that I so much want to get rid of.</p>

<h3> sherzad---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ovi Store still not working...N8</h2>
                    
<p>I have spent hours on this forum looking for a solution that works.&nbsp; So far, no luck.&nbsp; I cannot activate the Ovi Store app, along with the web browser that comes with the phone.&nbsp; So none of the Facebook/Twitter apps work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this is a result of the "hard reset", so there must be a solution.&nbsp; My carier is AT&amp;T and I'm in the US, so I'm not using Anna.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a solution???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            FEEDBACK &#58; Request feature to pull stored passwords into Edge from other Browsers</h2>
                    <p>I have accomplished migrating my favs from other browsers into Edge. &nbsp;LOVING EDGE! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But...how do we pull the stored passwords from Chrome or Firefox into Edge as well? I understand this feature is not yet available and it was suggeested that I send this to you through the feedback app, which I can't seem to find. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It only seems reasonable that this feature should be standard with Edge, so I am officially requesting it and hope you will consider it. &nbsp;Otherwise, I'll have to stick with Chrome or Firefox, and I'd rather not.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>On my PC I no longer have the option to reboot my system into the BIOS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a bug then ok, but I fear it is a design decision and in my opinion an exceedingly bad one. Having to hit F2/Del in a 1-2 second window during boot is a horrible experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curiously, the&nbsp;option&nbsp;<em>is</em> there on my Surface Pro 3 which is also on 10576.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I guess the discussion I'm trying to start is: To which extend should/will/wanna we allow MS to dictate which parts of the Hardware/OS we are allowed to access and control</strong></p>

<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">After the check disk is completed, you may try booting the computer and check if that resolves the issue. If the issue persists, then try performing a&nbsp;<em>SFC</em>&nbsp;scan using&nbsp;<span>SFC /SCANNOW</span>&nbsp;command

<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">You’ll receive “<span>The operation completed successfully</span>” message when each command is successfully executed. Once done, restart your computer and it should boot fine now. This means the&nbsp;<em>MBR</em>&nbsp;is
 fixed now and you can verify it by executing&nbsp;<span><code>bcdedit /enum</code></span>&nbsp;command at&nbsp;<em>Command Prompt</em>. This method is equally helpful to&nbsp;<span>Windows 7</span>,&nbsp;<span>Windows 8 or 8.1</span>&nbsp;users as well.</p>

            <p>It's the fact that it is missing on my PC that bothers me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should, of course, neither love nor hate MS, you should, in my opinion, try to influence MS's design decisions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, it is clearly a design decision not to allow users to 'selectively' update&nbsp;their machines. You can't refuse a driver. Being one that is stuck with a driver that does not work&nbsp;100% (RealTek sound) this did not make me happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I understood (caught onto) MS decision to do just that and now I'm all in favor of 'forced updates'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this removal is simply a 'I-know-best' decision that holds no water. As you say, there is no real problem with getting into the BIOS, but it is harder than necessary. My system passes the F2/Del window very fast, it can take several reboots for it to
 take hold, while before it was a couple of mouse-clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like before, if anyone can explain to me why this is a good decision then I'll be (maybe) happy to change my opinion</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have NO trouble to fix, I simply want to be able to easily get to my system's BIOS. Perhaps to enable an onboard device. How does entering a command prompt help me here?</p>

<p>On my PC I no longer have the option to reboot my system into the BIOS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a bug then ok, but I fear it is a design decision and in my opinion an exceedingly bad one. Having to hit F2/Del in a 1-2 second window during boot is a horrible experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curiously, the&nbsp;option&nbsp;<em>is</em> there on my Surface Pro 3 which is also on 10576.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I guess the discussion I'm trying to start is: To which extend should/will/wanna we allow MS to dictate which parts of the Hardware/OS we are allowed to access and control</strong></p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, how have I survived all these years never even realizing that this is an option :)? Should it be present on Win7? I still run W7 Ultimate on my desktop rig, which has UEFI, but security disabled (because it wouldn't let me dual-boot to Linux). What
 option should it be in Recovery &gt; Troubleshooting? Would it be present in God Mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my laptop I dual-boot W10 Home and W10 Pro Insider, currently on build 10576. But the mobo isn't young enough to have UEFI - would it matter? I see even less options on both of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your actual discussion point, I'd vote for MS to regulate far less and let us users decide more for ourselves. Especially it's plain absurd that I wouldn't be allowed to control my own hardware the way I see fit. The OS is provided, admittedly,
 but it would be much sweeter and way more productive for all parties to agree rather than argue on its usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been Windows user since late 80ies and not always happy about how things have been handled at various turns. And I'm not going to be overly loyal if recent development regarding privacy will be the only new MS way. I'm very sorry, but that's the way
 it just is. I'm happy to share some relevant data if it helps us all get better computing experience, but I want to know what I'm sharing.</p>

            <p>Hi Ripley,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As for your questions:</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it's not exactly in the forefront is it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Sec-&gt;Recovery-&gt;Advanced Startup-&gt;...boot down...-&gt;Troubleshoot-&gt;Advanced Options-&gt;UEFI Firmware Settings
</strong>(see pic from Surface in prior post)</p>
<p>Few, I hope I got that right</p>
<p>I'm 90% plus sure it is in Win7 (on UEFI machines, don't know about others), but that's too long ago for my brain. It was in all builds since W8.0 but has disappeared (on the PC) in build 10576, and that, I think, is a plain bad decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As for your discussion remarks:</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You express my sentiments on the matter exactly, so I see no reason to add to that. But did you know that MS is now developing it's own UEFI-BIOS software? I wonder what options that will give us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post, it is exactly what I hope more Insiders, young and old, would express.&nbsp;Lets have less&nbsp;of this either-love-it-or-hate-hit nonsense that we get so much of these days</p>
<p />

            <p>Thanks for that. I can actually get to that screen from my dual-boot system's boot menu, but there's no UEFI Settings option for obvious reasons. It's plain old AMI BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there are more startup options than in previous systems albeit not to the level of granularity provided by msconfig.exe.</p>
<br />
<p>OTOH my Win7 system is somewhat distorted by Asus, the motherboard maker. E.g. pressing F8 during boot sequence brings out a boot menu but not the usual with Safe Mode etc. Actually the only way to boot into Safe Mode that I've found on this system is via
 BSOD. Hence also other options may differ from standard ones remarkably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my experience accessing BIOS/UEFI hasn't ever played a big role - it's not always easy, but I've always got what needed eventually. Be it installing/troubleshooting/overclocking/updating or else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For disclosure, during my career I have tinkered with dozens if not hundreds of computers both professionally and as a hobbyist, even if I'm not actually a computer tech, more like casual geek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So did you manage to sort out your driver issue? What's your system - desktop, laptop - make/model or custom build...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know that MS was also into BIOS making - come to think of it, isn't it quite natural seeing how deep in hardware manufacturing they are already? I've got practically no experience from Surface devices, wouldn't they be the most obvious candidates?</p>

            <p>You are lucky in that you where not affected by the KB3105208 bug which caused machines with UEFI to actually refuse to boot at all (BSOD). The solution: disable
<strong>Secure Boot</strong> in the UEFI-BIOS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, you&nbsp;only need to access the BIOS rarely but there are times it is inescapable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If also have an Asus MB (currently a Sabertooth Z87) and I have bought Asus MBs/Graphic cards ever since the 90's. On the whole I am very happy with their quality/price. I had forgotten about the F8 option but I also have that and can maybe use that to help
 an another Insider with an Asus T200TA tablet. So thanks for reminding me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your not being a computer techie, well, I have actually seen a so called
<strong>MS Support Engineer</strong> in another discussion post&nbsp;this "solution": Uninstall and then reinstall
<strong>Windows Update</strong>. I mean, given that, you are certainly qualified to call yourself a tech. The very best engineers are not&nbsp;taught, but have learned by experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your question to what problems I have, well, the answer is None. I did get the KB3105208 boot hang but a quick look at this site provided the solution so I got around that painlessly. I have&nbsp;my PC, Surface and two phones running W10 without any
 problems (other then the usual work-in-progress issues that everybody has).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for MS developing their own BIOS: That actually surprised me as I thought the BIOS on the Surface was already made my them, but of course Asus did not create the AMI BIOS in your machine, nor (I think)&nbsp;the UEFI in mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All-in-all, when it comes to hardware/software installation/troubleshooting we seem to be on the same level, but I did make a career as a software developer (started 1982), and that maybe helps me spot/understand issues somewhat easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the important stuff:</p>
<p>You can get the <strong>Safe Mode</strong> startup (and more) from the <strong>
Startup Settings</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my greetings to you Engineer Ripley (The Talented)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of reasons why your Office 365 would crash. Interfering 3rd party programs, Antivirus, corrupted system files, or changes in the Office account setup are only a few of these reasons. We have an article that can help you resolve this crashing
 issue. This article also contains proper steps on how to do a repair. If this is the exact steps you have done for repair, you can skip the first steps and go straight to the last part which will let you download an easy fix for Office. Kindly visit the link

<p>Easy fix looks like a complete removal of Office and complete reinstall. &nbsp;Therefore having to reenter all calendar links, email links etc. in outlook, correct?</p>
<p>Uh, not so easy a fix IMHO.</p>
<p>But no other answer it appears as quick repair and "on line" repair were not successful in fixing the problem and on line repair got me an error 30034-4 which sent me to the page you linked.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If Outlook is crashing can you please post the crash event details.&nbsp; To get those go to the Control Panel and search for Event Viewer.&nbsp; Click View Event Logs.&nbsp; Under Windows Logs click Application Log.&nbsp; In the Application log look for an event 1000 or 1001
 corresponding to the last crash and post those details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only Outlook is crashing try creating a new Outlook Profile,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-F544C1BA-3352-4B3B-BE0B-8D42A540459D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-F544C1BA-3352-4B3B-BE0B-8D42A540459D</a>.&nbsp;
 It might be good to add one account at a time and see if it could be any specific account that could be triggering an issue.&nbsp; You can keep the original profile for reference and if the new one works make it the default.&nbsp; Or you can choose to prompt for profile
 to easily switch between them when opening Outlook.</p>

    <title>Outlook Out of Memory and attached storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cp_ca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Out of Memory and attached storage</h2>
                    <p>I started getting the "Out of memory or system resources. Close some windows or programs and try again" error couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>It happened every time I opened any *.pst file from my Outlook 2010 on Win10.</p>
<p>No configure changes happens in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many others have the Outlook&nbsp;"Out of memory" error through out the years.</p>
<p>Believe me, I have spent hours&nbsp;trying out every suggested solution that could be found online, but none fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, the problem went away when I copy the *.pst file from my external storage to the C-drive.</p>
<p>I am using Microsoft Surface running Win10.</p>
<p>The *.pst files are stored in a memory card inserted into the microSD card reader of the Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It made no sense&nbsp;to me.</p>
<p>So I inserted a USB memory stick&nbsp;to the USB port and copy the *.pst files to the USB drive.</p>
<p>Outlook open the *.pst files from the USB drive with NO error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are both 128GB external storage.</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;two&nbsp;differences between the microSD and USB</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;The microSD card has BitLocker activated, while the USB does not.</p>
<p>2. The microSD card uses exFAT file system, while the USB uses FAT32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion is that the error has to do with updates occurred in the last two weeks with either BitLocker or exFAT.</p>
<p>I want to keep my *.pst files in my BitLocked microSD card.</p>
<p>Any suggestion other than&nbsp;backup &gt; reformat &gt; rewrite?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>

<p>If stored on a usb drive then that usb should be shutdown and safely removed prior to closing win, and should only be connected after the system has been booted up, otherwise you run the risk of pst corruption</p>
<p>Out of memory is a pst specific issue <a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.msoutlook.info/question/518</a></p>
<p>What size is this pst?</p>
<p>A usb stick or microsd both have considerable lower performance than an internal ssd.</p>
<p>Outlook requires full read/write access to a connected pst </p>

<p>The microSD card states in the computer and never removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using USD drive, I use the "Eject" function to unmount, before removing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used tool to scan the *.pst files. They are not corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated, I&nbsp;tried all suggested solutions posted online.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Size of *.pst is not the matter.<br />
I tried removing and closing all *.pst files&nbsp;from Outlook.</p>
<p>Then, created new *.pst file (4K)&nbsp;from another machine.</p>
<p>Outlook can open the new *.pst file from USB drive.</p>
<p>But got&nbsp;"Out of memory and resource" error when opening the new *.pst file from microSD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check the properties of the *.pst files, they are not "read-only".</p>
<p>Outlook has full read/write access to the *.pst files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not complaining about performance.</p>
<p>Outlook was reading/writing my *.pst files perfectly fine couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>We've been having this exact same issue since Windows updates were ran in September '17, though it is not affecting all users.&nbsp; the only "fix" thus far has been to copy the PST files from their home drives on a file server to their local C drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior
 to September this was working properly, and nothing found on the internet has worked so far.&nbsp;

            1.&nbsp; It is affecting random users whose PSTs are on remote storage (file servers).&nbsp; Not all users are affected.&nbsp; We've seen it with Windows 7 and 10; we're using Outlook 2016 (version 1705 build 8201.2193).&nbsp; The issue started on 9/18/17 after installing
 September Windows updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; I am able to open affected users' PSTs on my computer, and if I create my profile on their computer I can open it as well.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; If the user creates their Outlook profile on an unaffected computer they can open their PST files.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; We have tried (unsuccessfully):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a) Uninstalling/reinstalling Office<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;b) Replacing their computer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;c) Uninstalling any recently installed Windows updates on their computer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;d) Uninstalling any recently installed Windows updates on the file server<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;e) Update Office to the latest version<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;f) The registry entry&nbsp; “UseLegacyCacheSize” =1 under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\&lt;version&gt;\Outlook\PST<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; The only thing that has worked is to move their PST from the file server to their C drive.

<p>The provided link does not work.</p>
<p>In addition, there is new problem with bit-locker'ed memory card and Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the daylight savings time ended&nbsp;on Nov 5, the timestamps of all the files on my bit-locker'ed memory card were not adjusted.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I tried to delta backup files on the memory card, 100% of the files were considered out-of-date.</p>
<p>It took me almost&nbsp;15 hours to&nbsp;fix the problem, since the card was encrypted, it took 5 times longer to write to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would the bit-locker problems be fix?</p>
<p>If Microsoft does not support bit-locker, please let me&nbsp;know, and I will seek other encryption technology.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Default Excel 2016 Color Palette - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob_morph  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Excel 2016 Color Palette</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm struggling to set the default Color Palette in Excel 2016. I want it to use the Office 2010 theme. I have read various articles saying I should create a blank workbook, change the color palette to 2010 and then save as a template. I have done this, but
 each new workbook I create still defaults to the Office 2016 color palette. How do I get all new workbooks to then use that theme? Do I really have to choose the template every time I create a new file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<h2>            Why does inserted equation disappear&#63;</h2>
                    I was working on a excel spreadsheet in excel 2013. I had inserted some equations and saved the spreadsheet on my onedrive. Then when I went back to edit it, my equations were gone. Everything else was still there, like my formulas and text. I tried to
 login off and on and reopen it but it still would not show the equation. What is it that I am doing wrong?

            Equations are not supported by the Excel Online / One Drive. It doesn't support any shape also like Text Box etc..Unfortunately, equations are inserted in shapes.
