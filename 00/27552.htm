<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better isolate the issue, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you trying to use the Outlook desktop app or Outlook.com?</li><li>When did the issue first occur?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes before you encounter the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, you can try to access your email account using other browsers to check if you will encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also send us a screenshot of how you can view the folders on your email account. This will help us get a better view of your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>I am experiencing a problem where my folders in my outlook are overlapping. </p>

<p>
</p><p>This has never happened&nbsp; before and I am making sure that each has its own folder and layering the folders with subfolders, but when I add a folder or arrange them, it does this on my computer. Can you please help by responding to this email?
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jocelyn, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have noticed that the post has been idle for quite some time now. You don't need to worry, we'll help you sort this out. For us to isolate the main issue, we would like to know if you're using an Outlook app or Outlook web. Is this issue happening on
 a specific account only? Also, when did the issue first occur?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response. </p>
        </p>

            This is happening on the web, not a phone device. I have noticed it for about 2 weeks from 2/19/18&nbsp;and my co-worker mentioned that the same thing is happening to her account. We both have no idea why.

<p>Thank you for that information. This could be an issue with the Outlook server or with the corrupted file on your account. For us to isolate the main issue, we suggest that you try using a different browser. Make sure also to uninstall one of your antivirus
 applications. Running two antivirus applications may cause conflict on the system which may slow down your computer when opening some programs or applications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same issue persists, try using a different account on Outlook.com. If the issue does not happen on the new profile, there could be some broken system components on your old profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the results for further assistance.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Outlook 2016 has stopped working, wont open in safe mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nutmix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2016 has stopped working, wont open in safe mode</h2>
                    <p>outlook from office 365 64 bit, windows 10 64 bit. &nbsp;Nothing ever archived, and never use offline/cached mode (knowingly at least)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of the blue, outlook wont open in normal nor safe mode, always says "Microsoft Outlook has stopped working" then closes itself.<br />
</p>
<p>I have about 10 email accounts setup, which include two proper exchange (for work obviously), one hotmail (because you need one to use windows), and all the rest gmail (private). &nbsp;I probably have 100k of emails in the inboxes and sent items, as that where
 I leave them so I Can easily find them using the search function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open word and other office programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have wasted so many man hours due to outlook bugs and problems if there was an alternative, I would be using it.</p>
<p>Anyway, there isn't, so now to spend time trying to fix till it fails again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1, delete the OST file</strong>s. &nbsp;(from C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook) This is very painful, as there are 10 of them and they are all about 5GB. IT is going to take days to download them again. It would be great if you could
 just rename them to .ost.bak, see if it works, then if not rename them back but this doesnt work (tried it), it creates new files an starts from scratch again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, didnt help. &nbsp;Now I have days of downloading to look forward to, if I can get outlook working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2, repair pst files. &nbsp;(</strong>It would be great if MS could fix whatever is causing corruption, or automatically detect/repair problems)</p>
<p>This requires finding, then running&nbsp;scanpst.exe. I found no less than 3 copies of this, so I can only hope I have the right one. &nbsp;I choose you,
<strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\scanpst.exe</strong></p>
<p>Frustratingly, after you scan one file, the program closes itself, so you have to find it and run it again for each file. &nbsp;As the start menu search thing doesnt allow you to recall last command, so top tip is to open a cmd box and enter the above command
 with double quotes around, then you can use the up arrow to re-launch.</p>
<p>In my case, after 40 minutes of work it only found "Minor inconsistencies", which I chose not to repair due to the high likelihood of it destroying my life further than it already is. &nbsp;All the pst files were last modified about 8 months ago, which makes
 no sense. Also, why are there pst files when all my accounts are, and have always been, imap or exchange (no pop)?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. </strong>&nbsp;Contemplate death and/or moving to mac. I dont like macs particularly , but in my &nbsp;4 mac years, I had relatively few issues with mac mail, and it has that AMAZING feature that it shows all your inboxes as one inbox. This would save
 me hours a week, as every half hour I have to find, and open 10 sub inboxes to check each one in turn. &nbsp;I must be crazy to continue like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4. Repair office.</strong></p>
<p>Strangely, in "uninstall or change a program" i have office 365 listed twice, once as
</p>
<ol>
<li>"Microsoft Office 365 - en-us"</li><li>"Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus- en-us"</li></ol>
<p>Both have the same install date. &nbsp;Which one is mine?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the first one. &nbsp;I did a quick repair. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 5. Anyone? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found in the past microsoft support to be "have you switched it off and on again" with the mantra "create a new profile, and call us back in a week" even for web apps! No, I want to fix it in my profile. &nbsp;Call me old fashioned, but I don't want to
 have to spend a week reconfiguring outlook with all my accounts, address books, signatures (Which I have no backup), preferences and countless hours of pain. I dont even know what half the account details are (domains, servers, ports, ips, passwords). &nbsp;I have
 never seen an option to back this stuff up.<br />
</p>
<p>My big worry is my contacts. I put all my 1000 vital contacts, which are my private and business life, in my hotmail account. &nbsp;If outlook somehow corrupts or deletes these, and syncs this back to hotmails servers, I am completely stuffed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>== UPDATE 1 ==</strong></p>
<p>So in desperation I but the bullet and created a new profile via the mail control panel app thing, then set it to "prompt for profile". &nbsp;Now when I try to start outlook, it simply hangs (tried leaving it overnight) on "loading profile". This time it does
 not crash. &nbsp;So looks like outlook is completely broken. &nbsp;What options are left? Reformatting the HD, and reinstalling configuring all my apps is probably 5 days of work. I charge my time at £400 a day, so thats £2000 cost of doing this, more than a new Mac.
 I dont have 5 days. I need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>== UPDATE 2 ==</strong></p>
<p>Still no help or advice. I guess we really are on our own when outlook fails catastrophically.</p>
<p>In deeper desperation, I tried the office "online" complete repair option. I am guessing this re-downloads the app as it took a while (the quick repair took about 5 seconds).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can launch outlook and it asks which profile I want. &nbsp;Great, outlook is back. But if I select my profile it stops working again.</p>
<p>So I have no option but to start again from scratch with a new profile.</p>
<p>I spent a hour finding and setting up my accounts again, which is always difficult with two factor authentication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Most accounts are now working, with some problems. &nbsp;In one of my accounts I cant delete any mails, and in others I get all broken links for mails which worked before. &nbsp; What was lost was view preferences, favourites, list columns, contacts views etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>== UPDATE 3 ==</strong></p>
<p>Having found a working workaround to the issue which killed both outlook and my profile, and repaired outlook and created a new profile, &nbsp;I have hit the same problem again. &nbsp;When I add my second MS exchange account (a proper paid for one for my company),
 it has cause outlook to fail ,and corrupted my profile yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that MS has a Major bug when adding exchange accounts. &nbsp;When I try to add the account in outlook, it says "outlook has stopped working...". &nbsp;This is on a brand new install and profile, with only a hand full of other accounts added, and a fraction
 of the total emails I had before. &nbsp;So I did the workaround to the bug that MS has not fixed for some years, and added the account via the mail thing in the control panel. Now outlook crashes as soon as I open it. So have now wasted 3 days trying to get outlook
 working, with no help or support.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>== UPDATE 4 ==</strong></p>
<p>A MS support engineer took control of my computer, and did all the steps I have previously done, and got the same result - after a repair etc. outlook works, but then instantly dies when you add the 3rd exchange account, requiring a full repair+new profile
 cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of desperation, I disabled the remaining 4 COM add-ins, all microsoft:</p>
<ol>
<li>COM Addin for MS Outlook Hotmail connector</li><li>MS Exchange Add-in</li><li>MS SharePoint Server Colleague Import Add-in</li><li>MS Outlook Social connector.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>With these Microsoft add-ins disabled, I can finally add my third hotmail account without instant crashing. &nbsp;So Now I have no COM add-ins enabled. &nbsp;I have lost social connector, sharepoint, etc. which I can live without. &nbsp;The big question is "What features
 do I lose without the MS EXchange add-in enabled"? &nbsp;Unfortunately, the MS technician could not answer this, nor can anyone on the forums so far.</p>

    <title>Excel will not save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pashley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel will not save</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 enterprise with Office 2010 Enterprise. When I work in Excel and try to save the file I get a message "Errors were detected while saving (file name). Microsoft Excel may be able to save the file by removing or repairing some features.
 To make the repairs in a new file, click Continue. To cancel saving the file, click Cancel." If I choose Continue, I get a message "Cannot access (file name)." This problem happens randomly. Other times I get the message "An unexpected error has occured. Autorecover
 has been disable for this session of Excel." Then I am unable to save the document, nor can I open a new document. In both cases I lose any changes to the file. This happens on previously created spreadsheets and newly created spreadsheets. Please help me
 resolve this incredibly frustrating problem. Thank you.

<p>I went throught all those steps and they did not work. What did work was to network my printer instead of having it&nbsp;directly connected&nbsp;to my computer. Also I close Outlook when I want to work in Excel.</p>

<br />
What you describe is normal rounding, not round-up per se.&nbsp; I presume you have a typo and you meant to say that 333.45 rounds to 330 ("nearest ten").&nbsp; If the value is in A1:<br />
<br />
=ROUND(A1,-1)<br />
<br />
Read the ROUND help page for more information.<br />

<p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for this late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All sorted, issue was with the broken / incomplete installation of .Net Framework 3.5 on the machine. I have found out that one of my colleague attempted to install an SQL program to the machine and did not finish the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this has something to do with the Outlook issue. But after we re-installed the .NET Framework and updated the Windows, Outlook start working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt reply and I will take note of some of your tips. Below are the information that might be helpful for you for future references.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately that doesn't appear to be an available option. I thought I'd try a VBA solution but I've also found, or should I say can't find, a straightforward method to do that either. They seem to have left out some important functions in the PowerPoint
 VBA object model.</p>
<p>I suggest sending feedback (Help &gt; Send Feedback) and let MS know that adding multiple images is a desired function.</p>

<p>I'm NOT using the edge browser, but the IE 11 that was installed already in it.</p>
<p>I want to know how to get amazon OUT of this computer!&nbsp; Those cookies are pre-installed.</p>
<p>Amazon has a bunch of them and it doesn't need to trace my movements on the net!</p>
<p>That is really aggravating.&nbsp; It is not listed on programs I can uninstall.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There is an amazon 1button app on the search bar for internet explorer.&nbsp; Guess that's the culprit?</p>

            Since you include "McAfee add in" in your subject&nbsp; line, presumption is that you know that is being cause by it as a result. Would suggest contacting McAfee as the first option since the error is coming from a non Outlook component.

</p>
<p>Disable the McAfee addin which for all intents and purposes, really serves no purpose on a system that has a valid up-to-date A/V installed at the system level. Outlook A/V addins are known to cause more aggravation then their worth and are not required
 in today's environment.</p>

<p>(Personally prefer the "complete uninstall" approach in these cases and then re-installing making sure that the option for the installation of the Outlook addin component is not checked - assuming it's an option since haven't installed McAfee in a very long

<p>I'm having the same problem, but with Windows 8.1 it was OK after the Windows 10 Upgrade McAfee does not work on Outlook 2013. I wish I would have stayed with Window 8.1. Windows 10 SUCKS!</p>

    <title>run.dll files load on IE 8.0 Exit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnk1959  say:</h3>
<h2>            run.dll files load on IE 8.0 Exit</h2>
                    <p>I have a system with windows XP, when I shut down IE 8.0 a run.dll file shows up in the process window for however many times I turn on and shut down IE 8.0. When this happens the fist run.dll uses up 50% of the CPU if theres 2 they are both at 50% 3 then
 2 will be at 25% and one at 50%.</p>
<p>This slows down the computer tremendously to an unusable state unless I select the run.dll and end the process. The system I am currently using does not&nbsp; load any run.dll files when I exit IE 8.0 . I have uninstalled and reinstalled IE&nbsp; 8.0&nbsp;&nbsp;twice with the
 same results.</p>
<p>How do I stop the run.dll's&nbsp;&nbsp;from loading</p>

<p>I started in safe mode one rundll32.exe appeared in the task manager process window when I started IE 8.0 then went away when I shut it down. Then I went into IE 8.0 a few more times and it did not appear at all. I booted back to regular mode and still have

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was working with Halima S last week, this is the last message I sent out and I haven't heard anything back, can you help me out.</p>
<p>Thanks John</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the security scanner and it picked up 3 infected files but when you view the details it only showed 2.</p>
<p>Exploit:Win32/cpILnk.A&nbsp; C:\RAW32\setup50045.Ink</p>
<p>Exploit:Win32/cpIlnk.A&nbsp; C:\RAW32\setup50039.Ink</p>
<p>I went back into IE 8.0 and when&nbsp;I came out I still have the same problem rundll32.exe shows up in the task manager process window using 50% of the CPU.</p>
<p>In C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch&nbsp; there are 7 RUNDLL32.exe files they look like this:</p>
<p>RUNDLL32.EXE-IE8979IC.PF the only difference is the numbers after the dash.</p>
<p>I was going to run the Security Essentials program but I think&nbsp; that&nbsp; is a resident program but I'm not sure and we already have virus and security software running so I don't want conflicks.&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;have Panda Ati Virus.</p>
<p>Whats next and by the way thank you very much for your help so far.</p>

<p>Sounds like your computer is still infected or badly damaged since your last virus attack. Follow the links below and see if any of the troubleshooting steps work. If they do not work. I would then suggest doing a Clean Install of XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be a symptom of malware being on your system. Take a look at the guides below for advice in finding/removing malware from your system:<br />

                    <p>I want to use conditional formatting to highlight the entire row of a report that I created. I'm using a data field named "Permit Status" to and the Field data is the Word "Approved". in Design mode I clicked on the field Named "Permit Status" and clicked
 conditional format. I used the Field Value is = to "Approved". Below are the formulas I used.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Value="Approved"</strong> &nbsp;<em>for the Permit Status field, this worked and in print preview only the fields with "Approved" in them were highlighted green.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Permit Status]="Approved"&nbsp;</strong><em>I used this formula on the other fields in the row &nbsp;and in Print preview none of the fields in the row were green.</em></p>
<p>NOTE: I check the "Back Style" in Properties and it was set to "Normal"</p>

Adding the Card info to a Parent Account is just to confirm, that the owner of the Parent Account is really an Adult. If you are adding the CC only to your Account, He will not be able to use it on His Child Account.</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 - KMS licensed&#47;Xendesktop - rearm issue</h2>
                    <p>HI All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im having real problems around sorting out&nbsp; golden images for XenDesktops and both rearming windows and office to generate unique ID's for KMS activation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, they were really messed up when I started looking at them. Windows side I have managed to sort by resetting the rearm count (reg change in recovery mode). This is now fine and Xendesktops get Unique CMIDs correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now turns out we have same issue with Office 2010. However when I try to run ospprearm it gives error 0xc004d307 (rearm count exceeded). Office is currently activated (managed to get the count to 5) but I still cant see anywhere where the rearm count is
 shown or how to reset it. This appears to be same on 4 different Golden Images we have, so starting fresh isn't really an option. I saw some details around using ospprun.exe but this does not exist anywhere. I've also seen mention that uninstalling office
 and reinstalling will also reset the rearm count. This didn't seem to work yesterday but I am taking another fresh relook at this today.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Theres got to be a way to reset the rearm count for Office2010 (you can do it for windows!), any ideas???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we get the rearm available, I believe the process will be</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. rearm office </p>
<p>2. rearm windows </p>
<p>3. shutdown image and provide this image out to Xendesktops to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p />

            <p>Ok managed to resolve this not only does this get the CMID sorted but the rearm count too!!</p>
<p>I've not done full testing&nbsp;of each step&nbsp;but this is exactly what I did and it works</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Kbfix it ran to uninstall office 2010</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Delete the HKLM\software\Microsoft\office &amp; HKLM\software\Microsoft\officesoftwareprotectionplatform (had to mess about with permissions to do this). This is the main point, something in one of these registry keys must hold both CMID and rearm count.
 Nothing obvious thou. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Reboot and then reinstall office </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. run ospprearm and windows rearm. (office rearm was required for me as I tested this after step 3 to check new CMID was created first). NOTE CMID for office is generated on starting office or anything office related (including ospp.vbs to check CMID).
 If you didn't do this , just windows rearm is required. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If like me you are using Xendesktop and this is a golden image, this is point where you want to power it down, snapshot it and then provide this snapshot to the virtual PC's so they pick up unique&nbsp;CMID's for both windows and office on next boot up&nbsp;:D&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did not try the above solution yet and it appears that today, I'm am sync'd and all looks good.</p>
<p>The solution was to stop the sync and begin the sync process all over again. I'm missing a lot of files online but I they are local and I can copy them back to the cloud.</p>
<p>The initial sync issue, followed by the Windows 10 update (Your files are right where you left them), and another update after that continued to re-surface the sync issue, but with all those updates complete, One Drive for Business seems to be stable.
</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Dear adh36117 ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Please follow tips in this support article about exceeding storage limit <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/storage-limits-in-outlook-com-7ac99134-69e5-4619-ac0b-2d313bba5e9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/storag...</a>
<br />
<br />After you will move all unnecessary emails to deleted items, go to deleted items and select any email, press CTRL+A (this will select all emails) and delete them. After you will delete those emails from deleted items, storage should be released. It is better to do in Private browsing.
<br />
<br />Afterwards please log here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/storage/mailboxStorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/s...</a> and make sure that you have used space less than 15GB.
<br />
<br />Please share the results!

            Dear adh36117 , 
<br />
<br />In this case if you have another Microsoft account you can use it for 30 day trial version and add your main account and delete the emails. Yo can also buy Office 365 subscription for a month and free the space.
<br />
<br />Afterwards you can request an export of your mailbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-mailbox-and-delete-search-history-in-outlook-com-be5335ea-5f86-41ba-892e-de9e4cb16b87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export...</a>, so you will have a backup

            Dear adh36117 , 
<br />
<br />If you followed my suggestions and tried to delete those emails in MS in Private and you cannot do it, than using Office 365 is the easiest way. 
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10, you can add your account to Windows 10 Mail app and delete them there.
