    <title>Buying Chinese Surace Pro 4 and Switching to English language - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Buying Chinese Surace Pro 4 and Switching to English language</h2>
                    <p>I am a native english speaker with very little Chinese language skills and I work in China. I am thinking of buying a Surface Pro4 from a local retailer but the salesman told me in a very broken English that I cannot switch the language to English from Chinese
 and have to buy the English version online. Problem is if I buy from US or Hongkong, the tax will almost double the cost and I have to wait months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried looking for any confirmation on this - so far most comments online seems to say that it is easy to switch language to English by downloading a language pack, but I am very weary as the last phone I bought was in Chinese and could not be switched
 to English so was a wasted purchase (China modified hardware so as not to be supported by Google play, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone from official China sales confirm that I can switch to English from a Chinese retail buy of Surace Pro 4 and that I get the same hardware that everybody else in the world gets?</p>

            <p>The Surface Pro4 "professional edition" is the same price, there is a note on the website if you want to purchase it in China.</p>

            <p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b9f7c112-3fa4-4ea7-87c9-db498685c586" title="Furjio">

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes you can add&nbsp;an English language pack to your Surface Pro 4, this&nbsp;will change many aspects of Windows to English.&nbsp; Be aware that the base language will remain Chinese.&nbsp; There will be functions and features that will remain&nbsp;in the base language, perhaps
 preinstalled software and apps as well.</p>
<p>From what you say, this may be sufficient for your purposes.&nbsp; If you need a fully English&nbsp;device, you may wish to consider a Surface&nbsp;that is born with the English language instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Product ID has Invalid Characters</h2>
                    I purchased through Amazon an Outlook 2007 to install on my new laptop.&nbsp; Unfortunately it seems the Certificate of Authencity is missing a valid Product ID number.&nbsp; There are two series of numbers there, and I tried both only to get error messages such
 as saying "0" is an invalid character in this Product ID.&nbsp; I tried the other one and got an error message saying "1" is an invalid character.
<br />
<br />
Did Amazon sell me a pirated copy or what?&nbsp; They won't even take it back. <br />
<br />
So I am out several bucks.&nbsp;

<h2>            November 2017 Webcam error code &#58;0xa00f4271&#40;0x80070057&#41;</h2>
                    I have a the microsoft life cam-3000. It is an alternative to my computers built-in cam. It is detachable usb drive web cam. I just updated my windows 10 computer on 11/28/17. The camera was working just fine until i updated. After that the camera app
 says "Something Went Wrong. If you need it Here's the error code :0xa00f4271(0x80070057) This only happens when I plug in the web cam and doesn't happen with the built in cam. It also works just fine on everything else but the camera app. Ive done all of the
 suggested alternatives. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ed553d0-ed11-4cbf-908e-32417a16bd3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            We have had a host of the older VX camera issues however very few with the newer HD's.
<br />
<br />So yes, that would make a difference - use the methods in the very bottom link and your original drivers. Uninstall any other drivers you might have used.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to get my screensaver of my photos to be able to have different themes (black and white, collage, travel, etc). I just puchased a brand new laptop with Windows 7 and on the settings portion of my photos screensaver options is says "This computer's

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You are describing 2 different problems.</p>
<p>1. The default&nbsp; Photos&nbsp; screensaver does not have the advanced settings, such as, black and white, collage, travel, etc.</p>
<p>You can download the free&nbsp; <span>
<span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-photo-gallery?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Windows
 Live Photo Gallery 2011</span></span></a>&nbsp; and this will install a Windows Live Photo Gallery Screensaver that includes those advanced settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. The error "This computers video card cannot play themes" appears when the installed video card does not include
 the advanced options that are required to display Themes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since this is a new computer, I would recommend that you check with the computer manufacturers support&nbsp; to make
 sure that device is compatible with Windows 7 and that you have the latest drivers installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know what you find.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi EAsonA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you read the post.&nbsp; I am having the same issue, I did a clean install, not an upgrade, there is no OS to roll back too.&nbsp; Per the guidelines, the activated version of Windows had it's hardware information stored and would activate automatically
 post install.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is where we are, this final step is not happening as described.&nbsp; I Have a Windows 7 Pro key, but no windows 10 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is if you selected for format the original drive, again as per the instructions, there is no Windows.old file.&nbsp; But that isn't what we are looking for anyway.&nbsp; We have a valid Win 7 key, we want to install from that.</p>

    <title>XP and BIOS displays are too large for laptop screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c4istheanswer  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP and BIOS displays are too large for laptop screen</h2>
                    
<p>First some background:</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop. The video card is an NVIDIA GeForce2Go card. It's pretty old, but still works fine except for one unbelievably annoying problem. Basically, the computer thinks the laptop's physical screen is bigger than it actually is,
 which means that the display at all times (whether BIOS, XP splash screen, safe mode or desktop) extends too far by some amount (depending on the resolution size) off the edges of the screen to the right and to the bottom. So, for instance, the windows task
 bar can't be seen unless it's moved to the top of the screen. Similarly, the BIOS setup controls can't be seen because they're below the bottom edge of the screen.<br />
<br />
I have tried everything I can think of from downloading new drivers (tho I don't think that would affect the BIOS anyway) to flashing the BIOS itself. Always the same display problem, right from the start when the computer is turned on.<br />
<br />
The only thing that works is if I boot into Ubuntu from a live CD. Then, magically, the display fits on the screen perfectly and everything can be seen, which is the only reason why I haven't stopped trying to find a solution. But this happens only when Ubuntu
 is running, from inside the Ubuntu OS. When I remove the live CD and restart, back to the same display problem right from the first BIOS loading screen.<br />
<br />
On another forum, someone suggested that "chances are the laptop or graphics card manufacturer has altered the graphics chip, but failed to give it a unique ID, so some OS's may detect the component as something it's not, hence the wrong resolution."</p>
<p>So, I'm wondering if there's any way to look up the unique component ID or change it to the correct one in XP.</p>
<p>Or maybe this isn't the problem at all. Any ideas are welcome, I'm totally stumped!</p>

<p><span>Since the issue is happening before loading Windows, that is in BIOS itself, so there might be some problem with the VGA on mother

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really baffled by this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to install Windows 10 but I get the message that my cpu doesn't support NX.&nbsp; I researched into this and managed to install "CoreInfo".&nbsp; The information on that file showed my processor had support for NX, PAE and SSE2.&nbsp; I even went into the BIOS
 and under the advanced section had XD enabled.&nbsp; Despite all that I still get the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Pavilion P6103uk with Intel Pentium E5200 dual core processor (32bit) running at 2.5ghz, 3GB ddr2 RAM and 640GB hdd.&nbsp; I'm currently running Windows 7 Home Premium and the PC is 5 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<h2>            Error Code 831188FE</h2>
                    I tried signing in this morning and after it asked me to enter my email and password this came up. So I followed what it said on the Xbox site and deleted the profile, cleared my cache twice and re downloaded the profile. But it still keeps appearing.
 What do I do

<p>If you have any accessories [physically] connected to your 360 console (i.e., flash drive, external Hard Disc Drive), try removing them prior to the process of deleting and then re-downloading your profile.</p>

<li>Select&nbsp;<b>Clear System Cache</b>.</li>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Please continue to do the steps that tiadara has said above, but also, try moving your profile into a different storage location like your hard drive or console. This may be the problem.</p>

<p>Hi folks,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear some of you are having issues with that error code.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have recently updated your Xbox 360 console and are having this error. &nbsp;Try deleting the system update. &nbsp;The steps on your dashboard would be: Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage&gt;Highlight hard drive or memory unit&gt;press LB, RB, X, LB, RB, X&gt;Select yes to delete

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I have solved this problem with this procedure:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/errors/error-code-831188fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../error-code-831188fe</a></p>
<p>1. Unplug any accessories attached to your console, such as a headset, the Xbox 360 Chatpad, or the Kinect Sensor.</p>
<p>2. Delete your profile.</p>
<p>3. Clear your system cache twice. </p>
<p>4. Recover your gamertag. </p>
<p>This will help for sure.</p>
<p>Regards for all!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Terry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any hardware or software changes to the PC?</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur randomly or on performing a specific task?</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur at a particular time difference?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur if you have made any recent hardware or software changes to the PC. The issue might also occur due to the missing system files and folders on the PC. Performing clean
 boot will help you in identifying which of the third party software is causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Before performing
<strong>Clean boot</strong> run <strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check for the status of the computer behavior. System freezes and other irregular behaviors is mostly caused due to the unwanted/unused files
 retained in the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the cause of the issue and in certain cases will fix to enhance the performance of the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Maintenance</span></strong><span> troubleshooter will find and clean up unused files and shortcuts present on the system
 and perform maintenance tasks which will enhance the performance of the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

System Maintenance</strong> from the listed options, click on <strong>Advanced </strong>
option and check <strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>After the troubleshooting is completed, check the status for any missing system components on the computer.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;is resolved&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><strong><span>If the issue persists, boot the computer in
</span></strong><strong><span>Clean boot</span></strong><span> state by following the steps below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in
<strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes when at start up the logo is suppose to come up.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Did not install anything or update anything just typed a short pharagraph for English class, then shut down computer. Next day go to boot up the comp and freezes at the logo. I ran the boot diaganostics tool to make sure all parts are working accordingly
 and when I exited and started windows again it goes through. The next time it freezes again, so I use the boot to "warm it up" so to speak and then jump into the safe mode repairs, no issues just restore to previous version suggestion.</p>
<p>Currently running&nbsp;a full systems scan for any unwanted intruders and just updated my two razer devices but I doubt those would be the cause.</p>
<p>I do a full scan like every two weeks and a quick almost every other day. &lt;Microsoft Security Essentials&gt;</p>
<p>No other problems than just that start up.</p>
<p>I have: checked my BIOS, every driver, windows, everything is up to date and running normaly. Ran every windows diagnostic/ repair tool and dell diagnostics not so much as a performance improvement suggestion. Checked my comps's logs for internet processes
 and any transfers of data that may be unapproved. No lack of processing power or memory or anything to&nbsp;that nature. Everything is set to run with my current windows 7 home premium 64 operating system. Even made sure there were no cookies, trash files, etc...
 . </p>
<p>Overall nothing is giving me any information that would even point toward a possible problem and its acting like it just needs to warm up lol (room is at 70 degrees with no more than 33% humidity at any given time unless it rains). If anyone has any other
 ideas im open to them, otherwise prolly get techs to check the actual programming or something. Just really befuddling to me that there isnt any other symptome, though I know they can happen. For now I'll just leaved it loged off instead of shut off.</p>

<br />
1. Are you able to boot to the desktop?<br />
2. </span><span>What do you mean <span><strong>"then jump into the safe mode repairs, no issues just restore to previous version suggestion."?<br />
<br />

            I mean I used safe mode and since it couldn't find anything wrong, the only solution was just boot previous version that worked. Which kind of worked. Got in but the following time I started it, it froze again at the logo

 cause the tools came up with nothing.

<p>Older versions are not available in Official Skype website and we won't recommend downloading from other sources.</p>
<p>You should look for alternative software or contact the software vendor of the program you want to use with Skype and see whether they have alternative ways.</p>
<p>Also look into Skype bots in new version and they might be alternative bot.</p>

                    <p>Watched Satya Nadella on TV talking about Cortana as a big differentiator for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10 I discover this is not available in Europe even in English..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is such a crucial USP I found it odd it is unavailable to 340 mln potential customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the release schedule for Cortana (English) in Europe (excl. Uk)</p>

<p>I hear ya, bud. As a long time Microsoft proponent I am close to giving up on the company. Got the 950XL, and it is a nifty piece of hardware - but the Edge browser and the OS itself is designed to rely heavily on Cortana, so it sucks some hairy....things...at
 the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another matter is that whomever is the current outsource provider for the personal support needs to be terminated. In whatever definition of the phrase pleases you.</p>

            <p>What's also funny is that Cortana does not show up on my system because (assumption) I'm in Austria, not Germany. Austria is right next to Germany and is also a German speaking country. Guess we are to small to matter to Microsoft...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use it when I set Cortana to English, (my entire Win10 install is English in the first place, both of them) but when I use the default region setting I get the message "I'm afraid I'm not available to help in your region"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing goes for the Android app - I can't even download it in my region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess all that great talk about how amazing Cortana is and how they will roll out Cortana as soon as possible is just talk and nothing more. Shame that the non-English speaking world always gets left behind like this even if you speak English.</p>

            What I don't get is why NannyCorp can't put one of their usual checkboxes in there, along the lines of "I accept that Cortana results may not be optimized to my region but enable it anyway" or similar. Reminds me of when Sony hardcoded the BIOS on their
 top end laptops to permanently disable hardware virtualization because it "adversely affected battery life". I had to reveng the BIOS to use it for its intended purpose.

            Indeed. I get that they want their systems to be as good for the consumer as possible, but I see nothing wrong with informing the user that if they use it in a way that it was not designed for it might not work as intended.&nbsp;
