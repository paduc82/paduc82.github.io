            It was stated&nbsp;on the download page that media center functionality (which includes DVD playback) will be removed if the tech preview is installed. Microsoft has not yet stated how or if this will be back in the final version though there are threads where
 people have been able to get this working. Do some searching and you should be able to find everything you need.

            Yeah, just run VLC and you'll be fine. &nbsp;I usually uninstall Windows Media Player anyway (and I don't usually use DVD's anymore either). &nbsp;In fact, the only time I've used Windows Media Player is when I needed to listen to some MIDI files, and the only time
 I've used a DVD in the last many months was to burn the ISO file to install Windows 10.

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm sorry to hear that. Let me try and help you with the issue you are facing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be facing this issue due to several reasons like Windows store cache, security software installed on the computer, third party software conflicts etc.
<br />
<br />
I suggest you to try the following these methods and check if it helps fix the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>Here are the steps to clear the Store cache:&nbsp; </p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <strong>Windows key + R key </strong>and press
<strong>OK </strong>to open the <strong>Run </strong>window.<br />
b. Type <strong>wsreset.exe </strong>and click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If that does not help, let us temporarily disable antivirus or security software.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Warning</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to
 temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if it helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

    <title>Emails sometimes stuck in drafts folder instead of sending - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prjman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails sometimes stuck in drafts folder instead of sending</h2>
                    <p>I've had this issue for the last few months with Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a connected, send-only smtp account that I send emails from. When sending from this account, the emails will do one of two things:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Send right away</li><li>Stay in the drafts folder for one hour, then send.</li></ul>
<p>I can force the emails to send if I got the drafts folder, click on the email in question, and then send it again. I can also get the email to send by sending another email from the same account (both will then send). I've tested this behavior pretty extensively
 to make these determinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has changed on my smtp server, which we manage in house. Again, the behavior started with outlook.com a few months ago. There are no issues sending from Gmail on this same account. This is an Outlook.com only issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked SMTP logs on my end, and don't see errors being generated. In fact, as far as I can tell, emails 'stuck' the drafts folders aren't being attempted to be sent until one hour later. I've tried deleting the accounts from Outlook.com, but the behavior
 persists once I put the accounts back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the best information I can give - any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
When composing an email, it automatically makes a backup of your progress in your Drafts if you've been composing the message for a certain period (time limit depends on your email service provider), and goes to Drafts once you click on Send. This is to make
 sure that you won't lose your progress in case you lose Internet connection or if your computer loses power.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have other concerns.

<p>I appreciate the response, but you are not addressing my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware that the site makes a backup of an email as you are typing it, for the very reason you mentioned. My issue is that, when I click send, intermittently, the email....doesn't send.&nbsp; It stays in the drafts folder, sometimes for up to an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the behavior I'm trying to remedy. Please refer to my initial note above for clarification.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. Unusual behaviors in Outlook.com may sometimes be due to browser issues. You may try optimizing your browser by clearing the cache, cookies, and history, then see how it goes. Also, you may test it on other devices. If the issue
 persists, we encourage you to report the issue to the developers on <strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook UserVoice</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This is not a browser issue, as stated above. The delay in sending email happens in all of my browsers and happens in Windows mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an issue on the outlook.com side, as there have been no configuration changes on our end, and the delay in sending some emails is a relatively new issue (last few months).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple people in our company experiencing the same issue with outlook.com, but the issue does not occur with Gmail.</p>

<p>First, the paragraph marks will not show if you save as a webpage. That is the display in Word. Second, you can pick and choose them.

Showing non-printing formatting marks in Microsoft Word</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is likely that what you've done is change the formatting of one paragraph. A paragraph is everything before the next paragraph mark.</p>

<h2>            mVPN for Symbian &#94;3  &#40;Nokia N8&#41; &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using a PushMail solution with a Nokia E72 and Nokia X6, and in X6 i have had to install mVPN prior to use the Lotus Mobile Connect (VPN Client).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, in Nokia N8, is there any mVPN version to install and work ?</p>
<p>But, I really want to move to Nokia N8, but this problem is stopping me to move to the new phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some job mates reported they installed mVPN S60 5th Ed. version, and then the LMC Client, but LMC didn't show any Access Point in the AP Selection Window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(In S60 5th Ed, if you installed LMC WITHOUT installing mVPN, you'd see the same empty window).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it's like mVPN for S60 5th Ed. is not working in Symbian ^3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards and thanks</p>
<p>Gustavo</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I think you need also a new version of the notes client in your N8. In my knowledge IBM is currently working with it. You can check it from there, here is some guidance:<br />
<br />
If someone needs support with LMC they can either call 800-IBM-SERV and be prepared to supply their customer number, or if they know their number already, they can open an electronic PMR by going here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Gustavo, were you able to run the Lotus Mobile Connect (VPN Client) after you installed the Nokia Mobile VPN? If yes, could you please share how did you configure the VPN?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Rodrigo, LMC didn't work and IBM published a press release saying LMC won't be ported to Symbian ^3/Anna.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, i found an other internal VPN solution, but i decided to move to Android with a new Motorola Atrix 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, i updated my Nokia E6 from Anna to Belle, OS visual design is fancy but no useful.</p>
<p>The screen is small (as usual in QWERTY phones) and i don't find the new UI and font useful enough to still be in Symbian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to try the new Motorola Atrix 2 running Android 2.3.6, with a Dual Core processor and a big battery (1780 mAh) and with fine tune of Social Apps, screen timeouts, WiFi configuration, i got almost the same battery life of my Nokia E6 (but not as
 good as my previous E72).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, again, after several devices (N75, N78, N79, X6, E71,&nbsp; C6-01, E72, E6) i'm leaving this platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Thank you Gustavo, I also updated my Symbian Anna to Belle, and as you said, fancy but worst than Anna regarding usability and portability. Some applications I bought in the past just disappeared and even I need to buy them again or they are not currently
 compatible. Sadly I will evaluate other options too, like Android or iOS for my next phone after several years with Nokia.</p>

<h2>            How to sort a column, excluding the word &#34;The&#34; and &#34;A&#34;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>I am creating a movie inventory spreadsheet using Office 2013. I keep my physical movies sorted in a large bookcase alphabetically by title. But when sorting my physical movies, I do not include the words "the" or "a" when deciding
 where my movie goes on the shelf. Otherwise, I would have a huge section of titles that start with "T" because 50% of my movies have the word "the" as the first word in the title.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>I'm wanting this same criteria to meet my spreadsheet. When I enter a movie into the sheet, I want to be able to sort alphabetically by title and exclude the words "The" and "A."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>For example a list containing these movies is currently sorting alphabetically like this:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Arrival</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Mean Girls</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>The Adams Family</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>The Boy in the striped pajamas</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>The Little Mermaid</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>This above list is incorrect. It should read as:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>The Adams Family</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Arrival</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>The boy in the Striped Pajamas</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>The Little Mermaid</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Mean Girls</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>When excluding the word "The" it organizes the movies as they are organized on my shelf. I know I always have the option of typing titles like "Adams Family, The." But i might as well not even type "the" at all. I would like to
 have the entire title typed as it appears on the movie.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>I believe this is corrected by an IF formula but I can't remember exactly how to exclude those beginning words of the title.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Thanks in advance for the help.</span></p>

<p>if your movie title is in column A then you can create new movie title without 'The' and 'A' in column B using below formula and use column B for sorting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(IFERROR(FIND("The ",A1,1)=1,0),SUBSTITUTE(A1,"The ","",1),IF(IFERROR(FIND("A ",A1,1)=1,0),SUBSTITUTE(A1,"A ","",1),A1))</p>

<h2>            Office Lense imported image resolution falls short</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I tried to import an A0 size image, which is a technical document, where the key feature that Lense should offer, namely OCR fails. When looking at the pdf and zooming in it is no surprise as the resolution doesn't cut it. The image has sufficient resolution
 initially, because if I cut a piece out of it of say 1/8 it works very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a pay version of Lense without these sie limits? I tried the settings menu and set all resolution related settings to max already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or should I just make it a very confusing multi page pdf? I say confusing, because it is a circuit diagram, so it'll become a little hard to follow. The whole underlaying reason for this whole endeavor was to simplify searching for components, by ctrl+f
 the parts in the circuit diagram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Lense not even in the categories on this board????!!</p>

    <title>Weird Windows Update Issue for Windows 10 April 2018 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suat.cini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird Windows Update Issue for Windows 10 April 2018 Update</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to clean-install Windows 10 April 2018 Update and then upgrade to the latest Insider Build because I had Account Verification issue and Microsoft Store issue when in build 17751, 17746 and 17744 after clean-installing build 17744.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prepared an USB Windows 10 flash disk and put the Windows 10 April 2018 update on it. Then I integrated all the patches and drivers to the install.wim up to build 17134.254.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The build installed properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first verified my account. My account got verified with a code sent to my cell phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I visited Windows Update to check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update found the update KB4346783, which was integrated to the install.wim before installation to make the build number 17134.254, along with some other updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the weirdest part is, Windows Update tried to install the update KB4346783 twice, one of which had a description "Internal-Corpnet required" in it&nbsp; as the following screenshot shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a26158b0-746a-4725-a4e9-a9a1eb9a43e9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a26158b0-746a-4725-a4e9-a9a1eb9a43e9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly speaking, I couldn't understand the "Internal-Corpnet required" description but the main problem was, it was stuck in downloading and installation. I waited for a long time but it never started. Besides, I had never seen such an update before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to update to Insider Build 17751 with the iso I made but was unsuccessful. ( I will omit this part because of clarity and simplicity. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I re-joined in my insider program, chose Next Version of Windows and Fast Track, restarted my computer and checked for updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, Build 17751 was there and my computer updated to this build successfully and fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After build 17751, my account stayed verified because I had verified it when in build 17134.254 but my Microsoft Store problem continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me what "Internal-Corpnet required" description is and who is going to resolve Microsoft Store issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't download any new app from the store. When I try to download an app, I get this:</p>

<p>Hi Suat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you doing? Ah, not all fine, … but are probably enjoying yourself |--)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just saw this. Couple of questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who deleted their posts?</p>
<p>Why manually install that patch? Why not rely on WU (after installing the public build?)</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing fine. I also feel fine. I have OS issues but they will eventually be resolved. Thank you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you're also doing fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know who deleted the messages. Either the moderator or himself can delete his messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly speaking, there was nothing wrong with the messages to justify deleting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't manually install any patch. I integrated all the patches ( plus the drivers specific to my hardware ) to the install.wim till the date of clean-installation. My build number was 17134.254 when installation completed. This is the latest build number.
 Then I visited Windows update where what I called the weirdness happened. Pls see my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But EQuito found a web site where my weirdness was said to have happened to other people. Pls see the following web site:</p>

<p>You may check for absolute value less than a threshold which makes sense for you. Read about precision in Excel floating point numbers.</p>

<p>This is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>not</em></span> a rounding "error" due to 64-bit binary floating-point anomalies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, this is simply a formula design error, apparently.&nbsp; See the image below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c585e88b-89fd-4c8b-8261-945796607e0c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c585e88b-89fd-4c8b-8261-945796607e0c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference in D29 is due to an actual difference between D22 (175.165) and D27 (175.17).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, the root cause is due to values with more than 2 decimal fraction digits in E6 and&nbsp;G6, which affect the sums in E16 and G16.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unclear whether the values in E6 and G6 were sourced that way, or they are the result of formulas that failed to explicitly round to 2 decimal places, if that is your intent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to sum only the rounded the values as they appear due to cell formatting, enter formulas into row 16 of the following form (showing E16):</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(ROUND(E4:E15,2))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, explicitly round the formulas that sourced the values in E6 and G6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>PS.... The fact that D29 is -0.00499999999999545 instead of -0.005 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>is</em></span> an example of the rounding anomaly due to 64-bit binary floating-point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside.... Unrelated to your issue, it is always prudent to round arithmetic with numbers with decimal fractions to the precision that you expect the result to be accurate to -- 2 decimal places, in this case. That will ameliorate the effect of binary floating-point
 anomalies. So even the SUMPRODUCT formula should be:</p>
<p>
=ROUND(SUMPRODUCT(ROUND(E4:E15,2)), 2)

<h2>            How Can A System Be Stopped Long Enough to read from CD or USB Flash Recovery&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello To All,</p>
<p>I have a new 17" HP Pavilion with touch screen that I upgraded to Win 10 that is doing some processing that seems to be in a tight loop each time I start it up.&nbsp; There is an indicator light for disk activity and it is always churning away but it will accept
 a shutdown but will not read from the CD or the USB Recovery so I cannot get it to stop so I can query. I have backups so I will not lose anything of value if I kill it(take the hard disk out and wipe it clean so I can start a Seagate CD startup to reload
 the system BUT!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can find out why the system will not break loose so that I may interrupt it long enough to find out what goes????I would like to save the Windows 10 that is installed but will not wait long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could the system be doing that is taking multiple restarts, letting it run for 30 minutes to get some response, something???</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a procedure that can be downloaded for recovering using the USB recovery Flash drive memory?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I need the system back up and running.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>David</p>

</p><p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows&nbsp;10 Insider Preview Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are facing performance issues on&nbsp;your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could&nbsp;be caused due to corrupt drivers or software conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better understanding of the issue, I want to know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Which build of Windows 10 is installed on your computer?</p>
<p>2) Did you make any recent changes on your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the issue, please follow the methods given below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Boot the computer in safe mode.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to restart the computer in <strong><span>safe mode</span></strong> with networking and check if the issue persists.<strong>
</strong>Refer to the link below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>

</p><p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Put the computer in clean boot.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue doesn’t get fix in Safe mode, you may try to restart the computer in
<strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> mode to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Sadly Komal.Soni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not take long enough to read my statements before answering. If I cannot gain entry to the dad burned system, how in heavens name am I going to get it to go into safe mode? Please escalate this to someone else and ask them to read my statements.
 There are a large number of issues and I do NOT want to be anything other than helpful but I would like to have someone on your end who reads the words that I have written, OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is lock up, will not allow a stop even at boot up. This is not some academic exercise, this is the real world. The system locks up at boot and does not turn any means over for me to make input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Since you didn't give a model number, when you start up&nbsp;try hitting&nbsp;hitting F10 to get into setup or F12 for boot menu. after you get into either one you can select boot order.

            <p>I suspect you are more knowledgeable than me but here goes.&nbsp; Can you get to Task Manager or is that off limits to you also?&nbsp; This might tell you what is running and eating up the resources and the option to delete running processes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if you do a forced shutdown, can you get some control before the o/s starts to load?&nbsp; On my HP, I think it is the ESC key that will kick me to BIOS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of ideas.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            <p>Hi Joe and Mel below,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank both of you for your info. Joe, you are correct, I did not give enough info and that was my fault, it is a new HP Pavilion 17 notebook. It has an AMD A4 - 6210 APU with Radeon R3 graphics 4GB RAM and originally had Win 8.1. Hope that is enough information
 to help out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to complicate things, This HP 17 laptop with Win 10 that I am using to reply will not allow me to log into the forum community using Spartan/Edge. I finally had to resort to using Google Chrome to get these messages to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able, using F10 to get into the bios whereas I had always been able to use F2 and F8 on prior systems and using F10 is new. I can now boot from the recovery USB flash drive to go back to Win 8.1 or use the Seagate loader to boot a system that would
 allow me to do a reload of the old OS. I want to save Win 10, if possible, but I do want a dual boot system so that I can boot to either Win 10 or to 8.1 on this unit and to Win 7 or Win 10 on my other 2 units.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to download another Win 10 OS as they charge dearly in this country for each GB downloaded but I guess it is just as well, I can probably get the new 10122 rather than the 10074 that I was/am using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, your information was most helpful and GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Humbly,</p>
<p>David</p>

    <title>Audio Drops Out When Saving PowerPoint &#40;Office 365&#41; To MP4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris panny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Drops Out When Saving PowerPoint &#40;Office 365&#41; To MP4 Video</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 64 bit, 1803, Office 365</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a 7+ minute PP slideshow which has text, pictures and audio. The audio was mixed using Adobe Audition and exported as 44.1k stereo mp3 files. All 8 of the mp3 files were set to 32 float bit depth, 256 kbps CBR. The slideshow plays fine within PowerPoint
 and also as a stand alone PP slideshow, but when I save it as an mpeg 4 video file, I'm getting some audio drop-outs. I've tried saving to mp4 several times and in each case, the sound drops out in the same 2 locations. There are no animations or transitions
 at the occurrence of the drop outs, so I'm not sure why this would happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video has been uploaded to my youTube channel if anyone wants to give a listen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drop outs occur at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>00:56, 5:48</p>

<p>Hi Chris Panny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried to play the shared link and we did not get any drop outs of audio. The issue that you have encountered might be caused by the network connection that you have or the device that you are trying to use. For us to have a better understanding of
 your concern, we’d like to know more details about your issue. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the issue occur on a specific PowerPoint file that you have saved as an MPEG?</li><li>Are you connected to a wired or wireless network connection?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I would suggest that you play your saved MPEG file in other devices to see if you will encounter the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

<p>I want to know how to make the auto increment letter. Generally I was using for number like Dmax("[FieldName]","[TableName]")+1 at the default valve properties of the field.</p>
<p>Thanking you all in advance.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>As advised, I copied the below code, pasted in my new module.</p>
<p>Function IncrementString(ByVal strString As String) As String<br />
'<br />
' Increments a string counter<br />
' e.g.&nbsp; "a" -&gt; "b"<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "az" -&gt; "ba"<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "zzz" -&gt; "aaaa"<br />
'<br />
' strString is the string to increment, assumed to be lower-case alphabetic<br />
' Return value is the incremented string<br />
'</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim lngLenString As Long<br />
&nbsp; Dim strChar As String<br />
&nbsp; Dim lngI As Long<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; lngLenString = Len(strString)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; ' Start at far right<br />
&nbsp; For lngI = lngLenString To 0 Step -1<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' If we reach the far left then add an A and exit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If lngI = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strString = "a" &amp; strString<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Consider next character<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strChar = Mid(strString, lngI, 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If strChar = "z" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' If we find Z then increment this to A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' and increment the character after this (in next loop iteration)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strString = Left$(strString, lngI - 1) &amp; "a" &amp; Mid(strString, lngI + 1, lngLenString)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Increment this non-Z and exit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strString = Left$(strString, lngI - 1) &amp; Chr(Asc(strChar) + 1) &amp; Mid(strString, lngI + 1, lngLenString)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; Next lngI</p>
<p>&nbsp; IncrementString = strString<br />
&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp; <br />
End Function</p>
<p>I called on the form by the Default value on form as below :</p>
<p>=IncrementString(DLast("[SeqNo]","[LettTab]"))</p>
<p>I tried by Dmax but after Z, it will producing for AA only for all the next records, while it should change to AB..then AC and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore I used DLast and it worked perfect, I tested uptill 3 alphabets and its working.</p>
<p>My Query is that it can be called by Dmax, as i am worried if the user by mistake retypes of the field for example some lower Letter sequence then the sequence may get disturbed/wrong as it is depending of the Dlast.</p>
<p>Please advice.</p>
<p>Regards and thanking you all once again for your help and support.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us. Based on your description, it seems the issue happens to all PCs in your company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a test in Excel version 1806(10228.20080) and the issue cannot be reproduced.</p>
<p>I suggest you try <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
performing a clean boot on Windows</a>, then open Excel to check if you can use the Insights add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'd like to confirm the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.Did you have the issue in previous?</p>
<p>2.If it is convenient, could you check if the issue happens in another Internet environment?</p>
<p>3.Please open Excel, go to File&gt;account&gt;capture a full screenshot of <span style="font-weight: bold">
Product Information</span>. (Note to mask your email address.)</p>
<p>4.Does the issue happen in a specific workbook or all workbooks?</p>
<p>

    <title>Several Problems with Ovi Maps on E71 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Several Problems with Ovi Maps on E71</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I am using Nokia Maps 3.03 on my E71 (language: German) plus Nokia Map Loader 3.0, but I am experiencing several problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Nokia Maps goes online via Internet for a few seconds (which costs me) although I set it to my Wireless connection... how can I switch that off?</li><li>Every time I load a new map (and voices) via Map Loader and then start the software on my E71, it tells me that the maps are out-dated and I need to delete them. But then I do not see any maps in the software, and also the load of the voice is gone.</li></ol>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
<p>KaiH</p>

<p>1. That must be the Assisted GPS going online to get a position fix. Disable (untick) everything else other than Integrated GPS in Positioning Methods. So the only thing ticked should be Integrated GPS. Also set the Connection setting to offline in Ovi Maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Using file manager delete the Cities Folder and qf file. Once done, run Ovi Maps once. Then redownload the map data and voice files again using Ovi Suite&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>My browser&nbsp;is Polaris 6.01 from Infrawear INC.&nbsp; (Still rocking the LG 265... aka Rumour 2).&nbsp; When I enter "mobile.live.com", I get an unverified secure connection warning, indicating the identity of the website cannot be verrified.&nbsp; When I try to connect

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to turn the browser's error logging on, but it shows no history of errors upon reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a URL with a simpler logon?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>m.live.com (loads a blank page)</li><li>mobile.live.com (loads a blank page)</li><li>mid.live.com (redirects to mobile.live.com, which reboots phone).</li><li>m.hotmail.com (loads a blank page)</li><li>mobile.hotmail.com (loads a blank page)</li></ul>

<br />
I suggest that you try to access m.mail.live.com or access the link&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com</a> directly. If&nbsp;your mobile device keeps on rebooting even after accessing these links then you may refer&nbsp;to&nbsp;your&nbsp;mobile provider as the issue
 is with the mobile browser intergrated in&nbsp;your mobile device.</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            MS Office Outlook 2010--lock the ribbon open every time outlook runs</h2>
                    <p>Originally posted in outlook.com--hopefully this is the correct location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reboot my computer and open MS Outlook 2010, the ribbon is not visible. &nbsp;I am aware of how to make it visible by clicking the ticker in the upper right. &nbsp;What I am asking is how to lock the view so every time I run Outlook the ribbon is visible.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEVER want the ribbon to hide. &nbsp;Not today. &nbsp;Not tomorrow. &nbsp;Not Monday or any other day. &nbsp;Is it possible to set Outlook to retain my viewing preference with the ribbon visible every time I run it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks<br />

            <p>thankyou. &nbsp;I saw that and no, that is for 2016 I believe. &nbsp;2010 does not offer that in any location I could find. &nbsp;I have my PHD in google and have searched this on more than one occasion. &nbsp;Finally gave up and posted here in hopes that Microsoft experts
 could provide a solution or at a minimum an explanation as to why it does this. &nbsp;It is not a consistent behavior. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>My response is that I do not understand why someone would spend the time to post a "let me google that for you" link. &nbsp;I know how to google. &nbsp;If neither simplemindz nor yourself have actual knowledge of how to answer the question or an explicit link to a
 procedure to resolve the question, it baffles me why you post a reply. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regarding the question, yes, it seems to be somewhat erratic, but I have not spent the time to verify with 100% certainty the exact actions that cause the ribbon to be collapsed when I initially run Outlook. &nbsp;I don't reboot everyday and I don't track the issue.
 &nbsp;IIRC, it was an issue a year so ago--I opened Outlook and the ribbon wasn't visible and I had to google to find out about the ^ since this was a new behavior. &nbsp;I did search this particular issue at the time. &nbsp;The behavior stopped at some point so I forgot
 about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently--December? &nbsp;It happened again. &nbsp;It has happened a few times since then, but it is not consistent. &nbsp; It is a nuisance though when it randomly occurs. &nbsp;I believe it may be related to something like a security or software update, that is not a regular
 event, but I have not been able to find an answer hence, I posted my question here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have actual knowledge of the issue or an explicit link to a solution I would appreciate you sharing it. &nbsp;There are many links to solutions of similar issues with XCEL, Word and apparently Outlook 2016, but I have not found one for Outlook 2010. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> andy_473  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to upload picture on LYNC</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>At my office we have taken picture of my colleges. We would like to use these picture&nbsp;on Lync. But the only way I see that we can&nbsp;use the&nbsp;pictures&nbsp;is by&nbsp; linking&nbsp;the picture to a web page. &nbsp;This is my problem. The profilepictures I would like to&nbsp;upload is
 on a memory stick and I do not want to post&nbsp;all the&nbsp;picture on a &nbsp;web page first and then&nbsp;link&nbsp;each picture from a webpage.&nbsp; Is it possible to just upload the picture into LYNC in some way ? See attachement,&nbsp; The only solution I can see is by showing the picture
 from a web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have office2010. It would also be nice to have the picture on e-mail as well. Is there any guidence for how to get this in use?
</p>
<p>Would appreciate any feedback.</p>

<p>Hello grunty1938,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to merge two Skype account or created an account in Skype using a phone number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that you can only update your Skype account to a Microsoft account once.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you already have a Microsoft account</strong>, we recommend updating it with your Skype account. This lets you access Skype, Office, Xbox and other Microsoft services with a single sign-in and gives your Skype account the same level of protection
 as your Microsoft account. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you don’t have a Microsoft account</strong>, you’ll need to add a verified email address to your Skype account. This makes it easier to get back into your account if you forget your password and allows you to protect your account with two factor
 authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can download the classic version of Skype <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>How can we have it stay at 90%???? &nbsp;this is not good to have to keep changing it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok, so what you did is give me another option of zooming.. and you did it 3 times which is odd. &nbsp;That is nice, but not what i asked.</p>
<p>I asked how can we lock the zoom setting. &nbsp;I set it to 90% and then if i go back in to the same email it is back at 100%.</p>
<p>So again, does anyone know how to lock the zoom here?? that is my question. &nbsp;Thanks though for the other option of zooming..now i can zoom 2 ways and neither of them lock in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real answer is that there is no way to lock the zoom. Weird that it was designed that way.</p>
<p>I saw many users requesting the ability to freeze or lock it in Outlook User Voice. &nbsp;So this needs attention.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Anyway, there is no solution at this time.</span>&nbsp;So no solution is the answer.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Issue with InstallRoot path upon O365 upgrade&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with InstallRoot path upon O365 upgrade&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this has been reported by anybody else in the past but finally, after facing this issue on different computers for over a month now, I'd like to let you know that an upgrade to the recent O365 (2016) releases are actually causing issues with
 the Install Root registry's value. Ideally, upon a successful upgrade/installation, the InstallRoot registry key (at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\[App]\InstallRoot) should have the value - “C:\Program Files {/Program Files (x86)}\Microsoft Office\root\Office
 16\”. However, for some reason, the value being recorded there is - “C:\Program Files {/Program Files (x86)}\Microsoft Office\root\VFS\ProgramFilesX64(/X86)\Microsoft Office\Office 16\”, which is causing a few applications to detect the correct Office application
 version installed on the computer and hence is failing their installs too.<br />
<br />
Is this known? I have noticed that this happens when you upgrade from an already installed MS Office package (even after removing the previous install first). Could you please provide any information on the cause of this and suggested ways to avoid this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ashutosh Sharma

            When you define the Styles, save them to NORMAL.DOT template. There is an option on the Modify Style dialog to save the changes to NORMAL<br />
<br />
The easiest thing is to later copy the NORMAL.DOT to the new "blank" computers so they have the same setup.<br />
