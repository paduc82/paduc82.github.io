</p><p>Hi Jomari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was texting 2 different individuals about charges made repeatedly to my Visa credit card account and they wanted to remote assist me with an issue I have been have with my laptop ever since I was spammed and error codes received an now error with updating
 my machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, unfortunately they were not able to assist me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Insisting instead the charges where legitimate and in fact they didn't see a problem with transactions or event's that are associated with the week in question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not updating calculator on the regular updates?, or finding that it was not updated with regular up dates, should not have been the reason I can no longer update my machine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe my account and machine where compromised and possibly, my credit Visa card account, have deleted payment form on MS and Game in question will no longer purchase anything from MS, regretfully so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been the second such incident within the past 2 month's, the other was not being able to see pre paid for content, even after the release date. For 2 week's after and not until link was sent directly to me in email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            So I can&#39;t talk in a party with only my friends because I&#39;m comm banned&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I sent messages to two people that had a cuss word in it and got comm banned. I didn't get a warning or anything, just a straight up ban. I hadn't played xbox in a long time and I didn't know they turned into sensitive dictators. It's whatever though, I understand that I should be comm banned cause I was mean in the messages. However, I don't understand why I can't talk in parties anymore that are exclusively me and my friends. Does xbox feel the need to censor me from my friends? There's a mute button, a kick button, and a leave party button. Why am I not allowed to talk to my friends? Luckily, this was enough to get them to just buy Overwatch on PC and now we play it on there. Definitely didn't feel like waiting 7 days for me to get unbanned from your **** system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Stay soft, Xbox. Maybe soon your system will completely die out and everyone will realize PC is better anyways. I heard they don't ban people on there cause they said 2 bad words. Haha</p>

    <title>iPods Connected to Console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ermac29  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPods Connected to Console</h2>
                    
<p>I wasn't sure where to put this so I decided to post here. Now, I realize I am an Ambassador but I don't know everything there is to know about the console workings.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my problem/concern/question is when I connect my iPod to a front USB port on my console, it appears the console's Media Player plays the same few songs over and over. I have close to 500 songs on my iPod, I have the Opptional Download which allows for
 iPods to be played. I do select the option that states Play All. Now, when I literally use the player itself it appears to load all the songs contained. However, when playing a game is when the iPod/player plays certain songs.<br />
<br />
I have the player set to Random (I think). When selecting a particular song it repeats said song only until I hit the Next option. When I glance at the iPod itself it has the symbol that it's connecting to the device it's plugged into.<br />
<br />
Any ideas, suggestions would be greatly appreciated&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does your iPod have wireless capability, there are a couple of good apps to look for, the first being MediaConnect. The second SyncStream. If you search the app store you will soon find both apps.</p>
<p>I tend to use mediaconnect myself, it allows you to stream your music,photos etc to any DLNA enabled device wirelessly, I have no issues playing all my songs on the Xbox 360 wirelessly.</p>
<p>search for sync:stream and media:connect on the app store, both are free.</p>
<p>I even stream my photos and music to my internet enabled tv wirelessly.</p>

<p>Edit (wouldn't let me edit the above post) - Mister Darcy, is there any more info you need? When I look at the iPod display screen it shows the rotating arrows signifying it's syncing to the device it's connected to. Would this have anything to do with my
 issue? Should I let it sync and then play when done? Seem though it never ends the syncing though</p>

    <title>Cannot change lock screen background and MISSING REGISTRY FOLDER. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot change lock screen background and MISSING REGISTRY FOLDER.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i premise i clean re-installed Windows 10 following the standard media creation tool a few days ago and i have been using one of my many lockscreen wallpapers without any problems for the last few days until one hour ago.</p>
<p>Today i wanted to change my lockscren wallpaper and after selecting a new one i noticed that it wasn't showing when i restarted,&nbsp;instead i am now getting a blue wallpaper in both my lock screen and authentication screen.</p>
<p>I tried looking for other people with this problem but only found people who couldn't even load the new wallpaper in the settings or getting grey preview/infinite loading/errors while trying to set it as the new lock screen wallpaper. For me the system LETS
 ME SELECT THE IMAGE NORMALLY AND EVEN SHOWS ME THE PREVIEW IN THE SETTINGS TAB, but when i try to restart i still get the blue wallpaper through both the lock screen and authentication screen.</p>
<p>Note that i already tried with different images from different system paths and the result is still the same.</p>
<p>I tried navigating to&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization as it was recommended by one of your admins in a similar question to mine, but i noticed I DO NOT HAVE THE LAST FOLDER OF THE INDICATED PATH "Personalization", it
 just isn't there and in every other forum question similar to mine no one else had it missing.</p>
<p>So i'm guessing my problem derives from the fact that somehow that folder was deleted today?</p>
<p>I then tried to SFC /verifyonly and it didn't find any corrupted files.</p>
<p>I am really worried right now because for me formatting and then reinstalling everything takes a lot of hours and i did it just a week ago, so i really would like to avoid having to do it again just because one registry folder got somehow deleted.</p>
<p>Note that my system is fully up to date, clean from any kind of malware and fresh new (since i clean installed a week ago).</p>
<p>I just don't know what to do now, could i possibly manually recreate the registry keys that were in that folder that somehow got deleted?</p>
<p>Please someone help me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I just checked another person's laptop with windows 10 and he doesn't have that folder as well. So i guess the problem is not that?</p>

<p>Hi Pete,<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure that the account you created is running as an administrator to avoid permission issues. To check, follow the steps below:<br />
Control Panel &gt; User accounts &gt; Change your account type &gt; You will be prompted for the administrator password then type the password. &gt; Set the account type to Administrator.<br />
<br />
Here's how you can transfer files from the old user account to the new user account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File Explorer</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>This PC</strong>, select <strong>Local (C:) drive</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54b85e90-3d02-4364-b957-6078381b9be9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54b85e90-3d02-4364-b957-6078381b9be9?upload=true" /></a><br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Users</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59c936b8-8c97-4f7c-a361-6fbf5a78f9da?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59c936b8-8c97-4f7c-a361-6fbf5a78f9da?upload=true" /></a><br />
</li><li>Look for the username folder of the old account (ex: admin).<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad3226f5-c406-4ca3-bb21-2ec9ea33b0e9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad3226f5-c406-4ca3-bb21-2ec9ea33b0e9?upload=true" /></a><br />
</li><li>Copy all the folders from the old user account or you can choose which to copy.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a1abc86-6c0d-489d-b995-23ba486a3507?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a1abc86-6c0d-489d-b995-23ba486a3507?upload=true" /></a><br />
</li><li>Look for the new user account folder and paste the one you copied. Highlight all the folders and click paste or you can press
<strong>Ctrl + A</strong> and <strong>Ctrl + V</strong> to copy and paste the items. This will copy all the files and folders from the old user account to the new user account.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may decide whether to keep the old user account or delete it. The old user account will also consume space on your computer.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.<br />

<h2>            Print Spooler Error 1068&#58; The dependency service or group failed to start.&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hiyo!<br />
<br />
So, I was having trouble scanning with my&nbsp; Lexmark 1240 All in One; The control software kept saying the driver was not installed. (FYI Yes it was) Okay says me. Download and run the Driver again, still nothing. Hmmmmmm<br />
<br />
So I goes ahead and uninstalls the thing. Unistalls the HP Deskjet 1600 (The AIO is now more or less a very bulky scanner, don't ask.) Then I find of course like a darned fool I forgot to check the USB cable. Yup like a silly goose forgot to plug the AIO IN.
 Now I feel stupid. Run the Lexmark installer again, now the print spooler will not start, What??? Mkay. I can fix this.<br />
<br />
Services.msc Restart the spooler. I do tech support for a living, I can restart services in my sleep. Heck sometimes I do.<br />
<br />
Won't start Plunks this one in front of me "Error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start" Okay somebody at work mentioned this with Lexmarks. I can confirm dependancies. Then I searched for "print spooler dependancies" And found this delightful
 thread [url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/print-spooler-error-1068-the-dependency-service-or/399f0ba6-ee10-43b7-a51b-b30bebb56cd9?auth=1]Link[/url] One teensy problem.
<br />
<br />
Where's my Dependancies tab?<br />
<br />
Seriuosly, I rebooted and restarted, BUT in no way, shape or form can I find the dendancies tab. At this point I'm posting this looking for help with figuring this out.<br />
<br />
So System info first <br />
Windows XP<br />
Media Center Edition<br />
Version 2002<br />
Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
I have not clean booted it yet. But I'm posting this then I will be.<br />
<br />
So&nbsp; two questions<br />
<br />
1. Where's my dependancies tab in Services management<br />
<br />
2. Looks like the Lexmark Unistaller took out the Microsoft XPS Writer. How can I get it back?<br />
<br />
Help?<br />

                    <p>Got a brand new laptop. Updated it to Windows 10 without a problem. Used Edge to open Gmail. Wanted to send an email with an attachment. The attachments "refused" to appear on Gmail. I tried sending the message anyway thinking maybe they were there but not

<p>
</p><p>Downloaded Chrome. It works fine, easily add attachments to Gmail. Guess that solves the problem, but only if I don't use Edge. Can this be fixed please?</p>

            I am an insider preview user and I never had problem with Gmail.<br />
<br />
After last upgrades I had the same problem with Gmail Attachments but it is not Edge Problem because it happens also with Chrome.<br />
Only closing and restarting the browser Gmail works. But after some times it doesn't work again.

Using Edge to access google webmail I am also unable to attach documents although Chrome works as expected.

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I found this brilliant solution on:&nbsp;http://www.msoutlook.info/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Windows Resource Checker – sfc /scannow
</p><p style="color: rgba(3, 22, 52, 1)">
To recover from the issue, you must run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as “System File Checker” or “sfc”. This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Right click on the Start button of Windows and choose: Command Prompt (Admin).
<ul>
<li>
If you don’t see this, instead choose: Windows PowerShell (Admin)</li></ul>
</li><li>
Behind the prompt type:&nbsp;<code>sfc
 /scannow</code><br />
<em>(note the space in the command)</em></li><li>
Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.</li><li>
Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>It worked like a dream.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,so I am looking for a game (Not sure if I'm in the right section for this). I played it about 1-3 years ago,it was an arcade game. It was an RTS and from what I can remember there were 2 sides red and blue,so your soldiers were red and blue. Oh,and
 I only played the demo,not the full game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I was thinking Risk, but that wouldn't be it. I'm stumped now, i'm tempted to look through the arcade now. At least&nbsp;that'd be more productive than trying to find someone who doesn't use mods or ragequits everytime they miss a shot in RE 5.</p>

<h2>            Start-up error&#58; Intel UNDI, PXE-2.1 &#40;build 083&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to turn on my laptop, I am seeing the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Intel UNDI, PXE-2.1 (build 083)</em></p>
<p><em>Copyright (C) 1997-2000 Intel Corporation</em></p>

<p><em>PXE-MOF: Existing PXE ROM.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has a solid state drive (SSD) not a hard disk drive (HDD).</p>
<p>I've read on other forums that the issue could be HHD boot related, since I don't have a HDD it must be some other cause.</p>
<p>I use windows 10 operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with trying to resolve this issue would be much appreciated.</p>

            You might need to load your BIOS and make sure the hard disk is set as the first boot device. Learn how to do that:

<p>Thank you for your response Andre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try this approach but since I don't have a hard disk drive (HDD) then I don't think this will work, I can't see a hard drive option in the BIOS, it just says "not detected" under the item "hard drive". I have a solid state drive (SSD) which is not
 an add on, it's the factory version that I purchased with the original computer. The boot priority is "Legacy First" I believe. Any suggestions would be most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi JakeND,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple download options at the link that you provided.</p>
<p>Do you mean the "Create Windows 10 Installation media" option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does the USB that I use need to be empty, i.e. have no other content on it?</p>

<p>PXE boot means its trying to get boot information from the network adapter - it is not trying to boot from any hdd/ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a bios Setup setting. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also might be your SSD is not plugged in, or defective and its reverting to PXE boot.</p>

<p>Hi JakeND,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your recommended steps, the USB does need to be blank as any data on it will be deleted. I now have 2 options when I start the broken PC with the USB plugged in, these are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Which type of installation do you want?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1. Upgrade: Install Windows and keep files, settings and applications</em></p>
<p><em>The files, settings and applications are moved to Windows with this option. This option is only available when a supported version of Windows is already running on the computer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2. Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)</em></p>
<p><em>The files, settings and applications aren't moved to Windows with this option. If you want to make changes to partitions and drives, start the computer using the installation disc. We recommend backing up your files before you continue."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried option 1 but it does not work, I receive the following message after trying option 1:</p>
<p><em>"The upgrade option isn't available if you start your computer using Windows installation&nbsp;media."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reluctant to try option 2 as I don't want to lose any files. I don't understand your previous advice "<em>make sure windows is active</em>". I'm not sure how I can do this if the computer will not start?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further advice will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The SSD is built in, it is not an add on or plug in device.</p>
<p>The following are the Boot settings which are currently shown in the BIOS:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Boot Mode &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Legacy Support]</em></p>
<p><em>Boot Priority &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Legacy First]</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><em>EFI</em></strong></p>
<p>

<p><em>Network Boot: Realtek PXE B08 D00</em></p>
<p><em>SATA ODD &nbsp; &nbsp; : PLDS &nbsp; &nbsp; DVD-RW &nbsp;DA8A5SH</em></p>

<h2>            Not receiving calls on Skype for XP</h2>
                    I have Windows XP and updated Skype with I suppose the latest version for XP, 7.36.66.150. &nbsp;I can sign in, make outgoing calls, use IM etc but NO calls are coming in. &nbsp;When someone calls me they say there is no ring, it just hangs and then hangs up automatically.
 &nbsp;I have seen other posts that had this problem but then couldn't connect. &nbsp;I can connect no problem but just cannot receive incoming calls.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you having issue on receiving calls on your Skype Number or just Skype-to-Skype calls? Is it happening to a specific contact or phone number? I suggest
 you follow the instructions below for the meantime and check if issue persist.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Uninstall and reinstall the Skype application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Make sure that you’re on online status on Skype.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Try using a different connection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Check on the privacy settings on the Skype application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I look forward to your reply.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Van_M,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having the exactly same issue.</p>
<p>We did all the steps you suggested except different connection. The computer is connected to the broadband landline and we can't experiment with any other type of connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We reinstalled 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptoms are as GeneAttwood described&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype Version 7.36.0.150</p>
<p>Winidows XP Professional SP 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can make outgoing skype to skype calls, incoming and outgoing text messages, but not get incoming calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be glad to get further guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I recently added one possible fix to resolve issues with incoming calls (not coming in at all), when running a 7.31+ version designed for the OS.&nbsp; This is different than a no audio issue.&nbsp; It may not help in your particular scenario but it may help others.<br />

            Hi, i have the same problem as author has. One additional detail i can share. Incoming calls work grate after app installation before system restart. Or after reinstall... So it works till first system restart...

            Hi Kenneth, please provide a bit more detail on this issue . . .
<br />
<br />Where exactly are you seeing this error in Windows 10?
<br />
<br />It refers to a HEVC codec, are you playing a video when this happens or downloading a video?
<br />
<br />If you are playing a video, are you playing it online or in a windows app locally?

<p>In event viewer as this and other updates fail, should not even be an issue as now on a local account.</p>
<p>Another issue, get past the bios, sometimes I get a log in window other times it just goes blank and after a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>seconds my display shows no video input message.</p>
<p>Also got a message that I needed to fix my MS account for shared experiences; no devices are set to use this and&nbsp;</p>
<p>especially this one on a local account; pic attached.</p>

<h2>            People cannot find me by Skype ID</h2>
                    <p>I have given a number of people my Skype ID and they said they can't find me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also apparently cannot link my phone number even though it shows up as verified in my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my IOS Skype app under privacy it doesn't show up as a way for people to find me nor does it give me a way to add it. it is just greyed out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for myself it also doesn't show any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened after the new Skype versions. Never had a problem with this with the original Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no known issue with regards to finding people in Skype using the new Skype version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that there is no space when people search for your Skype ID. Also, you cannot search for your own Skype ID using the same device.</p>

</p><p>With regards to the Privacy Settings, is the <strong>Appear in search results and suggestions
</strong>toggle On (slider to the right)? This will help other people to find you on Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not help, try to uninstall Skype &gt; reboot your device &gt; reinstall Skype&nbsp;at the App Store &gt; reboot your device once again &gt; sign back&nbsp;in</p>

    <title>USB Mass Storage Device Not Working in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Mass Storage Device Not Working in Windows 7 </h2>
                    In Devices and Printers the storage device appears and says it is working properly.&nbsp; However it does not show up as a drive, hence I cannot retrieve my files.&nbsp; There is no manufacturer's name on the device.&nbsp; As has been mentioned before elsewhere by several
 people, it worked fine under Vista.

            <p>No, but Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 or Windows 8.1 with Update 1 must be installed to receive and download the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<p>Hi finnebasse,</p>
<p>Pathfinder is a Web browser based on Internet Explorers rendering engine. Pathfinder utilizes Internet Explorer's LAN settings to access the Internet.</p>
<p>Since the particular application is causing problems on your computer, you may consider uninstalling the application from “Programs and Features”.</p>
<p>Here’s an article you may want to refer to:</p>
<p><strong>Uninstall or change a program<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</strong></a></p>
<p>After removing the application from Control Panel, reinstall it and check if there’s any latest development release for it.</p>
<p>See how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Keeps Signing Me Out</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I try to do anything, whether it be to load up whatever game is in the drive or play a game saved to my 360, or watch Netflix online, my Xbox signs out my profile. It doesn't do it with only my profile, it does it with
 others as well. It does it whether I'm connected to Xbox Live or not. I have no idea how to fix this and I'm just looking for a little guidance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 32-bit to 64-bit</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 on my pc without facing any technical problems. My processor is 32 bit and 64 bit capable. ( I tried to use the media creation tool, but I wasn't allowed to run the tool of 64 bit).Could I perform a clean installation of Windows
 10, 64 bit? Please reply soon, thank you.

            sorry to hijack the thread, but I upgraded from win 7 32 bit to win 10 32 bit via the creation tool. i have activated win 10 and signed up for a ms account. so now i've made a new tool for a 64 bit clean install but the product key keeps being rejected.
 do i skip this and then sign in to my ms account once i'm able to? will this activate windows?<br />

<h2>            amd radeon hd 8400 since windows 8.1 upgrade dvi monitor not recognized in windows.</h2>
                    The only time windows recognizes the dvi monitor is after I uninstall the video drivers and restart my machine. &nbsp;Once it loads a video driver the dvi monitor looses its signal and the windows screen changes over to the vga screen. &nbsp;any suggestions?
