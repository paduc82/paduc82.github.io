<h2>            Slander and Defamation</h2>
                    
<p>Earlier today, I was falsely accused of sending hateful messages to my now supposed "friends." Of course, they refused to tell me the content of the messages I allegedly sent them. Now, I'm not the kind of person to send anyone any sort of hateful message
 of any kind. I'm just a regular teenager. I just started driving. I just got my permit validated a week ago. Been working on my summer work and spending a little too much time on Xbox in between.</p>
<p>My first thought was that someone had hacked my account and sent my "friends" these hateful messages and made it look like that I had sent them. So I called up&nbsp; Xbox Live customer support and waited until I got a representative from the
<em>billing</em> department. (It was the best I could get. The category closest to the one I needed was "if&nbsp;you needed help managing your account/membership press 1." It wasn't like "If you think your Xbox account has been hacked..." or "If someone falsely
 accused you of...") I asked the guy if he could pull messages to or from my account, but I guess that isn't possible. So, he checked my recent purchases and nothing was out of order, so my account probably wasn't hacked.</p>
<p>The only other logical explanation was that my "friends" decided to just lie, I guess is the best word, about the whole thing and say that I sent them a whole bunch of messages saying a whole bunch of stuff. Why they would do something like that, I have
 absolutely no idea. They fed the lies to a mutual friend who eventually removed me from his friends list.</p>
<p>The people who lied about me sending them hateful messages go by the gamertags "mod removed."</p>
<p>Why people feel like they have a need to do this, I will never know. When Microsoft made Xbox, they wanted people to have a good time with some pretty cool games, not spam others or falsely accuse other people of saying something bad about someone else.
 Just because the only thing that can identify someone on Xbox is a gamertag does not give people the right to target someone cause someone a heck of a lot of stress over a video game.</p>

            <p>Hey Jetsfan.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Filing false complaints is against the terms of use and code of conduct. &nbsp;So if your friends reported you falsely it will be seen and they'll be in trouble instead of you. &nbsp;You've got nothing to worry about if you didn't send anything.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for the naming and shaming, Vote is just pointing out that it's possible for anyone to come on here and post anything. &nbsp;We know that you might not have a reason to lie but there are people that do and since we have no way to prove otherwise we don't allow it outright. &nbsp;The damage done if someone did lie would be done before anyone could post saying it was or wasn't true? &nbsp;If Vote actually did post what he posted only he meant it not to be an example you'd be getting hateful messages and be judged even if a MS rep came in here and posted "hey guys, this wasn't true" &nbsp;Those hateful messages you would get though could be reported and then the Policy Enforcement team would have a whole bunch of unnecessary message reports to deal with as well that all could have been avoided. &nbsp; That's why the reporting system is in place to deal with these things.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>TL, DR - They can call support all day long and file 1000 complaints and have all their friends file them too. &nbsp;If it didn't happen they'll be in trouble for wasting the PET's time and lying. &nbsp;So you're good to go if nothing happened.</p>

<p>Right, but I tried filing the complaints earlier, but they didn't work, and now I'm particularly angry because their lies cost me a friendship with someone I've known for nearly two years, who was also my best shot at getting back in the clan that I got
 kicked out of because of one of the people mentioned above.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Slander and Defamation is a CIVIL matter, not a criminal matter. ALSO, Slander and Defamation can only occur if the slander and defamation was A) Made in Public, usually the media in some form, and B) You use REAL names........</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Since you have an "anonymous" Gamertag, and the "accusations were NOT made on a public media source, then you have ZERO basis for any kind of lawsuit.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, There is ZERO chance you you being able to subpeona MS for the chat messages.</p>

<h2>            Starcraft 2 blue screen System_thread_not_handheld &#40;nvlddmkm.sys&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I updated to Windows 10, everything is great except my gaming experience. 8 over 10 times I get a blue screen "SYSTEM_THREAD_NOT_HANDHELD (nvlddmkm.sys)" when I try opening starcraft 2. I googled the issue and reinstall my graphic drivers and it didn't
 solve the problems. Now starcraft has just released the new patch and I cannot get into the game anymore (I get blue screen every single time).&nbsp;I even recovered my laptop and reinstalled everything again but it still doesn't fix my problem. Can anyone help
 me with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            I'll see if I can reproduce this, can you post your graphics card model and driver version? I have not hit this issue on a few different NVidia cards so I'm curious which ones you are using.

            Also I see you have a laptop. From the dump it looks like you have a hybrid laptop, meaning it has two video cards. Cnn you run 'dxdiag' and tell me what the other GPU is? it should be an Intel HD of some kind. Also let me know the driver version. Also
 what model of laptop do you have? This is an NVidia bug, but if I can get enough info I can get a bug for them to investigate.

<h2>            Does my Drivatar drive as skilled as me when I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m offline&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does my Drivatar drive as skilled as me when I'm offline? I'm just curious to know if it memorizes the way I drive exactly like taking notes of how I shift and turn and brake or is it just a normal AI car that just drives randomly???</p>

<p>That's the proclaimed idea behind the new drivatar so, yes. I'm told mine is a "dirt bag" that wins so, it's like me. lol</p>

<p>It's definitely not random. The drivatar system does "take notes" on how you brake, how you turn, etc...</p>
<p>Does the drivatar system take that data an apply it directly to your drivatar in your friend's races? Or does it accumulate the data from all players in the system and use the total, accumulated data to power the drivatars in races? No one knows for sure.</p>
<p>We also need to consider that the drivatars always have TCS and ABS turned on. If you don't drive with those assists then your drivatar is instantly not driving exactly like you do. We also need to consider that each player chooses his difficulty level.
 If you are a top 100 driver but your friend is racing against you on the "Easy" difficulty setting - your drivatar probably isn't driving exactly like you do.
</p>
<p>It's also my opinion (based on experience and many conversations with others) that the drivatars adjust their behavior a bit based on the way the actual player drivers. You might be the cleanest driver in the world but, if your friend is the dirtiest racer
 in the world and he's driving against your drivatar, there's a good chance that your drivatar is going to engage in some bumping and grinding because it's adjusting to the way your friend drives.</p>
<p>No one (except Turn10) knows exactly how the system works. No one needs to know exactly how it works. All we need to know is that the drivatar system is dynamic and that creates some single player experiences that far exceed the AI of past generation games.</p>

<p>Final questions 1) Do I get more credits if my drivatar wins races online when I'm offline? 2) Can I train my drivatar to drive perfectly like me? 3) Does it memorize my skill set on each racing track or just on how I drive all together? 4) Do I get more
 credits if my drivatar is in more races or do I just get more if it's in less races and wins them? 5) Does it memorize my skills according to the selected car example I will drive recklessly in my Nissan Skyline R34 and drive clean in my Honda S2000.</p>

<p>1) Yes.</p>
<p>2) Not exactly.</p>
<p>3) Yes, per track. &nbsp;If you cut certain corners, your Drivatar will, too.</p>
<p>4) More for more races.</p>
<p>5) No.</p>

<p>The answer to that last question is something I find interesting. So, according to your answers IceMan, this means that James' drivatar won't drive exactly like him if he drives differently in 2 separate cars, but rather takes how he drives from both cars
 and averages them together per track. Weird...</p>

<p>Going by how drivatars used to be waaaaayyyy back in FM1 (I know, I know, they're "completely" different now), my guess would be that they learn how you drive in cars with different drivetrain layouts, and apply that knowledge accordingly. &nbsp;For example,
 how you drive in an FF as opposed to an FR or MR. &nbsp;So, its driving skills in say a VW GTI would be applicable and similar to its skills in a Fiat 500 (both FF). &nbsp;Skills in a Ferrari F50 would be similar to skills in a Lamborghini Diablo (both MR), so on and
 so forth.</p>

<p>Hey Dirty, you just need to see my videos to see how your drivatar drives lol. I'm always mumbling under my breath when I see that thing show up. Which is not too often considering it's usually LEADING the pack and I'm forced to play catch up. Although I
 must state that I've noticed a dramatic change in the way the AI performs when pushed to the limit. For instance there are many tracks that I'm just plain terrible at driving on...but one in particular is my favorite and I tend to do very well in those races.
 Well the AI treats me like a nobody when I'm in any race other than that one. The minute I get into that preferred track the AI starts driving like bats out of hell to keep me from winning and from what I've seen they put up an amazing fight.</p>

<p>This thread made me think of other drivatar questions 1) When I race with my Honda S2000 with a Halo paint job on it does it stay on with my drivatar even if I got 3 other paint jobs with that car or does it change between those paint jobs???? 2) If I use
 a certain car for the event does my drivatar race in that car that I used for that event or does it use other ones that are in my garage that can be used for a certain event??? 3) Does my drivatar change cars and paint jobs on it's own depending on who it's
 racing???</p>

<p>Others might want to confirm this but I believe your drivatar races a random car for the given event. You may not even own the car your drivatar uses in a given race. So, obviously, your drivatar will not use the same car you have used for a given track.
 I've also noticed your drivatar will use a random paint job too. Also, I think your drivatar will only race on tracks you have raced on.</p>

<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, Update<br />
the <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the <strong>
major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related<br />
does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something is too sensitive<br />
to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the
<br />
System Maker's Support.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and<br />
the heat sink which are common causes.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below and those in the next message.<br />

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is
<br />
"possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory
<br />
and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug. Make sure
<br />
the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully
<br />
inspect the motherboard and other cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to to find out what updates are missing. You can start from an remote pc to the windows 2008 server.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use Windows Server Update Services to find and deploy the missing patches.

<p>Hi Matheus, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see a question mark beside the profile picture of a contact&nbsp;due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>the contact request you've sent to this person is still pending; or</li><li>this person's contact request sent to you hasn't been accepted. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If your contact request to this person is still pending, you can just right-click the name of this person and select
<strong>Remove from Contacts</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a contact request waiting for an approval from you, you cannot remove it, but you can hide it by right-clicking the name of the person and choose
<strong>Hide conversation</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>

<ol>
<li>Open the&nbsp;<span>Start&nbsp;</span>menu, then type&nbsp;<span>Device Manager</span>, then select it from the search results.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<span>Sound, video and game controllers</span>, select your sound card, then open it.</li><li>Under the&nbsp;<span>Driver&nbsp;</span>tab, select&nbsp;<span>Update Driver</span>. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</li></ol>
<p>Nothing worked.... Of course I tried using different headphones etc.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any help, thanks for answering.</p>

            Hey Tomas.  <br /><br />Please run the Sound Playback troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  <br /><br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  <br /><br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  <br /><br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  <br /><br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/

                    <p>I need to run a temporary network set-up for speed and interference issues we use an Ethernet wired Lan. We only need a network without internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have purchased 4 new laptops to use on the network these are all running Windows 8.1, i have set-up the network using Homegroup and set it as a Private Network. Each time the laptops go to 'sleep' or i disconnect and re-connect to the network the Homegroup
 resets to 'Public Network' i then have to go into the setup and reset back to 'Private Network', is there a way of locking the network on 'Private Network' to save me the hassle of having to reset each time?</p>

            <p>Hello Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist&nbsp; you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you want to keep sane IP address without using internet connection, that&nbsp;might be&nbsp;possible but you will need router to connect all of your computers. The steps provided below is not a sure shot resolution but you may try this and
 see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be times when you need your PC to retain the same local IP address every time it boots up.&nbsp; Forwarding ports, sharing content on your network, and other things can all be made easier when your computerâ€™s IP address never changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DHCP </strong>stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and is the recommended method for forcing your computer to use and reuse the same local IP address. Every home router utilizes DHCP, and anytime you jump on to a Wi-Fi or wired network,
 you are more than likely obtaining an IP address through DHCP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every router manufacturer is going to have a slightly different way to configure DHCP reservations, but it should go something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, we need to figure out the IP address of our router, so we can go in and configure it.&nbsp; Bring up a command prompt by pressing
<strong>Windows key + X </strong>and selecting <strong>Command prompt (Admin) </strong>
and type <strong>ipconfig.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Youâ€™ll need to look for the Default Gateway IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f12%2f2-default-gateway-cli.jpg" height="185" width="611" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have trouble with the command line or just prefer to find the information with the GUI, you can navigate to
<strong>Windows key + X &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f12%2f3-status.jpg" height="385" width="506" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once youâ€™re in that menu, right-click on your network adapter &gt; Status &gt; Details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the details menu, youâ€™ll see your default gateway listed.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f12%2f4-default-gateway-gui.jpg" height="444" width="376" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you know your routerâ€™s IP address, type it into a browser to get to the configuration menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f12%2f5-router-password.jpg" height="420" width="447" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your router should prompt you for a password, like in the screenshot above.&nbsp; If youâ€™ve previously configured a password for your router, enter it and click OK.&nbsp; If not, then it should still be at the default value.&nbsp; Linksys and a lot of other routers use
 a blank username and the password â€œadminâ€ for authentication.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the type of router youâ€™re using, you may have to fish around a bit for the DHCP settings.&nbsp; On Linksys, the DHCP settings are on the first page when you login.&nbsp; Regardless of the type of router you have, your DHCP page will look something similar
 to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f12%2f6-dhcp-settings.jpg" height="105" width="535" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As indicated in the screenshot above, click on DHCP Reservation.&nbsp; Youâ€™ll be brought to a screen like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f12%2f7-dhcp-reservations.jpg" height="430" width="637" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This menu already has the MAC addresses, IP addresses, and hostnames populated.&nbsp; It makes things easier because all you have to do is select the desired system, pick an IP address, and click â€œAdd Clientsâ€.&nbsp; When the settings are finished, youâ€™ll see them
 listed under â€œClients Already Registeredâ€, as seen in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your router doesnâ€™t automatically populate the MAC addresses for you and makes you put it in yourself, you can get your MAC address the same way we got the default gateway address earlier.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f12%2f8-mac-address.jpg" height="444" width="376" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have your settings configured and saved, your system(s) should now start pulling the same local IP address all the time.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I am not using a router on the network just 2 or 3 un-managed 10/100/1000 Gigabit switches. I am trying to keep the set-up as basic as possible (less to set-up &amp; manage and lees to give problems) the total network at the busiest will
 have 10 laptops connected at any 1 time. </p>
<p>As the network is to be used in Gym halls we did look at wireless but once you get 200+ people using mobiles etc. the connection can get a bit problematic, slow &amp; unreliable. We have the most success and for speed we tend to stick with the wired Lan.</p>
<p>I can obtain the i.p address's for each computer but it would seem that these are not changing, the error message saying an i.p address has not been allocated in the homegroup troubleshooter box after it has changed the network back to private.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ramesh</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again i don't have a problem sharing files etc. that;s all set up ok.</p>
<p>The issue is that Windows 8.1 keeps reverting to 'Public Network' i need to lock it on 'Private Network' to save me having to re-visit every computer after they have gone to 'Sleep' or are disconnected or reconnected to the Lan (Ethernet Cable Link).</p>
<p>

<h2>            Error _message &#61; &#34;Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This error message comes up when trying to open a sql connection. Both in compiled and run time.&nbsp; The program runs fine on several pcs, it happens only on one system.&nbsp; I am not sure but it seems to have started doing that after an automatic win 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First Form is a Splash screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Splash screen code I have the following code</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim connection As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim MyConnection As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyConnection = My.Settings.BookStoreBConnectionString<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connection = My.MySettings.Default.BookStoreBConnectionString<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Con As New SqlConnection(MyConnection)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I put a break here and then press F8 it goes to Con.Open and pressing F8 again it jumps to the next form
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Con.Open()&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catch ex As Exception<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Try</p>
<p>@@@&nbsp; the code continues as below but this is skipped and jumps to the next form
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim cmdGetDetails As New SqlCommand("SelectComdetails", con2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cmdGetDetails.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cmdGetDetails.Parameters.Add("@Identity", SqlDbType.Int)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cmdGetDetails.Parameters("@Identity").Value = "1"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dbread As SqlDataReader = cmdGetDetails.ExecuteReader<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If dbread.Read Then</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#########################</p>
<p>This is the place it jumps to, press F8 and it moves from line to line by pressing F8 but when it comes to the line Catch ex As Exception it come back with the above error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub FrmMainMenu_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is part of the next form</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim connection As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connection = My.MySettings.Default.BookStoreBConnectionString<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim con2 As New SqlConnection(connection)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; con2.Open()&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catch ex As Exception<br />
&nbsp;Hope some one can help with this, as said the exact copy of the program run without any problem on other win10 systems.

Angell67-
<div>The advice just above is not bad at all, but if I were you, I would take more steps. &nbsp;(Plus if you cannot start the PC, you cannot run the safety scanner.) &nbsp;Also, this would've been better if posted in the MSE forum (link at top.)</div>
<div>The safety scanner does in fact work well, but if you have a root kit infection, it and any other antivirus app being run by the OS can be fooled. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest the MS Defender Offline beta. &nbsp;On another, clean PC you will create a bootable CD or USB memory stick, and defender will run from there.&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline</a>&nbsp;
 You will have to start your PC and get into the BIOS setup to have your PC boot from these... &nbsp;That happens early enough that you probably can still access it. &nbsp;If not, then&nbsp;you can get at least a free consult from MS from here: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/</a></div>

            IN addition to the MS scan recommended (not instead) I would download Malwarebytes from link and boot into safe mode, do a full scan and let us know the results.<br />
<br />
Please download the free version of Malwarebytes. <br />
Update it immediately. <br />
Do a full system scan <br />
Let us know the results at the end. <br />

    <title>HDD to SSD upgrade, problems with Surface Drivers iaStorA.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eth777  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDD to SSD upgrade, problems with Surface Drivers iaStorA.sys</h2>
                    <p>I had my HDD fail in the original Surface Studio, and I seen a write up on how to upgrade to SSD drives, figured it was a bonus to get an extra 1tb, and a lot more speed.&nbsp; Everything went fine up until I tried to install the Latest Surface Studio Driver
 pack.&nbsp; I can install base windows from a USB drive, and it all works,(really fast too!!) however as soon as I do a windows update, or run the Driver pack, and reboot, I get boot failure.&nbsp; (windows logo, and some spinning dots, dots stop half way, and it restarts)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried the Surface BMR recovery, and can't get that to boot from usb at all, same reaction with the spinning dots.&nbsp; Sorry, wish I had an error code to provide, it just quits and reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had some bluescreens along the way, complaining about iastora.sys, it seems like updating to the latest raid driver, is causing me the problem.&nbsp; Which makes me wonder if that isn't what broke the drives in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if anyone had experience with this, I've seen&nbsp; few people on this site saying they had done this, and unfortunately, I didn't see any mention of these errors.&nbsp; Hoping someone has some ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Eth</p>
<p>
</p><p>update:&nbsp; I also tried to use the raid driver extracted from the drive pack during install, where it asks to load driver.&nbsp; did that and immediate bluescreen.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2f5f0ad2-77fb-420a-b69c-1a503a916b57" title="eth777">eth777</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for raising your concern. For us to isolate the issue given we have here some questions. Please do verify :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How is the boot-up of the surface studio?</li><li>Is it still running on the pre-installed OS that it came with when you initially purchased it?</li><li>Is the new SSD used purely for storage or is this where you boot the OS from at the moment?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to collate a few details about your current setup to ensure that I can picture out how we can help you in getting this issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I replace the HDD with and SSD, and the NVMe with a larger NVMe drive.</p>
<p>I am using a windows 10 boot disk, to install windows, and I can install windows to either drive, however, when I run the latest surface drivers, and reboot, It hangs up and never comes back.&nbsp; At that point I can't do any repairs or rebuilds, only thing
 that gets it back is a full reinstall of windows.</p>
<p>these are the drivers i use:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54311</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran after a standard windows install, with latest windows 10 USB boot disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After initial install, it boots fine, and I everything is good. (did i mention very fast :)</p>
<p>However the problem occurs after installing the drivers, or even letting windows update do it's thing.&nbsp; same result, it starts to boot, gets to windows logo, then spinning dots stop half way and it restarts until i get automatic recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's not specifically supported, just hoping to figure out why that driver isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi eth777,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading your SSD is not officially supported by Microsoft, this may or may not work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks like the RST Driver software did not like the drive I chose (WD Black NVMe)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put the stock nvme drive back in, and it loaded up on that with the recovery disk with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I'll pick up the suggested samsung 960 pro NVMe drive from the ifixit writeup and see how that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a new SSD, and windows installed on the NVME drive.&nbsp; It's moving really fast.&nbsp; Got to watch drivespace though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if anyone is looking to attempt this read everything out there about it, and be ready for some frustrating troubleshooting, just in case :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably wouldn't have even attempted this is if the stock HDD didn't completely crash, and it looked like Microsoft wanted to charge $899 to fix it.(basically replace it with a refurb, with the same sub-par HDD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just an fyi, it's probably not good practice to shun customers who are willing to do more technical work, they are still customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>system error e203 XboxONE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crunchyhornet3  say:</h3>
<h2>            system error e203 XboxONE</h2>
                    
<p>NEVER AGAIN will I buy an Xbox!!! Yesterday this system error message comes up on a black screen, E203 xxxxx... So I come on here to discover I have to download some crappy update, plug it&nbsp;into the console to get it back working... and guess what... YUP...
 IT STILL DOESN'T WORK!!!! Next I try to contact someone.. I can only post on here or tweet them.. I mean what is all that about??!</p>
<p>Then it tells me I'm going to need to send the console away to have it repaired... SERIOUSLY!!?? It's barely 9 months old, this whole thing is just bad, I mean really bad, I would seriously expect a console that cost me around Â£300 to last longer than 9
 months.</p>
<p>So I try to go to the page to sort out a repair and all it constantly does is tell me the page has timed out or something along those lines!!</p>
<p>So now I have an XboxONE that doesn't work, nor does the diagnostic repair tool and I can't request a repair... GREAT, NOT HELPFUL AT ALL AND SERIOUSLY BAD CUSTOMER CARE.</p>
<p>We also own a PS3 and PS4 and do we have any of these issues... NO of course not, if it needs a system update, it literally takes minutes and it's done, none of this downloading, unzipping and then needing some form of 2gb harddrive/usb etc etc.</p>
<p>In all the years we have had playstations we have NEVER had any issues like this, it's just ridiculous, and if I do somehow manage to actually find a way to repair this machine, it's being traded in for a PS4 and never again will Xbox be allowed in my house.
</p>
<p>I should have known there would be nothing but problems after it took my son all of Christmas day just to install a game!!</p>

<p>I had an issue with my PS4 albeit my own fault but the end result was I had to download the files that would restore a totally blank hard disk drive to reinstall the whole PS4 O/S back to the drive.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you had to perform the same thing for Xbox One, it can be recovered by the user but does require some understanding what your doing on how the software works.</p>
<p>the thing is this may require you to remove the internal hard drive which I don't recommend unless it's out of warranty or your not bothered about warranty as know what your doing and don't want to send it off.</p>
<p>if using disk always install game in off line mode first then update if you have to .. it's quicker that way.</p>

    <title>Repeatable Bugcheck on Windows 10 clean install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jh_12701  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeatable Bugcheck on Windows 10 clean install</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span>The blue screen shows a KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (Netwsw00.sys) The bugcheck from the event viewer states:
</span><span><span><span>The bugcheck was: 0x0000001e (0xffffffffc0000005, 0xfffff801f65b0049, 0x0000000000000000, 0xffffffffffffffff). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 090915-5984-01.</span></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This bugcheck happens EVERY TIME that I attempt to connect to my Windows Phone internet sharing. My phone is a Nokia Lumia 928, Version 8.10.14203.306. This bugcheck happens ONLY when connecting to my phone, I can connect to any other wireless network I
 have tried. The wireless icon shows that it is connected, then within a short time (or as soon as I try to use the network) the Windows 10 system crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a HP laptop and the wireless device is: Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 1000, the driver versions are Netwsw00.sys = 15.4.1.1 and vwifibus.sys=10.0.10240.16384 (th 1.150709-1700)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine on Windows 7 and I decided to to a clean install of Windows 10. All updates are installed and I have tried a clean install twice.&nbsp; Again, it crashes EVERY TIME I connect through my Windows Phone and NEVER crashes connecting to any other
 network</p>

</p><p>Looking on the Intel site there are no drivers listed for a Centrino Wireless-N 1000 device under Windows 10, the recommendation is to use the ones that come with Windows.&nbsp; I believe that 15.4.1.1 is the latest driver.</p>

            <p><span><span>I could not find any drivers on the Intel site, but did find a Windows 7 driver listed on the HP site for my laptop. The driver is in a file sp54841.exe.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The wireless device on the laptop is an Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1000 and when I look at the hardware Idâ€™s using device manager it shows PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_0084.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I then uninstalled the device using device manger and ran the sp54841.exe.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When I ran sp54841.exe (in Windows 7 compatibility mode) it said that it provides support for PCI/VEN_8086&amp;DEV_0084 (among others).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I then rebooted and the device came back. I connected to my cell phone and it seemed to last a bit longer, (I actually got a web page up) but within a minute it crashed.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I found that there was another file created called InstMultiPkg.exe written by Intel. I also ran that in Windows 7 compatibility mode after uninstalling the driver, then reboot.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>No change.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>I also tried to do an update driver (driver rollback is greyed out) and pointed to the location of the Windows 7 drivers it said that the drivers were up to date.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It still crashes.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What can I do from here?</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

            <p><span><span>I found that Intel has a utility that checks for updated drivers, but that said that I was up to date.
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I did a lot of searching and found that there have been similar reports of this in Windows 7, 8 and 8.1, they do not all have the same crash signature, but all have similar symptoms.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This pointed me to an Intel Proset wireless driver. I found that it does support my adapter the name of the file is Wireless_18.12.0_Dt64.exe (for 64 bit systems).</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It was a joy to find that this updated NETwsw00.sys from 15.4.1.1 to 15.11.0.9.</span></span></p>

    <title>Take ownership of System32 folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ladislav magyerka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Take ownership of System32 folder</h2>
                    <p>I have problems installing stuff like Visual Studio, GPU drivers, printer drivers, transfering files from desktop to a folder on the desktop not letting me use or delete the new file, updating Windows Defender and who-knows-what else that is not giving me
 an error right away. Figured out the GPU drivers problem by taking ownership of "drivers" and "DriverStore" folders in System32 folder with "Take ownership" in context menu. My old PC is running the same OS with no problems at all.<br />
Tried to get myself permissions for System32 the usual way but I get an error. For "drivers" and "DriverStore" I used the context menu. That works but it gives me (Administrator) permissions AND sets me (Users) as the owner. I just want to have permissions
 to change (install, etc.) stuff and leave the owner the same. Now the owner is not the same in other folders. SYSTEM and TrustedInstaler all the way with different permissions for them. Usually "Users" has 3 permissions, "Administrator" has 0 permissions,
 "TrustedInstaler" has 1 permission, "CREATOR OWNER" has 0 permissions, "SYSTEM" has 0 or every permission. Sometimes there is even my username with 0 permissions but mostly it's not there at all.</p>
<p>I already tried to solve Visual Studio startup crash in a forum: <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/silverlight/en-US/7703213f-6977-4e51-a4ea-8c2835b5d383/visual-studio-2012-express-for-desktop-crash-after-startup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

but they pointed me here. Now I know for certain that this ownership mess is the problem in everything.</p>
<p>1. Is it safe to take ownership of the whole System32 or even Windows folder?<br />
2. How to set full control in permissions without getting an error?<br />
3. As a last resort: if I format my HDD and do a clean install, will this problem persist? Or is there a way to prevent it from happening?</p>

            <i>1. Is it safe to take ownership of the whole System32 or even Windows folder?</i>
<div>-&gt; No, it is not. This likely to wreck your installation.</div>
<div><br />
<i>2. How to set full control in permissions without getting an error?</i></div>
<div>-&gt; You don't because there is no need to. To install software, right-click the installation program, then left-click "Run as administrator".</div>
<div><br />
<i>3. As a last resort: if I format my HDD and do a clean install, will this problem persist? Or is there a way to prevent it from happening?</i></div>
<div>-&gt; This is a perceived problem that does not exist when you adopt the approved methods for installing a program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In other words: Leave the Windows folder and its subfolders alone.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

RUN AS ADMIN follow the instructions<br />

<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the vents are clear and that the<br />
fans are working. Even though the temp is OK do not assume heat can't affect the video,<br />
sound or other system functions it those get to hot. Try adding a small fan blowing into<br />
the vents as a test. (Those are mostly for a PC not a laptop.)<br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started?<br />
(Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the<br />
time this started) Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and<br />
antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when<br />
you get to those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.</p>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />
