</p><p>Although it is for Windows 8 initially I think the method offered by Anil Kumar B is still valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other ways of checking to make sure you are not missing any files or settings is as follows</p>
<p>
</p><div>Method 1: <br />
System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
<div>Run system file checker (SFC) and see if it helps. Please follow these steps:

            Hi Iktoma  ,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing. 
<br />
<br />You can close your Skype account via this link:-
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a> 
<br />
<br />Please be aware that this also closes everything on that microsoft account as well, should you have anything associated on it. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for the info, but I don't want to close my Microsoft account or my account with skype via my Microsoft account.&nbsp; I just want to get rid of the extra Skype account .&nbsp; Sounds like they are not separate things and one can't be removed without the
 other.&nbsp; Is that true?</p>

<p>William383,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is Iktoma.&nbsp; I posted the question about the 2 Skype accounts and how to remove one.&nbsp; I think I understand my problem now so maybe this will help you.&nbsp; When Microsoft took over Skype, the Skype accounts were converted to Microsoft accounts.&nbsp; So
 actually I had 2 Microsoft accounts not 2 Skype accounts.&nbsp; I can log into Microsoft using My Microsoft email and password for one account or log in to Microsoft with my old Skype username and Skype password for the second Microsoft account.&nbsp; You should try
 to log onto Microsoft using your old Skype name and password and then you should be able to&nbsp; manage your Skype Credits.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; I understand now.&nbsp; I did not realize that my old Skype account was now a Microsoft account.&nbsp; So, actually I have 2 Microsoft accounts (not 2 Skype accounts) and I can delete one of the Microsoft accounts

            I have had 2 Skype numbers for years. Payments for them are debited every 3 months. Suddenly I cannot access my Skpye account - I get this microsoft thing instead, something I never signed up for - and when I use the site to manage my account, none of
 my information - my Skype numbers and the years of payment history, my photo and all my old Skype info - none of it is available to me. I want to keep one of the phone numbers, and cancel the other, but there is no one for me to talk to, and no way for me
 to interact with anyone concerning my account. What does the Borg suggest?

<p>This does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot manage my account. My 2 phone numbers do not show up for me to manage. My years of purchase history do not show up. Nothing about my account shows up to manage. I had to cancel the payments from my payment side, because I cannot manage my account
 under manage my account, and there is not customer service to talk to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 phone numbers. I only need one. But as I cannot manage my account under manage my account, I am forced into having no phone number with Skype, which clearly does not exist anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very bad situation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Assign IRQ to VGA surface pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my surface pro 3 at work (as its more powerful than any of the desktops here), bought a dock and have it set up perfectly at work, I use two screens, the surface pro's own touch screen and a big Dell monitor connected to the surface dock's mini display
 port. I need to add a third screen to the mix and wound up buying a little "USB to VGA adapter" from ebay. Ive plugged it into my surface and the drivers install correctly however windows 10 device manager is telling me the device could not start properly
 (code 10), have researched the issue and found that i need to enable "Assign IRQ to VGA" in the bios for this to work<br />
<br />
can anyone tell me if this is possible on the surface pro 3 and if so how do i access the bios? everything ive read tells me to turn the surface off, hold the volume down button, turn on the surface and release the vol down button once i see the surface logo.
 This does something (writing flashes on the screen too quickly to read) however it does not open up the BIOS menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone know what i should do?</p>

            <p>Getting into the BIOS won't help you. The SP3 doesn't even have a BIOS, it uses UEFI. UEFI has many fewer options, and regarding your USB-to-VGA adapter, it won't fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the only options you'll see in that screen. Judging from your technical acumen, I strongly recommend you
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do not</span></strong> go messing in there. (Please note I am explicitly
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7474a4f-4f66-49a3-81a3-c99f60d49e8c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is far more likely you have bad/inappropriate drivers for your USB adapter. With a modern operating system like Windows 10 you should not have to mess with any of that. It should all be plug and play. What make/model is the adapter? Are you sure
 you they even make&nbsp;Windows 10 drivers for it? (&nbsp;'a little "USB to VGA adapter" from ebay' doesn't inspire confidence in the manufacturer's credibility.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many topologies you could connect three monitors to your SP3. (You do have the SP3 with SP3 docking station, correct?) They are described well here:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="http://winsupersite.com/mobile-devices/microsoft-details-surface-pro-3docking-station-external-display-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Details Surface Pro 3/Docking Station External Display Support</a>
 (SuperSite)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If you can't get the right drivers for your current adapter, I would recommend returning it and purchasing a DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter&nbsp;instead.&nbsp;(I suspect your Dell monitor is HDMI... which means no daisy-chaining displayport. And I suspect your "new" monitor
 is VGA-only.) You plug one into the Dock, one into the Surface Pro 3. Would look funny, but it would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you start having to look at "MST" adapters&nbsp;(Multi-stream transport i.e. DP <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>splitter</strong></span>) it gets more expensive.&nbsp;You might be better off getting the Surface Pro 4 dock instead -- it comes with 2 DP connectors and is backwards-compatible with the SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>EXACT </strong></span>item I would have gotten instead, if I were in your position, is here: again, this is my opinion as a IT manager, not an official endorsement from Microsoft. The "MST" part of this
 adapter is very important and why it is so much more expensive.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Jigsaw - Statistics Incorrect - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw - Statistics Incorrect</h2>
                    
<p>I had initially posed my question in the "Gaming on Windows 10" community forum at answers.microsoft.com, but the only "solution" offered there was to tell me to post my question on the Xbox forums.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this is the right one to ask this in but
 it seemed the best fit.&nbsp; Here was what I had posted in the other forum:</p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">Is there any way to reset and/or re-sync the puzzle statistics in Microsoft Jigsaw?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">I ask because mine are essentially incorrect.&nbsp; While it's not necessarily a big deal in the grand scheme of things, my OCD kicks in fairly high gear when I can tell that the statistics are not accurate.&nbsp;
 For the classic Jigsaw statistics, the game is telling me that I have "played" 148 puzzles, but that I have only "completed" 142.&nbsp; Well, bottom line is that is not correct.&nbsp; I have not yet started a puzzle that I have not fully finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">I suspect what is happening is related to the freezing issue(s) I constantly have with the game.&nbsp; It has become fairly common place for the gave to "freeze" after I've completed a puzzle.&nbsp; My computer
 doesn't freeze or lock up - just Jigsaw.&nbsp; And it only seems to be a graphical freeze.&nbsp; Task manager does not show the game as not responding or anything like that.&nbsp; The main game window just "locks up" - like when you complete a puzzle and the animation begins
 to play to add gold bars to your total, that animation will freeze and the game window itself becomes totally unresponsive.&nbsp; Sometimes, but not every time, I can sort of "force" the game to start responding again by trying things like minimizing and maximizing
 the game window, or putting the game into full screen mode and then back into windowed mode.&nbsp; This, however, does not work every time and on occasion I am simply forced to close the game out totally and re-start it.&nbsp; If I had any guess I would assume that
 the puzzle completion count being off is somehow related to those times when the game freezes and I am forced to restart it, but now I am curious to know if there is a way to somehow sync these or edit them in some way so that my completed count is accurate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">Just in case the question arises: my video drivers are up to date, Windows 10 is fully patched and current (with automatic updates enabled), I have tried to do a wsreset to clear the app store cache (which
 did nothing), and the main game menu window does not show any "recent" (i.e. uncompleted) puzzles that I can select and complete.</span></p>
<p>Since originally posting this the issue has continued.&nbsp; While the statistics for the daily challenges and jigsaw jam remain accurate, the disparity in the classic jigsaw statistics for puzzles played vs. puzzles completed continues to increase despite the
 fact that I have fully completed every single classic jigsaw puzzle I have started.</p>

<p>In addition to my post above I just wanted to quickly add that the freezing issues I mentioned above appear to have lessened as well. &nbsp;Two days after I posted my initial post on the other forums a video driver update for my card was released. &nbsp;This update
 was installed on my system and since then the freezes seem to have stopped but the difference in the puzzle played vs. completed count continues to increase.</p>

<p>My issue is worse. &nbsp;I have had all my collection under classic jigsaw disappear and have been passed back and forth between xbox support and microsoft support NO ONE helps. &nbsp;They just say sorry we dont do that. &nbsp;Any ideas would be appreciated. &nbsp;I am still

<p>So why isn't Microsoft or Xbox addressing this? I am really tired of being passed back and forth and then told to post to the forum. Is it a Windows 10 problem? a video driver problem? An xbox problem? or a Microsoft game problem?

<h2>            locked out of computer</h2>
                    
<p>I am locked out of my Windows Vista Home Premium computer;&nbsp;I have a password and it keeps telling me that it is incorrect when&nbsp;I know for a fact that it's not, on top of that I had gotten into my account a few minutes before with the same password. I do
 not have another account on there, I do not have a password reset file and when I try to access through safe mode it brings me back to that screen and asks for my password, which doesn't work. Is there anyway to get to it without using some sort of program
 that hacks it for me? Please and thank you!</p>

            <span><span>Is Caps Lock on? If yes, turn off Caps Lock and try again. If not or that doesn't work, reset your password to something else
</span></span><span>using one of the methods below instead. You might then want to follow the general recommendations for setting up user accounts in Vista that I'll give you at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Doing all this requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place) is the better solution for
 you.</span> <br />
<span><br />
If you have a Vista installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes<br />
net user [insert your user account's name here] [insert new user password like 1234 here]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Now you will be able to log into your user account using the password you set; i.e., 1234. If you don't have a Vista installation DVD you can either make a bootable Vista Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />

<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Log into your administrative user account (not the Built-in Administrator) which will either require no password or something simple like "1234".<br />
<br />
If you used Method 1, after you have logged into your administrative user account you should disable the built-in Administrator again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">General Recommendations For Setting Up Users In Vista:</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

    <title>Windows 10 update crashes my computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bkjwashere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update crashes my computer</h2>
                    <p>I ran this computer just fine fine for several years, including a long while after I installed Windows 10 as suggested.&nbsp; I had very few problems at all until last fall.&nbsp; Then Windows 10 auto-updates started crashing my computer.&nbsp; I have spent countless hours
 researching &amp; testing things, running all the troubleshooters, running diagnostics.&nbsp; I've tried so many things to stop this over the past 6 months, &amp; now I'm afraid I'm screwed.&nbsp; &nbsp;After every update I can recall since last fall (2017), The computer booted
 up just fine &amp; appeared to be perfectly fine.&nbsp; I could open &amp; run any program just fine.&nbsp; No troubles.&nbsp; But, 3-10 minutes into using the computer, whatever I clicked on next would not work.&nbsp; There would be no response at all.&nbsp; I could still click on some things,
 but others wouldn't respond.&nbsp; Gradually, if I continued to try to click on things, they would all not respond &amp; the computer would completely freeze.&nbsp; I would reboot &amp; it would happen over and over until I gave up &amp; started trying to solve the problem by troubleshooting
 &amp; reading blogs...anything I could do to solve it.&nbsp; Every time, which by now has been about 15, I would wind up having to revert to an earlier build.&nbsp; Once I did that, everything worked perfectly.....until Windows 10 forced another update.&nbsp; Then it all started
 over again.&nbsp; Two weeks ago, an update happened, &amp; I reverted back, but then it did it again 2 days later.&nbsp; Then again the next day.&nbsp; I reached Microsoft support on the phone, but they just said: "your computer is not compatible.&nbsp; Our developers can't know
 all the old drivers out there, so we can't help you".&nbsp; I asked if they would help me just turn off the auto updates, which I used to be able to do.&nbsp; He said No.&nbsp; My computer is a Gateway FX6840, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU&nbsp; &nbsp;870 @ 2.93GHz, 4.00 GB RAM, 64-bit
 Operating System, x64-based processor.&nbsp; Yesterday, the PC updated again, but this time they have removed the ability for me to revert back to a previous working version.&nbsp; I'm hoping I'm not screwed, because I have several cryptocurrency nodes (not bitcoin,
 no I'm not rich) that have wallets on them &amp; I'd prefer not to rebuild all of that if I can avoid it.&nbsp; Nor do I want to re-install the many programs I have loaded with all my settings and custom menus, addons, etc. in place by doing a clean install.&nbsp; I don't
 have alot of money, so the little I have, I'd like to not lose or have to build back from scratch.</p>
<p>Is there anybody out there who can help me, or point me in the right direction?&nbsp; I'm leary of those support companies that want a fee, then pipe in and take over doing God knows what to my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.&nbsp; Signed 52 year old dude who built his 1st PC from scratch in 1990, but is lost with this new stuff.</p>

<p>Im even more screwed. Windows 10 update forced itself onto my laptop, and now i cant even boot it up. I get the Dell logo, a flash of a white-bordered square, then a quick message "attempting to recover installation" immediately followed by "restoring previous
 version of windows".... then back to Dell logo and repeating in an endless loop! I have work to do and didnt ask Microsoft for this fatal invasion of my laptop.&nbsp;</p>

            It won't return from a sleep state. I get flashes of white lines across the screen, but it never returns. I have to shut the computer off, then back on for it to start again. Tried everything. I finally removed the updates and turned off Microsoft's automatic
 updating (hack available to do this on google). The system is functioning normally&nbsp;again, so obviously, this was an update issue.

            Have you tried doing a system reset through the Dell console? I think you turn the computer off, turn it on then immediately off again, turn it on them immediately off, then turn it on and it will go into the Dell recovery console. Might be the only way
 to get functional again. Then I would recommend turning off automatic updates. You can't actually turn them off in Windows 10 (since MS thinks we are too stupid to know when we need them), but there are a few simple tricks that can be done to stop auto-update.
 Just look on google.

<p>Same and/or similar issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd think after so many people have posted on blogs about the problems with their latest updates,&nbsp;and Forbes has written about the problems

<p>Why would they do that when is it such a small minority of users having issues?</p>
<p>If there's something amiss with your system that is causing the update to not work you need to work at diagnosing what hardware or software is causing the failure. A process of elimination can go a long way to find the "bad" piece in your setup.</p>

    <title>internet dropdown boxes freeze webpage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terencewiesner  say:</h3>
<h2>            internet dropdown boxes freeze webpage</h2>
                    <p>I use windows7 (64bit) MSOffice 2010 (especially Excel running large sheets with complicated formulae &amp; VBA macros) on an HP Probook 4730s computer.&nbsp; I run Kapersky Antivirus 2014.&nbsp; Everything is up to date and was paid for.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last few weeks whenever I click on a drop down box the web page freezes.&nbsp; By clicking on x I can get out of the page&nbsp;and right clicking on some links allows me to open a new page that works until I&nbsp;try &amp; use a drop down box again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can use the
 drop down boxes however when I boot Windows in&nbsp;SAFE MODE with networking. So&nbsp;I suspect an addon -&nbsp;but neither System Restore nor&nbsp;repair MSOffice2010 nor Microsoft troubleshooters nor trying Google Chrome fixed the problem.&nbsp; I would appreciate a fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Okay, well from further research, it looks like the game just still does not have a full-screen feature because of it being a part of windows store apps. It most likely will never actually be added.

<h2>            files keep getting corrupted</h2>
                    <b><i>Windows corrupting files?</i></b><br />
<br />
Dear Windows Folks,
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>The Problem:</i></div>
<div>My computer is - seemingly randomly - corrupting files and folders!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>The System:</i></div>
<div>since November I am running Windows 8 64 Bit (for the past few weeks Pro with Media Center) on my new laptop, an Asus Zenbook UX51VZ with two SSDs as storage space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>What happened:</i></div>
<div>I was quite happy with the new system... until it started randomly corrupting files and directories.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First it happened to some Pdf-Files. When I tried to open them, I got an error-message about corrupted files and they didnt open properly anymore.</div>
<div>I thought, maybe it is because of Adobe Acrobat or because I synchronize my documents with Sky Drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next a whole folder was broken, wherein I worked on a new website. I was able to regain access to the folder itself after running checkdisk. But most of the files inside were faulty after that. Again I thought: Maybe its Adobe (Dreamweaver) that corrupted
 the files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But then I hit the same problem with some film trailers I downloaded from Apple.com.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And the latest - and particularly annoying - incident happened to mp3 files of a soundtrack that I recently downloaded from Amazon. I bought these files yesterday and they were working perfectly fine. Today I cant access the folder anymore...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is that a known problem of Windows 8? Or may it be a faulty SSD drive? Is there any way to fix it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am pretty devastated here.</div>
                </div>

            Hi petercowd 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />As the first step towards troubleshooting, please confirm if you have caller ID setup
<br />
<br />What is caller identification and how do I set it up? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>

            Thanks for providing this clarification. 
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot - Can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and let me know whether you are able to make a call from here?

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Control Panel
<br />
<br />2. Choose Security and Maintenance
<br />
<br />3. Select Change User account control settings
<br />
<br />4. Switch the toggle to Never notify

            Sorry, but I do not know how to do a screen shot.&nbsp; It is the same bar that comes up showing the various icons such as google.&nbsp; It just stays there when I am using the computer.&nbsp; I now see it twice, once on the side and then across my PC.&nbsp; However, the
 side bar remains when I am using the computer and is quite annoying.

            Hi Moka99, without being able to see that,  I think you may be in Tablet Mode . . .
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + A
<br />On the Resulting Flyout, if you cannot see the Tablet Mode Button, click 'Expand'
<br />If the Tablet Mode Button is not gray, click it so it becomes gray
<br />This will turn off tablet mode<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8312e05-1026-4858-b511-5739e852ce44?upload=true" />

    <title>Canon Scangear tool &#38; 64-bit machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sm_sb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon Scangear tool &#38; 64-bit machine</h2>
                    <p>Hi all...we have recently made the transition to Windows Small Business Server 2011, MS Office 2011, and a few new laptops are running Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are unable to get the Canon Scangear tool to work with the machines that are running Win7 64bit and Office 2011 64-bit.&nbsp; We were able to get the Scangear tool to work just fine with the 32bit machines.&nbsp; (Took a little creativity with a macro though.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have tried force the Scangear tool on the 64bit machines to run in compitability mode - XP Service Pack 2 &amp; Service Pack 3.&nbsp; The Scangear tool is able to detect and connect to our Canon IR3300 and the test is successful.&nbsp; When we actually try to scan
 to Word (via macro) or One Note, we get this error "Unable to connect to scanner or camera.&nbsp; Check the connection and reinstall the driver if necessary."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?&nbsp; Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp; Unfortunately this will NOT work for a solution.&nbsp; Our copier is a black &amp; white Canon IR3300.&nbsp; This scan tool is specifically for a Color Canon 5600f.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the last update, I have uninstalled &amp; reinstalled the Scangear Tool.&nbsp; I have even tried to run the setup.exe in compatibility mode.&nbsp; It does look to install all of the files for XP Service Pack 2, but still get the same error.&nbsp; (It tests fine though
 when doing the initial discover.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution we came up with/found was to back the MS Office to 32 bit (left OS at 64 bit).&nbsp; Once we did that, the Scangear tool worked just fine on all machines/all OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>This solution may help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>on 64bit-systems you have to copy all DLL-files from ScanGear-directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Canon\Network ScanGear\) to your windows directory.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any hardware or software changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Which USB Audio Device's are you referring to?<br />
3. What is the make and model of the USB audio devices?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to run Audio troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click hardware and sound and click on ‘Playing Audio’.</span></p>
<br />
<b>Method 2:</b> To update the driver using Windows Update<br />
<br />
a. ‌Open Windows Update in Control Panel by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Windows
 Update in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking Windows Update.<br />
<br />
b. Tap or click Check for updates.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are any available updates, click the links to see more info about each update. Windows Update tells you if an update is important, recommended, or optional. Each type of update might include drivers.<br />
<br />
c. On the Select the updates you want to install page, look for updates for your sound card, select the check box for the driver that you want to install, and then tap or click OK.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There might not be any available driver updates.<br />
d. On the Windows Update page, tap or click Install updates. Administrator permission required&nbsp; You might be asked for an admin password or to verify your choice.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Update will tell you if the updates were successfully installed.<br />
<br />
Post us the results after you try the above steps.<br />
<br />

            1. The audio troubleshooter said nothing was wrong.
<div>2. I tried updating via Device manager, but there were no updates</div>

A1. You should have (a) uninstalled the preinstalled Norton application, (b) downloaded/run the &nbsp;Norton Removal Tool &amp; rebooted, and then (c) installed the purchased
