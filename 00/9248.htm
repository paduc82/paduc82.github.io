<h2>            Unable to Create Access Before Change Event</h2>
                    I am trying to add a table level 'Before Change' event to a table, but am unable to because the buttons are greyed out. Access 2016. Code and data in separate .accdb files. Am connected to the 'data' file. I can make other table changes - for example I
 can add a new column to a table.

            <p>Because you have a split system, then modifications to the table design must occur in the back end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for data engine code (triggers) this is ALSO the case. The changes to tables (and table triggers) have to go in the back end, since what would occur if ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù users were using a different front end parts?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, you not only notice that the buttons for creating/editing the table events are disabled, but note ALSO how you can‚Äôt even make changes to the table structure(s) in the front end. You also can't "enforce" relations in the front end as again
 such changes must apply to all users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for table level design changes, and table level code (table events ‚Äì or so called triggers), you make such changes in the back end.</p>

            <p>I was already trying to add the triggers while directly connected to the back-end database. Turns out that, while the data file is in .accdb format, it was still Access 2003-2007. I exported and imported into an Access 2010+ formatted database, and was able
 to create the triggers.</p>

            No this did not work, I've been having the same issue and now cant access the account to buy my little brother the new battle pass on fortnite. Surely if it includes money earning you'll start trying to fix it. Instead of suggesting the same things where
 it says (8) people have the same question that means that more than one person is having the issue. I've done ALL your steps and even went as far as to add a EXTRA phone number but doesn't work. Please just fix the issue.

<h2>            Not receiving emails due to full inbox</h2>
                    Hello, Someone recently told me that they received a message back telling them that they could not send an email to my account because my inbox is full. Then, I received an email from Outlook.com telling me I needed to clean up my email as I was approaching
 a limit. I have since cleared many old mails from some folders, deleted lots of emails with larger attachments, and have a very small inbox (about 6 emails). Another sender phoned me today to tell me they were unable to send an email to me, and another email
 I was expecting last Friday has never reached my inbox. I have been using this hotmail account for many years, and never experienced any issues. I have not changed any settings. It appears to be related to the change to Outlook.com. Please can someone help,
 because I am expecting important emails about job opportunities. Thank you.

            Having read some more posts I have found a temporary fix - maybe a permanent one. Here is how I got there.
<div><br />
<div>Using my gmail account, I tried to send an email to my hotmail (outlook.com) account. It was rejected with the following reason code:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Action: failed<br />
Status: 5.2.2<br />
Diagnostic-Code: smtp;552 5.2.2 This message is larger than the current system limit or the recipient's mailbox is full. Create a shorter message body or remove attachments and try sending it again.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I searched for this code in this forum, and eventually found a post that mentioned sent mail, and the fact that it was duplicated and duplicating at a fast speed.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I checked my sent mail. There were many many duplicates, and all with time stamps close together (ie. every 10 minutes or so). I then searched this forum for problems with sent mail, and eventually found a post
 that mentioned Samsung phone.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have a Samsung phone. My Samsung phone has the email client attached to my hotmail (outlook.com) account. After deleting all the sent mail on my Macbook, I checked again a few minutes later, and some more appeared.
 I checked my Samsung phone email client, and saw the same sent files in the sent mail. I deleted these on the phone and deleted them on my macbook. Now I have no sent mail (I hope I don't need any of it!!)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Anyway - seems to be a sync issue with the sent mail, which causes the Outlook.com account to grow too large. I will keep an eye on the issue and report back if I make any new findings.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have sent two more test emails from my gmail account to my hotmail account and they have been received okay.</span></div>

            One more point...
<div>If I send an email from my phone in future, I will delete it from the sent mail section. I will then check and delete it from my macbook sent mail section. Hopefully this will stop the sync &amp; duplicate issue which appeared to lead to the full mailbox issue.</div>

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0x80070005 Access Denied and a disabled network card</h2>
                    I am trying to repair a Dell Inspiron E 1405 running Windows XP Media Center Edition version 5.1 (Build 2600.xpsp_sp3_gdr.101209-1647: Service Pack 3)<br />
<br />
I received this computer stuck in the "resuming windows" screen.&nbsp; Would not turn off unless there was a hard boot and even after removing the battery for extended time, when battery was replaced the screen was still "hung"&nbsp; I removed battery again, did the
 F8 thing a few times and finally it booted properly.&nbsp; I set up the wireless network, which worked flawlessly then I began to update Security essentials and important windows updates.&nbsp; It limped along, I deleted some unused programs.&nbsp; Rebooted and continued
 the updates.&nbsp; At no time would this computer allow me to turn on SE as my virus protection.&nbsp; Same big red box that said start but when I did the same error message, 0x80070005 Access denied appeared.&nbsp; I hoped the updates would solve the problem.&nbsp; Let it work
 over night, at reboot I had no IP address.&nbsp; It sees the wireless networks available.&nbsp; it tells me there is a great connection, it will not renew the IP address.&nbsp; I have attempted from all angles I know of from C Prompt to network set up to right click the
 icon.&nbsp; I think there is a virus here and do not know how to get around it to get on-line and do the updates.&nbsp; Any help here would be great.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            Thanks Ahaap.&nbsp; Sadly, the computer I am working on is so messed up that this scanner would not execute.&nbsp; i was able to download it to a thumb drive from my healthy computer, but it will not launch in the sick computer.&nbsp; The infected computer still cannot
 access the internet.&nbsp; The wireless network card sees the available networks, sees a healthy signal but will not get an IP address.&nbsp; I will follow the other links now, just wanted you to know that whatever this is is so bad this did not work.&nbsp; On to the next
 one.&nbsp; Thank you again and if you can tell me another way to launch this that I haven't though of that would be great.<br />

<p>1a. Was <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/how-can-i-be-sure-mse-is-woking-on-my-computer-i/6503d663-38d6-43fe-a7dd-c3728731f3af">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> (MSE) originally offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you (or the owner)&nbsp;intentionally
<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>1b. In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</p>
<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong>: What is the <strong>Created</strong> date displayed on the resulting

<p>2. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before MSE was installed</em>, was&nbsp;the subscription still current, and was it uninstalled it before&nbsp;MSE was&nbsp;installed?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when it was purchased? (Doesn't matter if&nbsp;it was never used&nbsp;or Activated it.)</p>
<p>5. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the

Switching to the other option gives me LastName FirstName on both contacts &amp; SMS'es... So that's even further away from what I really need: FirstName LastName on both contacts &amp; SMS'es...

This is very annoying when sync to Outlook and removing any of the field or changing fields isnt an option because your messing up your contacts in outlook.<br />
<br />
I think this problem is common to all NSeries phones. As i've tested N73, N76 and N77 all with the same problem.

N82 Black is my first Nokia phone for about a few weeks already but having a small screen its very hard to see contact names in SMS and Email, you mostly see only lastnames which is very very annoying. I think I just have to revert back to Windows Mobile.

<h2>            E71 Keypad</h2>
                    
<p>Any idea how to change the keypad of E71 to an English alphabet characters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have received a new E71 as a gift. The phone was purchased in Dubai-UAE. The keypad has the Arabic characters as the main&nbsp;visual ones and they are of no use to me.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any suggestion</p>

<p>I did contact Nokia Care and it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>The problem is that I live in Canada and there are no retail stores for Nokia.</p>
<p>Local electronic stores and carrier service providers&nbsp;do not carry keypads in stock</p>

<h2>            Unable to access mails using Thunderbird program.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Pop email account</p>
<p>Run out of ideas. May be a little off subject but will try.&nbsp; I have IE10 in W7. My internet supplier is Century Link.</p>
<p>Our Email is Embarqmail.com which was bought out by CL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night something changed and I can no longer get email in Thunderbird though I can get email in the webmail</p>
<p>program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CL had me change port, change server from Embarqmail.com to CenturyLink.net</p>
<p>I can send email but not access from The Thunderbird Program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get unable to access server, but the server is there on Webmail and there for sending email</p>
<p>so what has changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Century says they are fine, my setup is right but still doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the latest updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP </p>

            <p>Possible improvement with a bios update, but doubtful.&nbsp;&nbsp; All other bios updates are Beta and primarily improved on processor compatibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; I might consider one if I can get the manufacturer to be more specific on what they do.&nbsp; I have 0709 below.</p>

    <title>Indentation of headers in multilevel list in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ns law student  say:</h3>
<h2>            Indentation of headers in multilevel list in Word</h2>
                    <p>How do I change the indentation on a multilevel list? This is how my headers look now:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11d541bb-751f-4bc8-bc9c-f70f1926083d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11d541bb-751f-4bc8-bc9c-f70f1926083d" /></a></p>
<p>I want the heading to be block-indented like this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82193aae-eaa2-42c8-bf8b-cf3090dda0d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82193aae-eaa2-42c8-bf8b-cf3090dda0d0" /></a></p>
<p>I have Word 2016 for Mac. At some point I turned off the auto-numbering/list-creation feature. I just turned it back on, and it seems like the auto-feature is not really back to how it was before. When I hit 'enter' to create a new heading, it does not insert
 the new numeral or letter automatically until I click on the multilevel list button again. It seems like maybe the formatting is also different now. &nbsp;If there is a way to just reset all my settings to the original Word settings maybe that would fix my problem.</p>

<h2>            In Outlook, is secure password authentication &#40;SPA&#41; redundant when SSL or TLS encryption is used&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have just setup Outlook to connect to an IMAP and SMTP mail server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IMAP server requires SSL and the SMTP server requires TLS.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secure Password Authentication (SPA) is a proprietary Microsoft protocol used to authenticate Microsoft email clients with an electronic mail server when using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), or Internet Message Access
 Protocol (IMAP). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally usage of Secured Password Authentication (SPA) depends upon the type of protocol used by Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the mail transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This depends on the internet service provider and this option is not commonly used by most of the service providers., Unless your ISP has indicated that your service uses Secure Password Authentication (SPA), do not select the Log on using Secure Password
 Authentication (SPA) check box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the above information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all.</p>
<p>Like you I hate it when people do not read&nbsp;the question well and only try to give an answer hoping that it will be marked as&nbsp;"helpfull" or even as&nbsp;"the answer" .</p>
<p>To my regret&nbsp;even people&nbsp;who are related to MS&nbsp;(in some&nbsp;way, like some&nbsp;admins)&nbsp;even&nbsp;mark these&nbsp;false answers as "the answer".</p>
<p>I hope it will not happen for this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I think it is not neccesary to use SPA if you are using SSL and TLS, so it is redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I came her because I have&nbsp;different question&nbsp;about the same subject:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is TLS or SSL redundant if you are using SPA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp;my question is:</p>
<p>If Secure Password Authentication is used, what about the email message itself?</p>
<p>Are the email messages&nbsp;themselves encrypted &nbsp;after the (encrypted) authentication proces or are they just send in plain text?</p>
<p>I assume there is no VPN tunnel or other encrypted connection used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On other words:</p>
<p>If I POP my email without using a secure connection&nbsp;but if I do&nbsp;use SPA. Is my email message encrypted or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone with real knowledge can reply to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</p><p>Each and every time it's getting somewhat better to use on a tablet, though it's still a huge pain in the **** compared to 8.1.2, that said there are a few issues that's cropped up no matter the build installed&nbsp;or&nbsp;the method for installation (i.e. fresh
 install from ISO or upgrade via ESD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tablet mode setting doesn't stick. Every time the tablet is rebooted it's back to desktop mode, even though the&nbsp;"When my device wants to switch modes" setting specifically say "Never prompt me and always stay in my current mode".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known bug that I just haven't noticed in the release notes or is it a device specific one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and this is off-topic, but I found this rather amusing:</p>

<h2>            Array formula with COUNTA and INDIRECT</h2>
                    <p>I have a book with 100 sheets in it, and I want to create a formula that will tell me the total number of rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get the number of rows from one sheet with this formula:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">=COUNTA(AvgSales_0!A:A)</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The only thing that changes in that address is the "0" from "0" to "100".&nbsp; So I thought I should be able to use an array formula with INDIRECT to iterate between 0 and 100, have INDIRECT return a reference to "AvgSales_xx!A:A" and
 COUNTA would just sum them all up.&nbsp; But I get&nbsp;a #VALUE error.</p>

            <p>hi there. &nbsp;you would have to create the sheet names listing all the worksheets you wish to sum up. &nbsp;this link here explains:</p>

<p>
</p><p>you could also do a simpler formula if all the worksheets you want to include are lined up together.<br />
=COUNTA(AvgSales_0:AvgSales_100!A:A)</p>

</p><p>Solution was:</p>

<p>sign back in with email/user name and password</p>
<p>
</p><p>after the manual forced &nbsp; &nbsp; 'sign out' / 'sign in' &nbsp; &nbsp;my problem was resolved which is interesting because one would think a reboot of the computer does the same thing...</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business syncing takes ages, icon overlays missing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>i have tried several ways to fix this issue. </p>
<ol>
<li>Stop Onedrive for Businiess (Groove.exe) </li><li>Clear %UserProfiile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Spw data </li><li>Remove synced folder in User\username </li><li>Run Groove.exe /clean /all </li><li>restart sync process </li></ol>
<p>It starts creating the folders and a lot of files (almost everything is done except for 4 files).</p>
<p>Finally i can wait for hours but it just does not sync new changes won't be processed either.</p>
<p>The Logs in Spw\logs are huge but i only can find log entries with id 1062 and no further information include.
</p>
<p>I am syncing one personal onedrive folder and a public sharepoint folder.</p>
<p>The files have been uploaded with the sync client not using the web site. so i guess there should not be a problem with forbidden characters aso as it shouldn't upload those files (right?!)</p>
<p>Any ideas what can be the problem?</p>

<p>Regards </p>
<p>Thomas</p>

<p>Hi Thomas,<br />
<br />
Regarding the situation, I suggest you backup and remove the 4 files from both the local folder and the cloud, wait for the sync to complete, and then move them back into the sync folder.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, you can try the following steps:<br />
1. Use the ‚ÄúFix it‚Äù tool in the article below check if you have encountered any restrictions of the OneDrive for Business sync client.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738</a>
<br />
2. Use the ‚ÄúFix it‚Äù tool in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to remove the OneDrive for Business cache.<br />
<strong>Warning</strong>: This tool can cause data loss. To reduce this risk, read this article in its entirety before you use this tool.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, please let us know the version of your OneDrive for Business. To find the version, open
<strong>Task Manager</strong>, right click <strong>Microsoft OneDrive for Business</strong> under
<strong>Processes</strong> tab and select <strong>Properties,</strong> then switch the tab to Details.<br />
<br />
About the icon overlay issue, you can refer to the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3079213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sync icon overlays are missing from OneDrive for Business synced items</a><br />
<br />
Let us know if there is any update.<br />
<br />

<p>OneDrive for Business is possibly the worst piece of software that Microsoft has every developed in it's history. The solution given is always "recreate the folder" or "move files somewhere else" without ever bothering to get to the root of the problem.
 Unbelievable shitty.</p>

    <title>latest update for Nokia Lumia 930 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            latest update for Nokia Lumia 930</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi Microsoft team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around 21st June you guys performed an automatic scheduled update for the Nokia Lumia 930.</p>
<p>The update has done something wrong with the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ It doesn't play streaming video properly anymore </p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ I read comments in my Facebook anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3/ When using messaging apps within Facebook or Telegram it kinda hangs or its too slow, I can't make out what it actually doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,...the update has buggered up the phone. I'm not sure what else it may have done, but it didn't help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I was to roll back to the previous version, how can I do that? As I may want to trouble shoot the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Peter </p>

<p>Modify the formatting of the paragraph that contains the text.</p>
<p>Or, as labels are just tables with fixed cell dimensions, you could modify the cell margins via the Table Properties dialog.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
