    <title>Column Spacing on Column Chart - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Column Spacing on Column Chart</h2>
                    <p>I have made a column (or vertical bar) chart in excel 2007.&nbsp; The X-axis has dates and three columns of data above each (comparing quantities installed during that week).&nbsp; My problem is that at each date the three columns are squeezed in very tightly and
 it is hard to see the differences in the data heights or colors while between the dates on the X-axis there is a lot of white space.&nbsp; I want my columns to be wider and less white space between each week. I can't figure out how to make this happen.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download trial version of MS Project</h2>
                    On Sept 15 I tried to download a trial copy of MS Project Professional 2010, using my Windows Live account.&nbsp; As a security step, the system told me it had sent an email to my registered account which would contain the remainder of the instructions for
 the download.&nbsp; I never recieved the email.&nbsp; Previously, on Aug 23 I used the same procedure to successfully download a trial version of Visio 2010.<br />
<br />
I spent a little over an hour being transferred from one phone support person to another (I have a list of 7 phone numbers, some of which I got twice), none of which had any ideas as to what to try next.&nbsp; They just collected the same info on phone number, email
 address, ciomnpany name etc, logged the call, and suggested i talk to someone else.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any ideas?

    <title>Microsoft Access Decrypt Button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shirleyrob2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access Decrypt Button</h2>
                    <p>I have an Access database that I use regularly and make updates to it weekly.&nbsp; I always do a "save as" copy as a back-up in case the original gets corrupted and never had a problem doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason it is no longer allowing me to save a copy.&nbsp; It is encrypted with a password so when I go to "save as" it is asking for the password which I have to put in twice for some reason and then it says password not recognised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to decrypt the password by going into the document as "exclusive" but when you go to where the decrypt button should be it is not there and still says encrypt.<br />
</p>
<p>Just wondered if anybody had any ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scanned my PC for any errors etc.&nbsp; All Office 365 is all up to date and PC also been re-started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At a loss now.</p>

<p>If you're confident that you did not add a password to your database, then you may have troubles with that database, or with your installation of Access or Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, be sure that you've installed all Office and Windows updates. If you have, then you may need to uninstall and reinstall Office. There are various ways to unistall, but I prefer this option:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Option #2 is the one to use, as it ensure you remove the registry entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of that works, then perhaps you have a recent backup you could use to recover? If so, then use that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, you'll probably have to use a recovery service like www.everythingaccess.com.</p>

<p>Hi there, Many thanks for taking the time to reply - much appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might not have explained properly. I did add a password to the database so obviously have to enter the password each time to access the database and all works o.k. and has been for a long time.&nbsp; It is just preventing me from doing a "save as". When I try
 and save as it asks for the password a couple of times and then says wrong password so that is why I wanted to decrypt the password from the original document and then I would hopefully be able to save a copy o.k.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said in my previous post it is not letting me decrypt when opening it as exclusive - the decrypt button just isnt there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering whether to re-install Office so will probably have to do this unless following this message there is anything else you can suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks again.</p>

    <title>Concatenate Rows in Access table through query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Concatenate Rows in Access table through query</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Sorry, I originally accidentally posted this question in an older thread about a similar issue. I am truly a novice, and have been using data bases specifically designed for my data so I have only ever needed to run queries in design view. My only
 experience in SQL view and VBA has been coming out of searching for a solution to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered data into a table named Inventory with several fields, but the relevant 4 are Catalog_Number, Material, Quantity, and Artifact_Type.&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Catalog_Number</td>
<td>Material</td>
<td>Quantity</td>
<td>Artifact_Type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000</td>
<td>Quartz</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Tertiary flake</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000</td>
<td>Quartz</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Projectile point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000</td>
<td>Chert</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Tertiary flake</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1001</td>
<td>Quartz</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Tertiary flake</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I need to produce a result (bear with me- I'm not the one that wants it this way) that shows all of the Quantity and Artifact_Type contents combined in a single field where Material is same only where Catalog_Number is same.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Catalog_Number</td>
<td>Material</td>
<td>Final Content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000</td>
<td>Quartz</td>
<td>2 Tertiary flake, 1 Projectile point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000</td>
<td>Chert</td>
<td>1 Tertiary flake</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1001</td>
<td>Quartz</td>
<td>1 Tertiary flake</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I tried adding fields and running an update query to populate a Cat_Mat field, since a combination of the Catalog number and material is what would necessitate each unique row. I also created a Artifact Type w_count so I only need to concatenate
 1 field. I realize this is redundant data, and I'm probably over complicating this, but I've got no support and my knowledge base is limited to having tables structured the way I want at the time of data entry. The other fields still exist, but I have not
 been trying to use them after this point.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cat_Mat</td>
<td>Artifact Type w_count</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000Quartz</td>
<td>2 Tertiary Flake</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000Quartz</td>
<td>1 Projectile Point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1000Chert</td>
<td>1 Tertiary flake</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1001Quartz</td>
<td>1 Tertiary flake</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I tried a few concatenation functions</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueclaw-db.com/concatenate_multiple_records_one_field.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blueclaw-db.com/concatenate_multiple_records_one_field.htm</a><br />

<p><a href="http://www.tek-tips.com/faqs.cfm?fid=4233." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tek-tips.com/faqs.cfm?fid=4233.</a></p>
<p>following the directions on how to add the code, copying and pasting the code exactly, and following the directions on how to use the function in a query. I've been getting a variety of errors for 2 days, including&nbsp;<span><span><span>compile
 errors on lines of modules, undefined&nbsp;functions in expressions, and syntax errors (missing operator) in query expressions.</span></span></span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>With my limited experience it is hard for me to adapt and trouble shoot from similar examples and solutions on forums, so I hope you all don't mind too much if this is repetitive. If I could figure out
 a way to do this with just queries I would, but I'm afraid I am in over my head, and would greatly appreciate any specific direction or advice anyone can provide. The simpler the better- I'm sorry to be a bother. Thanks so much- I really appreciate it.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>What I think you need to do is create a query that concatenates the Cat/Mat and Artifact/Count fields. Then use that query as the source of a query that uses a concatenation function (I would recommend Allen Browne's) to concatenate the Artifact/count field
 over Cat/Mat field.</p>

<p>In the last 24 hours I've handled 2 computers with this APLZOD.DLL problem.&nbsp; the first one took me all day yesterday.&nbsp; The second took about half an hour.&nbsp; I don't know what the Microsoft support folks will come up with.&nbsp; Nor do I know what the Apple support
 folks will do.&nbsp; I only know that they will continue to accuse each other while your computer fails to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my second computer I fixed the problem fairly quickly by doing a complete uninstall of iCloud for Windows followed by the install of iCloud for Windows.&nbsp; This fixed up my Outlook 2016 profile so that everything works the same as it did before the MS security
 updates clobbered Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I had previously run the installation repair function of iCloud for Windows figuring that this would be good enough.&nbsp; It wasn't.&nbsp; You must uninstall iCloud for Windows and reinstall it.</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel</p>
<p>I have the same problem with outlook 2010.</p>
<p>I cannot locate the subkey in the registry:</p>
<p>HKCU\software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Security\</p>
<p>What would a similar subkey be called in Outlook 2010?</p>

</p><p>I am not aware that this issue applies to Outlook 2010.&nbsp; If you want to try the registry key solution though follow the same instructions but set the path to 14.0 as noted below.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>how to get emails off 5230 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agb1---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to get emails off 5230</h2>
                    
<p>Eventually got email set up on 5230, but all come in via messages.&nbsp; Horrendous as it in no time dumped copies of hundreds of emails on ghe phone.&nbsp; Had to stop them by changing email settings on phone.&nbsp; NOW trying to get the hundreds of emails off the phone
 - every last bit of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far seems the only way is to throw phone in the sea, or run over it - any ideas??</p>

I've got entries in my Authenticator app I no longer need there (old/expired) but I can't find a way to remove them! No buttons, nothing but copy to clipboard when touching an entry for a second, how do I remove them?<br />

    <title>Word - Save Dialog Box Appears Again After Saving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesvan88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word - Save Dialog Box Appears Again After Saving</h2>
                    I am having a problem with one of our work computers using Word. When the user clicks on 'file' and goes to the backstage to save the document, they see the regular selection of recent locations, the file name, and the document type. After making changes
 then clicking save, the dialog box appears anyway, even though they have made their selections/changes on how to save the document. They then have to re-enter the new file name, and re-select the location and document type in order to save it.<br />
<br />
If they don't make the changes in the initial backstage view, and just click save to bring up the dialog box - After making the changes here and clicking save they are told that the file can't be found (of course not, we're trying to save it).<br />
<br />
What is causing this?

</p><p>Command: DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, , acFormatPDF, strOutputFile, False, , , acExportQualityPrint</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first the DoCmd.OutputTo method runs fine.</p>
<p>But if you do 10 minutes nothing (only opened)&nbsp;and then you try to run DoCmd.OutputTo again, access crashes without error.</p>
<p>It seems like a timer-problem, but there is no timer.</p>
<p>Only by acFormatPDF and only&nbsp;with accde. In a accdb-file all is fine.</p>
<p>It is not a&nbsp;problem of the PDF-Software. I checked several PDF-Software-Products. Additional: Parameter Autostart is false.</p>
<p>So the PDF-Software should do no matter.</p>
<p>It is not a Problem of anti-virus-Software. I checked it also without any anti-virus-Software.</p>

            <p>I have made the same kind of observations as NikolausM.&nbsp; I have discovered that if the app sits idle for 7 minutes and 59 seconds or less, it is able to store the pdf within C:\Temp&nbsp; .&nbsp; If it sits idle for 8 minutes and 0 seconds or more, it cannot store
 the pdf within C:\Temp.&nbsp; The application simply crashes without error during its attempt to convert the report to pdf, and store it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time threshold's&nbsp;given are as measured from the moment the application is opened.&nbsp; So, I have 7 minutes and 59 seconds from the time the application is opened to created and store the&nbsp;pdf, via DoCmd.OutputTo.&nbsp; After that time, if I attempt it, the app
 crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Office Pro Plus 2016 (32 bit) on Windows 10(64 bit).&nbsp; I am starting an accdb file from a bat file using START and a /runtime flag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Form_Open event handler of the applications Display Form , I ask to store the report as a pdf in C:\Temp.&nbsp; But first, I have the code pause for a set number of seconds, an amount&nbsp;which I varied&nbsp;during my tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a code sample that will give a good idea of&nbsp;how the test was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'**************************************<br />
Within Display Form:</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const secondsToSleep As Long =&nbsp;479<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testReportToPdfStorage secondsToSleep<br />
End Sub</p>
<p><br />
Public Sub testReportToPdfStorage(secondsToSleep As Long)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim millisecToSleep As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fullPathToStoredFile As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; millisecToSleep = secondsToSleep * 1000<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fullPathToStoredFile = "C:\Temp\" + "Statement-" &amp; secondsToSleep &amp; ".pdf"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PauseExecution millisecToSleep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'a call to a&nbsp;subroutine within libPauseExecution<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, "rptBillingStatement", acFormatPDF, fullPathToStoredFile, False, "", 0, acExportQualityPrint<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
'**************************************<br />
'libPauseExecution:&nbsp; Not much to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Declare Sub Sleep Lib "kernel32" (ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long)</p>
<p>Public Sub PauseExecution(lngMilliseconds As Long)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep lngMilliseconds<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have looked for clues as to cause in the Windows Event Log, but have found nothing.&nbsp; In addition, I have done some&nbsp;studying of ProcessMonitor logs, but have come to no conclusion what might be causing this time dependent crash to occur.&nbsp; This is a very
 repeatable problem.</p>

<p>I am not clear whether you experienced this problem too?&nbsp; Did you experience this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as a solution from Microsoft is concerned, I know of none, but I haven't searched much for a solution since March 29th since I'm developing an SSRS (Sql Server Reporting Services) workaround.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry Robert.&nbsp; I suppose I didn't answer your question about runtime or full access.&nbsp; I am running my application in a full version of Access2016, that&nbsp;was a&nbsp;part of Office Pro Plus 2016 (32 bit), run on Windows10 (64bit) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am launching my accdb from a bat file using START and a /runtime flag... so perhaps it is sort of like using the runtime version of Access, though I actually have the full version.&nbsp;

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, since I have replaced my Office 2007 and 2013 with Access 2013 all users who working with my application crash when trying to export to PDF (not always one time on two)</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S Over 50 users have the same problem (windows 7 and Windows 10 too)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have absolutely no idea about the solution and I find nothing about this problem on the Web...</p>

            <p>Robert.&nbsp; I do appreciate your getting back to me with more information on your particular situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really&nbsp;annoys me that I cannot find anything in&nbsp;the Windows Event Log corresponding to the crash.&nbsp; As I mentioned in an earlier posting, I've considered reviewing ProcessMonitor logs, but am a bit overwhelmed by how many ProcessMonitor entries there are,
 even in the second in which the export to pdf goes from good to bad!&nbsp;&nbsp; 7min59 seconds good.&nbsp; 8min00 seconds bad!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to eventually transition all my reporting to SSRS, and so have decided to begin use of&nbsp;SSRS in response to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you, your using Access2013, I gather, is a way to make the problem go away.&nbsp; This is good.&nbsp; I hope there is nothing preventing you from doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;also haven't seen a solution on the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good day,</p>

            <p>I - and many of my customers have exactly the same problem too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior occured since Office 2016/Access 2016&nbsp;has been deployed. Before (with Office 2013/Access 2013) everything was fine, after upgrade to Office 2016/Access 2016 this behavior occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Office 2016/Access 2016&nbsp; and you also install the Access 2013 Runtime, and open your application with the Access 2013 Runtime, everything works perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a bug in Access 2016. I hope somebody of Microsoft will listen to this conversation - and solve the problem!</p>

<h3> petr vones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail app push notification stopped working &#40;server issue&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Mail app push email notification for Outlook account stopped to work today (it was working for one year). I haven't changed anything. Note it stopped to work
<strong>on two different devices</strong> at the same time. The only way to get new messages is manual synchronization despite of it reports "Up to date" which is not true now. Calendar automatic updates still works (on both devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it is a server issue because TcpView now reports connection to <strong>
dub407-m</strong>.hotmail.com server (on both devices affected) while there was something that starts with snt&lt;number&gt; before when it had worked. It seems to be Microsoft account specific because notifications on other accounts where Mail app is connected to
 col403-m.hotmail.com server works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information, there is also similar change in redirected server url for Outlook web mail, it used to be snt151.mail.live.com for several months but today it has changed to
<strong>dub128</strong>.mail.live.com Maybe the new "dub" node is somehow out of sync ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to reinstall the Mail app, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>No, there is no problem with firewall settings as long as it has worked for one year on two devices and the connection itself works. Read my first post carefully. It is Microsoft server issue, the server node has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Short summary</span> (same issue on two diferent devices):</p>
<ul>
<li>My MS account until 20 Jan 2016 - connection to snt-xxx.hotmail.com - notifications worked</li><li>My MS account from 21 Jan 2016 - <strong>connection to dub407-m.hotmail.com - notifications does not work</strong></li><li>Other MS account - connection to col403-m.hotmail.com - notifications still works</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I can not choose to which Microsoft server node the Windows 8.1 Mail app connects but the dub407-m one I am being assigned to now is apparently broken. Note that automatic (push) Calendar events synchronization works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Fiddler debugging proxy to capture communication between the livecomm.exe process and Microsoft server. It has
<strong>confirmed</strong> that new email notification does not arrive from the server (while the calendar event updates does). How to get this fixed ?</p>

    <title>Video Green Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matkor1994  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Green Screen</h2>
                    Every time I try to play a video...youtube, youtube app, vimeo, you name it a green screen comes up. I was recommended to follow these directions:
<p>If you are using Internet Explorer, I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it works:</p>
<p>a. Open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>b. Click the <b>Tools</b> button or press <b>Alt key + X</b>, and then click <b>
Internet Options</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click the Advanced tab, and then browse to the <b>Accelerated graphics</b> section.</p>
<p>d. Click to select the Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering check box.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Apply</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>f. Close all open Internet Explorer window and then test the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did that and it still won't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I can add this to the list of problems I have been having with Windows 8 (Flash not working, updates stopping at 13%).</p>

            <p>Okay so I have been working on this for weeks and have fixed the problem for me with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not work for you but it may help. I purchased a new HP Notebook about 2 months ago with an AMD Graphics chip. I have tried absolutly everything to fix this issue and the GPU rendering does not work, period.</p>
<p>What we need in IE is to be able to turn Accelerated Graphics right off either by the old button when you used to right click on the video and turn it off or by a fix for Flash being built into IE with Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I uninstalled the latest set of drivers for my Graphics Chip and tried to go back to the first set of drivers for this notebook it did work well for awhile. but it seams that over time the issue developes again ussually after surfing Videos for an extended
 period of time or playing a game like D3 and then hitting Facebook and having the green screen come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only sure fire fix for me was to just uninstall the Catylist Drivers reboot and run the notebook with NO AMD Catylist drivers installed period. It works great and I havn't had the problem return. Games seam to play just fine and I have not had any issues
 with my comp since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seams to me that the fix for this would be easy... GIVE US BACK THE OLD SETTINGS BOX WHEN RIGHT CLICKING ON THE THE VIDEO BOX AND UNCLICKING THE ACCELERATED GRAPHICS BUTTON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEM SOLVED..... GO FIGURE. IF IT AINT BROKE THEN DON'T FIX IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Google chrome I can still just turn accelerated graphics off and everything works fine. It wasn't broke so google didn't break it just to "improve" it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so this is an addition for all the posts I have added to this group. Just a tally&nbsp; of all the fixes I have physically worked with to solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><div>First things first. Read about IE fix for Win 8.1</div>
<div>If it doesn't work for you then see if you have AMD Quick Stream and if so then uninstall it and see if that works. If not then grab the Flash-player uninstaller and see if that helps. Lastly try just uninstalling Catalyst drivers. Do not do them together.
 Do each one separately and after trying one it should work at first but fail after a time.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Uninstalling AMD Quick Stream is the only one that has worked and I have not had a green screen since . &nbsp;What we need is Microsoft dev team spending five minutes with Adobe and adding the option to un-click hardware acceleration back into the Flash settings
 instead of the &nbsp;option currently in the IE Advanced settings tab. It is junk the way it is now and there is no excuse for it.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Remove Outside User from Global Address List</h2>
                    
<p>I shared a directory from One Drive for Business&nbsp;with an Outside user who had a Hotmail account, this worked well.&nbsp; However when I did this I now noticed this user has been added to our GAL, which it shouldn't be.&nbsp; I've shared directories with other outside
 users in the&nbsp;past and this has not happened.&nbsp; Under Administrator / Exchange / Recipients / Contacts - there are no users listed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did this user get added to the GAL as well how to do I removed it?</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>I would like to know more information to test and identify the issue:<br />
1.&nbsp;Please show me the details about how you shared the directory.<br />
2.&nbsp;Do you have DirSync or AAD Sync deployment?<br />
3.&nbsp;Regarding the directory and GAL, do you mean the Office 365 Directory which you can see in People, or the local AD directory?</p>
<p>And please share with me a screenshot of the GAL where the unwanted user appears. You can hide users’ privacy. To upload the pictures, click

<p>hi eric,<br />
<br />
thanks for your reply.<br />
i understand that this external hotmail user automatically got added into your gal. also you have checked in office 365 eac (exchange admin center) to see if this user is added as an external mail contact but didn’t see this user. so my suggestion is that you
 can try to use powershell to check if this user is added as a mail contact. here are the steps:<br />
1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to exchange online using powershell</a> with an admin account.<br />
2. run the command below:<br />
<i>get-mailcontact<br />
</i>if you can find the user listed in the result after running the powershell command, you can run another command below to hide this user from the address list.<br />
<i>set-mailcontact -identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -hiddenfromaddresslistsenabled $true</i><br />
<br />
if the user is not listed in the result, could you check in office 365 owa (outlook web app) to see the detailed directory this user belongs to as the screenshot below, the all contacts, all users or any other directory?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4af03603-f83b-4668-8b74-f2528d38fb84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4af03603-f83b-4668-8b74-f2528d38fb84" /></a><br />

<p>Hi Eric &amp; Mia,</p>
<p>I did some tests using the same steps as Eric’s in One Drive for Business but the external user is not added to my GAL.</p>
<p>To further troubleshoot this issue, can you share with me the results of Yang’s steps?</p>

<h2>            My files are being held hostage by OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Recently, my hard drive had a melt down.</p>
<p>I had to buy a new computer and the computer came with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I had to take my original hard drive and have the files recovered into an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I began to set up my computer and somewhere during the process, agreed to OneDrive, which I didn't really want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I recovered my files on from the original hard drive, I downloaded them to the new computer.</p>
<p>Immediately, the went on OneDrive and within, two days, whatever space Microsoft gave me on OneDrive was full and Microsoft, now wants me to pay for more space, which is the precise reason I didn't want OneDrive or cloud service of any kind.</p>
<p>NOW, I've tried to transfer my files to my computer hard drive and OneDrive won't let them go. This seems to me to be a hostage situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to retrieve my files from OneDrive so that I don't have OR WANT the cloud service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HAHAHA LOL! Now I see the OneDrive forum has been locked! See no evil, Hear no evil?</p>

<h2>            Nokia 3120 Classic - restoring display menu</h2>
                    
<p>I was recently personalizing my Nokia 3120 classic and was trying to see what I preferred regarding the display (essentially the home screen).&nbsp; When I pressed the 'up' navigation button and then 'options' to changes what was displayed, I set all parts of
 the display to empty (when I first bought it, it was populated with a line of application/function icons - left to right in the top-most row, the date and time in the second row and 'notes' in the third row).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can't get anything back, and none of the Menu functions allow me to make any changes to this part of the display.&nbsp; Restoring factory settings does not restore this either.&nbsp; There is no intuitive way for this to work on the 'home' screen as the options
 function doesn't exist any more (emptying the rows has removed the function altogether).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing to direct a fix in the user manual either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Here are a couple of comments/suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you try to download and use the APA Format&nbsp;6th Edition Word 2007/2010 template from&nbsp;<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/templates/CT010117271.aspx#ai:TC101987287|" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>? This
 might save you some time and frustration. </li><li>Page numbers do not always dynamically update during editing sessions. This is to conserve resources. If you<em> absolutely have to</em> see updated page numbers during an editing session, you can use the<em>
 Print Preview</em> command to force an update of all fields (page numbers included).</li><li>If you need to put a simple page number into a header, open the header for editing and use alignment, margins and tabs to correctly position the<em> text insertion point</em> (e.g.<em> blinking cursor</em>), then
 press<em> CTRL+F9</em>&nbsp;and type<em> page</em>. Click back in the normal document area to close the header editing session. You've just created a page number in the header.</li></ul>
<p>I would personally take advantage of the freely offered (and proven) work of others by downloading and using the template.</p>

 can this be removed without downloading software? If he buys an anti-software program such as McAfee will he be able to download it successfully? And are his files protected when his computer is turned off? Thank you!

    <title>Has my account been hacked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bressoncartier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has my account been hacked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go into the search&nbsp;box at the top left hand side of microsoft outlook, and type in my own e-mail address, I get these options as well as my own e-mail address:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;and
</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where # represents numbers. When I put these codes in google, it brings up loads of stuff about e-mail integration (with android phones etc). I have not integrated my e-mail with any other device, so has my e-mail been hacked and has someone set up integration
 to their device?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been in to 'manage account' and it does not show any devices but would they show if it was set up via the device rather than through Outlook? Would any devices which have been added and then removed show up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, sometimes when I try and access my account, it takes me to the account menu but won't let me access the my inbox. Does this mean someone else is accessing my account from another computer at the same time I am trying to access my account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cartier</p>

            <p>Hi BressonCartier,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood correctly other search results appear in the search box of Outlook when you type your&nbsp;own email address and you've found out that some codes in those results are related to email integration with devices so you want to know if your account
 was hacked and has been integrated to any device.&nbsp;You've mentioned that you've checked the "Manage account" page and found no details regarding devices associated to your account and sometimes when you sign in you are directed to the Account summary page instead
 of your inbox so you want to know if someone else is accessing the account at the same time that you're using it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to the results that you are seeing in the search box,&nbsp;are you referring to the search box in Outlook.com indicated in the picture below and not with the search&nbsp;option in Microsoft Office Outlook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e60253a2-d00f-4d87-a873-dce9924f515b" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, please provide us the screenshot of the search results that you're seeing in the private message area that I've created for further investigation. Just click on the "<strong>You have a private reply to this message</strong>" link above your post
 to view the message and make sure that you are signed in to the forum to view the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an initial troubleshooting step, you can clear your browser’s cache and temporary internet files&nbsp; to make sure that your browser’s settings are not causing your issue and refer to this
<strong><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for assistance in clearing cache and cookies on various browsers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After optimizing, please close your entire browser and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try using your account on other supported browsers for Outlook.com to isolate the cause of the issue. You can visit this
<strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-wlsettings/which-browsers-are-supported-by-skydrive-people/63a2884f-99d9-4d21-806a-156c1b185b44">link</a></strong> for the details on the supported browsers for Outlook.com. It would
 also be better if you can provide us more information regarding this issue by answering the questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the same issue occur when using your account on a different browser/computer?</li><li>Does the same issue occur when using a different Microsoft account on the same browser/computer?</li><li>Do you remember any instances that might have caused the issue?</li></ul>
<p>To address your concern on how to determine what devices were&nbsp;integrated to&nbsp;your account, please be informed that you won't be able to see those information in the Manage account page. Instead, you'll be receiving a notification in&nbsp;the mobile number associated
 to your account or in your alternate email address&nbsp;informing&nbsp;you that your account has been integrated to any device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to your issue with being directed to the Account summary page instead of your inbox when signing in, it's possible that this issue occurs because you're logging in via
<a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a> instead of <a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://mail.live.com</a> so I would advise you to try optimizing your browser first then sign in to your account again at&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you believe that your account has been hacked, w<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e urgently a<font><span>dvise you to</span>
<span>check and clean</span> <span>your computer</span>
<span>from viruses,</span> <span>then change your password and update your account credentials to&nbsp;by following the steps provided in the help article "<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/hacked-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My
 Outlook.com account has been hacked</a></strong>".</span></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>You can also request for your account's IP log in history to verify if someone else is trying to access your account by submitting a
 support request using the secure e-form for Microsoft account issues in this <strong>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</span></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
