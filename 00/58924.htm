<h2>            Windows 7 - Frequent &#34;Not Responding&#34; Problem</h2>
                    For the last 3 days I started getting frozen screens. It first happened while I was playing Team Fortress 2. Screen froze for a minute and then everything turned back to normal. After that I started getting "not responding" where programs of all sorts
 stop responding for about a minute. It happened in IE, Chrome, Media Player, Security Essentials so far and I keep getting them. Specifically the program would suddenly freeze -with mouse still visible and I can move it- and then it comes back as if nothing
 happened. In Media Player the song would stop playing and after about a minute would either continue from where it froze or skip the time in between. It occasionally happens consecutively to the same program and lasts a bit shorter.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I should also mention that I ran a full scan with Security Essentials which took over 4 hours with all the freezing happening countless times. No viruses found. I also got Norton 360 running but haven't scanned with it yet</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My computer is not new and I have been using it the way I did for over 5 months now since I changed the HDD (Current one is 150 GB) . Specs:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 64-bit SP1</div>
<div>Intel Core 2duo 8400</div>
<div>2 GB RAM</div>
<div>ATI Radeon 4850</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My first post so sorry if I haven't been clear or missing details. Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: I should also mention an overall performance drop on my PC.</div>

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Hi </p>
<p>What you are experiencing is the <strong>TDR</strong> (<strong>T</strong>imeout
<strong>D</strong>etection and <strong>R</strong>ecovery) component in Winfdows 7. When a process takes too long to respond, the system will stop and restart that process to recover. In the past this would would require the system to shut down and restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This particular timing issue can be difficult to track down and resolve, but is usually associated with the Graphics device and driver.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It's been my experience that the most common causes of the TDR problem are the following.
</span></p>
<p><span>(In no particular order)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Startup programs:</span></b><span> A program that is set to start at boot that is either corrupt or otherwise using a&nbsp;large amount of system resources. (Remove any unneeded programs from the the Startup)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Overclocking:</span></b><span> This is one of the most common. (Set all of the hardware back to the defaults)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Too many graphic intensive programs</span></b><span> running at the same time. (try running ewer programs at the same time)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Gaming programs</span></b><span> that have 'mods' and try to use more&nbsp;graphic resources than the installed device can supply. (Remove the mods)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can try&nbsp;extending the TDR value as described in the following article?</span></p>
<p><span>Display driver stopped responding and has recovered Error message in Windows Vista or Windows 7:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2665946/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2665946/</a></span></p>
<p><span>Check for updated drivers for the installed graphics device.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know what you find.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

            <p>It all depends if your hardware supports that feature level in Windows 10. If you have the latest drivers for the video then you may not be able to run Unreal in Windows 10. Looking at the support page it doesn't have Windows 10 drivers.</p>
<p>Run Dxdiag.exe in the run command to check your DirectX level.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 going crazy&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and lately, I have a very strange problem: windows explorer - I will open folders and after 1-2 minutes of use the PC&nbsp;will refresh&nbsp;as if I have pushed the show desktop option, and the PC will close all opened folders and I will have to open all folders again?!</p>
<p>there will be times that it will happen before I can open any folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone find a fix to this? do I need to run the repair option? delete all c? I am so frustrated I'm thinking on going back to 8.1!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards,&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I can't add any printer regardless of brand (HP, Zebra, Citizen...)</p>
<p>Every time I try to install I get the 0x0000007b error...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried all latest drivers with no success. Tried to clean up all printers drivers even spooler folders... I'm suspecting some Windows fault, but maybe anyone resolved such issue?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you walk me through what steps you took before it got in this situation? Did you have the SkyDrive Desktop Client installed on Windows 8 and upgraded to 8.1? The two blue arrows means that folder is still syncing, so it could be that waiting a bit will
 be enough for the files to show up. Where did you delete the original? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that SkyDrive is a syncing system, so if you delete something on one machine it will be deleted everywhere. So do please be careful about that. If you're syncing this file between multiple computers I'd check the recycle bin of all machines for that
 file (it should be there; SkyDrive never permanently deletes anything). You can also go to
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/</a>&nbsp;and click the Recycle Bin link in the lower left to see if the file is there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>-Erik</p>

Download/apply the .lnk (shortcuts) association fix from this URL:<br />

That should take care of the problem.

<h3> chriskarns  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to force PS&#47;2 drivers load on startup for Win 7</h2>
                    I have Identified the problem of why my IBM model M keyboard doesn't work on start up. I am currently using it now to type with. It works in Bios, and works fine on older computers. The way I have remedied this situation is using an old HP keyboard, then
 swapping the cord over to the IBM keyboard after windows starts. This tricks windows to load the PS/2 drivers. How can I Force the PS/2 drivers to load each time I start windows? This would fix the bug, and make it work without swapping keyboards after start
 up.&nbsp; The drivers I need to force are i8042prt.sys and kbdclass.sys. where do I go to enable them?<br />

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I would suggest you to update the latest version of chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website and check.</font></font></font></span></p>

    <title>Keyboard possibly permanently disabled or doesn&#39;t respond to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard possibly permanently disabled or doesn&#39;t respond to switching between tablet&#47;desktop in Samsung galaxy book</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Galaxy book has this function where if you fold back the attached keyboard it would automatically switch to tablet mode and disable the keyboard; if you flip it back flat it would immediately come back to desktop mode and keyboard's backlight would come
 up. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>However after not even 1 year of use, I noticed mine has been really slow to respond to said position changes and so I had to enable a notification for every switch to see when it actually responds. Before, if I fiddled around with it for some time it would
 still respond timely to switching modes, but a few days ago it's become less and less responsive, sometimes even coming up with the wrong mode's notification. It used to have a notification sound whenever I switch modes/detach/attach keyboard but now that's
 gonna as well. Today I've only managed to make the keyboard light come on twice....after a lot of attempted driver updates and restarts.... So I really wanna know what the problem actually is...
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I'm using win 10 home ver 1803, already looked through a lot of the questions in the forum and tried updating whole system, updating all drivers in DM, a lot of restarts and detaching the keyboard..... The keyboard itself doesn't seem to be broken in any
 way, only used this for 1 year only detached a few times. So i thought maybe something wrong with the driver for responding to mode switch is faulty? Like my keyboard is still disabled because it thinks I'm still in tablet mode? Or something to do with the
 compatibility of updates like in this q?https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/auto-swich-mode-tablet-not-working-after-fall/ac0ac2c7-937b-4e83-be99-ae5af4c9a434?auth=1&amp;page=2</p>

<span>Changes in the operating system like major

<span>If your device has suddenly disabled some options and no longer operate in a normal way, it means they’re no longer compatible with your current operating system anymore. To get more details about your issue

<ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press

<p>
<span>In addition, you will need to check if there are any new BIOS (Basic Input / Output System) driver updates or releases from your
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">computer manufacturer’s website</span></strong> (which is Samsung). We strongly recommend downloading and installing them to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
Once done with the installing, check your keyboard settings if its functionality will return to normal again.

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>It's OS Build 17134.285<br />
Model # SM-W727NZKAKOO</p>
<p>No error message present</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using troubleshoot for hardware and keyboard, both saying nothings wrong; uninstalling keyboard drivers in DM and reinstalling; updating system and check every single drivers in DM and updating the ones that said have updates; rubbing the keyboard
 connector buds with rubber/paper etc. And of course a lot of restarting and detaching to see any of that worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I had this issue I don't recall doing anything irregular...does updating system when it required count?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for bios drivers, I didn't find anything like that, but I know that Samsung has this Samsung update app that supposedly has all drivers in one place and tell you if anything needed to be updated. Last time I checked they were all updated.</p>
<p>

 to get this game running?

<p><em>"the properties folder or whatever "</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp; Whatever is not helpful. Do try and be accurate with error messages. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The game was released in '02, which puts it just within the era when games are more likely to have compatibility problems.</p>
<p>I have two games from '02 that using Compatibility with Win95\98 (which is supposed to force games to run on a single core of the cpu)</p>
<p>helps make them run.</p>
<p>- You could try setting Compatibility on the games<em> setup.exe</em> on the disc (or other name the games installer may use) before starting the install.</p>
<p>Sometimes copying all files from the disc to a folder on your desktop (or other preferred location. This folder gets deleted later),</p>
<p>and try installing the game from there will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the files fail to copy completely and it happens at the same percentage if you try again, the disc is probably dirty or stuffed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Also verify you have Direct Play enabled in... <em>Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features On or off
</em></p>
Scroll down to and enable<em> Legacy Components</em> &amp;<em> Direct Play</em>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't have the data for Sid Meier's SimGolf,&nbsp; but Sim Golf 2 uses <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>SafeDisk </em>copy protection</span>. I can't find anything about Sim Golf 2,</p>

    <title>How to fix corrupted tasks found in task scheduler - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to fix corrupted tasks found in task scheduler</h2>
                    If you are having issues with error messages like "The task image is corrupt or has been tampered with," I hope the following helps you:<br />
<br />
I had 3 tasks saying that they were corrupt or tampered with:<br />
<br />
1. Task ValidationTaskDeadline<br />
2. Task ValidationTask<br />
3. Task AutomaticBackup<br />
<br />
These 3 errors would not let me back up my computer, and would make my computer say that my copy of windows 7 was not genuine, even though it was.&nbsp; If any of you are going through this exact problem or one similar.&nbsp; I feel your pain.&nbsp; Here is how I fixed it.<br />
<br />
1. Open My Computer<br />
2. Go into the C:\<br />
3. Open the Windows folder<br />
4. Open the System32 folder<br />
5. Open the Tasks folder<br />
<br />
At this point things can get a bit tricky because you have to know which folder contains the corrupt task.&nbsp; As there are numerous ways to figure out this part already, I will just skip it.&nbsp; Once you find out the proper folder, simply delete it.&nbsp; If you were
 having the backup issue I was having, simply run a new backup, and all should be working well again.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.&nbsp; I understand how frustrating this issue can be, especially if you can't backup your computer.<br />

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you today
<br />
<br />Create a VPN profile
<br />
<br />If you don't have a VPN profile on your Windows 10 PC, you'll need to create one. Before you start:
<br />
<br />If it’s for work, look for VPN settings or a VPN app on your company’s intranet site while you’re at work, or contact your company's support person.
<br />If it’s for a VPN service you subscribe to for personal use, visit the Microsoft Store  to see if there’s an app for that service, then go to the VPN service’s website to see if the VPN connection settings to use are listed there.
<br />Select the Start  button, then select Settings  &gt; Network &amp; Internet  &gt; VPN &gt; Add a VPN connection.
<br />In Add a VPN connection, do the following:
<br />For VPN provider, choose Windows (built-in). In the Connection name box, type a friendly name (for example, My Personal VPN) for the VPN connection profile. This is the VPN connection name to look for when you try to connect In the Server name or address box. Type the address for the VPN server.
<br />For VPN type, choose the type of VPN connection you want to create. You’ll need to know which kind of VPN connection your company or VPN service uses.
<br />For Type of sign-in info, choose the type of sign-in info (or credentials) to use. This might be a user name and password, one-time password, certificate, or a smart card if you’re connecting to a VPN for work. Type your user name and password in the respective boxes (optional).
<br />Select Save.
<br />If you need to edit the VPN connection info or specify additional settings, such as the proxy settings to use for the VPN connection, choose the VPN connection and then select Advanced options.
<br />Connect to a VPN
<br />When you have a VPN profile, you’re ready to connect.
<br />
<br />On the far right of the taskbar, select the Network icon (either  or ).
<br />Select the VPN connection you want to use, then do either of the following depending on what happens when you select the VPN connection:
<br />If the Connect button displays under the VPN connection, select Connect.
<br />If VPN in Settings opens, select the VPN connection there, then select Connect.
<br />If you're prompted, type your user name and password or other sign-in info.
<br />When connected, the VPN connection name will display Connected underneath it.
<br />To see if you’re connected to the VPN while you’re doing things on your PC, select the Network icon (either  or ) on the far right of the taskbar, then see if the VPN connection says Connected underneath it.
<br />
<br />Connected to a VPN

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, try to run your computer in safe mode by following the steps in this link Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10 and see if it helps. If the issue is not occurring while in safe mode, that would mean a program is interfering. In that case, you
 can perform a clean boot by following the steps on this link <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            &#34;Windows not Genuine&#34; issue...</h2>
                    Hi all, I have a genuine OEM copy of Windows that came preinstalled on an Acer computer. Suddenly, MS is telling me that it is not genuine. If I go to&nbsp;www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/ I can confirm this. I have posted the diagnostic report below. I
 have scoured the Net and can find lots of people with this issue, but cannot find a solution that works in my case. I have tried the following:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>- Checked Intel Storage drivers</p>
<p>- Checked for multiple language packs ( as per:&nbsp;kb2105247)</p>
<p>- chkdsk /r</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow (found problems it couldn't fix - unsure if this is related, but I can send logs if needs be)</p>
<p>- Compared the files&nbsp;sppcomapi.dll and&nbsp;sppcommdlg.dll with another Acer machine. They are exactly the same (ie Hex the same)</p>
<p>- Tried to re-activate as per some suggestions, but am unable to do so. MS tell me the OEM version is "locked" to Acer and they cannot reactivate it.</p>
<p>- Confirmed the PC is virus and spyware free with 3 different scanners</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have no idea where to go from here. From what I have understood, the computer is correctly activated, but the Windows Validation tool has found files it believes have been tampered with. I really don't want to spend hours reformatting and re-installing
 software. Does anyone have a suggestion I could try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p><br />

            Thanks for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I cannot change the product key using the instruction in link you gave me. At the bottom of the System Information screen, under "Windows Activation" it simply says "Windows is activated", shows my Product ID and that's it. No choice to
 change the product key.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>I think the reason is here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/cannot-change-product-key-in-windows-7/80f896b1-3483-435a-9b7f-d0c92442284f</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Your computer has a OEM-SLP version of Windows 7 Ultimate installed. &nbsp;Due to the fact that several critical system files have been tampered with, you will not be able to change the product key. &nbsp;You will need to reinstall your Windows 7 operating system
 using the recovery method recommended by your computer manufacturer."</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the troubleshooting I have done, I don't believe it is an activation issue. Since it is an OEM version, it comes pre-activated. I believe the issue is to do with "Windows Validation", which according to my research (there are a lot of mixed messages
 and confusion on the Net about this - so I could be incorrect) is different to Activation. I believe that Windows can be successfully activated, but if the Windows Genuine Validation Tool finds issues - such as "tampered files" it marks your copy as not genuine,
 thus my issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I may be barking up the wrong tree, but this is what I seem to have gathered from hours on the Net. The issue I have is that I cannot understand why these files above are showing as "<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Tampered File" and how to fix this...</span></div>

            <p>Thanks for the link. Unfortunately, it did not help. Windows is OEM and pre-activated. Thus I cannot activate it any more</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(step 1 in the link:&nbsp;<span><em>Open <span>
Windows</span> Activation by clicking the <span>Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />,
 right-clicking <span>Computer</span>, clicking <span>Properties</span>, and then clicking
<span>Activate <span>Windows</span> now</span></em>.</span>‌ Doesn't work, as I do not have that option).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not believe this is an activation issue. From the Googling I have done (LOTS!) people with a Windows Validation issue are often told to activate. However, their copy of Windows is already activated (As is mine). However, the validation tool that runs
 in the background has flagged certain files as being modified, and flags windows as non genuine...</p>

            Thanks. I did try this earlier, but Microsoft could not help me. They said that since the product key is Acer OEM, MS are unable to assist and I needed to call Acer. Needless to say Acer were no help: "Reset to factory default"

            Cheers for the reply. This is what I stated from the start, but everyone keeps insisting it is an activation issue!
<div><br />
<div>I know the original post is a long way up - so I'm not surprised you missed it, but I did initially run sfc /scannow. It said that it found problems it couldn't fix. I can send logs if needs be. Strange thing is, I compared these two files to the same
 files on another Acer Windows 7 PC with the same SP level and the files were exactly the same (I mean same hash value and everything).</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I'm starting to think that maybe the files haven't been tampered with, but for some reason the OS thinks they have?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know at this stage I could just reformat, but this isn't the 1st time I have come across this issue. I feel that there has to be a fix rather than simply reformatting...</div>

            <p>I found a much simpler method.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open SETTINGS</p>
<p>2. Select EASE OF ACCESS&nbsp; (help for visually and hearing-impaired users)</p>
<p>3. Select MOUSE</p>
<p>4. Select POINTER SIZE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Select largest size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This not only increases the size of the pointer, but also increases the length &amp; width of the cursor.&nbsp; (I also changed my pointer color from white to black.&nbsp; Makes it much easier to see.)</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hi Paowie,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community, and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to try these steps provide below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Use windows explorer/Windows 10 equivalent is called This PC to navigate
 to "Local Disk (C:)&gt;Windows&gt;Cursor".</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 2:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span>Make a new folder for your custom cursor set, and drop it in. This should not be compressed in any way, i.e. it should be just a regular folder with the .cur files in it, not a .zip or .rar. You should have at least the basics, like the resting
 cursor, hovering over a link cursor, etc etc, not every single arrow is required to make it work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 3:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> After it is dropped in, hit the start menu, then settings. Type "cursor"
 in the find a setting bar. Pick "Change how the mouse pointer looks" and it will give you a pop up with a new menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>From here, it's pretty easy.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 4:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Make sure you are on the pointer tab, the scheme is set to none, then click
 each 'type' of cursor one at a time in the Customize menu. When the cursor you want to change is highlighted blue, hit browse and navigate to that new folder you made right inside the default location it opens to.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 5:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Select the corresponding custom cursor, then hit open. This will replace the
 default option with your corresponding custom cursor. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 6:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Do so for all options you'd like to change, then hit Save As under the scheme
 selection drop down box. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 7:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Give it a name, then hit apply and then Okay. Your cursor should change.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In future, if you have any issues related to Windows, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

            I got this computer from a friend, they got new ones. I did updates on it because it has been sitting for a year without being updated. There were a lot of updates, ( close to 100). When I restarted it after the updates it looked like it was starting,
 it went through the Dell logo then into the Windows XP screen, then the screen went black and a blue screen came up with the error code STOP: c0000221 (Bad image checksum) The image lz32.dll is possibly corrupt. The header checksum does not match the computed
 checksum. I have tried everything. I have changed the boot sequence to the CD Rom it won't read it. I've tried all the keys you mentioned, when I get to the screen to go to safe mode when I change it to go to safe mode it won't do it, it trys to restart and
 does the same thing over again.<br />

            Hello, scarlet9549. I remember you from this thread:
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/please-can-someone-tell-me-what-to-do-error-code/2d4b7e06-4d71-4c40-9198-0d3da9834a63">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/please-can-someone-tell-me-what-to-do-error-code/2d4b7e06-4d71-4c40-9198-0d3da9834a63</a>
<div><br />
<div>From what I gather, you never did build the bootable CD correctly, which is fine for now since you really don't need it anyway.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The good news is you have a Dell Windows XP Reinstallation CD at the SP3 level. It is available if you ever do decide to use it to perform a Clean Install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But as mentioned in the other thread, your best bet for now is to do the following:</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>____________________________________________________________________________________</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>&nbsp; NOTICE: Using PC Restore permanently deletes all data on the hard drive and removes any applications or&nbsp;</div>
<div>drivers installed after you received your computer. If possible, back up the data before using PC Restore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To use PC Restore:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Turn on the computer. During the boot process, a blue bar with www.dell.com appears at the top of the screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Immediately upon seeing the blue bar, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F11&gt;. If you do not press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F11&gt; in time, let the computer finish restarting, and then restart the computer again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; NOTICE: If you do not want to proceed with PC Restore, click Reboot in the following step.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. On the next screen that appears, click Restore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. On the next screen, click Confirm. The restore process takes approximately 6–10 minutes to complete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. When prompted, click Finish to reboot the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; NOTE: Do not manually shut down the computer. Click Finish and let the computer completely reboot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. When prompted, click Yes. The computer restarts. Because the computer is restored to its original operating state, the screens that appear, such as the End User License Agreement, are the same ones that&nbsp;</div>
<div>appeared the first time the computer was turned on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. Click Next. The System Restore screen appears and the computer restarts.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>8. After the computer restarts, click OK.</div>
<div><br />
<div>____________________________________________________________________________________
<div><br />
<div>Now, in your other thread, you stated that you "<span>tried the Ctrl + F11 key with no luck." But you didn't give specifics. I still think this is your best bet for now. Try again. If you still have a problem, give a detailed account of what went wrong.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>As far as the Clean Install option goes, the F12 key is the way to go (with your Dell CD in the optical drive). You had had problems with booting off a CD in the past, but it must have been because you burned the CD incorrectly. The only way one
 can boot off a CD is if the CD is bootable. :-) The good news is surely your Dell CD is bootable.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>But before trying the Clean Install with your Dell CD, you really should try the PC Restore technique outlined on p. 43 from your manual.</span></div>

            I tried it again it won't do it. I did make another Recovery CD but the CD drive won't read it. I went to F12 and changed the boot sequence again to CD but it still won't read it. It won't read the Dell Windows XP Re-installation CD. When I put the CD
 ( any ) CD in the CD Rom it won't read any of them. Could it possibly be the CD Rom is no good? and if it is what do I do about it? I have a Dell Dimension 4100 that I'm not using, should I take the CD Rom out of it and put in the 2400?<br />

            What exactly do you mean by "the CD drive won't read it"? What exactly happens?
<div><br />
<div>Do you ever see this screen:</div>

            Let's backtrack.
<div><br />
<div>When you press F12, do you see a screen that looks something like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg70.imageshack.us%2fimg70%2f4396%2fbootdevicemenu2wz.png" /> </div>
<div><br />
<div>Remember, you need to press F12 immediately after you turn on the PC! (It's not a bad idea to tap it repeatedly, just in case.)</div>

 _"and nothing more as for Hirens Boot Cd I think it needs img.burn on Cd or Dvd to operate (?).thanks,Alice.Any other ideeas?As I run the Hiren even from flash.Does that flash needs to be reformated and only contain HirenBootCD?My regards to anyone who can
 help me,please. </p>

            <p>How long did you leave it at "Start booting from CD.."? It usually takes about 30 min for some slow machines to boot the CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Did a friend create the Hirens Boot CD? If so, did they test it to make sure it was working?</p>
