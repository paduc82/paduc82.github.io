                    How do I add new icons to the SystemRoot%\System32\shell32.dll on my computer or is there another place plus I have icons that are png files that are not recognized, will they work or what type of icons can I download to a place on my computer to use on
 a windows 10 platform?

<p>Hi Mitchell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icons found in SystemRoot%\System32\shell32.dll are by default. Only .dll files can be used as icons, you need to use a third party software that can convert/create your .png files to .dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to post back should you have any other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Skype Number no longer works, cannot get a new one</h2>
                    <p>Skype seems to have given away my Skype Number to a local business.&nbsp; I am not sure how this happened, but when I try to get a new Skype number, the system asks me what state I am in.&nbsp; I am in New Mexico.&nbsp; It is a state.&nbsp; But it does not appear on the list
 of states.&nbsp; Hence, I cannot proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Skype is very careful to avoid having any customer service number, so there is no human being to help with this.&nbsp; Is there any way that we can get help from a real person, and get a Skype number?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            0x124_GenuineIntel - WIN7_DRIVER_FAULT - WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR BSOD&#47;Crash</h2>
                    I've been experiences crashes for months ever since the obtaining this tower, though they only seem to occur during the intense use of gaming/rendering and sometimes the use of high quality Flash (Though seemingly on on Youtube, all other players work
 fine). Crashing during Youtube is a rare occurrence and has only actually happened a handful of times in the past.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Altering my BIOS settings including eventually resetting them to defaults.</li><li>Cleaning my GPU (which fixed the fault of overheating on the board) and reseating it.</li><li>Updating AMD drivers from the official site.</li><li>A clean reinstall of both Windows 7 and Windows 8 (Crashes occur on Windows 8, as well).</li><li>Observing and noting performance of CPU and RAM during intense operations.</li><li>Removing some software inducing faults during operation.</li><li>Reseating RAM, HDD, GPU.</li></ul>
<div>Although I have not yet checked the CPU physically, it performs well under every other task but the main reason would be that the heatsink is large and to remove this It would involve removing the other components before hand and I've no completely static-free
 area to store them during this process (I do, however, have an anti-static wristband for when I need to make alterations).</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A copy of my most recent DMP file is located here:&nbsp;http://sdrv.ms/17Z0Pj7</div>

<div>Any help would be appreciated, thank you in advance.</div>

            This one crash was 0x124 and refers to genuine Intel.&nbsp; I would run the cpu stress test prime95<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<em>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.<br />
If you continue to get BSOD here are some more things you may want to consider.</em><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that
 it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the in-built memory diagnostics (run MDSCHED) or the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing.</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee
 that the RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates,
 or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether
 the machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately
 the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.<br />
<br />

<div><br />
Prime95 Setup;<br />
- extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice<br />
- double click on the executable file<br />
- select "Just stress testing"<br />
- select the "Blend" test.&nbsp; If you've already run MemTest overnight you may want to run the "Small FFTs" test instead.<br />
- "Number of torture test threads to run" should equal the number of CPU's times 2 (if you're using hyperthreading).<br />
The easiest way to figure this out is to go to Task Manager...Performance tab - and see the number of boxes under CPU Usage History<br />
Then run the test for 6 to 24 hours - or until you get errors [b](whichever comes first)<br />
The Test selection box and the stress.txt file describes what components that the program stresses.</div>

<p>This error is related to the display adapter.</p>
<p>Which display adapter do you have and are you using the latest version of the driver for the display adapter?</p>
<p>When did this problem start?</p>
<p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

<p>It is not necessary to reinstall the operating system in order to get a sound card to work! All you need to do is locate the correct driver, download it, and install it. If you post back with the make and model of your motherboard, we should be able to help
 you find the audio driver if you are unable to do so.</p>
<p>Note: It is also important to install the correct drivers for the chipset and video card (and maybe the network card, too).</p>
<p>When you "reinstalled OEM Win XP," what exactly did you do? Clean, Repair, or Parallel Install?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I have done the following:</p>
<p>uninstalled and reinstalled the audio driver including the newest driver from Realtek.</p>
<p>I have updated the BIOS</p>
<p>I tried the microsoft repair utility / fix it from microsoft.--pertaining to fixing no sound.</p>
<p>I tried to resolve the problem with Intel 3x (intel MB)</p>
<p>Intel told me I needed to reinstall the OS. Someone else did the reinstall of the OS after the New hardware was installed.</p>
<p>Today I just did:</p>
<p>direct x diagnostic tool---report said there is no sound card or sound device installed.</p>
<p>I did a search using SIW and I see no RealTek (sound codec / driver manf.) Under sound/controller in device mgr. the only showing sound device is a TigerJet USB phone, that shows up in the sound device recorder / playback. I've disabled it in device manager
 but still no sound. WMP shows No Audio device found. I've tried booting up w/o TigerJet phone plugged in but still no sound. The video card &amp; network card all work no prob with them.</p>

<p>Go into the BIOS to see if there is a setting for onboard audio. If the BIOS is set properly, I suspect there is something wrong with the motherboard. I think you would do better posting to a hardware forum or newsgroup.</p>
<p>Still, if you wouldn't mind and answer&nbsp;this question:</p>
<p>When you "reinstalled OEM Win XP," what exactly did you do? Clean, Repair, or Parallel Install?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I have checked the BIOS setting realted to the onboard sound and it is ON. Again, I didn't install the OS after the upgraded MB &amp; Video card were installed.</p>
<p>The OS run fine with no problems the only issue is the No Sound.</p>
<p>The MB is new and from Intel. I've read on another forum that when reinstalling OEM Win XP with a new MB a " repair or upgrade " install should be used ?</p>

<p>It's still possible there is something wrong with a new motherboard.</p>
<p>Yes, when you change a motherboard (unless it's identical to the old one), it is necessary to perform a Repair Install. That is why I asked what you meant by the phrase "reinstalled OEM Win XP." I was asking if you performed a Clean Install, a Repair Install,
 or a Parallel Install. In your first post, you stated you reinstalled the OS. But your most recent post seems to contradict this!</p>
<p>So, what kind of install was it? And what is the timeline?</p>
<p>(If you installed the OS prior to changing the motherboard, you will still need to perform a Repair Install.)</p>

<p>I did not do the install of the New MB or the New Video card and the REinstall of the OS, someone else did it. I'll try to find out which type of OS reinstall they did.</p>

<p>If the Clean Install was performed AFTER the&nbsp;new motherboard and video card were installed, then a subsequent Repair Install is unnecessary.</p>
<p>If all the correct drivers are installed properly, then there is a hardware issue. It's possible that there is something wrong with the motherboard or the onboard audio component.</p>
<p>Have you looked at Device Manager?</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>Reinstalling the OS (Clean Install or Repair Install) won't solve your problem (assuming the Clean Install was performed after the new motherboard was installed).</p>
<p>Now, if for some odd reason, the Clean Install WAS performed when the&nbsp;OLD motherboard was present, then yes, I can see how a Repair Install could help.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Control Panel &#39;View by&#39; settings will not stick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajacks88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Control Panel &#39;View by&#39; settings will not stick</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 8 Pro N. When I open up the control panel its default view is 'category'. If I change that to 'Small Icons', close out of control panel, and open it again, it is back to 'category' view.<br />
<br />
Is there some setting that needs to be set in order for that preference to stick?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            I had the same problem. While the 4 steps did not work for me either, I've found a somewhat similar solution as Ajacks that I believe will work on all Windows 8 platforms.<br />
<br />
When you open Control Panel, it opens in "Category" view by default. <br />
If you look up at the address bar it'll just say "Control Panel".<br />
But if you switch to "Small Icons" or "Large Icons", the address now reads "Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items"<br />
<br />
If you hover the mouse over the words "All Control Panel Items" it will highlight blue. You could then click and drag it out to the desktop to create a shortcut. When you click on that shortcut, it should open control panel to Small or Large Icons view, depending
 on which view you last closed it on (Category view won't count!). Additionally, you can right-click that shortcut and Pin to Start Menu or add to Favorites for convenient access. You can also change the name to "Control Panel" if you don't like the bulky "All
 Control Panel Items" name. <br />
<br />
If you want Control Panel to open in Category view again then do the same thing, but this time highlight and drag the words "Control Panel" from the address bar to desktop and pin it Start or where ever you usually click to open Control Panel up.<br />
<br />
Hope this solution makes it easy to whoever reads this to match their preference!<br />

<h2>            Chicony usb 2.0 graph render fail.</h2>
                    i have a toshiba L300-148 laptop with a built in webcam running chicony usb 2.0 when i load the camera assitant software it displays graph render fail. i have tried re-installing and rolling back the driver, i have also deleted the devicde from device
 manager and Vista has auto dected and reinstalled the device. I have visited the tosiba website to no avail. Any ideas would be most helpful as device manager states that the device is working correctly but obviously its not!!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Easy fix for this. Happened to me too. Probably happened because other<br />
software downloaded has corrupt the camera assistant software. Go into<br />
control panel, programs and features if using Vista. click on camera<br />
assistant software. Click on change at the top<br />
and then choose the repair option and this will fix the issue str8 away!<br />
<br />
<br />
hope it helps

<h2>            After failed update rollback, windows will not resume&#47;boot.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone.&nbsp; So I finally acquiesced and decided to install (what I believe to be) the fall creators update for windows 10.&nbsp; This caused some issues with a 2nd GPU, and I was unable to fix it.&nbsp; I decided to go back to a previous version of windows.&nbsp; I went
 through all the system dialog, and that was that.&nbsp; After leaving the PC to do its thing for a while, I noticed I was at the spinning white dots.&nbsp; No text, just the dots.&nbsp; I figured it was normal, so I left it.&nbsp; I came back 2 hours later to the same screen.&nbsp;
 My OS in installed on an SSD, so I couldn't believe it would take this long.&nbsp; I assumed it was hanging, and reluctantly did a reboot.&nbsp; Upon loading past motherboard splash screen, I get the blue windows logo for 1 second, then black screen.&nbsp; On/off many times,
 same result.&nbsp; I create a USB stick using media creation tool.&nbsp; Loads fine.&nbsp; Nothing is working with these options.&nbsp; Can't find OS, can't restore, I have no images saved.&nbsp; I was able to move a few important files on to external drives by navigating through
 the file system under the option to locate drivers to attempt to restore from an image.&nbsp; I can see everything is still there, which is good.&nbsp; I loaded up the command prompt, went though all bootrec and chkdsk commands.&nbsp; Mostly running into "Can't find element".&nbsp;
 So now I'm stuck.&nbsp; The PC either goes to blank screen after brief windows logo, or the spinning dots.&nbsp; Any input would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I performed all commands except the last which includes the windows directory.&nbsp; I ended up doing a fresh install because I needed the machine running sooner than later.&nbsp; Still, your reply was quite timely considering the support volume of a company so
 large.&nbsp; I appreciate it.

            Hi, Milan,
<br />Seems your keyboard was made with German physical layout. 
<br />Ot vise virsa, you use English physical layout with German 
<br />You need just swap this keys yourself or ask a techician to do this.

<h2>            MS 5000 Wireless Mouse wakes computer</h2>
                    I have two Windows systems, 1 uses Win 7 and the other uses Win 8.1. In both systems the Wireless Mouse 5000 wakes the computer from sleep even though the Power Management setting through the device manager is set to NOT ALLOW the mouse to wake the system
 (box to allow is NOT checked). All other mice I try, wireless and wired, respond correctly to Power Management setting.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else encountered and solved this behavior?<br />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Try to add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />3. Try uninstall and reinstalling your Bluetooth drivers, look for any update and try to install the drivers from the manufacture Web Site.
<br />
<br />Also, I attach some link with more procedures in case the steps above didn't work:
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it works,
<br />
<br />Best Regards,

            Hi, I‚Äôm Virginia an independent advisor.
<br />It may be the Bluetooth element requires a driver update or has failed.
<br />First to try is update the driver - visit Intel &amp; download their updater software:
<br /><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support...</a>
<br />You may try uninstalling the current driver first if that‚Äôs possible.

            Hi Cheryl,
<div><br />
<div>Since you enabled all programs in Family Safety, please try to run the program
<b>without </b>using the administrator level. This should run the program using the current account and would prevent asking for administrator password. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>1. Right click on the shortcut or menu item.</p>
<p>2. Select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to the&nbsp;<strong>Compatibility</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p>
<p>4. Click the&nbsp;<strong>Change settings for all users</strong>.</p>
<p>5. <b>Uncheck</b> the&nbsp;<strong>Run this program as an administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Do this again for the program itself.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please let us know if this would work.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>I have a dell inspiron touch screen laptop. How to stop the touch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tauseef95  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have a dell inspiron touch screen laptop. How to stop the touch keyboard from popping up whenever i touch a text box, without disabling the service&#63;</h2>
                    i don't want to permanently disable the service as i may sometimes use the touch-keyboard. (in case of darkness,etc..)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>until yesterday the touch-keyboard would pop up only if i touched the touch-keyboard toolbar in the task bar. now it pops up whenever i touch on search boxes, comment boxes, address boxes or any text box. (especially google chrome)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>how to make it pop up only when i need it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks in advance.</div>
                </div>

<p>I am trying to install some third party software that comes from a developer that I trust. When I try to install I get the following Windows Security Warning:&nbsp; "Windows found that this file is potentially harmful." It says that Windows is helping to keep
 my computer safe, but it does not tell me how to bypass this message and install the software anyway. Can anyone help with a solution?</p>

</p><p>I recently bought an Alienware 15' laptop in December and have been having problems with the left touchpad button since I bought the computer. I have not really tried experimenting with the right button and selecting something through a tap on the touchpad
 works accurately. I've had the following problems with the left button since I purchased the laptop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Clicking does not always work on the first try. Sometimes I have to click on something several times for it to select whatever I am trying to click on.</p>
<p>2) Trying to highlight anything is extremely frustrating. For example, when I am trying to highlight a sentence on Microsoft Office, I will click and highlight a section then release the left mouse button, and it will continue to highlight. I then have to
 click the left mouse button again, which usually leads to my highlighted section being unhighlighted. I have to do this several times for the highlighting to work, which is extremely frustrating. A similar happens with trying to scroll with the scroll bar
 on any website- when I try to stop scrolling by releasing the left mouse button, it will continue to scroll as if I still have the left mouse button pushed down.</p>
<p>3) Sometimes the click will act as a double-click. It will randomly do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. I have tried to reset the touch settings and mess around with the settings with no luck. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Have you first saved your movie (not your project)?&nbsp; The reason I ask, is it sounds like you are trying to stream from Windows Live Movie Maker.&nbsp; WLMM is an *editor* not a media player.&nbsp; What you want to do is to save your movie by using the
<strong>File </strong>menu (<strong>Alt+F</strong>) then chosing <strong>Save Movie...</strong>&nbsp; Have it save a completed copy of your movie onto your PC.</p>
<p>*Now* try playing that file via Windows Media Player and see if you have the same problems or not.</p>

</p>
<p>1.Go to the following Microsoft Safety Scanner: </p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
