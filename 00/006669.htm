            I was having this same problem. After trashing the preferences, autocomplete did work, but once I changed the preference so that double-clicking did not allow me to edit directly in cell, autocomplete stopped working again. When I switched the preference
 back to edit directly in cell, then autocomplete worked. So it seems there is a bug that connects these two prefs, which should not be connected.

<h3> radmanuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            I had to restore my laptop to factory settings and have now lost Office 2007, is there anyway that Microsoft can send me a link to reinstall the full version&#63;</h2>
                    about 2 years ago I purchased Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student and when I got a replacement laptop they sent me a link so I could reinstall the software onto the laptop, I have recently had a computer virus and as a result I have had to restore my
 laptop back to factory settings and am wanting to know if Microsoft can find my details and send me a link so I can reinstall the item. I have sent a message but all I get back is messages from Microsoft Online store saying that if I purchased it from the
 online store then they could help, and to e-mail technical support which I have done only to get another message back saying that they will only deal with purchases made through the online support and to e-mail technical! Im lost without it and cant afford
 to replace it!!!

            <p>Then you should have made a claim on your insurance (as I presume you had other stuff stolen at the same time) and replaced the disk and key....</p>
<p>And secondly you should have asked about this BEFORE returning your computer to factory settings, as there are methods of obtaining a Product key from an installed version of Office...</p>
<p>There is one other avenue, but that will depend on whether you can furnish proof of purchase....</p>

            WOW, talk about being judgemental. Yes I had other stuff stolen, in fact seeings as you asked I was asleep in the house when 4 people broke into the house kicked ten tonnes of **** out of me I was in hospital for 5 weeks, Im fine by the way thanks for your concern! When I was eventually released from hospital I then had to return to the home where I nearly died to then go through my belongings, what was left and contact my insurance company to make a claim. I apologise if amongst my claim I hadnt noticed that my Office 2007 disc was missing and I apologised for NOT contacting someone before I restored my laptop back to factory setting it wasnt until I had done so that it had dawned on me that I would loose Office 2007, but I suppose that as your a Community Star you are PERFECT in everyway and have NEVER made a mistake. But hey, thanks for all of your help and thanks most of all for reminding me of the terrible incident where I was attacked and nearly killed in my own home, guess I will just have

            <p>Well I'm really sorry to hear that. Obviously I had no knowledge of your situation.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't have any real bearing on your current situation.</p>
<p>I suggest, as you use H&amp;S and obviously don't need or use Outlook that you go for one of the two very excellent FREE Office suites such as
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Libre Office</a> or <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Office</a>, both of which will do everything that H&amp;S does and much more,&nbsp;neither of which require purchasing or activation nor a product key. (My preference is for Libre Office as the future of Open Office is uncertain). Using one of these will mean that
 you won't have this problem ever again...</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Access 2003 doesn't know anything about later versions.&nbsp; So, the internal functionality is looking for Office programs of 2003 and EARLIER.&nbsp; So, if you want to export something out, you should still be able to do so but it will take building that functionality
 with VBA using the Late Binding method.&nbsp; See this for more about that:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245115</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, hopefully you don't have the 64 bit version of Office as I don't think the 32 bit version can even use the 64 bit Office in late binding.&nbsp;

    <title>Watermark on Windows 10 Tech Preview - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Watermark on Windows 10 Tech Preview</h2>
                    The workstation I have running Windows 10 is an older net-book. I bet you think I'm going to ask a question about speed, incompatibility, or screen resolution. This may very well be the first question about a notebook computer that has nothing to do with
 those. In fact, my question is simple. I have Windows 10 Tech Preview and the screen it is running on is very small. The watermark is very obnoxious and I am wondering if it can be removed? It is activated.

<h2>            Office 2016 for Mac - Powerpoint - no sound options for transitions</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sound file seems to be empty of any sound options. &nbsp;When I am on the transitions ribbon and want to insert a sound for example, a small chime when the slide moves to the next slide, there are no sound options. &nbsp;I have a screenshot here, any ideas as to
 how I access the sound files that should be there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Sorry, I just opened the new 15.21.0 version of PowerPoint 2016 and they still don't have sound alerts. &nbsp;Don't know if they don't realize it. But how are you supposed to create a Presentation without sound effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you'll have to do is if you want sound you'll have to use&nbsp;either PowerPoint 2011 or Apple's Keynote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its's not a Bug it's an oversight.&nbsp;So go to the PowerPoint Suggestion Box website instead. &nbsp;And explain to them You can't&nbsp;have a decent presentation without transition sound effects.</p>

            <p>The option is for you to choose a sound from your own sounds. The drop down is not supposed to have a list of sounds from which to choose. To get at the built-in sounds you can navigate to the location shown below. You have to right-click on the PowerPoint
 app file and choose Show Package Contents to get into these folders.</p>

            <p>Sorry, Jimmy, but I have to disagree for at least 2 reasons :-)</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Since their inception, Sounds have been presented in the Transitions list in all prior versions. Here's what you get in PPT 2011 &amp; prior&nbsp;
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d22e683d-3215-49da-833a-26cf92abfd4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d22e683d-3215-49da-833a-26cf92abfd4f" /></a>IMO MS simply failed to hook it up, &amp;</li><li>Even if they're "not supposed" to be there, what you're suggesting simply cannot be done from within the program when you open the
<strong>Sound:</strong> dropdown.</li></ol>
<p>It's fine to have the option to choose from other sounds, but the ones that <em>
ship with the program</em> should be available for use <em>in the program</em>. Besides, who would even think to dig into package contents to get at program features that should be provided by the UI?</p>

            <p>My default assumption with Office 2016 is that if a feature is broken or missing it is intentional. In this case, I presume that the missing list of shortcuts to the sound files is because they got broken along the way and Microsoft either hasn't gotten
 around to or can't be bothered with fixing them. Maybe Microsoft is waiting for more votes at the wishing for features site here:</p>
<p><a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288925-powerpoint-for-mac/suggestions/13335672-please-add-sound-alerts-to-powerpoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Please add sound alerts to PowerPoint</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I say "supposed to be there" I assume their absence is intentional on Microsoft's part. I didn't mean to imply that they don't belong there from a consumer/user perspective. Certainly to be consistent with all other versions of PowerPoint they belong
 there. It's like VBA in 2008 - just gone.</p>

<h2>            Macro to Determine Based on Active Sheet Name</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to do this?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Workbook Sheets “RegularHours” &amp; “Overtime” are formatted the same:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C3:F3 are sheet names (all in the same workbook) and I intend to add more to this list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need the code to determine based on the name of the active sheet, which column in row 5 to put the value of ActiveSheet.Range(“N31”) and ActiveSheet.Range(“P31”). The value of N31 goes in sheet “Overtime” (row 5) and the value of P31 goes in sheet “RegularHours”
 (row 5)<br />
</p>

<p>I hope I explained this well enough.<br />

            If I am interpreting this correctly, there are worksheets named <i>GrantB, SothiaC, NathonD</i> and

<i>Overtime</i>&nbsp;to put the values from N31 and P31.

<h2>            Win phone 7 Outlook 2010 Sync with stand alone PC</h2>
                    
<p>Hi after waiting 10 months for release and eager anticipation &nbsp;My HTC 7 arrived.&nbsp;Goodbye Iphone :) back to Microsoft&nbsp;. Started set up all went well very impressed set up pop3 email only then did alarm bells ring. Opened Zune to sync contacts calendar notes
 FROM PC NO OUTLOOK sync !!!!!!!!</p>
<p>After reading forums of the more than complicated time consuming method of&nbsp;syncing and then sorting hundreds of contacts&nbsp;I despaired.</p>
<p>The last thing I thought of before ordering was that a state of the art&nbsp;Microsoft based Windows Phone 7 would&nbsp;not sync with my desktop Outlook 2010&nbsp;via a usb cable and Zune. Please tell me I was not alone.</p>
<p>I do not trust the cloud that much at present given the past history of&nbsp;hacking accounts.</p>
<p>Unfortunatley I cannot wait for Microsoft to reconsider&nbsp;/ relent (wishfull thinking)and allow&nbsp;Desktop users to sync via Zune.</p>
<p>THE PHONE has now gone back and I&nbsp;have one that syncs as it should&nbsp;an&nbsp;APPLE&nbsp;&nbsp;IPHONE4</p>

    <title>How to Add Other Calender from Directory on New Outlook Web - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> treyoshi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Add Other Calender from Directory on New Outlook Web</h2>
                    <p>On the previous OWA interface, it was very easy to add a co-workers calender to my list of other calendars by using the add from directory option (see screenshot).&nbsp; Recently I was prompted to use the "new" outlook, and after switching I cannot find this
 feature.&nbsp; Does anyone know where I can find it?&nbsp; Thankfully for now I can revert to the old design, but assume eventually I will not be able to do that.</p>

<p>Hi Jeffrey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing back and letting us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your screenshot, when I check at my end, initially I can’t see the More Options. But when I move my mouse cursor on to the name of bucket, the More Options feature can be seen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you still can’t see the More Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ed2c295f-1832-482a-9100-fc44850b02ad" title="Frances Maxine MarieCapili">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to let you know why the&nbsp;screenshot you provided&nbsp;is not showing on your post, I removed it for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And regarding your query, changing Skype Names have never been possible. And we no longer have an option to create an account using our preferred Skype Name.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve the sign-up experience, Microsoft now offers a new simplified method for creating an account. You will no longer have an option to create your Skype name because the new simplified account sign-up method only requires an email or
 a phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to find your account's&nbsp;Skype Name, let me help you get it by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in to the Skype website</a></strong>.</li><li>Scroll down and look for <strong>Purchase history</strong>.</li><li>The Skype Name of your account will show up at the upper right side of the Purchase history page, before the "Sign Out" button.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you created an account using a phone number or an email, your Skype Name will start with "live:".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope the information above helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Good day,&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1F97D973-A76C-4E20-93B8-4BF5821BA72C">ab2014</a></span></strong><span>.
 After installing the Lumia Cyan SW in your phone, have you verified if the system apps have been updated as well? To do this, just go to the phone
<strong>settings &gt; swipe to applications &gt; store &gt; check for updates</strong>. BTW, are you referring to the
<strong>reset your phone</strong> option under <strong>Settings &gt; about</strong> when you say 'hard reset'?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This link will provide you additional tips on managing the phone's battery life:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.nokia.com/nz-en/support/product/lumia520/userguidance/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=GUID-DB7FD3C1-122C-43CE-8AFD-8034FC707A61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know if these steps helped improve your phone's performance. BTW, welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!</span></p>

            After doing all these steps also battery draining continues. After 25min net use battery came down from 76% to 61% that also under battery saver mode. Nothing left for update. And hard reset mean not about reset your phone option under Settings &gt; about
 , it's the option where you have to press power button and volume up down button combination.

 to try the reset under Settings &gt; about. Make a backup&nbsp;first to avoid data loss. Just enable all options under
<strong>Settings &gt; backup</strong>. After doing this step, monitor if the phone's battery performance will improve.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If this doesn't help, try recovering the phone's SW using the Nokia Software Recovery Tool.

<p>I have update my Lumia 920 to cyan around 2 months ago, and since then my battery was draining in less than a day mostly iddle. Before the update I could go 2 days and have still 20% left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have researched the problem, and found that a lot of people are facing the same issue. Shame on Microsoft/Nokia not to acknowledge the problem. I have tried every option suggested on the various discussion board without any success. The only thing I didn't
 tried was a hard reset for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I went on vacation, and used an international sim card, and suddenly my battery life was even better than before the update. I could go more than a day using my phone intensively (GPS, Pictures,...), and still have at least 30%-40% at the end of
 the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I came back home, I return the original sim card, and change the following things in 'cellular + SIM':</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I set &nbsp;data connection off by default, and will turn it on only when needed (most of the time at home or at work I will use wi-fi anyway).</p>
<p>2. In Network selection I select my provider instead of choosing automatic, and select 3G. I will change it to 4g when I turn the data connection on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been 15 hours since the last charge, and my phone is still at 90%. It seems to work for me (it might not work for every body). In any case it's only a work around until Microsoft acknowledges and fixes the problem.</p>

            First of all I tried everything from hard reset to soft reset and use it in various ways. I have to do soft or factory reset 3 times. After first reset I was unable to add Microsoft account, there was some error code and saying try again every time. So
 I reset it again. This time two function was not working properly. First one is when I tried to make a call screen goes off. I can't even disconnect the call. I have to press the power button 3 4 times to see the screen again. And second one is double tap
 to open lock screen feature was not working. So I reset the phone again.<br />
<br />
Now when it comes to the battery issue, still no luck. The only way I can save battery life is by not using cellular data and not using the phone at all. As I don't have Wi-Fi connection so I have to use cellular data all the time.The only option I have not
 tried yet is reset phone by Nokia software recovery tools.<br />
<br />
Before my phone was ok.I enjoyed using it. But now it become frustrating. Windows 8.1 cyan update make my life hell.<br />
<br />
The feature which I liked most in windows 8 was the facebook chat option under messaging hub.Microsoft removed this beautiful feature in windows 8.1 and now we have to install an chat app extra which consume a lot of battery.<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Home - Access in MAC</h2>
                    Although I see responses of 2011 that Access was available for windows. Is there possibility to get Access for MAC?

<br />
<br />I am sorry, because the Mac operating system does not have the required underlying structure, Access is not available for use on a Mac

<p>How ever is impossible install MS Access on Mac but if anyone needs then let install "Virtual Box - free software delivered by Oracle" and on virtual disc install legal Windows, next Office and let be happy with Access.</p>
<p>Is not the same but still works My main computer is Mac and it works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Danie</strong>,<br />
<br />
We have noticed that the post has been inactive for quite some time. We'd like to confirm if you are still having issues with Outlook. If so, can you send us a screenshot of the options that you are getting? Also, we'd like to verify what are the steps you
 have already taken so far to fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime, I'd suggest launching Outlook in&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>safe</strong></span>&nbsp;<span><strong>mode</strong></span></a></span><span>.
 This will help in disabling add-ins that may possibly contribute to the issue. If the issue still persists even in safe mode, you may try repairing your Office application by following the instructions on this&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>article</strong></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi anthonymartinez,</p>
<p>
to understand the situation better, i would like to conform some information as below:<br />
1.&nbsp;which office 365 plan are you using, small business plans/business premium plan or enterprise plans?<br />
2.&nbsp;can you check the sites sharing status under&nbsp;<strong>sharing overview</strong>?</p>
<p>
actually, to enable external sharing on&nbsp;onedrive for business library, we just need to turn on the option under sharepoint admin center &gt;&nbsp;external sharing &gt; sharing overview<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=269f8794-7c9f-4325-9db3-acf708b11baa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d269f8794-7c9f-4325-9db3-acf708b11baa" /></a><br />
<br />
then we can share files located in onedrive for business with external users as following:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f6ab1fc2-ae64-4382-b16f-1df683bd03cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df6ab1fc2-ae64-4382-b16f-1df683bd03cd" /></a></p>
<p>
as for the error message under the external sharing&gt;&nbsp;<strong>sites</strong>, i would like to explain that i have run the same situation within my small business premium plan. it's an expected behavior in office 365 small business plans. here is an article about
 these plans:&nbsp;<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/moving-to-the-new-office-365-plans-for-small-and-midsized-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/business/moving-to-the-new-office-365-plans-for-small-and-midsized-businesses</a>.
 &nbsp;<br />
also this thread mentioned the same situation just for your reference:https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/402565</p>

<p>Hi AnthonyMartinez,</p>
<p>I suppose that the "Photography" in the screenshot is a folder. if so, it's an expected behavior since guest link only applies to individual files rather than folders.</p>
<p>That's the reason why it shows the restricted link (internal folder path) in "Get a link" section even though the external sharing is enabled.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Send an email from Outlook to One Note as a subpage in Office 2010</h2>
                    I have created tabs and pages in One Note, but I have some emails I want to send to One Note as subpages. Right now, the only way I can figure out to do this is to create a blank subpage first in One Note and then send the email to that blank page and
 rename it in One Note. Is there some way to send directly to One Note as a sub page under one of my current One Note tabs?

<h2>            Disable Site Content for student users</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've been working on creating a Sharepoint for students to download homework assignments and upload completed homework. I've created a subsite within the class site using the Document Centre template, as i'm trying to limit the students from seeing each
 others homework. However because the pupils can see the 'Site Content' on the Document Centre subsite they can gain access to the uploaded documents.</p>
<p>If I could disable site contents for the student users they would only be able to upload their homework, and not download another students work to copy. Does anyone know how to disable the 'Site Content' link in the quick finder (top left) for a group of
 users?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Ryan</p>

<p>Hiding the links from the top left quick launch and settings options is one thing and not giving them access to the "Site contents" Page is another. There are methods to hide the option. but if the students are smart enough to have already saved the link,
 they can access it anyways. :-)</p>
<p>you may want to use the onenote class notebook for your purpose. take a look at it here.

<p>hi ryan, if i understand you right you would like your students to upload and only see their own homework right?</p>
<p>as you are already using sharepoint you can create a very very easy workflow in sp designer (literally 2 lines). the workflow you need to build is called impersonation workflow. you can set it up as such so your students only see their stuff but you are
 able to see everything.</p>
<p>below is a screenshot of on mini step i m using for a library in our environment:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e1c6fb00-5b21-4bac-a48c-08843b56183f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de1c6fb00-5b21-4bac-a48c-08843b56183f" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope you find this useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>all the best</p>

<p>hi ryan, you will need to open sp designer navigate to the site in spd and then create a new workflow. select a sharepoint2010 workflow and you are almost there.</p>
<p>have a look at the screenshots below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>start your new workflow by selecting the 2010 platform type.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a2c4d8f2-207b-4f13-86a7-bd1c36665f39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da2c4d8f2-207b-4f13-86a7-bd1c36665f39" /></a></p>
<p>in the new window click on step 1 and then the impersonation step will become available. otherwise it is greyed out.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1ffbf15e-701d-486b-a15d-0a12e2cb1e6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d1ffbf15e-701d-486b-a15d-0a12e2cb1e6f" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>set up the permissions as you would like them to be to fit in with your exercise and hey presto!</p>
