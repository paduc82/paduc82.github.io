<h2>            Can&#39;t open a .xlsm on a new installed version of Excel.</h2>
                    I have an Excel .xlsm file that I can't open on a new computer with 2010 installed. It opens correctly on other computers with Win7 and Excel 2007 &amp; 2010 installed.
<div>I have checked all the options under Trusted Sites and other options under FILE. &nbsp; They seem to be the same as the other computers. It opens and indicates "Protected View" - Open to Enable Editing. You click it and it downloads another copy on the file
 with an option to Enable Content. you click that and ribbon disappears and all you have is a blank worksheet but with the correct names of the sheets shown. Everything on the task ribbon is blanked out. The correct file name at thetop &nbsp;is correct. Excel is
 frozen. You have to go to the Task Manager to End Task. If you allow Windows to restart the file it opens it as file name (Version1).xlsb.</div>
<div>The auto open macro stops at '</div>
<div>"Windows("FileName,xlsm").Activate as the file extension is wrong.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<br />
If you have tried it with all those sim cards that would kinda point to a problem with the phone itself

<h2>            I think I have two separate accounts&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today, I downloaded Skype on my iPhone. I already had an account on my Mac, but when I put it on my phone I requested a password change because nothing was working. I'm worried I made a new account, even though it might be good if my Skype on Mac
 is linked to this old email I don't use now. Messages I sent from my phone aren't linking up with my laptop, and I can't find out how to see what email is connected on my Mac. I could just sign out, but I don't see how to do that either.</p>
<p>Any help? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Searching an auto filled field in access</h2>
                    <p>I am very new to access...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I m an event planner an I am trying to create an event management system.... I have a two tables a client database and an event database which has fields for every part of the event i am planning, e.g. Event Date, Event Name, Client First Name, Client Last
 Name etc etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the event entry form (which is based on the Events Database) I have created a look up field which then auto fills in the last name, phone details, address of the client onto the event form, I'm not sure that this is the correct way to do it, but for the
 moment it seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also created a query (based on the Events Database) and from this i have created a split form which shows all of the events with a summarized version of the events at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also created a search box in the header which searches various fields... it works fine for the event name and event date but because the first name and last name are auto filled I can't get the search box to search those fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have watched ours of online tutorials and read everything I can find about it, but I still cant find a solution... can anyone help?</p>

<strong>Client First Name, Client Last Name</strong> etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stopped reading after this sentence. You meant "event table", just to be clear on nomenclature, but the real issue is in the client names. That's a big no-no. The only client-related field in the event table is ClientID. If you ever want to look up the
 firstname/lastname, you can run a query that joins the two tables. That's the relational way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you create ANY form or ANY report, you have to get the db design right, or your project will fail. This forum and others can help if you ask specific questions and provide the background information. Posting a relationship diagram is very helpful
 to focus the discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to discourage you, but taking this on as a rookie is a heavy lift. Are you sure you don't want to buy something off the shelf? Have you looked at the Event-related templates in the Office template gallery?</p>

            <p>Yes sorry... I meant event table...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The First Name, Last Name fields on the event form are autofilled by a look up field but that data is not actually stored in the Event table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that I may not have set it up correctly... but I have searched the internet to try and understand how to get the client name onto the event form and every video and article I read seems to want to insert a subform into the event form and that isn't
 what i want. I wonder if you would be able to point me in the right direction for one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But back to my question, is it actually possible to have a search field to search auto filled fields from a form or am i asking too much of Access....? or should I go back to the drawing board?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the template gallery and nothing seems to fit what I want, the ones available are all a bit too simple for what i need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/advice would be treasured...</p>

            <p>Lookup fields on the table level are&nbsp;NOT recommended. Lookups should be done on the Form level using List controls. Please see my blog on Displaying Data from Related Tables for ways to display the client info on your Events form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a split form, then use the datasheet view to do your searches. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm also concerned about this; "which has fields for every part of the event i am planning". That is probably not good design. What you probably want is 2 tables. Your Event table with info about the event itself&nbsp;like&nbsp;date client, location and an event
 details child table that lists all the items for the event. We would need to know more about what info you capture about each&nbsp;event to advise further.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The way I would typically do this is as follows:</p>
<p>* First get the db design correct, so the Events table has a ClientID field.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Create a query on the Client table, perhaps:</p>
<p>select ClientID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName as FullName from tblClients</p>
<p>I'll name this query qrycboClients</p>
<p>* Design the Events form, put a combobox on it (I'll name it cboClientID), and set the ControlSource to ClientID and the RowSource to qrycboClients. Set the columncount to 2, and the ColumnWidths to 0;1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using such combobox is very common in Access. It satisfies computers that like to work with numbers, and humans who like to work with text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there was an extra field about clients that I wanted to display on the Event form, let's say the City where they live, I would:</p>
<p>* Change qrycboClients to include the City field.</p>
<p>* Update the combobox properties to columncount=3, columnwidths=0;1;0</p>
<p>* Add a textbox, and set ControlSource to:</p>
<p>=cboClientID.Column(2)</p>
<p>This will display the value in the 3rd column (index = 2)</p>

            You'll find an example of pretty much exactly what Tom described in FindRecord.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the option to <em>'Open form to filter by a foreign key'
</em>opens a form which includes an inbound combo box in its header, set up in this way.&nbsp; The code for the combo box's AfterUpdate event, which filters the form to the selected contact, is:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cboFindContact_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Nz(.Value, 0) = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Filter = "ContactID = " &amp; .Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />

<h2>            Strategy to migrate dynamic distribution groups.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>One of our client has on-premises Exchange 2010 server. The company has split and now out of total 400+ mailboxes &nbsp;150 will be migrated to a new domain and the rest will be migrated to same domain but in different O365 tenant</p>
<p>For Example : Out 400+ mailboxes which now belongs to abc.com, 150 will migrated to xyz.com under one O365 tenant and remaining willl be migrated to abc.com in different O365 tenant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are using Dell on Demand tool to migrate 150 mailboxes to xyz.</p>
<p>We will be creating a new active directory forest for abc.com and will perform the directory sync in order to sync the password.</p>
<p>Now we discover there are 200+ dynamic distribution groups exists at on-premises Exchange server and client want us to migrate them to Office 365 under abc.com tenant. What will be the best method to migrate it ? Since there will be no Exchange server in
 the new forest abc.com I guess we can not create dynamic distribution groups there and sync them to O365.</p>
<p>Any suggestions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi vSolutionsITSupport,<br />
<br />
Dynamic distribution groups cannot be included in Directory Sync, therefore, we don’t have any official-supported tool to help you migrate them to your Office 365 tenant. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
If you have an Exchange on-premises server, you can set up an Exchange hybrid deployment to enable your cloud users to send emails to these on-premises dynamic distribution groups. Since there’s no Exchange server either, you may need to manually create these
 dynamic distribution groups in your new Office 365 tenant.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen<br />

<h2>            Spreadsheet web app</h2>
                    I would like to have an excel spreadsheet which is accessible via a webpage and allows different users to log on and fill out separate versions of the spreadsheet. I would then like the user to save that information which will then be stored on a server.
 The users will submit this spreadsheet periodically. which will be stored on the server.Whats the best way to go about this?

</span>This can enable you to develop capabilities to: offer a variety of user access scenarios (anonymous to secure login), allow users to save/load data, submit/share assessments, create reports, monitor usage, etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You might also consider the newer/better JavaScript API for Office (Add-Ins)
<a href="https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span>There's also graph.microsoft.com (REST API), but its Excel API is still in beta (also has access and other limitations).</p>

<h3> seoulgal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 persistently asks for password and cannot send or receive emails</h2>
                    <p>I have just spent 2 hours reading anything and everything I can find on this issue. &nbsp;To say I am angry and frustrated would be an understatement. I truly hope somebody out there can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7 and Office 2013. Outlook 2013 has worked fine since installation about 3 months ago (I upgraded from 2007). I have a BT Yahoo account (UK). &nbsp;I am based in Germany. When I opened Outlook today it started prompting me for my username and
 password when trying to send and receive emails. They are saved, always have been, and so I click OK. It prompts again. I click Cancel. It prompts again. I closed and reopened Outlook. Same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can log in directly to my email account using Internet Explorer. I know my password is correct! I can also send and receive from my iPad! Why on earth has this suddenly started happening? I have emails sitting in my Outbox that just won't send. I have
 read all these suggestions for so-called fixes but anything simple where I just check settings on my computer doesn't work. A couple of fixes out there were so complicated I just couldn't understand them. Suggestions such as 'delete your profile' are also
 useless because they don't say how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, please can someone help? I have so much work to do and simply cannot work from my ipad. I have all my emails stored and sorted on my PC and need to be able to work from within Outlook as I always have done. It's such a random problem that I have
 also experienced in the past but it was always resolved at some point. This time, nothing I do is helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to, in Outlook 2007, be able to go in and delete my email account (I have two BT Yahoo accounts) and just re-create them. Now I get a warning about cached emails and losing information. I have no idea what it means and don't want to delete anything
 so I cancelled it. &nbsp;I am now so stuck. I also tried looking in Credential Manager but there's nothing Office related there at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

 connecting to your account. Verify the settings below and make changes if necessary."</p>

</p><p>I have no changes to make! &nbsp;It's all correct. &nbsp;Now I also have an additional problem in that 2 emails are stuck in my outbox. I went offline, closed and reopened Outlook, and tried to delete them. They don't budge. I can't move or delete them. If I try to
 open them it says Outlook has already started to transmit them. I am working offline!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that my Outlook is just corrupt? If I reinstall will I lose any emails? I have thousands!! I would do a backup but since upgrading I am unsure where they are stored on my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not added or changed anything, not anti-virus, nothing! I literally left the computer for a week as I was busy and then this started. I also don't allow updates to install automatically without my input. Nothing should have changed since it last worked
 perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi there, after 3 frustrating hours it appears to be solved. I have no fix to pass on though I'm afraid. I logged in (again) directly to my email account and because this had been going on for so long was told that there had been unusual activity on my account.
 Hardly surprising considering this problem. I reset the password and then got stuck in a loop. Irrelevant to this post, I managed to find a fix. After that I reopened Outlook and lo and behold it's working!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have absolutely no idea why it happened and it wasted several hours of my life and raised my blood pressure. But I really appreciate you trying to help, so thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no doubt it will happen again someday and then I'll be back on this forum. If there were an alternative to Outlook I'd use it. I've had more problems with this software than with any other, EVER!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again :)</p>

    <title>Email to Group, also into Teams Channel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Email to Group, also into Teams Channel</h2>
                    <p>In October I posted this thread:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_teams-mso_o365b/teams-email-to-group-also-send-to-channel/bd94216b-a18a-4cd8-bb0c-3f347b5e260b</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, we have a 'staff' group in o365 and where someone sends an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' we want it distributed to staff - and delivered to the 'Staff &gt; General' teams channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, I created a contact with the Teams email address, and added it to the group. But we have recently started getting duplicate notices into Teams when emails are sent this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I've check to ensure the user isnt somehow in the group twice</p>

<p>Hi 8DWDW8,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information, based on that, may I confirm with you the received notifications are as follow pictures showing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19e6d34e-dd08-4729-9521-9727977ef40f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19e6d34e-dd08-4729-9521-9727977ef40f?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>If so, since I created a new Office 365 group, added one teams channel email address to that group, the members in the teams channel are also this group’s members, then when I sent emails to that groups, I
 would get two notifications, one was from Outlook client, one was from &nbsp;Teams client. Please check if you are the same situation as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have different scenario, could you please provide the two notification screenshots to me so that I can better look into this issue? Meanwhile, whether the group you mentioned is Office 365 group, or
 other groups like distribution group? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. The message is delivered once via email into Outlook, as expected.&nbsp; But it appears in the Teams Channel twice. In both instances into the teams channel, it appears as an email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send over emails as attachments separately if these help?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi 8DWDW8,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it appears in general channel twice, please navigate to Teams-&gt;Activity tab-&gt;Feed to see whether the notifications for this email messages also displayed as duplicated:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0a749b7-c2fe-43f9-9278-d3d375cb4956?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0a749b7-c2fe-43f9-9278-d3d375cb4956?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, double-click the two duplicated feed notifications to see if they both pointed to the same email messages, if the email messages in General channel conversations tab are also duplicated, please provide a screenshot of this symptom to me for analyzing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4735fde4-c0bf-4062-910d-e737b33044c7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4735fde4-c0bf-4062-910d-e737b33044c7?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, may I confirm with you the following information?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is the issue continuously occurs after adding the teams channel contact? Whether all of members in Teams have been affected?
</li><li>Have you configured any relevant notification settings prior this happening?</li><li>If you try to re-add the teams contact, could this issue exists?</li><li>Whether the said group refers to Office 365 group?

<p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the notification appears:</p>
<ul>
<li>twice in the activity feed</li><li>twice in the channel</li><li>once in the users inbox</li></ul>
<p><br />
Your questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the issue continuously occurs after adding the teams channel contact? Whether all of members in Teams have been affected?<br />
This affects all users sending to the list, yes</li><li>Have you configured any relevant notification settings prior this happening?<br />
No - other than the channel being favoirited</li><li>If you try to re-add the teams contact, could this issue exists?<br />
I have tried this late last week without success</li><li>Whether the said group refers to Office 365 group? And whether this group is also the group that the channel belongs to?<br />
Yes and yes</li><li>As my understanding, you have a group, and want the emails send to this group also send a copy to another Teams group channel?<br />
The behavior I want is outlined below:</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Desired behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>Group to existing on Teams (exists today - Staff Lobby is the group)</li><li>Email address to exist in exchange (exists today - staff@ is the email)</li><li>A user can post in Staff Lobby &gt; General and group members can see it (exists today as standard teams functionality)</li><li>A user can email the Staff Lobby group from exchange (existing functionality)</li><li>Any email that goes to staff group is shared into the Staff Lobby &gt; General channel (<strong>not standard functionality</strong>)</li></ul>

<p>Hi 8DWDW8,</p>

<p>As we couldn’t find any setting and configuration could trigger the double delivered to Teams channel, and there’s isn’t any official article describing this symptom, I suggest you may use directly send the
 emails to that channel instead of add it to Office 365 groups.</p>

            Hi,<br />
I bought nokia 6131 yet. Before i buy, i read features of phone on the websites. Standart standby time appears 240 hours. So nokia company claims that its standby time will be nearly 10 days. But my phone holds only 1 day in its first week. i think it will
 lengthen to 2 days after next charges. Although it has nice specifications, this is a disappointment. I think company must be more realistic, it will hold 10 days it you don't use it! It is a critical that i want to say. I saw this comment when i was looking
 for a solution to this problem.So it seems there is no solution with another battery. Thanks...

            Standby time estimates is with your phone turned on, probably no SIM in it, and not touched at all.<br />

I have a 6131 and with normal use (listen to music for a minimum of 2 hours a day, constant texting, a few calls) I get 4 to 5 days out of the battery.<br />
<br />
If you are only getting 1 day and are not calling people excessively or have the bluetooth switched on, then there may be something wrong with your phone.

            I tried my phone with minimum usage. I didn't talk to anyone long and i didn't play music so much. It finished within 24 hours. This is the 4th time i charged it. I'll wait for a few weeks. I hope duration will be lengthen. If it won't, i will send my
 phone to service. Thanks for suggestions.<br />

            Cant Nokia come up with a solution with the 6131 short life battery. The truth is that with normal usage it lasts one day. I dont think all who are concern with this topic have faulty phones. We have a battery life problem .Please try to advise an alternative
 battery in the market that can withstand the 6131 beauty.<br />

    <title>How can I make cells expand horizontally automatically as I type - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelwhy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I make cells expand horizontally automatically as I type &#40;as opposed to wrapping, which expands text vertically.&#41;</h2>
                    Is there a way to have cells automatically expand horizontally as I type? Basically, I want to be able to use the "wrap" function, but just make the cells expand horizontally rather than vertically. (I do know how to do this after I type, but I want a
 way to have it automatically done for me while I'm typing, if possible.)

            Hi SueEdwards48 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Skype number has to be purchased. It looks like you didn't purchase it. You should give them Skype ID, I think they asked for this not Skype number.
<br />
<br />To find Skype Name / Skype ID / Skype Address
<br />
<br />Click on your profile picture in top left corner &gt; In the resultant screen, click on Skype profile and you will have Skype Name which is also called Skype ID or Skype Address
<br />This may be in the form of live:abcdefgh
<br />OR
<br />Click on 3 dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; Account &amp; Profile &gt; On right side, you will have Skype Name
<br />OR
<br />Another way to get Skype Name / ID is to type following command in any chat and Enter. One of the fields is Skypename: in the output
<br />/dumpmsnp
<br />(The output will be displayed to you only. The contact whose window did you entered this in will neither see the command nor the output)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />Log into this page: <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile</a>
<br />
<br />There you will find your Skype ID, (begins with live: . . ) which you can provide to anyone wishing to contact you on Skype
<br />
<br />If you do indeed also have a Skype number, you will find that listed near the bottom of that page . . .

<br />
<br />
The Rotate option is currently not available for inserted file printouts in OneNote. As a workaround, you can change the print orientation of the PDF file before inserting it. Also, this feature has already been suggested to the developers in
<strong>OneNote UserVoice</strong>. You may want to vote for the feedback, and check on some suggestions

<p>Try soft reset the phone. This will refreshes the OS and will not occur data loss.
