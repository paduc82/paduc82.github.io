<h2>            Defragment and Optimize Disk won&#39;t open in Local Services</h2>
                    Defragment and Optimize Disks service is missing from list of Windows 10 services. It shows up on list of Administrative Tools in the Control Panel, but won't open even when using "Run as Administrator". I have run DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
 in the command prompt and it still does not fix the issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Defraggler, but still it does not show up on the local services list. I have run Dell Support Assist and no problems are found. All of this makes Norton Security
 unable to Optimize Disk. Norton says it is a problem with the defragment app on Windows and were no help at all.
<br />
I am running a Dell Inspiron 5379 with 1TB HHD, 8GB ram and the latest updates of Windows 10 installed.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When you backup files on a Windows 7 computer you may receive error 0x81000019 with an error message similar to the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"A shadow copy could not be created. Please check the 'VSS' and 'SPP' application event logs for more information. Details: Insufficient storage available to create
 either the shadow copy storage file or other shadow copy data."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error can happen because of having too many Windows language packs installed on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cause is that the Backup process involves the system writer that reports files in the important applications installed on the machine. In the case where a large number of language packs
 is installed, the metadata file reported by this writer becomes huge in size and does not fit the 100 MB volume. This causes backup to fail since there is not enough space for the shadow copy creation. This is not something that you can check on to validate
 since this metadata file is created during backup and deleted at the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve the issue, uninstall all of the unused language packs that are currently installed on your computer. You can do this by clicking Start, and then typing
<i>Lpksetup.exe</i> in the Search box and then clicking Lpksetup.exe in the list of programs. Once the Language Pack installer starts, click Uninstall display languages. Uninstall the languages that you do not use, and then restart your computer and
 restart the backup.</p>

<h2>            credit card compromised</h2>
                    
<p>I recently received my credit card and there was a charge of 19.99 on it for the 26th April 2014. &nbsp;My son has an account with Microsoft and he did not charge this payment to my card, he keeps records of all things he buys and this does not appear on his
 records plus he did no receive any e-mails regarding the purchase from Microsoft. &nbsp;We got in touch on line with the team and it appears there is a second account under my sons account the name on it is
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> we do not know who this is but this is the gametag that charged my credit card. &nbsp;I want to know what can be done with regard to this gametag as I do not want my son to buy anything else from Microsoft we have had to cancel our
 cards and order new ones, this is a lot of trouble as you would be aware and also it appears we will not get this money back, it may be a small amount but its the principle that counts I feel aggrieved that I will have to pay for someone elses charge</p>

<p>Please respond soon thank you</p>

<h2>            Was I Scammed&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On Saturday I received an error on my computer where the computer would not allow me to do anything and the computer was making a loud sound and at the top of the box had Microsoft then it said that i needed to call to get the issues resolved. call&nbsp; 1844-240-9879
 . i called them they said that they where with Microsoft and that my Network had a big virus that was effecting the whole network. That my IP address was public and that in order for me to use my computer again it would be $199 for them to remove it. Then
 after it was removed they transferred me to Fix it Fast Solutions where they said that the only way to keep this from happening again was to have a firewall put in place around our net work, and that would be for 4 years for $600. I was not 100% sure, i went
 along with it and paid for it all. Is this a scam?? do i need to have a firewall around my network, did Microsoft truly shut down my computer and this was the only way to get it back running??</p>

            Yes I am sorry you were scammed, these tech support scams are all over the Internet . . .
<br />
<br />I am so sorry, but you have been had, they use scare tactics, like you have a virus, your IP address is open to the public . . . none of which is true, they are pure charlatans
<br />
<br />Did you give them remote access to your PC/Laptop, if so the only safe method to get them out of your system is:
<br />
<br />Backup your data
<br />Wipe your hard drive
<br />Clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />If you have the know-how, do this yourself, if not get a hand from someone else
<br />
<br />In the future, on these webpages, click on nothing, open Task Manager and shut down your browser from there . . 
<br />
<br />Once again, I am sorry you have been scammed, if you can, put a block on the payment you have made . . .

            Yes, you were scammed. In that you paid for a "service" that you don't really need.
<br />
<br />The problem is that while some of these places actually do provide legitimate support services, unfortunately some of them take your money and disappear after a short while.  Some also go farther to the "dark side" by installing malware on your computer and selling your banking information and other contact information to other hackers as part of a "sucker list" that identifies people who have already fallen for a scam.
<br />
<br />Firewalls. 
<br />Yes, it is a good idea to include firewalls on your home computer network.  If you have a "router" separate from the "modem" provided by your internet provider, there is a chance you have a hardware firewall there.  Windows 10 comes with a built in "software" firewall.  Just type "firewall" in the win10 start menu to get to it.  Or you can buy or use a free firewall program.
<br />
<br />Firewalls provide a different type of protection than "anti virus" or "anti spyware" or "anti malware" programs. Windows is designed with 64,000 "Ports" that it uses to communicate with the outside world.  A few are defined for specific uses, most of the others are just left 'open'.  A fire wall "closes" unused ports and creates rules on who (userid) and/or application and/or specific hardware and/or website can use open ports.   Some malware tries to use your computer by accessing it via unprotected open ports or by highjacking open ports to other non-standard uses. 
<br />
<br />Here is a more detailed description of firewalls

                    I am unable to change any settings after the Windows 10 update in April 2018. Specifically, I want to change back to my PIN to sign in with but it only allows me to use original password. Why did it revert back to original settings &amp; not let me change
 to my former preferences? Anything I click on in the settings does not do anything &amp; locks up the system. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<h2>            Manage wireless networks in Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello, I have been using Windows 10 since the first day it was available, and I like it a lot so far. The only problem I have is an option seems to have been "forgotten" or removed. It exists on Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
My question is: Is there a way to reach and change these settings without a 3rd party program? Because if that's the only way (seems like it so far) I must say, I'm very confused.<br />

            Well my only question is:<br />
<br />
Can I get the "Manage wireless networks" option on Windows 10?<br />
<br />
When a computer does NOT have internet connection, it is impossible to access these settings on Windows 10.<br />
<br />
When a computer does NOT have internet connection, it is possible to access these settings on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I want to access these settings on Windows 10 when I don't have an internet access.<br />

That is my only question<br />

 So how do we manage wireless network profiles in Windows 10?

<h2>            D-pad issues with NEW &#40;3.5mm&#41; Xbox One controller</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, earlier today I bought the new Xbox One controller, Covert Forces, with the included 3.5mm jack and revised bumpers. I noticed that the D-pad was unresponsive with some of the presses. I'll press down to navigate a menu and it won't go down until
 I press it another 2-5 times. I went to the settings to check for updates and there was none. I checked both wirelessly and wired, still nothing. I plugged in my old controller and it works fine. Help?</p>

<p>I've noticed that the d-pad will only work 100% of the time if you press it unnecessarily hard, but if you do regular taps, like on the normal Xbox One controller it won't registrar the taps.</p>

<h2>            Skype on Windows 10 - all calls are not working.</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Skype on my work computer to host a conference call. My work computer has Windows 10 and I am using the newest version of Skype. All calls are not working for me. When someone calls me, I do not receive the call.&nbsp; I am sitting at the computer
 awaiting the call, and all I receive is the 'missed call notification' pop up in our chat after the fact. Similarly, when I call people, they are not getting my call. They are also just getting the 'missed call notification' in our chat after the fact. All
 my settings are normal, and all parties have a good/solid internet connection. Please see attached image: this is my view when I try to call a Skype contact. The contact I am calling never receives my call, even though she is at her computer actively awaiting
 the call.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> nevada wolf pack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update downloaded Windows 10 in the 32 bit format, but I have a 64 bit processor. How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why did <strong>MS Update download the 32 bit version of Windows 10, when I have a 64 bit processor?</strong> When I went to the MS website, there
<strong>didn't seem to be an option to select a 64 bit version</strong> of Windows 10 update, just an unspecified Windows 10 upgrade that did not say whether you would get a 32 or 64 bit version. My current version is Windows 7 SP1, but for some reason the
 Windows 10 update downloaded the 32 bit version. I am not sure if this is related, but now
<strong>my CPU is running at 100% nearly all of the time</strong>, unless I <strong>
disable wuauserv</strong> under Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past when MS screwed-up an update or sent out something buggy, they have followed-up pretty quickly with a revision to the update that fixed the problem.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you using Windows 7 32 bit before upgrading to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a 32Bit version of Windows 7 installed, then you will get a free upgrade to the 32Bit version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Windows 10 64 bit installed in your system, you have to clean install windows 10 64bit after the Windows 10 32bit is activated. Please follow the below link to download and install Windows 10 ISO file to perform the clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or reinstall Windows 10 using a USB or DVD, you can use the media creation tool to create your own installation media with either a USB flash drive or a DVD. The tool provides file formats optimized for download speed and can be used to create
 ISO files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: Make sure you backup all the important data in your computer before performing upgrade or clean installation of Windows.</strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if they help in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Verify if these two services are running:</span></p>
<p><span>A. Volume Shadow Copy service
</span></p>
<p><span>B. Windows backup</span></p>
<p><span>Also ensure that their dependency services are running. You can check this information from services.msc. Follow the steps below to check
 the services.</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to start and type services.msc in the search field.</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the two services.
</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-Click on the service one at a time.
</span></p>
<p><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select properties.
</span></p>
<p><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Dependencies Tab.
</span></p>
<p><span>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the dependency services.
</span></p>
<p><span>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure they’re also running.
</span></p>
<p><span>h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start a service, right click on it and select start.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Try to</span><span> run [System File Checker] SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b><span>You may also</span><span> set your computer in Clean Boot state and check if the same issue occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>

    <title>Windows cannot find &#39;C&#58;&#92;Program Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgeconroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows cannot find &#39;C&#58;&#92;Program Files &#40;x86&#41;&#92;Microsoft Life Cam&#92;LifeCam.exe&#39;</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.&nbsp; Microsoft LifeCam worked fine before I removed the camera (unplugged USB connection). The camera remained disconnected through several automatic Windows updates.<br />
Now when I try to open the application I get the error message......... "Windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Life Cam\LifeCam.exe'".<br />
I have unistalled the program...re-installed the program...purchased a new Microsoft HD 3000 LifeCamera...same result. I copied the .exe file from a working XP Pro 32 bit computer's Program Files and pasted it into the LifeCam folder under Program Files (x86)...same
 results. I have downloaded and run the LifeCam3.60 file from Microsoft support...same results. I have tried all the above with and without ant-virus programs running...downloading through Firefox, through Explorer etc. And yes I have tried all my available
 system restore points.<br />
Does anyone know what else I might try?<br />

            Thank you Jessen P,<br />
&nbsp;For your prompt reply and suggestion.<br />
I have tried that and also ran sfc scannow and chkdsk /r.<br />
I wanted to reply because I remembered something that may be pertinent. During the time that the camera was disconnected I ran a "Fix Computer" app within the AVG Free anti-virus program. I skipped all the suggestions offered because they were performance adjustments
 I prefered to keep. There were no logs created, so I don't know if any changes were made. The system has been fine after that, although I have since unistallled AVG ( too many notifications).&nbsp; It wasn't until this problem with LifeCam that I remembered.
<br />
If I begin to install the OS again will the Windows 7 install disk offer a "Repair Installed System" option like XP did?<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            Many Files, Folders, and system files were set to "Read Only".<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Many "Common Files" could not be reset. This can happen as a result of a virus, but none of my anti-virus programs reported any infections.<br />
<br />
Re-installed OS. Problem eliminated.<br />

<h2>            Printing photos using File Explorer in Windows 10</h2>
                    With a photo document open in File Explorer in Windows 10 I was able to print by clicking on the ... to find the print drop down option and subsequently click on the print option which would give other options re size etc. Now I get the following message
 in red "We couldn't reach this printer. Make sure the printer is on and you are connected to the printer's network or try a different printer. Clearly I have chosen an option somewhere IU shouldn't have, How do I get back my original option?

</p><p>Yes, I have been doing some changes, mainly deleting programs that I had not used or wanted to use. Of the programs that I deleted the only program I vaguely remember was an HP program controlling music as I prefer to use Windows Media Player when ripping
 music CD's from my own collection, &nbsp;which I have been doing on and off for the last couple of weeks. All programs would have deleted using the tools provided on the system. I only noticed the problem after&nbsp;a Windows 10 update which occurred on 16th May but
 it may have occurred some between then and early March which is when I remember last printing using Windows Explorer.&nbsp;As far as I am aware every troubleshoot enquiry I have carried out has been using Window 10 facilities and&nbsp;has proved negative. I have also
 deleted and reloaded my printer which is a Canon MG7700 Series Printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printing from other programs is not a problem as I can print from Word, Excel etc. I believe I may have instigated a change without realising or knowing the full consequences of that change like indicating that a file is always opened by a particular program.
 My laptop is an HP Pavilion 15 Notebook PC originally Windows 8 but upgraded to Windows 10 Home Version 1607 OS Build 14393.1198.</p>

</p><p>Please note that although the thread you gave the link to refers to a the same problem I have I do not use Microsoft Edge I prefer IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having read the thread it largely implies that the printing problem has been in existence for more than a year without Microsoft knowing how to&nbsp;solve the&nbsp;problem. Various possible solutions are put forward with the majority being debunked and the person
 who started the thread finally giving up getting a solution after a year of waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second from last post&nbsp;on the thread wondered if AVG was a cause by deletion of the printerconfig.dll. Unfortunately for those of us that are not computer savvy they did not provide any information on how to check on one's own computer. The last post
 also asked for instructions. I too am waiting for instructions on how to check.</p>

<p>You can check the printerconfig.dll by clicking the Windows menu, and typing the "printerconfig.dll" on the search bar. Click on that file and there will be a pop up window to open that file.

<p>Thank you for informing us. Since the previous recommendations did not resolve the screen flickering on your Surface, it's best that you take the device to a Microsoft Store. A Store technician can run further tests and give you the best options regarding
 the findings. Go <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to locate the nearest Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to reach out to the Community in case you have other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 msconfig startup selection reverts from normal to selective startup</h2>
                    While trying to resolve problems with Bing apps in Windows 8.1, I accessed msconfig and noticed that the selective startup was checked. &nbsp;I attempted to change it to normal startup; I rebooted and startup option reverted back to selective. &nbsp;Can anyone shed
 some light on this? &nbsp;Thanks. Btw, I run a Toshiba Satellite, if that's any help.

            Thank you so much for your prompt response, Babu V. &nbsp;I followed your instructions. &nbsp;The scans showed that everything is clean and in order. &nbsp;I created a different user account. &nbsp;Msconfig still reverts to "Selective startup." &nbsp; One of the items checked
 under "Selective startup" is "Use original boot configuration" and is in gray. &nbsp;Everything is working well. &nbsp;Should I continue troubleshooting? &nbsp;Thanks for your help.

            <p>I have the same problem on a brand new Lenova G505s&nbsp;laptop that I just&nbsp;set up.&nbsp; Did not install any software or apps.&nbsp; All the startup items are showing they are enabled and have ran a virus scan several times and the system is clean.&nbsp; I went ahead and ran
 a system restore back to factory defaults and still the same issue.&nbsp; I sent the original laptop back to the supplier and got another brand new laptop...same issue!!!&nbsp; Why does MSCONFIG continually revert to Selective Startup when there are no driver or software
 conflicts and the system is brand new.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By the way&nbsp;Windows 8 SUCKS!&nbsp; Moving everything around does not make it a new operating system!&nbsp; It is not very productive when&nbsp;all of my employees have to spend 8 to 10 hours re-learning an OS when they could actually be working!!!&nbsp; Companies don't need
 a tablet...we need a computer that actually works!&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry I have to vent some where!&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    As title states, at first thought it was just ctrl+ shortcuts not working but now it seems the right ctrl button works just fine while the left one does not work at all. It won't work in any program, although it does on the on-screen keyboard, so slightly
 worried it might be a hardware issue. Let me know if there's anything else I could try. (This was originally on Windows 8, though I finally updated to 10 today thinking that might fix it, and it hasn't.)

            I once had a client who was very prone to hit the left control (ctrl)&nbsp;key instead of the shift key with all sorts of unforeseen consequences.&nbsp; I was able to write some code to disable the left control key but it was so long ago I cannot remember how I
 did it.&nbsp; So although it is very likely to be a physical&nbsp;hardware problem in your case, it can be done by software.

            Believe me, if you mistakenly hold down the Control key instead of the Shift key when you are trying to produce a capital letter, even only 1 time in 10, it does all sorts of weird things and totally disrupts the flow of anything you were trying to write.&nbsp;
 My poor old lady client was completely bemused.

<p>My left cntrl key will work for cntrl c and cntrl z commands but not for the cntrl v one. &nbsp; My right cntrl works for everything so I suspect tha some software has corrupted the keyboard shortcuts. &nbsp;Not sure if there is a way to restore its defaults But if
 u do find one Please let us know</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello</h2>
                    I have trouble setting up Windows Hello on my Dell XPS 13. It stopped working and there is only one way how to log in via password only. Even PIN does not work. I already reinstalled Windows and no improvement.

            1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

<p>Many thanks for your reply. Unfortunately nothing helped. I believe there is something wrong with the PIN. I type the PIN code and nothing happen. And there is always button for setting up the PIN. Can I reset PIN in some way? There are now options for remove
 PIN or fingerprint.</p>
<p>
