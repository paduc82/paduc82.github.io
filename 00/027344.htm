<h2>            Need help on Table set up for SINGLE Payment of Many Invoices</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">Payment / Invoicing&nbsp;Overview</p>
<p>
</p><p>The business dictates a <strong>Single Monthly Payment </strong>to be made against multiple monthly Invoices and I need feedback if my current tables&nbsp;(especially invoices, payments)&nbsp;&nbsp;are set up right.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Notes: </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1. We're not tracking invoice line items/ details but merely the Invoice's SUM Total</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. Invoices are issued monthly and are "many" since many Customers are using the same Contract's Services, and any given Customer may receive multiple Invoices during a month</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3) One goal of the db is to (with yet-to-design querries) track monthly payments against montly invoices to ensure they match</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4) Payments are normally made 1-month after invoice comes in. One Payment is made&nbsp;<em>PER Contract PER MONTH.</em> i.e; if Customers Jim and Bob both use "Mr. Clean" Contract's services in June; Jim and Bob both receive invoices
 but they're paid in ONE Payment to Mr. Clean; in JULY.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Current tables look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce601b8d-b398-49d8-96f1-1a39bc9a2d9f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEMS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Even if Payment data is entered into the tblPayment, the tblInvoiceSummaries PaymentID (FK) does not know a payment has been made and it also needs to be updated. But this seems like redundant work</li><li>Do I need an Join Invoice_Payment table even though my relation is ONE-TO-MANY? Any other suggestions?</li></ol>

            <p>I don't have enough information.</p>
<p>For one customer the rule was that any payment is applied to the oldest invoices and forward until the money has been exhausted.
</p>
<p>For another customer the rule was that any payment is applied to the invoice numbers listed on the check.</p>
<p>There are probably at least half a dozen other ways to apply payments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in assuming that tblInvoiceSummaries.PaymentID is nullable and is populated only when we have received full payment for that invoice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation seems definitely solvable, but may require a solid analysis session with an Access database design expert.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>You seem to have a 2 stage process happening here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My opinion would be to keep it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding of your question is that you issue invoices to customers for services provided by a supplier contractor ( eg Mr Clean)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customers pay you - then you pay Mr Clean . .&nbsp; is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if so then the customer part is a standard invoice module - issue invoices - collect payments and allocate them to invoices. - refer to Tom's reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the second part is to collate the payments to invoices by supplier. So all you really need is a supplier ID in the invoice. Then create a report that collates the data and create an EXPENSE entry equal to the payments received ( less any commissions and
 graft/corruption money etc&nbsp;) then you pay the suppliers from your expenses account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if this is not the scenario -&nbsp; then some more details would be needed for us to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers</p>

<p>
</p><p>your basic understanding quoted above bold&nbsp;is correct-- just wanted to clarify that for everyone's understanding&nbsp; please consider that a Contract = contractor = supplier.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you mentioned I needed a supplierID in the invoice, but tblInvoiceSummaries already has ContractID in it.&nbsp;So... did I misunderstand or did you mean something else?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, PaymentID FK in tblInvoiceSummaries is updated when paid. Not sure if this is the best way. Also note, there is NEVER partial payment of any given invoice. It's either paid IN FULL in month "x" or in&nbsp;month "1+x".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure which missing information you're refering to but&nbsp;I do have a&nbsp;description of entities; below</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Products and Services:</span> Goods that the Contracts offer to Customers</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Contracts:</span> Can also be called the "contractor". They provide the Products and Services ONLY IF a Customer has budgeted and allocated FUNDING towards that Contract. Many Contracts offere the same Products and
 Services; i.e; Contractors Mr. Clean&nbsp; and Miss Scrub both do carpet cleaning. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Customers and Clerks: </span>A Customer employes one or many Clerks to make calls (orders) for Products and Services from the Contract they choose. A Customer can have many Clerks but any one Clerk can work in only
 one Customer camp. i.e., &nbsp;Clerks Jeff and George are assigned to Contractor Pepsi, but only George is assigned to Contractor Budweiser, so only George can buy beer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Funding: </span>A yearly budget that each Customer must allocate for every Contract they intend to use.&nbsp; IF No budget allocated, there is no use of that Contract or their services by that Customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Invoice Sum:</span> Each Contractor sends monthly invoices to Customers. The Customers&nbsp;sum all their invoices and request a single Payment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Payments:</span> Monthly payments are made (in&nbsp;Â¥ or&nbsp;$ depending on Contract)&nbsp;against multiple invoices. THERE IS ONE PAYMENT PER CONTRACT. i.e., If Customers A, B and C all use Contract "Mr. Clean", then Mr. Clean
 will get ONE Payment for all the invoices (from Customers A, B and C). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know, based on this if my table set up and normalization assumptions are correct.</p>

<h2>            store and error code in lumia 920 Windows 8.1</h2>
                    When I try update a game (clash of Lords 2) I can see an error code: c101a027. And when I try update or install all other app I can see another error code.805a01f4. What can I do? Many person say that I have to install w10. But I heard that In Lumia 920
 this isn't possible. If I can't update the game I have to stop playing it.. Or If I make a new Appstore ID??

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Concerning your issue about not being able to update your game (and subsequently, add another app), may we ask when was the last time you tried accessing our store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We managed to see other users having the same issue but we are able to install an app an hour ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to perform a soft reset on your device by pressing the Power and Volume down button simultaneously for about 15 seconds. Once the phone vibrates, remove your hold and wait for the phone to finish rebooting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once done, check if you can install/update an app this time. If not, please notify us.</p>

    <title>Refund Fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joopslaman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refund Fail</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I wanted to play the game sea of thieves really bad, so I purchased the game pass, at first for free. However 1 or 2 days after the trial I quickly started losing interest in the game. Luckily I found out that when I canceled my subscription, I could
 get a full refund. But it just said: ''refund failed'', with no further explanation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I do anything wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, why isn't there a Xbox live or gaming category or something like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im sorry if there is one, I just found something that said ''gaming''</p>

            The default security code is 12345 unless changed.<br />
<br />
If you changed it and you forgot it, there is no other way but to have the phone repaired via the care point.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no IE12. The highest version is IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Windows 10, you now have two web browsers built-in. One is new and called Edge and the other is IE11.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you having trouble with watching Sky Go, then it is probably because Sky Go uses the Silverlight add-on which Edge doesn't support. To get around this simply use IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE11 can be found by searching for <strong>Internet Explorer&nbsp;</strong>from the&nbsp;<em>Search
</em>box at the bottom of the screen. When it appears in the list of search results either select it (or right click on it and
<strong>Pin to Start </strong>or <strong>Pin to taskbar </strong>to make it easier to access later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't yet installed Silverlight add-on, it is a free download from Microsoft here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/Get-Started/Install/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/Get-Started/Install/Default.aspx</a> .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Tip - If you are in Edge and viewing a page that needs Silverlight, you can switch to&nbsp;Internet Explorer by selecting the 3 dots (<strong>...</strong>) near the top right then
<strong>Open with Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>

    <title>Two columns in Word, but NOT newspaper style - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lilbro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two columns in Word, but NOT newspaper style</h2>
                    Way back when, Word would allow a document to be formatted with two or more columns that did NOT flow one to the next. This is something Word Perfect and every other word processing program has allowed. Is there a way to set Word columns to parallel without
 jumping thru all sorts of hoops?

            <p>Word for Windows does not support parallel columns, but you can imitate them by inserting a table with one row and the desired number of columns.</p>
<p>Select the table and select No Border from the Borders dropdown on the Design tab of the ribbon (under Table Tools),</p>

            If you don't want text to flow from one column to the next, then a two-column table is what you need (it's the equivalent of parallel columns in other programs). You can remove the border lines, as HansV suggested. Whenever you need the text to line up,
 vertically, just insert a new row.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We hear that you're having concerns with playing the music from Nokia 635 to Lumia 640.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have some questions for us to isolate the concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. How did you transfer the music? Is it via wireless or wired? </p>
<p>2. Did you use an SD Card for storing and retrieving audio files or music?</p>
<p>3. Does you tried to troubleshoot the concerns?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your response would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried the following and still get (xxx) xxx-xxxx.</p>
<p>Control Panel&gt;Phone &amp; Modem&gt;Location&gt;Edit&gt;General&gt;United States&gt;Area Code&gt;212&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that&nbsp;entering the country/region as the U.S.causes the format to&nbsp;default to (XXX) XXX-XXXX which is the standard format in the U.S.<span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the older versions of Outlook, I would enter a country that&nbsp;uses the XXX.XXX.XXXX format as its standard and that allowed me to get the desired result. I can't remember which country I used, though.&nbsp; Does anyone know which countries use the XXX.XXX.XXXX
 format?</p>

<h3> brycem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for Mac modifies the Style settings when editing an individual paragraph - why &#63;</h2>
                    I am running Word for Mac 2011 Verison 14.3.1 on a Macbook Pro with OS X 10.7.5.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am having a huge problem that Word behaves very strangely with Styles. &nbsp;I have a "Normal" style which has a first line indent and justified layout.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am finding if I want to change the layout of an individual paragraph it applies the change to the whole document and when I check the "Style" settings I find the change I did at the paragraph level has been modified the whole Style. &nbsp;For example:-</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&gt; Enter a "Return" to create a new paragraph in the Normal Style</div>
<div>&gt; Select centred for the text alignment for this new paragraph (using the "centred" button in the paragraph tab of the ribbon</div>
<div>&gt; All the paragraphs in the document with Normal style become centred</div>
<div>&gt; Check the Style properties - the style property shows the text alignment to be centred.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is just another of the bizarre behaviours of MS Word for Mac .......</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help appreciated</div>

            In later versions of Word (including 2010) the default setting for the Normal paragraph style is to
<i>not</i> update automatically. Additionally, the check box for enabling Automatically Update has been removed for Normal. The most likely reason the check box is there for you is that the document was originally created using an older version of Word -- 2003
 or earlier for PCs, 2004 or earlier for Mac. If you create a new blank document in 2007/2008 or later, then go directly to
<b>Format&gt; Style&gt; Modify</b> for Normal you'll see that the check box to <i>Automatically Update</i> isn't even there :-)<br />
<br />
That property is not a factor when modifying a style in the Modify dialog. Any changes you make to the style's definition will automatically apply to any text in the document carrying that style -- That's the standard behavior of a Style.<br />
<br />
The purpose of the check box was to enable the style modification based on any <i>
direct</i> formatting changes made to the text, itself. That's what is happening to you &amp; that's why the check box was removed... to keep users from having to go through exactly what you're experiencing.<br />
<br />
IOW, using the Modify dialog updates the Style regardless of whether the box is checked, but directly formatting the text doesn't modify the Style. If the box is checked, formatting the text also redefines the Style.<br />

<h2>            Enter and space keys not working</h2>
                    While in OneNote, I try to hit enter to move down a line but it doesn't work. The same for the space key, everything just stays highlighted. This is a brand new problem because several hours ago I used it with no problem. Does anyone have any suggestions?
 I've thought about uninstalling it and reinstalling it but I don't want to lose the work that is on there. I use it mostly for my school and it would be a huge hassle to copy everything into something else before doing that. I'm hoping the uninstalling it
 will be a last resort. Thank you!

            <p>Something new.</p>
<p>The Speech Recognition is now working.</p>
<p>You have to turn it on then you can talk to Cortana, the speech recognition of IE.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>But now the sounds do not play on any of my windows Apps.&nbsp; It will work if I play music through Google Chrome but none from windows, IE 11, Music, or Windows Media Player.</p>

            <p>Build 10135: Speech recognition works, and so does Cortana.</p>
<p>My question is, since Cortana is still a little buggy, won't hold still long enough for input. Cortana seems to think (sic) that I need to see the riots in Betchawannaland* or the local weather instead.</p>
<p>Disengaging speec h recognition doesn't help much. One in four times Cortana misbehaves and I need to give it a "time out" while I do other things.</p>
<p>As an aside, I attached a Viewsonic TD2220 touchscreen monitor as my third so I have a wide view. I found third party software giving control for the extra screens. Until I have enough $ to get a 3D camera, my holographic (detecting motions) programming
 must wait. There are much better and comprehensive touchscreens on the market but I got the Viewsonic while it was on sale and I was attending college online. Part of my stipend went for a computer and accessories.

<p>Multi-thinking and only three topics in that paragraph. ((#3 being this paragraph.)</p>
<p>For another post: Why only three dimensions. A camera&nbsp; on each of three or four monitors would give another, added&nbsp;POV. After all 5.1 or 7.1 audio is already there. Perhaps I am thinking of 3D output. :)</p>

<p>I called T-Mobile to unlock my Lumia 521 and they told me the phone number associated with the SIM card belongs to a company called Simple Whole Sales. Nothing shows up on Google for that company. T-Mobile advised me to contact Microsoft with the IMEI and
 see what Microsoft says. Has anyone encountered this situation? I will call Microsoft tomorrow but I doubt they can help unlock a T-Mobile SIM.</p>
