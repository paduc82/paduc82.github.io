<p>Hey there, I did disabled credential manager as you indicated in your directions.&nbsp; I also took down credential manager all together nothing listed there.&nbsp; I use a password manager.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I used the run command (admin) and typed net localgroup administrators and the rest is history!&nbsp; No more problems.&nbsp; Here's what I think the "generic credential" is; it's MICROSOFT...doing their sneaking around in my system that's why no MS staff
 talk about it becuz...well I don't need to tell you do I?&nbsp; 😜</p>

<h2>            Wireless certificate issues&#58; &#34;Windows was unable to log you on to the network&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I'm running Windows XP SP3 with no issues connection to simple wireless networks and networks that require a simple password to enter. However, I can't connect to a wireless network that asks for certificate credentials. I correctly enter in the user name
 and password (and leave logon domain blank), and I've verified that these are correct. But it won't connect, and just says that "windows was unable to log you on to the network". Other people have successfully connected to the network with Windows, so I'm
 not sure why I'm having so much trouble. I've tried disabling the firewall temporarily to see if that would make a difference, but it didn't. Am I missing something here?</p>
<p>Thanks so much in advance!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Logging on with certificate is a function of proffessional business network.</p>
<p>You have to check with some one in charge of the network for the correct configuration.</p>

<p>Hello ,</p>
<p>Windows XP SP3 is a Service Pack, not an operating system, which may be part of the problem.</p>
<p>Wireless Network? Do you own the Router? If not, check with the owner of the Router.</p>

    <title>Getting GTA V updates offline&#63; Download on USB Drive... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting GTA V updates offline&#63; Download on USB Drive...</h2>
                    
<p>My XBOX 360 does not get online, for whatever reason. I don;t use it much anymore except for GTA V. Someone told me and I have read that you can download the files off the internet, put them on a USB drive and/or CD and plug it into your XBOX. This will
 allow you to get all the DLC and updates Rockstar has given out so far.</p>
<p>My search attempts on Google are impossible, anything with GTA V kicks out a bunch of crap I really didn't search for.</p>
<p>Was hoping someone here knew.</p>
<p>I am looking for the location of these files for the XBOX 360 update and the directions if need be.</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance!</p>

<p>you can get xbox 360 update from xbox.com with a usb, but for gta5 updates, you need your console to be connected to the internet. you can get the update from the market place to download the update from xbox.com, but you will still need your console to
 be connect to the internet.</p>
<p>you can not get an update for a game basically</p>

<p>Try going to <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.rockstargames.com/</a> and look for "GTA: V". There should be a section there called "Downloads" or "Patches". See if this takes you to a DL for the patches/updates. Works like
 this for the PC, so maybe it will be similar for GTA: V.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in Windows 10.

<p>
</p><p><em>"Is the Program Files (x86) folder supposed to show in the C: system drive?"</em></p>
<p>The answer to your question is yes. If your game is working fine it should not be a problem. Maybe while installing the game, the location Games&nbsp;E was selected&nbsp;for the program files to be stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I hope this post is helpful. Get back to us with the results. We are happy to help.</span></p>

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks for the reply Joythar, I could see it if I applied "show hidden files folders and drivers" in the File/Folder options so it was in fact there, but for some reason it was hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I need to say that this is an OEM full system install of Win 10 Pro not an upgrade, and the
<em>Program Files (x86) </em>folder was hidden by the system on install OR after the install of the first program I installed on the C: drive..</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;To fix it, I applied "show hidden files folders and drivers" in the File/Folder options, then right clicked on the
<em>Program Files (x86) hidden&nbsp;</em>folder and selected properties and it was in fact checked&nbsp;hidden.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I unchecked "hidden" and now it is showing properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I was worried there for a moment because I had about 24 hours of time in this install, I use my PC for everything and I have a ton of programs and did not want to have to start all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thanks again for the reply,</p>

    <title>Unexpected error when changing privacy settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> burningpeasant5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unexpected error when changing privacy settings</h2>
                    <p>Recently a friend invited me to a club on the Xbox app. I couldn't join the club because my privacy settings wouldn't allow it. This was no big deal since I've changed my privacy and online safety settings before, so I figured I'd just go and change them
 again. Unfortunately, whenever I tried to change my settings I was told that an unexpected error occurred and that I should retry later. I've been having this problem for a few days and even talked to tech support for about an hour to no avail. Does anyone
 happen to have a fix for this?</p>

            Hi Shondella,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
This issue may occur if there is a problem with the handling of digital signatures in Microsoft Windows.
<br />
<br />
Here is what you need to check<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start; click Run, type Services.msc -s, and then click OK.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll down to Remote Procedure Call (RPC).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify that the Status is started.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify that the Startup Type is Automatic.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the following commands, click Start, click Run, type the command, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 softpub.dll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 wintrust.dll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 initpki.dll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 dssenh.dll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 rsaenh.dll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 gpkcsp.dll <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 slbcsp.dll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32 cryptdlg.dll<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Upgrade your Windows Installer Package to the latest version. <br />
<strong><br />
Windows Installer Version 4.5</strong> <br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942288/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942288/en-us
</a><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to remove the partial installation of Family Tree maker 2010 by using Windows Installer Clean up Utility.This utility will remove the installation files of the application.<br />
<br />
<strong>Download Link: Windows Installer Clean up Utility</strong> <br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301
</a><br />
<br />
Now try re-installing <strong>Family Tree Maker 2010</strong> and let me know if this worked.<br />
<br />

    <title>Huawei laptop ongoing support&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j. commodore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Huawei laptop ongoing support&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am a Huawei laptop user - 2018 Matebook Pro X - located in the US and am worried about whether I will continue to get Microsoft software and security updates.&nbsp; Of note, I do not seem to be receiving the May 1903 update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use this laptop daily for work and need it to be up to date and secure and am worried that, due to the US Commerce Department listing, Microsoft will stop providing updates.&nbsp; Is there any information anyone including Microsoft can provide regarding ongoing
 software and security updates?</p>

            Hi J
<br />
<br />There is no official word coming from Microsoft on this at the moment
<br />
<br />It should be noted that all Hwawei products (e.g. Huawei’s MateBook X Pro) seem to have been pulled from the Microsoft store - so that is not a good sign
<br />
<br />See if you can get 1903 this way:
<br />
<br />Click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1903 and bring your PC right up to date

            Hello J.
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />Microsoft has not said anything about suspend Updates on Huawei Laptops yet.
<br />
<br />Despite of the big scandal with Google suspended support on Huawei Microsoft says there is nothing to share about that.
<br />
<br />If you has not received latest updates try to download manually:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this information has been useful, please let me know if you still need assistance.

            Have you checked for updates via settings? I have an Huawei Matebook X pro also. Be sure to update your audio driver via Huawei downloads page if you have not done this. Run any driver updates and BIOS updates if you are behind. Do you have latest PC Manager?
 It downloaded newest sound driver on the 21st for me. I have the latest for 1809 updated yesterday but as yet haven't gotten 1903. I am sure it will roll out&nbsp; to you but for now make sure you are running the latest 1809&nbsp; 1763.529. Check by typing winver in
 search. Do not run windows update until you make sure you have all the latest updates from Huawei. There was a 3 month reprieve to the ban. I am not sure if the ban will include the operating system for computers that are already in circulation. The ban is
 supposed to be for hardware. If it comes to pass though others on Reddit have suggested you may still be able to manually update Windows. We shall have to wait and see how this all plays out.

<h3> notjus4ne1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t open store or use any of the apps I&#39;ve downloaded</h2>
                    Since downloading Windows 10, it's been one issue after another. Now I can't open the store or use the apps I already downloaded. It says the app can't be used with the built in Administrator. I've read other threads and nothing they've said do has worked.
 Just wondering since it seems to be a common problem if Microsoft has a updated way to handle this issue?

<h2>            USB HDD Recognized but not Accessible</h2>
                    <p>I have two Dell 64bit PCs:&nbsp; Inspiron 14Z and Studio XPS 435t / 9000.&nbsp; Both have peripheral USB HDDs attached for backup, etc.&nbsp; I updated the drivers, including Intel chipsets,&nbsp;on both PCs and am now faced with the following situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both PCs recognize the drives in File Explorer, but are not accessible: "Q:\ is not accessible. The device is not ready"&nbsp; The drives also show up in the Disk Manager, with file format of RAW.</li><li>However, if I switch&nbsp;the drives from one computer to the other, they are fully accessible via File Explorer, etc.</li><li>I tried various tactics remedy the problem: unplug the PCs, uninstall drives, uninstall USB ports, etc., but to no avail.</li></ol>
<p>I really cannot just switch the drives because of: backup history, drive capacities, portable drive needed by the laptop, etc. reasons.</p>
<p><br />

            Did you assign the disk the letter Q? That is usually the MS Office reserved partition on older computers. What operating system on each computer? Open Disk Management in Administrative Tools and see what drives are available. The external drives might
 need to be assigned a letter or reformatted to use with diff operating systems. Look for Disk 5 or 6 to see if it has a letter. Unplug the ext drive and see which one disappears from the list.

<ol>
<li>I used Q as illustrative.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;4 drives involved, with various assignments.</li><li>Both systems run Windows 8.1</li><li>I do not feel that a reformat is required, as per my original question, each of the drives is accessible when switched from the "native" PC to the other PC</li><li>I cannot assign another letter in Disk Management because it flags the drive as inaccessible.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That's a strange circumstance... you would think that they would be accessible on the "Native PC", not the other way around....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Normally the "RAW" format is something used by a specialty program\feature of some type.</p>
<p>I most certainly wouldn't reformat them...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You might try defragging them on the machine that they will work on...</p>
<p>I had a similar problem, except there was only one machine involved....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had been reloading images of Win 8 and Win 7 onto my SSD that I use for the OS....</p>
<p>This normally isn't a problem, but somewhere along the line I had failed to turn off the automatic optimization for the DATA drives...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems that Win 8 did an optimization (Defrag) on them, and when I switched back to the Win 7 image it didn't recognize the drives properly... It ran an automatic ChkDsk at boot on all three data drives...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They all then worked OK... I have since turned off the Automatic Optimization, and no more issues...</p>

            Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; I have both defragmented and ran chkdsk on the drives, using the PC that is able to access their contents.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when I switch them back to their "native" machine, they are still flagged as not ready/not accessible.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did quite a bit of searching on this issue... which appears to be somewhat common....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All of the fixes I could find involved "RECOVERING' the data in some fashion such as copying it to a different drive, reformatting, and then copying it back...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>None of these make sense for you except as a last resort since the drive works OK on different machines.</p>
<p>Unless you are desperate to use a particular drive on a particular machine....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was looking for a tool to reset the drives status, but that doesn't make sense either... there is nothing wrong with it's status on the other machine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There were suggestions that there may be an issue with the enclosure, and hooking it up directly as a internal drive sometimes works...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There was also mention of some security software that had encrypted the drive, causing it to appear as RAW.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do these drives\enclosures perhaps have some internal software feature, or something on the actual machine that could be causing this ? I know Seagate has some kind of feature that may do this...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you get anything at all to come up in your options in Disk Manage other than to reformat ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could try rebooting the machine with the drive attached and see if that might trigger some type of repair feature...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since you probably don't have a spare copy of the drives contents, I would be very careful about what you attempt...</p>

<p>Not sure what to do next?</p>
<p>Usually the new characters etc just appear in the game. I got an xbox live confirmation on screen which said the content had been successfully downloaded.</p>
<p>But nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, many people have reported Translator related issues. 
<br />
<br />What is your OS and its version and also Skype version?
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>
</p><p>I am using "Skype version 8.44.0.40"&nbsp; "Application version 14.44.40.1000". I am running Windows 10 Home. I have the translator setup to translate what I say in English to Spanish and translate what the other party says in Spanish to English. When writing
 messages it works fine. When we are on a video call what I say in English is translated to Spanish but what the other party says in Spanish is not translated to English. It previously worked correctly and has only recently stopped translating on the video
 call recently. I have this issue with two Spanis speaking contacts. Please note I am only trying to talk to one contact at a time. It is not a group chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Gib</p>

<p>Let's stick to just trying to purchase on the console. Tell me exactly what you are trying to purchase, what kind of payment method you are using, and what the exact error message/code is you receive. For now, try to remove and re-add your payment method,
 or try a different payment method and see if that helps. </p>

<p>I should also point out that I'm trying to buy some of the DLC content for Mortal Kombat. I purchased 1 month gold membership with paypal for my 1st time, then a couple of minutes later I tried to add more points for the extra characters but was unable to
 complete the transaction, both on Pc and Xbox. Thx in advance.</p>

<p>Well then, it sounds like your account is fine, and the item you are trying to buy works, it's just your Paypal account. Take a quick look at our Paypal Sticky (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/27/t/26156.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../26156.aspx</a>)
 and make sure you meet all the requirements for using Paypal. Thanks!</p>
