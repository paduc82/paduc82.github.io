<h2>            outlook 2016 trying to send invisible emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Using windows10, office 2016.</p>
<p>Outlook 2016 keeps trying to send an email when there is nothing in the outbox. A bit of research online leads me to believe I have a read receipt stuck in my system somewhere. I rec'd an email which requested a read receipt. I clicked yes. The return address
 was to one of those do not reply addresses. Now every time I try to use outlook it keeps trying to send this email. I have changed my settings so a read receipt is never sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried </p>
<ul>

            Hello Jimmy,<br />
<br />
<br />
If you've already tried deleting the read receipts using the tools you mentioned, it is likely that the issue is on the Outgoing mail server. Thus, we advise that you contact your Internet Service Provider for further investigations.<br />
<br />
Feel free to reach out if you require further assistance.

<p>Hello Hector</p>
<p>Thanks for responding. Here's a bit more information. Maybe should have included it with my original question. I use the 64 bit version of office. The bottom solution fails before it even starts and the 1st one fails at step 8. The solutions provided are
 for the 32bit version (or so I've been informed). Also during my online research I did notice that other people have the same problem of the MFCMAPI solution failing at step 8.
</p>
<p>Checked my provider before coming here. Sadly I assume any problem originates with telus so I go there first. Not my ISP problem. It's definitely in outlook.

<p>Hello Hector</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for staying on this. I do appreciate that. </p>
<p>I had the same problem with my 'old' laptop running win8.1 and office 2016. Like I said in a previous note here, I did a bit of research and thought I had discovered the problem. It seemed as I wasn't the only one with this problem and there seemed to be
 a solution. I tried the 'solutions' and they didn't work for me. Other folks had the same result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get emails from my realtor with new listings and they always ask for the read receipt. These emails are generated automatically by their system based on criteria I have given my realtor (house size, cost, # of bedrooms, etc) For read receipts, I had the
 outlook 2016 settings set to 'always ask'. For my realtor I always clicked yes not realizing it was the culprit. Each time I got new listings, I would click yes to the read receipt request. When I got rid of the old machine it was trying to send 72 emails
 every time I tried to use outlook. In the 'show progress' window I would highlight the 'sending emails' line and click 'cancel task' or I would wait and eventually it would fail and show a message. (I probably should have taken a screenshot of the message
 to show you but I didn't) Before I came here with my request I checked at Telus webmail and it wasn't trying to send the emails. I called Telus and after considerable discussion (they immediately denied any possibility it was them but I asked them to check
 thoroughly to make sure) I was sure then that it was something in outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new laptop with win10 and installed the office 2016 suite. It was a new install on a new machine. When I upgraded to this new machine I was hoping to see the end of the problem.
</p>
<p>The day after I got my new machine home and had the office 2016 installed and set up with telus, I got an email from the realtor and clicked yes to the read rec't request. My new machine immediately did the same thing as the old one. It tried to send the
 read rec't reply to an address that doesn't accept emails. It failed and showed a message. I immediately went to settings and changed to 'never send read receipts'. I still get new listings from the realtor with no additional problems. Outlook has been trying
 to send 1 'invisible' email since then. </p>
<p>I assumed office 2016 would have all the latest updates as I downloaded the product from Microsoft and registered it there. I saw your reply here advising me to check for updates and run a repair. I did check yesterday to see if perhaps that was the problem
 and Microsoft told me I am running the latest version and no updates are available. I never tried the 'repair' option. I have no idea what happened but Outlook is no longer trying to send that invisible email. I wish I could tell you I did something that worked
 but I am mystified. Other than come here to ask the question, I did nothing to solve the problem. It just went away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the length of this reply but maybe there is something in here that tells you something. I figured the more information you have, the better you may be able to figure the problem and perhaps come up with a solution for other folks with the same
 issue. I have left the 'notify me' box checked here in the unlikely event that you may have questions for me. I will reply to any such questions to the best of my abilities. Thanks again.

    <title>Computer Repair Shop installed MS Office Professional Plus 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alan_711  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Repair Shop installed MS Office Professional Plus 2007</h2>
                    <p>Last week I brought my computer to a computer repair shop because my HP Pavilion p6228p Desktop PC would not turn on, boot into Windows 10 and access the internet with a Spectrum modem at home. The computer was unstable and two office supply stores said
 it was because of a problem with the mother board. <span>I explained to a local computer repair shop manager that I had MS Word and Excel files on my computer. I told him I did not want them deleted when they were working on my computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer that I bought in November 2009 had Windows 7. Windows 10 was installed later when it first came out. I purchased
<strong>MS Office Home &amp; Student 2007 </strong>and installed it shortly after buying the computer at Office Depot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer repair shop did a data transfer, Windows 10 operating system reload -- including standard backup, software and drivers installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the computer repair shop installed <strong>MS Office Professional Plus 2007</strong> which I did
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span> purchase from them or Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the computer repair shop manager if this was illegal, unethical or immoral. He said "no".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that true? MS Office Professional Plus 2007 includes software such as Access which MS Office Home &amp; Student 2007 does not have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do repair shops have a MS Office Professional Plus 2007 license to install an upgraded MS Office version to a customer's computer that they work on if they do not know the product key to install MS Office Home &amp; Student 2007?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has a message regarding MS Office Professional Plus 2007 saying "this product is licensed to __________ (my last name)" and shows a Product ID number. How can that be when I did not purchase the software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I tracked down the product key given to me by Microsoft when I first ordered the Home and Student 2007 online in November 2009.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I click on Settings and Windows Update, there is a message "Microsoft Office File Validation Add-in Status: Pending Install". When I click "Next" the following message appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Software License Terms</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Please note: Microsoft Corporation licenses this supplement to you. You may use a copy of this supplement with each validly licensed copy of Microsoft 2003 and 2007 Office System Desktop Application software. You may not use the
 supplement if you do not have a license for the software. The license terms for the software apply to your use of this supplement... to install this update, accept the new Software License Terms. Close this window or select the Back arrow if you don't want
 to install the update now."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I hesitate "accepting and installing" this supplement since I did not purchase MS Office Professional Plus 2007 even though I did purchase MS Office Home &amp; Student 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to be involved in software theft if the computer repair shop is not authorized to install an upgraded version of Office that I did not purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as to how I should proceed -- either "accept and install" or uninstall MS Office Professional Plus 2007 and attempt to reinstall MS Office Home and Student 2007.</p>

<p>I spoke with the computer repair business owner. He told me someone gave him a
<strong>Volume License Edition</strong>&nbsp;of <strong>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007</strong> software which he said allows for an unlimited number of installations of this software to his customers at no charge. According to the business owner he does
 not charge for this particular software installation. His business does not make a profit from it nor is it for sale or resale. The business owner offered to reinstall Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 for me if I had the Product Key (which I do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told that <strong>Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007</strong> is no longer available for download from Microsoft's website even though I have the original Product Key and Order Confirmation Number. Support for Office 2007 has ended.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Please reply to this update so I can have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

</p><p>Office Pro Plus is most commonly distributed by volume license. But the type of installation you have does not meet the license terms.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>You have an Illegal or Bootleg installation</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The volume license is only allowed to be used inside the company that originally bought it. And even then they buy a specific number of licenes, not unlimited.&nbsp; So the repair business could install it on computers that they are going to use in-house. But
 as soon as the computer is sold to an outside owner, the license is no longer legal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to uninstall 2007 Pro Plus, then install your copy of Office 2007 and activate it. Do you have the right installation file / disk?

</p><p>There are a few non MS web sites that offer downloads. But there is always the concern that there may be an "addition" to the install file (ie malware!).&nbsp; Or find someone else who has the 2007 Home and Student installation disk. The disk (or installation
 file) itself is generic, it is your product key that is unique.&nbsp; But you do have to use the installation disk/file that is specific for your product key, ie Home and Student.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Places to look for old installation disks:</p>
<ul>
<li>local computer clubs</li><li>local small computer repair shops</li><li>university or college students (lots of geeks there with access "old" tech)</li><li>the internet</li></ul>
<p>If you find an install disk, you can just borrow it and copy the whole disk for later use.

                    Starting a few days ago, Outlook 2010, does not format some e-mail correctly. This includes e-mail received more than a few day ago that initially did format correctly.<br />
<br />

Here are links to those four screen shots:<br />

<p><span><span>Hi kaliniak,
<br />
<br />
Before removing the files from “temporary internet files” folder, make sure that there are no instances of “iexplore.exe” running in the task manager. Kill the process “iexplore.exe”, if running.<br />
<br />
For understanding process information in Task Manager, click <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Understanding-process-information-in-Task-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
For information on how to kill a process, click <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Exit-a-program-that-isnt-responding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Once there are no “iexplore.exe” processes running, try deleting the files from “temporary internet files”.<br />
<br />
If it does not work, try removing the files from safe mode.<br />
For information on how to start the computer in safe mode, click <strong>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!<br />

<h2>            This device cannot start. &#40;Code 10&#41;</h2>
                    I'm currently trying to get my Nokia 6235 mobile phone to work with my computer so I can get some photo's of it. I have installed the factor software that came with the CD, but when Windows (XP) installs the drivers automatically it tell me this:<br />
<br />
This device cannot start. (Code 10)<br />
<br />
No drivers came with the disk, and the tutorial clearly states to use the windows driver wizard to install device drivers, so I'm very confused here,<br />
any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
Thanks.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, but i am not sure if your phone has got memory card, so that mass storage/data transfer can be used using cable.&nbsp; Cable whichever you are using should be compatible with your pc and it should be genuine cable of Nokia.&nbsp; CDMA devices are not discussed
 here often :( So i cant help you regarding this :(&nbsp; May be you can check if any of your friend's has got laptop which has got infrared facility and you can copy from their pcs, if any :)</p>

            I have managed to get the computer to recognize the device via a usb cable, and I have all the required drivers installed, but when I open up the Nokida PC Suit and click Get Connected then click on the Cable connection option, it just stays on that screen
 saying "Please connect your cable to the computer and your mobile phone to the cable.". What's happening Nokia?!

<p>You must have installed a Windows Insider preview build on your Lumia 625, as it is not supported for Windows 10 Mobile. From August last year it is not supported for the Windows Insider program either, so you cannot install Windows 10 mobile on it by any
 method.</p>

            &nbsp;build 10041. This was on a surface 2 tablet pro 128. I believe it changed the language because while it is flashing on and off I can see a koreen folder on the desk top. I can not click on folders as they will not open for me. I could get remote to start
 up but I hove no one to dial in to help. I did install the update on a usb drive to reinstall it but when I stick it in and reboot nothing happens.

<h2>            In Outlook 2013, why is it slow switching from views such as Mail, to Calendar, to Tasks.&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a trial version of Office 2013 on my work laptop running Windows Pro 8. I've noticed that in Outlook, when switching views (Mail to Calendar, to Tasks for example) by clicking the "Mail" or "Calendar" or "People" or "Tasks" view there is a momentary
 lag, then is very nicely morphs into the new view. It's just a little to slow. Can this be sped up?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Bruce, <br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I would assist you in issue related to Outlook 2010, however I have a quick question for you:<br />
<br />
What type of email account are you working on? Is it Pop3, IMAP or Exchange server email account?<br />
<br />
</span>Start Outlook in safe mode and verify whether issue re-occurs.Follow the below mentioned steps to start Outlook in safe mode:<span><br />
<br />
* Hold <b>Windows key</b> + <b>R</b>.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the <b>Open</b> box, and then press Enter:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Outlook /safe<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><span><br />
</span><span>Note: There is space between Outlook and /</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>If Outlook safe works, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:
<br />
<br />
a) Click on <b>File </b>menu, click <b>Options</b>, <b>Add-ins</b>, <b>Go</b> button besides Manage:
<b>Com-in Add</b>. <br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the check box. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
</span><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>You may also check the following thread link which discusses about similar issue and see if it helps:<br />

            Not to thread steal but I've been having this same issue recently Office 2013.&nbsp; I'm also using an Exchange account, Have tried safe mode, Have tried checking "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" in Advanced settings, Have tried disabling all addons
 except "Microsoft Exchange Add-in" = all with no impact.&nbsp; PC is a Core i7 3.4 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 64 GB SSD Drive running Windows 8.1 Pro.<br />

            This made a HUGE difference for me. &nbsp;When I initially opened Outlook 2013, it pulled all my data from my 2010 version and wasn't able to process it efficiently. &nbsp;Since I created new profiles separating my IMAP accounts from my exchange, my IMAP accounts
 load fast now.

            <p>This works, but every few weeks I have to re-create an account again to reap any speed benefits, which is sort of shooting myself in the foot. I shouldn't have to recreate an account over and over again just to get a speed benefit that'll only last a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OST locally is under 5 gigs, so that's not the issue either, cached exchange mode turned on, on Office 365. (I'm sure no one at Microsoft would appreciate over 500,000 users turning
<strong>off </strong>CEM on Office 365...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for troubleshooting sake, I've turned off CEM on a few boxes and performance is still like AOL online back in the 90's.</p>

<p>Is there a method to give a demo application database to a client that becomes disabled after a period of time, say 30 days? I thought I had read that you could put a timer in a database to disable its use.</p>

            <p>First I do not like timed trials. Too often you download a trial, then something happens and you can't get to it and it expires. So I put a max records limiter in my demos. I use code in the Before Insert event of my main forms that checks for a hard coded
 limit and then pops up a message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sample application is limited to 10 records. If you wish to purchase the application please contact...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user can then delete existing records to continue to test, but the app is virtually useless. Plus demos are distributed as accde files so they can't go in and change the limit.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I use the same version of OneNote at home with Windows 10. Embed videos works fine there but at work, the video only shows up as a link and screenshot. Can't embed videos at work. Like you, I only get a link on the page. Wondering if problem is OS-related
 because work uses Windows 7. I plan on checking the OneNote version but the techs assure me the automatic updates are working fine.

    <title>Disable Sign on using one of the Aliases - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> want 2 retain control  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Sign on using one of the Aliases</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>i use alias to shield my original account name and that feature works well.</p>
<p>however microsoft permits to log-in using the alias with the same password as the original account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i &nbsp;registered on a site using that alias and now i see (on recent activity page) a huge number of failed attempt to login using that name from all over the globe.&nbsp;i have changed the password since then so i am safe for now, however i would like to disable
 login using that specific alias</p>
<p>
</p><p>i could delete that alias however , i would like to retain the alias and still disable login from it .</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it possible to disable login for a specific alias ? if not , is there an other method to disable login so that people stop trying it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            <p>Did you ever get help from Microsoft on this?&nbsp; I want to do the same thing, block logins using an alias.&nbsp; Just as a good security measure after getting an account hacked on Yahoo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yahoo used to block logins&nbsp;using aliases.&nbsp; I never showed my real ID to the outside world.&nbsp; But then they changed their policy and allowed logins using the alias.&nbsp; My password got raked and I was hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why they allow logins using an alias.&nbsp;&nbsp;It just provides another attack surface for a hacker.</p>

<h3> code numpty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Column chart to show percentage of numbers within a range</h2>
                    
<p>I have a dynamic named range which will consist of randomly generated numbers between 2 specified numbers, in columns and rows, e.g.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table>
</table>
<p>The Lowest Number &amp; Highest numbers are entered, along with the number of decimal places and may be different in every instance.</p>
From this data I need to produce a column chart showing (in this instance) what percentage of numbers fall between the integers 59 &amp; 61, 61 &amp; 63, 63 &amp; 65, 65 &amp; 67.
<p>I can't even work out how to arrive at the percentages, let alone the chart.</p>

<p>Let's say your range is named MyRange.</p>
<p>We'll create a data range for the chart in B1:C5. (If you use another range, shift the cell references as needed)</p>
<p>In A2, enter 59, in A3 61, in A4 63 and in A5 65. You can, of course, use formulas based on your Lowest and Higest values instead of entering the values.</p>
<p>In B2, enter the formula =A2&amp;"-"&amp;(A2+2) and fill down to B5</p>
<p>In C2, enter the formula =SUMPRODUCT((MyRange&gt;=A2)*(MyRange&lt;A2+2))/COUNT(MyRange) and fill down to C5. Format these numbers as a percentage</p>
<p>Enter captions in B1 and C1.</p>
<p>Create a column chart based on B1:C5.</p>

                    I just received a notice in my inbox for windows live mail that I have to update that program and Microsoft is doing away with it then they suggest that I switch to windows 10 mail app. I have been running windows 10 since it came out on both of my computers,
 a Laptop and Desktop. I have tried the windows 10 mail app and to say the least it the biggest bunch of **** that has ever been perpetrated on the public since AOL. I can NOT use outlook.com because I don't receive any mail sent to my address at outlook.com.
 I receive mail on outlook.com from all my mail that is sent to live.com but WHERE IS MY HOTMAIL I DON'T RECIEVE IT AT ALL?&nbsp;I Have to use live.com because that's the only mail that works sending and receiving. Now Microsoft has deemed it necessary that I should

------=_Part_1541002_819411349.1450191594094--)?? The only way I can receive mail is to have everyone send it to my live.com account then it shows up in outlook.com but I can't send anything from there and I have to open live.com so I can send mail, and Microsoft
 wants to do away with everything but the store app?????? I would be very happy to use one email account but it doesn't work. If you or Microsoft can show me how to fix this&nbsp;I would be very grateful.&nbsp;I have tried before without success.&nbsp;</p>

            I sent the message myself from my yahoo.com email to see if it would go through. The message read ; I just wanted to see if this would go through; This is the biggest bunch of **** from Microsoft that I have ever heard. I have had a Microsoft account with
 the same name&nbsp;since 1994. I use it to sign into Microsoft for all of my accounts including windows 10 and skype. I set up outlook email when it came out&nbsp;with a
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and registered it with my live.com email. I&nbsp;also set up Hotmail&nbsp;on live.com. Now I can't receive outlook or Hotmail on my live.com email because it won't connect according to my mail server.
 I did have 4 email accounts, yahoo, outlook, Hotmail, and live. Now it seems I only have&nbsp;(3) and that is outlook, live, and yahoo. I can use yahoo just fine (if they wouldn't keep changing it all the time like outlook does) and live just fine (until this last
 update that Microsoft told me I needed to install and can't get rid of) and outlook (I can't receive anything&nbsp;that is sent to my Hotmail account or my outlook account). I can use outlook to view my live mail but that's it and after this last fiasco of Microsoft
 with this update for live mail I have trouble using it the way I used to. It doesn't make any difference what people send me to Hotmail (even Microsoft) I don't receive it. I don't receive any mail from people sent to my outlook mail (except Microsoft). If
 you can tell me what's wrong I would be glad to fix it? I sounds like microsofts problem after reading the posts about outlook and the store mail app.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>We can't see addresses here, but it looks like you tried to send a message from Yahoo. If Yahoo is saying that the @hotmail.com or @outlook.com mailbox to which you sent the message is unavailable, then perhaps it is. When was the last time you logged into

            You may think you are correct but you are not. Anything that is sent to my Hotmail address is not received anywhere. I stay logged in on my live.com and outlook.com mail because I look at it 3 or 4 times a day. I sent my message from yahoo.com to outlook.com
 and it failed. I sent the same message from yahoo to live.com and it was received at outlook and live both. I sent the same message from yahoo to Hotmail.com and there was no message anywhere to be found. This has been&nbsp;my problem ever since outlook.com came
 into being and I joined it with a outlook.com address. NOW WHAT!&nbsp;

Not in this case! So what makes you so almighty? If everything worked the way it was supposed to it would be fine but it doesn't.

    <title>Setting Folder Security in VBA for Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jontyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting Folder Security in VBA for Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi, following on from the success of my previous post which was answered extremely quickly so thank you for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a slightly more indepth problem to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to set security on a folder to read only.&nbsp; This will allow me to put files into the folder and then lock them down, which will in turn prevent them from being altered or removed but still allow them to be read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious tool within the VBA box is the FileSystemObject.&nbsp; I can set the attribute of the folder object to 1 (Read-Only) but there is no security behind this and so in theory anyone could just untick the read-only box in the properties section.&nbsp; Plus
 it wouldn't offer security to prevent anyone deleting the files....so it doesn't really tick the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using ADsSecurity.&nbsp; I found an online document which goes to show how to use it, but the examples are for VBS and VB6.&nbsp; Normally this wouldn't be a problem, however my windows 10 machine didn't have the ADsSecurity.dll.&nbsp; I have now downloaded
 this, and successfully registered using RegSvr32.&nbsp; I have tried both early and late binding, but I am still receiving an error message stating ActiveX can't create object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub TestApprovalEB ()</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim oSec as ADsSecurity&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; Set oSec=New ADsSecurity</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub TestApprovalLB ()</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim oSec as Object</p>
<p>&nbsp; Set oSec=CreateObject("ADsSecurity")</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both Active DS Type Library and ADsSecurity 2.5 Type Library ticked in the references</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next option I tried was using a series of API calls</p>
<p>
</p><div>&nbsp; lResult = LookupAccountName(vbNullString, sUserName, bUserSid(0), 255, sDomainName, lDomainNameLength, lSIDType)</div>
<div>&nbsp; sDomainName = Space(lDomainNameLength)</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; lResult = LookupAccountName(vbNullString, sUserName, bUserSid(0), 255, sDomainName, lDomainNameLength, lSIDType)</p>
</div>
<div>&nbsp; If (lResult = 0) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Error: Unable to Lookup the Current User Account: " &amp; sUserName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; lResult = GetFileSecurityN(sFileName, DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION, 0, 0, lSizeNeeded)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; ReDim bSDBuf(lSizeNeeded)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; lResult = GetFileSecurity(sFileName, DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION, bSDBuf(0), lSizeNeeded, lSizeNeeded)<br />
&nbsp; If (lResult = 0) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Error: Unable to Get the File Security Descriptor"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; lResult = InitializeSecurityDescriptor(sNewSD, SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR_REVISION)<br />
&nbsp; If (lResult = 0) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Error: Unable to Initialize New Security Descriptor"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; lResult = GetSecurityDescriptorDacl(bSDBuf(0), lDaclPresent, pAcl, lDaclDefaulted)<br />
&nbsp; If (lResult = 0) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Error: Unable to Get DACL from File Security " &amp; "Descriptor"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp; If (lDaclPresent = False) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Error: No ACL Information Available for this File"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; 'Attempt to get the ACL from the file's Security Descriptor.<br />
&nbsp; lResult = GetAclInformation(pAcl, sACLInfo, Len(sACLInfo), 2&amp;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If (lResult = 0) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Error: Unable to Get ACL from File Security Descriptor"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>However excel crashes at this point when trying to GetAclInformation.&nbsp; And this is everytime!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am slightly lost as to what I can do....can anyone suggest an alternative approach?&nbsp; Or maybe explain where I am going wrong with the approach I am taking thus far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards and thank you in advance for any suggestions/help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jonty</p>
