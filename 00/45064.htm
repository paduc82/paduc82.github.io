============================================<br />
I'm just guessing you are not trying to Rotate the photo but to<br />
change it from Landscape Orientation to Portrait Orientation?<br />
<br />
In order to accomplish this task without distorting the image <br />
you would have to Crop out a section in the Orientation you <br />
require. <br />
<br />
In going from Landscape to Portrait...you will lose a portion <br />
of the image on the left, right or both edges depending on <br />
how you set the Crop Tool.<br />
<br />
See the following screenshot. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://i48.tinypic.com/1zc2why.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Crop To Portrait</a><br />
<br />
This is a landscape 4:3 aspect ratio photo being cropped to<br />
portrait 4:3 aspect ratio. The selection frame can slide right <br />
or left but the dark area will be lost.<br />
<br />
This crop tool is in the freeware FastStone Image Viewer.<br />

    <title>Pen Display drivers seem to randomly stop working after recent update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pen Display drivers seem to randomly stop working after recent update</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the recent Windows 10 update had broken something. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing a new update, whenever I try to use my pen display my computer freezes up for a few seconds then breaks the pen pressure completely. I can only fix this by rebooting my computer, which I cannot constantly do every time I try to work on a
 project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my pen display, both pens, the cables, and even my computer to see what the problem could be beforehand. The only possible idea for what the issue could be is Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is a possible solution to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I use a Ugee 1910B Pen Display if that's important)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Please try these steps and check after each step. 
<br />
<br />1. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Pen Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt;Locate your Pen
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />3. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />4. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you submit this issue as a feedback to Windows team through Feedback Hub so that Microsoft knows about this and can patch this in subsequent patches.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+F
<br />Submit your feedback
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<h3> kaseye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSD on boot - data intact - no boot records&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I came into the office today to find my PC will not boot into Windows 10.&nbsp;<span>I get the error:</span></p>
<p><span>"The Boot Configuration Data file doesn't contain valid information for an operating system. File: \BCD Error code: 0xc0000098".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am able to get to the windows Automatic Repair options after a couple failed boots (takes forever to finally get there). The startup repair option did not work. I am able to use the command prompt but I cannot view
 the C: drive, i only have access to X:. I can use the diskpart utility and view the HDD, but there are no volumes listed when using the "list vol" command. The "bootrec.exe /scanos" and "bootrec.exe /rebuildBCD" commands do not identify any windows installations
 and the "bootrec.exe /fixboot" and "bootrec.exe /fixmbr" both return "a device attached to the system is not functioning".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was able to boot into a Live Ubuntu USB and browse the HDD. All the partitions and files are still there and intact. I backed up everything but I would like to avoid a fresh install of Windows!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any help would be appreciated -- I can only access the command prompt or a live linux USB! I cannot access c: (or any other drive letter) from the command prompt but all the data seems to be there still!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Additional:</strong>&nbsp;PC is being finicky&nbsp;about booting a windows 10 usb drive, which is why i am using a linux usb</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>when booting to the windows 10 usb via USB mode it immediately jumps to the Blue screen and reads "your pc/device needs to be repaired" followed by the error listed at the top of the post. no options to get to startup
 repair or command prompt or anything</span></li><li><span>when booting to the same usb via UEFI mode the windows dots spin and spin and never move on..</span></li></ul>

</p><p>Hi KaseyE, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Blue Screen error may be caused by an outdated driver, a recently installed application that causes conflict on the system, or due to missing updates. This can also occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. Improper
 shutting down of the computer or forcefully turning off your device might also cause a startup issue. In order to fix this issue, you may refer to the link provided below. This support link has been helpful to a lot of Community members who had the same issue
 and this may also be the solution that you are looking for. Click the link to begin your troubleshooting process.</p>

</p><p>I created the system about 2 weeks ago using PCmover(prof) to move all files from win 7 to win 8.1 on this new PC. All worked well, with no account issues.<br />
<br />
Around 9/2/2014 user marykb... lost her access and her account reverted to a TEMP account. I have tried removing her account and re-creating it but the maryk_000" entry in USERS will not go away and TEMP entries are accumulating. The new accounts created for
 her do not allow her for example to access the internet &nbsp;"Chrome", (SSL error). Internet Explorer works. The only thing she can remember doing Oddly was using "Ctl,Alt,Del" to assess logoff once. It appears some pointers were not cleaned up properly. Is there
 a workaround for this issue. </p>

            &nbsp;Hi Gary,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>This issue may occur if the current user's profile was accidentally deleted from the system or got corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>I suggest you to follow the Method below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:Delete the User Account Profile's SID Key</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>This <strong>Method </strong>contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base:322756 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a> )
<br />
How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</p>
<p>Follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're not signed in to Windows, click the power icon from the sign-in screen, hold Shift, and then click Restart.</li><li>After restart, click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Advance Options</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Startup Options&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;restart.</li><li>In Startup Options, press number "<strong>6</strong>" on the keyboard, to select "Safe Mode with Command Prompt".&nbsp;</li><li>In Command Prompt, type in "regedit" and navigate to following path: <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList.</li><li>In the left pane, click on one of the S-1-5..... folders (SID key) with the long number which should have
<strong>.bak </strong>at the end of it.</li><li>Right click on the SID key, from step&nbsp;7 with .bak at the end, and click on Delete</li><li>Click on Yes to confirm deletion.</li><li>Close regedit and restart computer.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you log on to the computer, the profile folder you are having problems with is re-created. If not, then try a
<strong>System Restore </strong>using a restore point dated before you got this error. If this still does not help, then you will need to create a new account and restore the user folder files to new User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: How to Restore your PC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're not signed in to Windows, click the power icon from the sign-in screen, hold Shift, and then click Restart.</li><li>After restart, click on Troubleshoot.</li><li>Select Advance Options.</li><li>Select System Restore.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> After you select "System Restore", computer will restart automatically, select User Account you want to restore and follow the instruction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

                    <p>I've tried several delete programs, nothing works. Every mpsigstub.exe I looked at was created 3/3/15 288kb didn't look at all of them. Over half the directories on my C drive have gibberish names like C:\ef96c24ec7ec6284a36f1c4815387421 and contain that

<p>This is a Win7 64bit. I have several others, but none are infested with multiple copies of mpsigstub.exe. I've run avast and malwarebytes so I don't think these are malware...unless one includes useless clutter created by Microsoft in the category of malware.</p>

<p>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/fix-delete-folder-need-permission-perform-action/<br />
Method 3, Try unlocker, a freeware program...I downloaded from filehippo... Install using advanced and deselect toolbars<br />
Then from windows explorer selecte the directory, grant admin permission if needed.<br />
Then select the file mpsigstub.exe in the directory, accessed unlocker in explorer context menu and ran it<br />
Had to grant unlocker admin each time it started. Then selected delete and it deleted&nbsp; mpsigstub.exe<br />
Then I deleted the empty subdirectory using standard delete from context menu. <br />
Rinse &amp; repeat 29 times and they are GONE!<br />
No replies needed..other than an apology from Microsoft for inflicting this mini-plague on my PC....Fat chance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 build 10586 version 1511. &nbsp;I cannot update to Build 14393 ( version 1607 I think) I've tried the following methods:</p>

<p>Mediacreation tool</p>
<p>Windows update assistant (100% downloaded but fails to install system reserved error)</p>

<p><span>I would like information about xbox repair; I have 2 broken slims, a 250gb one that broke ages ago due to a lightning strike and my recent 4gb one that's hard drive has failed on me. They are both out of warranty and I would
 like to pay the fee for Microsoft to fix one of them.The 250gb one seal has been broken as I have attempted myself to figure out what got broken during the strike using a multimeter only. Will Microsoft fix the better xbox that has the seal broken or should
 I send in the 4gb one as they will refuse to fix the 250gb one?</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, since you broke the seal to your 250GB model, you voided any warranty and repair opportunity. However, you're not completely out of luck. You can set up a repair for the 4GB model. When you receive it after repair, you can use the 250GB HDD
 from the other console in the 4GB model.</p>

<p>They will not repair a console that has been "tampered" with. &nbsp;Once they see the broken seal, they will deny the repair. &nbsp;You will have to send in the other one.</p>

            <div>Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
•&nbsp;Does this happen with any particular application?<br />
•&nbsp;Does this happen when the mouse pointer is still or when you are doing some work on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div><br />
Method 1:&nbsp; You may try to reduce the mouse pointer speed and check if that resolves the issue.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Control Panel.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Hardware and Sound<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Devices and Printer click on Mouse<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the Pointer Options tab <br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce the speed of the mouse pointer and check if the issue is resolved.</div>
<div><br />
Method 2: Also try changing the refresh rate of the monitor and check if that resolves the issue. To change the refresh rate</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Control Panel<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Appearance and Personalization<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Display<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Change display setting on the left pane<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Advance settings<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the Monitor Tab and change the refresh rate and check if the flickering of the mouse stops.<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 3:</div>
<div>Step 1:<br />
Check if you face the similar issue in safe mode, if not you can try putting your computer in a clean boot state in normal mode and check if it works:<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Step 2:<br />
Try following the KB article to perform Clean Boot:<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
Disclaimer: After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem follow Step 7 to reset the computer to start as usual.<br />

<br />
I have two working solutions. The first and better one ist to use System Restore to get to a point before the update. If this works you're ok. I had to try different points until I found a good working one.<br />
<br />
The second&nbsp;way as a temporary fix is to &nbsp;click the BT Stereo Audio entry in the device manager or if not present the Unknown Device, Properties, Driver, Update Driver, Search on this Computer, Use a List on this computer, Audio &amp; Video devices, and there the
 old driver not the new 4.x one.<br />
<br />
I am not sure of the wording above, it should be close but i do not have an english OS right now here.<br />
<br />
After that and on reboot it will ask you again for a driver just click Don't install a driver now and everything should work fine.<br />
<br />
The second method i a kludge because it will ask on reboots but it is just one click and better than nothing. That's why the system restore method is better. Of course don't install the Bluetooth Stereo Driver Update from Windows Update again until it gets
 fixed or the same problem will reappear.<br />
<br />
Greetings and good luck mine works again<br />

Thanks Overlord71,<br />
This worked for me.&nbsp; I found that under my "Sound, Video and game controllers" in the Device Manger had a failed driver icon next to my "Bluetooth Peripheral Device".&nbsp; I used your instructions to install a new driver (or old one) and was given a list of of
 2 choices... "Bluetooth Stereo Audio Version: 3.0.0.183 (7/10/2008)" and a "Bluetooth Stereo Audio Version: 5.0.11.0 (8/13/09)".&nbsp; I chose the Ver.3.0.0.183 and my BT headphones now work in Stereo again, and I no longer have the failed driver icon.&nbsp; I just
 need to make sure I dont try to do the new update again.&nbsp; Thanks a million!<br />

<h2>            Apple Magic Mouse</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recently given an apple Magic Mouse and i can't seem to find a way to get the scrolling feature to work. I'm currently running Microsoft 10 home in my PC. Is there a software i have to download in order to get the device working properly? or is it
 because it's an apple product, basically impossible to get it running in a PC?</p>

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users who were experiencing the same issue found out that reinstalling the Boot Camp driver for the mouse in Windows 10 worked for them. Do you have the latest Boot Camp drivers installed on your PC? You might need to get in touch with Apple support
 for assistance with downloading the appropriate drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance. </p>

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visiting the manufacturer's website is one of the options you have to get the driver compatible for your device. Since you've mentioned that you are not able to find the driver, getting in touch with the manufacturer will be the best option to verify the
 compatibility.</p>

<h3> stewdawg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Date and Time won&#39;t Sync</h2>
                    <p>So I have recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10,&nbsp; the issue I seem to be having is whenever I boot up my computer for the first time of the day it displays the Date and Time of when I shutdown from the night before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried to fix this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1). I have tried selecting many different time severs under the Internet Time Tab --&gt; Change Settings. If I manually sync my time with a server that doesn't time out it will update my date and time but I would have to do that every time I log onto my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2). Tried manually starting and stopping Windows Time services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3). I've even tried to setting up a scheduled task running the w32time.exe /resync&nbsp; for every time the computer starts with no luck either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit :</p>
<p>4). I have also tried running cmd as Administrator, net stopping the w32tm service, unregister, then register, then net start w32tm as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I would ask first before do things like creating a batch file or having to edit something in the registry.</p>

<p>Hello there and thank you for replying in good time.&nbsp; I have tried the suggestions in the link you have sent me without success.&nbsp; Unfortunately my issue remains.&nbsp; After&nbsp;posting my original question and turning off my computer earlier today, I received notification
 of your reply on my mobile device, booted up my computer to&nbsp;try the suggested fix and now replying to your post and&nbsp;my&nbsp;clock displays the time from when I posted my original question earlier today.&nbsp; For whatever reason my time will not update upon start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your effort, I'm hoping to come up with solution for I have two other friends with this very same issue.</p>

            Yes I have checked to see if the BIOS is counting date and time correctly.&nbsp; The Mainboard I am using is just over 1 year old, Asus Maximus VI Formula Republic of Gamers series.&nbsp; The date and time issue occurred right after doing the update to Windows 10,
 I realize that many times in computers we always think of what was the last thing we were doing prior to an issue occurring which can sometimes lead you astray from the solution, but this one has me scratching my head.&nbsp; Thanks again for your help, I will keep
 trying things to get a solution so any ideas are welcome.

            Hi Marek,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi Ruth
<br />
<br />PUP is a computer acronym for Potentially Unwanted Program and is a somewhat subjective term . . .
<br />
<br />There is no way to actually automatically find PUP's, they are generally installed alongside legitimate software
<br />
<br />The best method is to open Settings - Apps and look for any type of program that claims to make your PC Faster, Clean Your PC or Clean the Windows Registry and uninstall any you find
<br />
<br />If you are unsure about any program you find, please list then here and we can advise on that for you . .

<p>Hello Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted system components are one of the possible cause of this issue. For this, we highly recommend doing a clean installation to isolate if your concern is within your software. To do it, you can follow the steps under Using the tool to create installation
 media on this <em><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article.</a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Doing a clean installation will delete all of your files. It is still best to backup all your files before doing a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you post the DMP files (last 5 is sufficient) I will analyze them to see if they point in a particular direction. However the issue you are describing is definitely hardware related.<br />
<br />
<strong>We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the OneDrive
<br />
or other file </strong>sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading
<br />
the minidumps copy them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload <br />
them from there.<br />

<strong>3.</strong> Run the memory&nbsp;tests (see methods below).<br />

-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
</p>
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Right Click the&nbsp;Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - <br />
write down the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click <br />
- Driver's tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not
<br />
do anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />
DriverVerifier.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check both your and the spouse's computers and accounts.<br />
<br />
Do an&nbsp;extremely thorough check for malware and then change your email password.<br />
<br />
Be aware that it is possible for someone to send email that "appears" to be from your<br />
account but that actually isn't - called "Spoofing". Which means its "Possible" the emails<br />
were not actually from you at all, though they may have your contact list. Have someone<br />
that is receiving the emails to check the header to see where it is actually sent from and<br />
NOT just the reply to address.<br />

<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />

<h2>            Не удалось авторизовать способ оплаты.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Доброго времени суток всем !</p>
<p>Интересует вопрос: В способах оплаты у меня указана кредитная карта MasterCard, ежемесячная плата за услугу XBOX Live с неё оплачивается исправно в автоматическом режиме, но вот при покупке баллов выдает такое сообщение:</p>
<p><span>Не удалось авторизовать способ оплаты. Обратитесь к поставщику соответствующих услуг или измените способ оплаты.</span></p>
<p><span>Все действия я проводил как с приставки так и через PC через интернет, в банке мне сказали, что никакие запросы обоплате не приходят, но вот при изменений свойств метода оплаты исправно списываются 30 рублей.</span></p>
<p><span>Ранее примерно пол года назад я уже покупал баллы с помощью этой же привязанной карты. Не подскажете в чем может быть проблема ?</span></p>
<p><span>Заранее благодарю.</span></p>

<p>Время от времени оплата глючит и бывает вот такое. Сам сталкивался с данной проблемой - обычно с приставки оплата проходит раз так на 10. Но обычно с 1 раза.</p>

<p>Lexxnv, что-нибудь изменилось у тебя? Я тоже уже несколько дней безуспешно пытаюсь поинты купить, и с консоли, и с ПК, выдает ту же самую ошибку. Раньше оплата всегда проходила нормально. На форуме уже есть подобная тема, но там описание проблемы июнем датировано,
 я же в июле нормально покупал поинты по этой карте. При изменении способа оплаты также по 30р. списываются.</p>

<p>Здравствуйте! Присоединяюсь к Lexxnv. Столкнулся с такой проблемой буквально сегодня, хотя до этого недавно и неоднократно покупал баллы. Проблема сама должна со временем пройти или надо раз 20-50 попробывать? А потом все мои попытки разом не спишуться с
 моей кредитки?</p>

<p>В саппорт звоните, чем на кнопку по 10 раз жмакать. Дело в том, что если потом 10 раз с кредитки спишется, никто денег не вернёт. Там указано, что эта покупка не подлежит возврату.</p>

<p>Я бы еще посоветовал время от времени поглядывать вот в это окошко: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/ru-ru/xbox-360/get-started/home?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../home</a>, там в верхней &nbsp;строчке пишут,если в Лайве какая-то проблема существует. Там несколько дней висело предупреждение службы XBoxLive о &nbsp;некорректной работе некоторых сервисов, в том числе по покупке пойнтов и содержимого из магазина.
 Сейчас вроде все норм, но стоит, наверное немного подождать еще чуть-чуть.</p>

<p>Ребят, я сначала пытался зарегать карту на консоли но оказалось, что там в поле срока действия карты возможно выбрать только 2020 год, а у меня 2021, поэтому удалил способ оплаты на консоли полез, регать способ оплаты на ком, 2 раза снималась коммисия в
 размере 30р, но покупку так и не удалось сделать</p>

    <title>Question about Xbox Gamesharing and My Home Xbox on Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> topramenallday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Xbox Gamesharing and My Home Xbox on Xbox </h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have an pretty odd problem with my Xbox one while trying to gameshare. Basically, when i tried to set My Home Xbox on my friends account on my Xbox One, it gave me a message saying that it couldn't set the account on and activate my Home Xbox. The
 message just stated that I could only set one console as My home Xbox and you could only do it 3 times a year. According to my friend, he never game shared or gave his account to anybody so I should be able to set My home Xbox on his account as he never hit
 the 3 year limit. But I can't activiate it. I tried removing my account from My Home Xbox and just setting his but that didnt work and I also tried to redownload his account. My friend also said he didnt set the account he gave me to My Home Xbox on his Xbox.
 So I really don't know what to do. If it counts, I DID gameshare with another account back then and successfully set the other account to My Home Xbox and it worked just fine. But I don't understand why it won't let me set the account as My home Xbox. If anyone
 could help me out with this or have a solution i would greatly appreciate it! Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Bala,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are unable to clear TPM and get the error code: 0x80290304. This issue is likely to happen when you have options like "RESET of TPM from OS" or "OS Management of TPM" disabled in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to verify if you have tried the correct steps, enable "RESET of TPM from OS" and "OS Management of TPM" option under System BIOS -&gt;&nbsp;Security -&gt; TPM Embedded Security page. Once done, this should help clear the TPM from operating system.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model no. of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, I would suggest you to update the BIOS version to the latest definition from the manufacturer's website and then try the steps. Check if that helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Action Center Says my Firewall is Turned off When It is On.</h2>
                    I am using a current and compatible version of Norton.&nbsp; Is this action center message not updating correctly?&nbsp; Clicking Turn On does nothing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community forum!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.

</span></span></span><span>Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows 8 Comes with inbuilt firewall, So if you install Norton, Windows Firewall gets disabled automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>So I would recommend you to uninstall Norton, because it is not recommended to use more than one security program.</span></p>
<p><span>So you can use either use Norton or Windows firewall.</span></p>

 In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is

            <p>I installed Norton 360 and it works sometimes. Then sometimes action center says I don't have a virus program installed. Yet Norton runs. My fix is a work around until Microsoft and Norton get it fixed. It works 100% of the time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. go to Norton and disable it and the Norton firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Restart</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. go into action center and click the enable virus and select Norton if it asks</p>
<p>wait a few minute for it to register. This should work but sometimes I have to do it a few times, don't interrupt the restart just&nbsp;wait until the action center flag comes up. Interrupting &nbsp;the restart seems to mess up Norton registering with the action center,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it a communication problem between Norton and action center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I've been having a lot of problems with Norton. Sometimes it does not scan, click the button and nothing happens. Running the fix above seems to fix it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems seems to be occurring more often and I'm about ready to uninstall Norton and try something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps Rob in Albuquerque</p>
