    <title>Windows 10 to Windows 10 File Sharing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 to Windows 10 File Sharing</h2>
                    <p>I have been researching every forum, including Windows 10 blogs for an EASY TO COMPREHEND SOLUTION to my problem.&nbsp; First, here is my setup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Two PC's, Windows 10, updated to the Anniversary Level, just released recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an ETHERNET CABLE tying these two PC's together and I use MOUSE WITHOUT BORDERS with one Keyboard and one mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use TWO DIFFERENT WIFI feeds to access the internet (they are working fine).&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Verizon for data is the reason.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Set up a Home Group and have tried to make the password work and it will not accept it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to SHARE FILES between FILE EXPLORER going BOTH WAYS.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I use a trading program and need to easily copy the Program's Saved Workspace Data and the most seamless way I was able to do this was originally between two PC's, running Windows
 7.&nbsp; NO PROBLEMS THERE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am SEEING&nbsp; a FILE Sharing problem with this pop-up:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Windows cannot access \\____[PC NAME]-PC\Documents" when I click on NETWORK and the DOCUMENTS FOLDER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me find a STEP-BY-STEP process to put both Computers on the HOMEGROUP or WORKGROUP, how to remove old settings that may be stored in a windows folder, "windows\serviceprofiles\localservice\appdata\roaming\peernetworking"&nbsp; FOLDER...which I
 am reluctant to do until someone here says to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want to copy files from one PC to the other seamlessly, through the Network using FILE EXPLORER.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I do NOT see THIS PC listed under NETWORK, but only the OTHER PC is showing up in File Explorer and I am thinking this is related to
 HOMEGROUP issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled NETBIOS over TCP/IP [Under Advanced Networking settings, for my LOCAL AREA NETWORK under NETWORK SETTINGS clicking on this under TCP/IPv4----as someone mentioned in a windows 10 Forum.&nbsp;&nbsp; This did nothing for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, there have been postings to remove Homegroup (latent or carryover) settings tweaking the registry.&nbsp;&nbsp; This forum talks about remove the "idstore.sst" files in the file above.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also says to ENABLE TO AUTOMATICED SOME "services.msc" SETTINGS related
 to HOMEGROUP, including "Peer Network Grouping" and so on, all the way through to "Homegroup Provider."&nbsp;&nbsp; The forum suggest to make sure they are all TURNED ON TO AUTOMATIC.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know how to do this, as I have messed with the services.msc settings in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help related to this issue.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; I am surprised at the number of people who are having FILE SHARING ISSUES with Windows 10.&nbsp; It is NOT that easy to understand WHAT TO DO TO MAKE IT WORK at all.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to FIX THIS.</p>

How to set up and manage Windows 10 HomeGroup on a local network</a></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I have done all of this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wondering how safe it might be to remove the prior settings first by removing ANY prior homegroups that were present in my PC's prior to the Anniversary Update.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that update, sharing SUDDENLY was affected somehow.&nbsp;
 Microsoft SHOULD look into this, as I am one of likely THOUSANDS of users affected by changes that are hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp; My PC's will NOT work using every single step that the tutorials are offering me in these pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am now understanding that I need to remove files, hidden of course, and then re-establish a brand new homegroup, by first turning on one PC and then connecting the other and allowing that next PC to connect with a new Password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file:&nbsp;&nbsp; idstore.sset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a file that should be removed from a "Peernetworking folder."&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reluctant to do this until someone from the Community verifies this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can add a URL that shows this method to fix Homegroups.:</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business &#40;Mac&#41; - Share Powerpoint Presentation Only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the Windows version of Skype for Biz - you can share either your entire desktop or just an application such as Powerpoint:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-your-screen-in-Skype-for-Business-2d436dc9-d092-4ef1-83f1-dd9f7a7cd3fc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great feature for many reasons - but on the Mac version - you can only just present your desktop - it is the only option available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like a feature miss to me - the most important benefit for it is when I am doing a Video Conference and I am on a single monitor - if I share the desktop - it causes a picture in picture parallax effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing how to do this in the Mac version or did MSFT just not enable the same feature in the Mac version and any idea if they plan to enable it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply! I tried both solutions you described and neither worked. Windows Store Troubleshooter found no issues and I signed out, signed back in, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No</p>
<p>2. My admin acct</p>
<p>3. Yes, I can view the image attachments on gmail.com web mail site (just not in Windows Mail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else should I try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind this isn't happening with my main accounts, just this secondary email acct. I have 5 email accounts in Mail total, this is the only one giving me problems.</p>

            <p>I'm sure you have figured this out by now, but it is the size of the attachment that is one cause of this message being displayed. &nbsp;According to other articles there is not file size attachment limit in Windows 10 Mail. &nbsp;The filesize limit is set on the
 Exchange Server that handles you email and attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is reproducible on my machine by simply going to my gmail account, and emailing an attachment that is over 10 MB to my Microsoft Exchange account. &nbsp;The banner,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"We couldn't download one or more of
 the attachments. Please try again later." is displayed, and in the attachment area of the email viewer, the message, "Dowload Failed."</span></p>

<p>Hi PA</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay, I was allowing COMODO time to respond to my inquiry. My system is running XP, IE 8 and yes COMODO Time Machine is installed. My IE hesitates for up to 75 seconds before begining to load. I havew watched Task Manager and noticed the System
 Idle Process stays at 90-95% while the delay continues. I just don't know why the delay happens. COMODO has given me a new password but when I attempt to remove Time Machine the system rejects my login.</p>

<h2>            Games for Windows Live is getting silly to install.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Seriously. Right now, my situation is this: In order to play my game online, Grand Theft Auto IV, I require the latest version of GFWL. Nothing wrong here, right? There wouldn't if GFWL didn't require Windows Live Sign-In Assistant 6.5, which requires
 CRM 2011 Beta, which requires Outlook which is bundled with Office (and while there is a trial version available, for some reason it just refuses to install unto my comp. All of the other features install fine but Outlook 2010.) And now, because the software
 is only half-installed, my game doesn't even start anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is there such stupid and overstretched dependencies? I have to install a huge pile of software I will never ever use just so I can enjoy a product I have paid for.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there ANY WAY to bypass this so I can finally play?</strong></p>

            Do you have Windows Live Essentials 2011 installed? I only have the 'Live Mail' installed and I think the Live sign-in assistant is part of that package. I just downloaded and installed GFWL and it found everything. The only thing extra I have installed
 is the Windows Live Mail.

            Nope I don't, and I really do not want to install it. Why must it be necessary to install a whole bundle I won't ever use just to play a game I already have paid?

<p>It probably won't install because it is dependent on Live Mail and/or Messenger. It looks like the easiest solution is to install Live Mail from the Live Essentials 2011 package.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=59fbc955-a9cc-4fb1-84dc-db88e9882ed3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=59fbc955-a9cc-4fb1-84dc-db88e9882ed3</a></p>
<p>I don't see any other way to get the Sign-in Assistant required for GFWL. Installing Live Mail seems necessary, but it doesn't mean you have to use it.</p>

            Two things: I find it absolutely retarded you need software you won't even use to use your other apps now.<br />
<br />
Second: still says it's not a valid application, although looking at the required specifications I might know why: I have Windows XP SP3, and the required OS says it needs at least Vista.

<p>The first problem is that since there aren't that many game questions, all questions concerning game problems go to one 'Gaming' section regardless of your Operating System. Your question came to 'Gaming' through the Windows 7 Forum, so I thought you were
 using Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second problem is that almost everyone else using XP and GFWL is having this problem. Here is a whole page from a Google search for problems with GFWL:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=2&amp;oq=gfwl+xp&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=gfwl+xp+download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?aq=2&amp;oq=gfwl+xp&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=gfwl+xp+download</a></p>
<p>Hopefully someone at the GFWL forum will have found the solution for you. Sorry I couldn't be of any help.</p>

<h3> lawrenceholland1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ready to install.. dialog won&#39;t respond to clicking on the &#34;Install now&#34; button</h2>
                    <p>I have checked for updates to the classic version of Skype.&nbsp; After the initial download, when the "Ready to install..." dialog appears, the "Install now" button is unresponsive.&nbsp; The "Not now" button works and just exits the dialog, of course, without doing
 anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe as an associated or connected problem, my Skype status for my account when I look in the Skype app, is perpetually spinning.&nbsp; I can log in online so my credentials are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p>I had the same problem with spinning wheel and not being able to login. It persisted even after reinstalling the application. What helped to login again was signing out first, then reentering credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I also see the problem with not being able to upgrade. The installer downloaded the update and I get to see the dialog saying that the update is "Ready to install...", but clicking "Install now" does not do anything, and the only possibility is
 to close the dialog or click "Not now".</p>

<h2>            Dell Studio 1735&#58; DigitalPersona 6.2.1.309a does not detect Authentec AES2810 fingerprint reader</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded by Studio 1735 from Windows 7 Ultimate (with DigitalPersona 5.3) to Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>The driver for the Authentec AES2810 fingerprint reader <strong>is</strong> present in Device Manager (and the device works e.g. with Authentec TrueSuite Starter Edition).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed DigitalPersona 6.2.1.309a (from <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=575108," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

https://s3.amazonaws.com/flexnetconnect/dell/personal6.2.1.309/x86/setup.exe</a>), it runs fine... but says it cannot detect the fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing the Dell R207052 driver I had under Windows 7 doesn't help -- and Windows 8 upgrades the driver to the latest version anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clue?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to Uninstall and Reinstall AuthenTec DigitalPersona Drivers in the compatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps to install drivers in compatibility mode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to the AuthenTec manufacture website and try installing the latest version of drivers. If Windows 8 drivers are not available, then you may install Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Note: Download the latest drivers from the Manufacturer‚Äôs website and save it on to the Desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Press the <strong>‚ÄòWindows + W‚Äô</strong> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) Type <strong>compatibility</strong> in the search box and then press <strong>
enter</strong>.</p>
<p>c) Click ‚Äú<strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>‚Äù option from the list appeared in the left side.</p>
<p>d) Select the drivers and install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the link to install Fingerprint reader driver drivers.</p>

            <p>Well... thx for the response, but I have some doubts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the version of Digital Persona is listed on Dell's website as being Windows 8 compatible, and I didn't have to install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode</p>
<p>- all Authentec drivers found on Dell's website are much older than the one that automatically gets installed in Windows 8 (version 3.4.3.78 dated 2012-08-27), and IIRC I tried to install an older version from the Dell site but it got automatically replaced
 by that most recent version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could it be that some part of Windows 8 like the build-in biometric framework interferes with Digital Persona accessing the driver?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot find any downloadable drivers on Authentec's website.</p>

            Did you get this fixed? &nbsp;I have windows 8.1 with a DigitalPersona Fingerprint reader working fine. &nbsp;The driver the runs hardware is different from the software that interfaces with the user. &nbsp;Let me know and I will help you sort this out.

            <p>Nope, I never got this fixed. The Authentec fingerprint reader (DigitalPersona is the software that deals e.g. with associating fingerprints with websites, Authentec is the hardware / reader) works since I can use it to logon/unlock, but the DigitalPersona
 software keeps complaining that "no reader is detected."</p>

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
The only way to retrieve photos that have been deleted or written over is with third party file recovery software.&nbsp; Search the Internet for things like "file recovery" or "photo recovery".&nbsp; I used a program like this to recover my photos several years ago when
 my hard drive crashed.&nbsp; They are not cheap, but for most of us our photos are priceless, so I know how you feel.<br />

                    Hi, I have a problem with opening GFWL in a game and when I press the home button GFWL doesn't show up and I can't save my progress, and when I try to open GFWL marketplace I get this message: "A required Windows component is disabled on your machine."
 I've already tried many things, restoring my system, trying to make another user account, removing my password!! But none of them could help me!! I also searched the whole internet but I couldn't find anything!! I really need to fix this problem!! thanks!&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Try to install the latest Microsoft Visual Basic C++ run-time components and then try to install Quickbooks.</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to obtain the Visual C++ 6.0 run-time components</span></b><span>:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>Place the computer in clean boot state and then check whether it helps.</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot problem by performing clean boot in Windows 7:</b><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b>Note:</b> Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in
<b>Step 7</b>: to reset computer as usual.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If both the Methods did not help, then it would be better to post the same question in the Intuit community (Quickbooks forum).</span></p>

<p>

</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you using Internet Explorer? If so, which version of Internet Explorer are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like it is buffering the video, so it will take time. Once the buffering is done the video will not freeze.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Internet Explorer, follow the steps from the article.</span></p>

            <p>No, I hadn't made any changes. Everything is up to date as well. Acctually it started after I did a Factory Restore.&nbsp; I think I was using Internet Explorer in this video. It does the same thing on Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. I thought it was a Flash problem
 too, but it has done the same thing with a Silverlight video as well (Netflix). It will freeze when running a Power pPoint too sometimes. It just doesn't make the buzzing sound. I have done a few things to try and fix this. I've reset the RAM, I've used a
 registry clean up as well. I'm not really sure what to do next. </p>

<p>I just reinstalled GTAIV today, but when i tried to log into my gfwl account, it told me that the key had exceeded maximum uses. Why do I even need to put the key in again if I have played it with that account before? What I would really like to know is
 how to get my key extended/renewed so I can play what I payed for.</p>

<p><span>This can help with some (but not all) programs: </span></p>
<p><span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p><span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p><span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

            No need to replace your printer: the Vista Printer Drivers work perfectly...despite what Dell says...but you MUST uninstall existing printer &amp; driver BEFORE installing new printer driver&nbsp;or it won't work. I've answered this question in another thread (<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/ab2cec8f-b267-4654-9f5f-9e9a48eac1c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/ab2cec8f-b267-4654-9f5f-9e9a48eac1c0</a>)
 but have also included my answer below:<br />
<br />
<p>You can also get the Dell 720 printer to work in Windows 7&nbsp;using the Vista Drivers but MUST use the proper driver 32 bit or 64 bit for your version of Windows 7. This might be a alternative for some users who's&nbsp;computers don't support XP compatability mode
 in Windows 7.</p>
<p>The 64 bit Vista Driver (R149373.exe)&nbsp;is NOT on the Dell 720 Drivers &amp; Download page but is available on the Dell website at:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://support.us.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;releaseid=R149373&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;libid=0&amp;typeid=-1&amp;dateid=-1&amp;formatid=-1&amp;fileid=198392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.us.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;releaseid=R149373&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;libid=0&amp;typeid=-1&amp;dateid=-1&amp;formatid=-1&amp;fileid=198392</span></a><br />
<br />
For more info you can&nbsp;see the following thread:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/08c2fbdf-bf6d-4562-b272-bcbdd6e8c641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/08c2fbdf-bf6d-4562-b272-bcbdd6e8c641</span></a><br />
<br />
Folks a reminder: Uninstall existing printer &amp; driver BEFORE installing new printer driver‚Ä¶even from failed installation attempts or new printer driver install attempt may fail. This was critical for Vista OS and I suspect Windows 7‚Ä¶also install correct driver
 32 bit or 64 bit.</p>

<p>All we can know for sure from the little you've written is that Windows is broken and won't start. This could be caused by malware infection, bad drivers, failing hardware, etc. There is no way to know from here. You would need to give some more information
 about your computer, the answer to The First Question, etc. for us to narrow down the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?</p>

            Hi OlgaMalik,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />From the existing contact, it is not possible to remove only phone number if this was part of contact's profile. If you had created a contact on your own, then you can do this.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a custom image, use the <b>Recimg.exe</b> command-line tool that is included in Windows 8.1.&nbsp;To do this, follow these steps:
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search. (If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">b. Enter Command prompt in the Search box.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">c. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command Prompt, and then tap or click Run as administrator.</font></span></p>
<p>d. In the elevated command prompt, copy and paste the commands below one at a time, and press Enter after each one.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you like, you can subsititute the C drive letter in the command below for the drive letter of the location that you would like to keep the CustomRefresh.wim recovery image file at instead.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>&nbsp;mkdir C:\RefreshImage<br />
&nbsp;<br />
recimg -CreateImage C:\RefreshImage</strong></p>
<p><br />
<br />
e. When finished, this new custom recovery image of your current Windows 8.1 setup will now be set (registered) as the current active recovery image used whenever you refresh Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It may take a bit to finish creating your custom recovery image. At the Writing image line the
</p>
<p>progress stays at 1% for a bit and then increases slowly until finished at 100%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer to this article. </p>
