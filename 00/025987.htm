<h2>            Display &#39;0&#39; in results of a query</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to display '0' instead of returning nothing in the following query:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT [October 834C Files Combined].File_Date, Count([October 834C Files Combined].File_Date) AS [834 Future Adds]<br />

GROUP BY [October 834C Files Combined].File_Date<br />
ORDER BY [October 834C Files Combined].File_Date;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should be getting 5 records as there are 5 [File_Date] fields that I'm grouping on.&nbsp; Currently, I am returning no results at all.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to send the Email in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I opened an Outlook.com account but cannot send or receive emails in Mail.&nbsp; I have found outgoing&nbsp;drafts in the Outbox, but cannot send them.&nbsp; If I check for test incoming emails, I just get the syncing image.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I had an error message of ' <span>We weren't able to send this message, so we've put it in your Drafts folder. Before you try sending it again, you can check to see if the address is correct and that no attachments are too large.'&nbsp;
</span>The address was correct and there were no attachments.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The version is 17.6769.40791.0 in Windows 10.&nbsp; I don't get any error messages, but the outgoing test messages&nbsp;are sitting in the Outbox, and there is no option to send from there.&nbsp; When I checked to make sure that all the updates had been done I got the

    <title>Can we get a smart watch that everyone needs&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericccccccc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can we get  a smart watch that everyone needs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There are many different types of smart watch on the market. The problem is, we don't really need them. They cannot change our life, and most of us don't need to record our heart rate / blood pressure / location all the time! For most of the Apps, mobile
 phone is a much better choice than the tiny "smart watch".<br />
<br />
However, there are some features that everyone needs, are perfect for smart watch.<br />
<br />
All current smart watches are developed in wrong direction. Watch is very small, but most vendors want to copy the features from smart phone to it! This attempt is doomed to fail from the very beginning.<br />
<br />
From my point of view, a smart watch everyone needs is a simple one with the features below. No fancy appearance, and it is not going to compete with smart phone.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Identity verification.</strong><br />
<br />
I don't want to carry keys, security passes, membership cards, discount cards, library card, drive license, credit cards, transportation card, etc. And, I even don't want to carry mobile phone everywhere. Smart watch is a perfect device for identity verification:
 light, handy, not likely to left in car / office / home / hotel, or get stolen. When working with fingerprint scanning, it's much more secure against hacker's attack or robber or thief.<br />
<br />
At checkout desk of supermarket, no need to take credit card / cash / smart phone out of pocket any more, just raise your hand, put your finger on the watch, "Beep", done.<br />
<br />
Do we still need wallet? I doubt it.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Receive ‚ÄúCheck Code‚Äù</strong><br />
<br />
How many passwords do we need to memorize? How complicated each one need to protect you to resist attacks? With the help of this watch, all online system can turn into "passwordless". Want to log on email system? Please enter your email address, then click
 "submit" button, wait for a few seconds later, enter the "Check Code" just received on watch, then click "submit" again, done.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Receive notification</strong><br />
<br />
For any important action online, such as online payment, no matter it's through credit card or PayPal, or just getting the salary of last week, we can get notification in almost real time.<br />
<br />
So, if anything goes wrong, we can respond in short time.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Long lasting battery</strong><br />
<br />
We don't need to keep the watch running all the time. It should be "wake up" instantly when making payment, and then go to sleep again. So, we may only need to run it for a few minutes a day, which means, it can last for months in one battery charge!<br />
<br />
When the battery needs recharge, we should get notification on the watch.<br />
<br />
So, the OS is completely different from any existing OS.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Remote control / No keyboard.</strong><br />
<br />
We should not be able to enter any text on the watch. So, all configuration is done through computer or smart phone, remotely. That's one of the major differences between Watch and Phone.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Tough</strong><br />
<br />
Dust proof, water proof, shock proof, and works well in extreme temperature.<br />
<br />
<strong>7. Enclosed environment</strong><br />
<br />
This watch is critical to user's daily life, so, security gets highest priority. To minimize risk, it should not allow any third-party software.<br />
<br />
<strong>8. Date / Clock</strong><br />
<br />
Only provide most basic information.<br />
<br />
<strong>9. GPS track (optional)</strong><br />
<br />
No map needed, but it's nice to know that we can always get help, anywhere, anytime.<br />
<br />
<strong>10. Privacy</strong><br />
<br />
OK, this is the inevitable drawback of this watch. But, as it doesn't collect information more than current mobiles, I assume it's fine.<br />
<br />
Currently, Android and iPhone can do these job already, but "watch" is much more elegant, and safer. &nbsp;Actually this watch can improve the security of all mobiles, a lot!<br />
<br />
To live without smart phone is all right. To live without this smart watch, it will be miserable.<br />

 resizing a cell on that page will change something and the border will show up. This time it won't. Does anyone know why this happens? Below is a screen shot of what I am working on. Row 39.10 has had the border changed but it won't show. And I only need the
 bottom border to be bolder.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b66574d-96c0-418c-bcfa-cf12d6f98109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b66574d-96c0-418c-bcfa-cf12d6f98109" /></a>

<h2>            VLookup not working with multiple tabs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am trying to make an invoice in tab 1 and client list in tab 2 in Excel.<br />
I made a drop down list to select the customer, and when the customer is selected I want to add VLookups to add the addres and other details below.<br />
<br />
Tab 1 named 'Factuur', Tab 2 named 'Klantensheet 2'</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Tab 1: 'Factuur'</strong></p>
<p>A6 is a drop down to select from tab 2 the client name (B2:B6) --&gt; This is working!<br />
<br />
A7: Vlookup formula&nbsp;<br />
=VLOOKUP(A6;Klantensheet!A1:E6;Klantensheet!C:C;FALSE) <br />
This is not working!<br />
<br />
--&gt; In A7 I want to add the adress from 'tab 2: Klantensheet' which I saved as 'Table1' and 'Klanten' in name manager option Excel.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Could anyone help me and advice why the lookup is not working?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I can not add screenshots or the excel file.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Your comment: <em>Tab 2 named 'Klantensheet 2'</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the formula you only have Klantensheet Left out the space and 2 and the single quotes around 'Klantensheet 2'</p>
<p>
</p><p>A1:E6 should be&nbsp;an absolute reference with the $ signs like the following&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$A$1:$E$6</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third parameter (or argument) should be the number of the column in the table array not column CC. I assume should be 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you formula should be like the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>=VLOOKUP(A6;'Klantensheet 2'!$A$1:$E$6;3;FALSE)</p>

<p>Hello, thank you for helping!<br />
<br />
I am sorry the name of tab 2 is: Klantensheet (so not Klantensheet 2 as I mentioned before).<br />
<br />
When I change the formula into:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
=VLOOKUP(A6;'Klantensheet'!$A$1:$E$6;3;FALSE)<br />
<br />
It is still not working... Do you know what could be the reason?<br />
How does&nbsp;$ work? Is that the same for EU keyboard/excel? --&gt; could this be the reason?<br />
Also without&nbsp;$ the formula is not working..<br />
<br />
oh maybe it is because of the 3 in the formula: I need column 3, but also in the second sheet: 'Klantensheet'.<br />
<br />
So I also tried:&nbsp;=VLOOKUP(A6;'Klantensheet'!$A$1:$E$6;'Klantensheet'!3;FALSE)</p>
<p>But it also not working...<br />

<p>If there are no spaces in the worksheet name then the single quotes around the sheet name not required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=VLOOKUP(A6;Klantensheet!$A$1:$E$6;3;FALSE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell me what occurs when you use the formula. Is it telling you there is an error in the formula or just not finding the value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have assumed that in your region you use a semi colon delimiter between the arguments in the formula and not a comma as is used in other areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The value being looked up (A6 value) must be in the first column of the range Klantensheet!$A$1:$E$6</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3 indicates to return the value in the 3rd column of the range Klantensheet!$A$1:$E$6. You do not use the sheet name with the 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dollar signs make the range absolute. ie. if you copy the formula down to the next row then the lookup table range will remain as $A$1:$E$6. If you don't use the $ signs then if you copy the formula to the next row then the lookup table will become A2:E7
 and then the following row A3:E8 and so on and&nbsp;it is not looking in the correct range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have said <em>"Unfortunately I can not add screenshots or the excel file."</em> Is that because of sensitive data or you don't know how? If because of sensitive data then make a copy to another worksheet and use dummy data and upload screen shots of
 the sheet with the formula and the lookup table.</p>

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/#a</a> you will see the only way to access office on an iPad is through the Safari browser. I was just looking for the same answer and found it just after I read your post. Good luck in your studies! (That is, unless

<h2>            Win 10 build 10061 unusable many errors...</h2>
                    <p>After updating to build 10061 I now have numerous issues, including printer no longer will work can not communicate with OS, Notepad app will not open, flash freezes, JPG&nbsp;images will open in preview says they are corrupt but will open on everything else
 when moved to flash drive, there's more but I can't recall all the others right at present. Its too annoying to use Win10 right now it needs a lot of work still and this build is really unusable.</p>

 even in test mode but the driver just will not install any longer.&nbsp; I get this error: "Function address 0xfddc4fdd protection fault exception code 0x0000005" Driver is Lexmark X2400 series x64 Win 7

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that when I installed Office 2016 Pro it immediately installed the full package with all the apps including the ones that I don't need (OneNote, Publisher, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't there a way to select during the installation which apps you want to install and which apps you don't? I remember Office 2013 did give you that option.</p>

            <p>Office 2016 Pro is a "click to run" installation.&nbsp; It is an all-or-nothing installer.&nbsp; To get the "customize" installation you need a "traditional' MSI installer.&nbsp; MS has moved almost completely away from MSI installations. This is a step back to the dark
 ages of "green screen", aka Mainframe, computing.&nbsp; Central IT, MS in this case, is in total control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The example the PGM554 captured and showed is explicitly for Office 2016 Professional Plus.&nbsp; In 2013 it was the only remaining MSI installer I was aware of.&nbsp; It appears to be that way again in 2016.&nbsp; I have not been able to find that installer in the place
 I got it from formerly, technet evaluation center.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping PGM554 has a link we can use that he will post here &lt;hint hint .... grin&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The instructions that BRADM posted are intended for corporate installations. But it may be possible for consumers to use the technique also ... Here are some parallel instructions for using the deployment tool to create a customized installation:</p>

<p>The info PGM554 provided was explicitly for Office 2013, *NOT* 2016. &nbsp;There is no MSI installer for 2016 and according to MS they will not be providing one as 2016 only comes as C2R (as is evidenced by the MSDN ISO). Maybe they release a MSI with the VL
 release on the 1st but they've explicitly said that won't be the case (mind you, they regularly contradict themselves).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions I gave should work with any number of types of installs - though I've got no intention of testing it, the&nbsp;c2rfireflydata.xml contains a list of possible product ID values and I know the method I showed above will will with a number of them
 (the various Pro and Pro plus versions and I've heard it will also work with the Home installs but I can't confirm.). &nbsp;The instructions at askvg won't work for an extracted ISO of 2016 (well, they didn't for me).</p>

<p>
</p><p>From past experience ,some versions of office would behave differently depending upon the sku when it came to things like administrative installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a couple of folks I've worked with in the past that are MVP's ,maybe they can kick this up stairs and see what's up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing MS,I can't say this would be completely out of character by complicating the install process beyond belief.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Yogendra,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, could you provide the following information?</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you sign in to OWA inbox successfully if you ignore this warning? </li><li>Besides <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a>, do you meet the same issue when you sign in to the
<a href="https://portal.office.com/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Portal</a> with your account?
</li><li>I noticed the issue also occurs to your colleagues. Please contact the administrator to check if his/her account works fine. If yes, confirm with the administrator if he/she did some changes to your account.
</li><li>Does the issue occur to other browsers? </li><li>&nbsp;A screenshot about ‚ÄúSecurity warning ". </li></ol>

<p>Hi Yogendra,</p>
<p>According to your description, your Office 365 account is working fine. The root cause is related to the IE browser. Since our forum mainly focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services, to ensure you receive the professionally assistance, it‚Äôs recommended
 you post in our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/home?category=internetexplorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IE forum</a> for dedicate assistance.</p>
<p>Before doing this, I suggest you try to clear the IE browser‚Äôs cache and cookies to check if the issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

                    <p>I was using Publisher 2000 yesterday when the side menu bar disappeared and I have tried everything that I can think of to get it back with no luck.<br />
<br />
Have you any ideas on how I can get it back.<br />

            <p>Perhaps you just moved it to the top below the other menus? If you accidently moved it you might not spot it initially. Look for the Arrow icon, then the A or the text frame icon, then the Table frame icon, then the word art icon etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to move it back to the side of the page you can mouseover the extreme left of that toolbar until you see the foursided arrow, left click and drag straight down. It is a little finicky so you might have to try it a couple times but that is how
 you move the toolbars from the top to the side.</p>

            <p>I wish I had a better answer but would suggest that you keep poking around near the top left of the page looking for a way to drag the object toolbar back into view.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at the left of the horizontal toolbars you will see a vertical 'bar' or the 'move handle' that if you left click and grab you can drag and move the toolbar. Try moving those to the right and see if you can find another 'move handle' that might
 be attached to the object toolbar that dissapeared. You have apparently moved and docked that toolbar somewhere else on the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of a reinstall, try a Help &gt; Detect and repair.</p>

    <title>ScanPst for Outlook 2013 does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drj72  say:</h3>
<h2>            ScanPst for Outlook 2013 does not work</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with the SCANPST program. &nbsp;A friend of mine, who has Outlook 2013, recently encountered a problem with Outlook. &nbsp;It would crash unexpectedly every now and then. &nbsp;Especially when she is composing an email. &nbsp;After checking the usual suspects
 (harddrive, virus, malware, etc.), I ran SCANPST on her outlook file. &nbsp;It reported several errors. &nbsp;So I clicked "Repair". &nbsp;A second scan also reported errors and subsequent scan/repair cycles do not seem to fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up creating a new PST file and copied over all of her emails/contacts from her old PST file to the new one. &nbsp;I then ran SCANPST and it again reported errors. &nbsp;I clicked "Repair" and ran another scan and it continued to report errors. &nbsp;Subsequent
 scan/repair cycles do not seem to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a whim, I created a new PST file and ran SCANPST on it, and it reported errors. &nbsp;This is a completely new PST file with no emails, nothing, and the SCANPST tool still reported errors. &nbsp;What's going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the new PST file I created in the second step above, even with the errors reported by SCANPST, seems to have fixed her problem with Outlook crashing ... at least I hope it does. &nbsp;I also trimmed the size of her inbox (she had over 1,000 emails in her
 Inbox) and setup up auto archiving to keep the size down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight into what's wrong with the SCANPST tool? &nbsp;Any suggestions I should try with regards to her Outlook crashing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>By your tests on the old PST and creation of the new PST file, which seems to have resolved the issue, it is evident that the old

What do you mean by rebuild my system? Did you format your computer or change the hard drive/mother board?
<br />
<br />
Usually, it is not required to de-activate the Office installation if </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">you had formatted the computer. However, if you have changed the hard drive/mother board, you need
 to de-activate it before re-installing it.<br />

</p><p>Win 8.1 was acting up...pgms locking the system, games locking the system..etc. so I did a refresh. Now I need to reinstall Office components...no HD was formatted and no MoBo was changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now if I do a re-install, I'll using my last Office 'credit' of the 5 I have. Is that true or will it recognize that Office was installed on this machine before and I'll get my last 1 install of Office 356 back.</p>

    <title>Is there any way to view&#47;open&#47;preview an HTML file that you - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ravenant211  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there any way to view&#47;open&#47;preview an HTML file that you created yourself in Outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    I would be very grateful if someone could help me out. I have created a custom HTML newsletter for a company and I need to be able to preview how it looks in Outlook 2010. Because of the special requirements and formatting of Outlook 2007/2010 I need to
 make several adjustments to the coding to ensure it's compatible with Outlook.<br />
<br />
The newsletter was created with Dreamweaver and works in all other mail clients but it's not quite right in Outlook 2007/2010. I really need a way to preview the email in Outlook quickly and often as I adjust, but I can't find any way to do this. I will take
 any solution that allows me to preview the email. Whether it's a way to open a local HTML file from my hard drive, create a new email message that actually displays a preview of the code that I enter, or a way that I can "email" Outlook the HTML file from
 my computer. I have been looking for over an hour online and can't find any information one way or the other to do this in Outlook 2010, the information is always for older versions of Outlook that don't appear to be valid options anymore.<br />
<br />
The only method I have right now is to send it through my newsletter client, but that involves having to wait for it to go through it's compiling process and then after it sends out the test email, I have to wait several minutes to receive the e-mail. When
 you're adjusting several small things back and forth, this process wastes a great deal of time with unnecessary steps. As Outlook is the ONLY email client that I need to address these issues in, I really need a way to preview quickly in Outlook specifically.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance for any help that you can provide!<br />

            <p>Unfortunately Outlook is only an email client program and not an HTML editor. You cannot open HTML file in Outlook email and preview it as you enter the code.</p>

<p>The best suggestion as you have mentioned is to email the HTML file and then preview it in Outlook.</p>

            Thanks Girish,<br />
<br />
I understand it's not a HTML editor. I was just hoping that there was a convenient way to preview HTML files using the Outlook HTML rendering engine, since it differs so dramatically from everyone else. Such things used to be possible in Outlook 2003 and before
 quite easily, though I know they were using IE instead of Word.<br />
<br />
Could you tell me if there is a valid switch to open HTML files with the Outlook.exe? I see several file types on the Outlook help site that have specific switches, but was wondering if there was a switch that will work for HTML files as well? I am assuming
 that since Outlook can view HTML emails that there should be some way to access this functionality without it having to come from an e-mail.
<br />
<br />
If not is there a way to "email" Outlook from your local computer without having to use another mail client? Like a script or something I can use? I really need a method that is faster than sending an e-mail out through the email client chain. It's already
 wasted hours in my work flow by having to wait on the e-mail to show up, all the worse because Outlook is the only mail client that uses such non standard, bizarre methods to render an HTML email.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance!<br />

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>I noticed you posted the question in the Adobe forums as well. I did not see any real solutions there as I was thinking it would have to be something done in Dreamweaver. I use that product but know of no way to do what you are asking other than emailing
 it to yourself.</p>
<p>There is not anything within Outlook that I am aware of that will allow you to "preview" html like you would in a browser.</p>
<p>If there is a way to do this, I have been unable to find anything related online.</p>
<p>Sorry about that...</p>

            Hi Tony,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the confirmation! Yeah, I have run in circles and tried to think outside the box, but no luck from anywhere. Evidently there was a method to be able to make Outlook 2007 your web browser, but the Outlook 2010 EXE file will not recognize HTML files
 as a valid target to open so even that idea is a no go.<br />
<br />
It's a shame, when I got into starting to make these HTML newsletters for a client and realized that Microsoft had decided to go a route that totally ignored all web standards, I thought they would at least give developers a method to be able to check how their
 work would turn out in the software... especially considering Microsoft made a big deal about how they were listening to developers concerns after the HTML nightmare began with Outlook 2007! ;)<br />
<br />
It looks like though that they have slowly just kind of kicked developers to the curve and said we don't really care. I don't always agree with using HTML email as a way to communicate with potential and existing customers, but, what your client wants your
 client gets! Especially considering the steady improvements in end user bandwidth, if anything, I have seen more and more HTML rich email coming my way from all sources. It's a valid if not ideally secure method to communicate with consumers and I am pretty
 frustrated about&nbsp; Microsoft's reasoning and disregard for developers in this ( I have read their response about making HTML email available to end users in a easy to access way&nbsp; and it being more secure etc, but that is still not a good reason. They could
 have always taken the extra time to make Word more compliant in how it interprets it's HTML formatting instead of an extremely old, dead, and depreciated VML format) !<br />
<br />
... Sorry about the mini rant :) I'm just really irritated. Every other mail client is handling my content fine, but because I was unaware of the Outlook 07/10 shortcomings, I found out it broke when my client got back to me that it was breaking in Outlook
 and was not very happy about it because I said it was ready to go. I accept partial blame, I should have done more research about the specific challenges before attempting to create the email. I never would have though in a million years though that Outlook
 would have taken such huge steps backward compared to other clients! Especially since Microsoft has been making really good strides on making IE so much more compliant with standards. Now I have a complicated HTML newsletter that is giving me fits and that
 I have to deal with/resolve because my client approved and likes the design.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I hate Microsoft or anything, but please, PLEASE&nbsp; Microsoft; if anyone from the company ever checks these forums, in the next version please throw developers a bone?! Anything to make it bearable to deal with, even just an updated thorough validator
 plug in would be something (the current one is sooo old and said my email passed even though it broke like crazy)! A way to preview HTML emails would be ok as an alternative as well, or best yet, update the HTML engine in Word to be a little more compliant
 and many headaches would go away! I know I am just one and have no reason to expect Microsot to listen or care about what I have to say, but still, I was taught you don't have because you don't ask ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks again Tony for taking the time to respond and for being through about investigating&nbsp; the issue, it is appreciated! I just wish you had found a better answer than I did lol!<br />

I was required to enter in a time for the event. An ALL DAY option would be helpful. Also, when I entered the times,<br />
I was suddenly brought back to today's date. I had to go to the future month, enter in the times first, then select the day<br />
of the month, in order to remain on that date. Also, a funtion to repeat calendar events annually, 3rd Saturday of each<br />
month etc. would enhance the feature as well.

<h2>            Microsoft Account - Verification Methods</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I have the Microsoft Authenticator mobile application installed to verify my logins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am changing my smartphone to a standard handset without Internet capabilities as I don't really use it on my smartphone at present, I use my laptop or desktop more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I (or is it possible) to change the way I verify my account so that I receive a code via text message to my phone, rather than receive a notification from the Authenticator application or having to enter the code from the Authenticator application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did use the chat which didn't help whatsoever. I turned off two-factor authentication, and turned it back on, after being told that this will allow me to reconfigure the verification method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi to change how you authenticate you can log into <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/security</a> you'll need the authenticator app to get in to change.
<br />To remove the app from a device using a personal Microsoft account. Go to the two-step verification area of your Account Security page and choose to turn off verification for your old device. 
<br />Hope this helps

<p>You should be able to add the phone to the account and then have more than one way to request a code. That's what I do. I can use the authenticator or request an SMS text. The choice for which method I want always appears on the page where I enter the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that SMS text is NOT a secure way to request authentication.</p>

<p>Let's get this started. I got unlimited data and I gonna use it.</p>
<p>Goals to find a way to&nbsp;tethering a Nokia phone via USB and BLUETOOTH using Linux.</p>
<p>For me I use a different Network Manager (WICD) and you may be using KDE or Gnome or Xfce so we gotta understand this won't be a clear or simple discussion. Help in anyway you can make it simple and clear.</p>

<p>USB is easier than bluetooth. The phone, when connected in PC Suite mode, behaves like a bog standard cdc_acm modem for which drivers are built into the linux kernel. On more user-friendly distros like Ubunto et al. it should be detected without you needing
 to do anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For less user-friendly distros I wrote this short guide: <a href="http://linux.sgms-centre.com/nokiafaq/mobile_broadband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://linux.sgms-centre.com/nokiafaq/mobile_broadband/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that "unlimited" internet on mobile phone contracts often excludes tethering and only allows internet use actually on the phone. And yes, they can tell the difference between the two.</p>
