    <title>Nokia 701&#58; My Personal Misery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 701&#58; My Personal Misery</h2>
                    I've had this phone for less than a week and I hate it with a vengence.<br />
<br />
Apart from a fault with the backlight not turning off after the "Time-out" period, the screen is just SO hyper sensitive. The SLIGHTEST brush - even breathing - on the screen will launch an app, a link on a web page etc. This was an upgrade from my E52 and
 what a disaster - the sensitivity of the screen just makes it unuseable. I hate Steve Jobs (RIP) for inflicting touch screens on humanity, and did Nokia have to TOTALLY abandon the candy bar form factor in a smart phone?<br />
<br />
To compound my misery, I downloaded 2-3 apps from the Nokia Store on Saturday morning and when I came to restart my phone later that evening it wouldn't power up (no such problems beforehand). It would get so far then just switch itself off, so like a good
 boy I took out the battery for a while before doing the 8-second power button press. Tried this 3-4 times and....nothing. Needless to say I had to resort to the 3-finger hard reset so now no Maps, Quickoffice, pdf, Nokia Store etc etc.<br />
<br />
So now I'm going to re-house my E52 like new and have a phone that does exactly what it's meant to do - work.

<p><span>Or, if you start Windows without logging in through a User Account (in other words Windows boots straight to the Desktop)
 then logging out and back in again will probably resolve this. When this occurs it means MSE notification/startup icon is losing the ‚Äústartup battle‚Äù among various programs.&nbsp; See if you can disable some of your startup items that aren't needed.</span></p>

    <title>Signature logos are received as attachment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j e r o n y m u s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signature logos are received as attachment</h2>
                    Whenever someone (from Mac or PC) sends me an email with a company logo in their signature it is included as attachment.<br />
<br />
This makes it a lot harder if you are looking for an attachment like text or images I need for my work because almost every email has got an attachment (paperclip symbol).<br />
<br />
In Outlook on a PC signature logos aren't delivered as attachments. So why does it work like this on a Mac?<br />
<br />
Also, I find the way Entourage handled attachments way more elegant. I really liked the list view of attachments with remove/open buttons next to it and I really can't imagine. This also was much easier to select one, more or all attachments.<br />

            When the logo image is included in the sig it will show as attachment unless they use a link to the image hosted online.<br />
<br />
Since most users don't take the time to host image online, you get the attachment in Outlook Mac. I totally agree that it makes seeing real attachments very limited.<br />
<br />
Even inline images&nbsp; are shown as attachments.<br />
<br />
Send your feedback, the more reports they get the higher it gets on the list to be fixed.<br />

    <title>Changed Alias Hotmail Acct Gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurenglaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed Alias Hotmail Acct Gone</h2>
                    <p>In an attempt to separate a personal Hotmail account from a work Office 365 account, we changed the alias from Hotmail to the work email address. Now the Hotmail account has disappeared. Microsoft was contacted, they advised us to create a new Microsoft
 account using the Hotmail address, which cannot be done. When we attempted to create a new account using the Hotmail address an error message appeared stating the account is already in use, however, when attempting to log into the Hotmail account via login.live.com,
 the error message states the account doesn't exist.&nbsp; We sent emails to the Hotmail account and they were kicked back as non-deliverable due to the Hotmail account not existing. This email has been active and used for 20 yrs... we NEED it back and cannot seem
 to find any answers either online or through Microsoft telephone/chat support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can changing an alias in an Office 365 account completely delete a Hotmail account?</p>
<p>How do we recover the Hotmail account?</p>

<p>Hi Laurenglaw,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your feeling and sorry any inconvenience caused by this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, even the Office 365 account and Hotmail account belong to Microsoft, they are totally two different products and provide different services. They won't affect each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About how to recover your Microsoft account, you can check if the article below work for you:</p>

            <p><span>Hi TMBroach,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Different from the traditional Windows Installer-based (MSI) method, the Office suite from Office 365 for Business subscriptions are Click-to-Run installation. We cannot
 choose the installation location for Click-to-Run for Office 365 products. Click-to-Run products are installed only on the system drive, which is typically C. To get more information, see
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219420.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Overview of Click-to-Run for Office 365 setup architecture</a>. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The installation on tables, mobile phones are also different from the method mentioned above. Normally, we can download them for separate app according to different Operating
 System. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the Click-to-Run installation, if you don‚Äôt want to install all products in the Office suite, we can use Office Deployment Tool to configure a custom installation.
 We can use the Exclude app syntax to exclude the applications which we don‚Äôt want to install. To learn more, see the articles below:</span></p>

            Hi Hector, I'm an independent adviser and will try to help.
<br />
<br />You don't say what you are exporting to, that could make a difference. The long text datatype in Access is not compatible with all other programs. So it may not be supported in the format you are exporting to.

            Hi Hector. For a PDF, you are better off creating a report  and printing it to PDF. that should preserve the long text controls. Excel will not import more than 255 in a cell. An alternative there would be to parse out the long text field into 255 character segments and include them in your exported query.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 keeps changing HTML email text to turquoise and underlining after email is closed</h2>
                    <p>I am currently trying to build some simple HTML styled email content within Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert a table, copy some text out of Notepad, paste into the table, colour it and set the typeface size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save the mail then close Outlook and re-open it - the text is now turquoise in colour and is underlined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot change the text once it has been reformatted to this state, i have to start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the standard anchor hyperlink behaviour (the blue colour) and the text does not behave as a link does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea what is causing this, but i would appreciate it if this resonates with anyone here.

<h2>            USB acting very strangely- not reading in computer</h2>
                    <p>I have a USB stick that will light up when initially plugged into the computer, and will even trigger an indicator sound, then will go dead. The indicator light on the usb stick turns off, and nothing regarding the drive shows up in Windows Explorer. Then
 I pull it out and hear the indicator sound again. It's like it is being read, but not actually happening. Then I restart the computer and it works fine or it doesn't at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

                    My MS Security Essentials is scheduled to run Sunday at 2AM but the scan runs indefinitely and NEVER ends!!! I wake up around 9AM and still scanning at it hit the 5,000,000 mark on number of items scanned, around noon it hit 7,000,000 and still scanning
 and it scans the same files over and over indefinitely until my computer shuts off due to over heating because of MS Security Essentials constant infinite loop of a scan!!!!!<br />

<h2>            Onenote personal notebook gone</h2>
                    <p>So I opened Onenote just before and noticed that all of my personal notes are gone and I tried to see if I can restore the note but there aren't any because I'm using the Microsoft store version which doesn't have that feature.<br />
I haven't used the Office365 2016 onenote since it deletes the notes from using startup.</p>
<p>Is there anyway of restoring the cloud sync back to the 10/5/18 3:00pm GMT +10?<br />
</p>
<p>*Update I've also checked through the backup files but since I'm using the Microsoft store version of Onenote, i cannot restore and I also have checked on onedrive/ Online onenote and its still all gone.</p>

            I had the same thing happen to my computer. Since I have also no viable way to contact support either, I unistalled Windows 10 preview. Now that I have done that, Microsoft still keeps on trying to update the program that isn't there anymore. Note to Microsoft,
 make it easy for your test subjects to contact the company. I was running Windows 7 with a Bose desktop system that plugs in via USB

            Yes, a clean install will start fresh and should eliminate the problems preventing regular Windows updates. You can always back up your files and important documents to a USB flash drive and reinstall them when up and running. This is why beta software
 is not to be used on your everyday production machine.

<p>Yes, that is just one of the things you have to consider before you install the next insider build.</p>
<p>These insider builds are Beta build and can be or will be buggy and have these sort of issues.</p>

<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where exactly do you get this error? Did you try a hard reset - after the hard reset you will be able to try to set up the phone again. if you will need an Activation Code, you can contact the chat support:</p>

    <title>Receiving WINMAIL.DAT attachments in Outlook 2016 with IMAP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Receiving WINMAIL.DAT attachments in Outlook 2016 with IMAP</h2>
                    <p>I have received attachments converted to WINMAIL.DAT files from multiple senders who are NOT using RTF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have learned so far this is apparently an issue with IMAP accounts under Outlook 2016 (on a Mac, in my case). The same senders and emails deliver attachments correctly when sent to my POP3 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">my</span> end, receiving in my IMAP account under Outlook 2016. Please do not reply with information on how the senders can avoid the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to control this and avoid having incoming attachments converted to WINMAIL.DAT?</p>

<p>Hi Danssmith1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the senders from whom you received the emails with Winmail.dat are Office 365 accounts, it‚Äôs recommended to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2487954/how-to-specify-the-email-message-format-that-s-used-for-external-recip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
disable the TNEF</a> on their sides. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I noticed that you‚Äôre sure the senders are not using RTF. And as you said your another POP3 account could receive the attachments correctly, you may try forwarding emails with Winmail.dat to your POP3 account on your side.</p>

            Kevin is correct that dolts using Outlook on Windows won't follow simple instructions. You won't be able to explain how to send email to these people.
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to get TNEF's Enough</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks or trying to help, but none of these suggestions address the problem, which is apparently a shortcoming of Outlook's IMAP handling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forwarding an email with a .DAT attachment does not change the .DAT attachment back to it's original format. You just get a copy of the .DAT file. Did you try that before you suggested it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asking senders to change their practices makes little sense because I may receive email from hundreds of senders, many for the first time. &nbsp;I routinely receive intact PDF attachments from other people at the same organizations as their problem senders. Moreover
 it is my problem, not theirs, and is not predictable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Level 1 Microsoft support is basically worthless for all but the simplest questions. I spent a total of nearly 2 hours on four chat sessions with no help whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only useful suggestion would be instructions on how to correct the Outlook flaw that is causing the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Danssmith1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can totally understand your concern regarding this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why I don‚Äôt think this&nbsp; issue is related to IMAP handling is that I didn‚Äôt get the same result in my own test. I tried to send an RTF format email, which had an attachment to an IMAP account and read the message in Outlook client. But there turned
 out to be no Winmail.dat attachment and the original attachment was shown normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To narrow down the case, this issue is possibly related to the ISP of your IMAP account. Please log in to the web client of your IMAP account email and check if the Winmail.dat attachments exist. And if it does it‚Äôs recommended to ask for help from your
 ISP support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<p>The problem with winmail.dat files is always on the sender's side. I've never ever sever seen it be an IMAP server issue.</p>
<p>It's a recurring problem that's all over the Web regardless of the email client (other than Outlook for Windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cause is well known: They have Outlook for Windows configured to send with the TNEF format. The .dat file has the copy of the message with formatting and sometimes the attachment too. 90% of the time, you can safely ignore the&nbsp;winmail.dat file (since
 it's just a copy of the message), but sometimes it contains the attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook for Mac (and Mail, and Thunderbird, etc.) is unable to directly read the winmail.dat files to display the content as it would for regular formatted messages (and no app I know of does actually), but there are a number of apps that should be able
 to extract the content. Look for TNEF on a site like MacUpdate for instance and you'll find plenty. The one Jim mentioned does just that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long term though, as Jim was trying to emphasize, the only solution is to ask the sender to change the configuration fo Outlook on their machine to disable TNEF (the format that encapsulates the message in the&nbsp;winmail.dat attachment). I perfectly understand
 that it could be a touchy situation and if you are reluctant to mention it to them, then you have to use an app to extract the content of the&nbsp;winmail.dat file.</p>
<p>In a way, they probably don't even realize that they are sending messages in that format had have contacts right and left complaining about these attachments. You might find a diplomatic way to make them aware of it (and the solution), that might end up
 helping them on the long term.</p>

i have a request<br />
is it possible today to update your myphone contacts/calendar .. .etc using an api?<br />
I explain<br />
<br />
i use lotus notes at work, and have hence developed a vb script (simple under excel vba) that reads my lotus notes calendar entries (lotus needs to be running, no problem for that) and uploads them to google calendar<br />
<br />
then on my device, i have google calendar setup via activesync for update<br />
<br />
the script is run every 2 hours in background and it allows me to have my meetings on my mobile phone up to date (at that frequency)<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
1. I can't use an exchange server and myphone at the same time<br />
2. I wouldn't mind switching 100% to myphone (since it allows me to sync messages and contacts too) as long as i can sync calendar and update calendar automatically using a vba script as i already do<br />
<br />
cheers

Hi <span><span>haseebch</span>
<br />
<br />
My Phone service doesn't allow that. It's not possible to update your contacts, calendars, etc using an API.<br />
<br />
