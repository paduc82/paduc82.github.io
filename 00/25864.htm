<h2>            Wireless devices not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I can't run any of&nbsp;my wireless mice, whether it is a Microsoft,&nbsp;Logitech, or even a Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB ports seem to be working find, when it comes to direct USB wired&nbsp;install, whether it&nbsp;is a keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a problem bringing up the hidden menu at the bottom or the side. There appears to be a lag. Clicking it a few times, eventually opens them up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than these two issues, Windows 10 seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, does Windows 10 allow you to have it look and run it like Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I am having the same issue and have not found any help. &nbsp;I know the mouse works as it is fine on my other laptop and the usb ports work on the laptop with windows 10 as flash drives and printers are recognized, just not the wireless mouse dongle.

            <p>You must have opened two instance of excel, thats why you are facing this problem.</p>
<p><strong><em>Just close one instance of excel where you have new file</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the excel window where you have your old file,&nbsp; now from here you open new excel file (CTRL+N),&nbsp; now copy from old file to new file, it will copy formula also.</p>

<p>The scenario is like this. Imagine I have two excel files (not workbook) named X and Y. I want to copy a particular formula from X to Y ,its not working. But at the same time I can copy the formula from X to a new excel workbook. I hope you understood.</p>

            <p>I got your point, what happens if you open these X and Y files in different instance/Window of excel&nbsp;then you will be not able to copy, but the copied data will be converted as paste value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now let's&nbsp;close&nbsp;all opened excel files including excel window.&nbsp; Now you open X file, now you open your Y file in the same window of excel through (CTRL+O).&nbsp; Now there are 2 files opened but only in one instance of excel.&nbsp; Now you will be able to copy
 the data including formula in each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you got it. There is difference between instance/Windows of excel.&nbsp; Sometimes we get open 2 excel windows each having a file, so at that time copieng formula will not work.&nbsp; So we should always open one instance/window of excel which may have any number
 of workbooks/files.</p>

<p>I got your point and its working in that way, thanks. But my friend can do it if he opens multiple excel</p>

            <p>Its not the question of multiple excel files but of multiple instances/windows of excel. I am pretty sure he also can't do it in multiple instances of excel. You/or he may open any number of files but all should be opened in the same instance/window of excel.</p>
<p>Just check with your friend laptop and try to open 2 windows/instances of excel each with file and then he will also face same issue.</p>

            I can't believe this is happening and the solutions I've seen... it worked fine in Excel 2003.&nbsp; MS wants me to copy or write a VBA code to copy 6 numbers from my 2015 Account Book to the 2016 Account Book?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll write them on paper and punch them in manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Jeeminy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This combined with Sort Criteria "bug" - I just want to sort columns A and C for 12 months without having to set the parameters every time I do it - will have me switching back to XL 2003 as soon as I go back where the disks are.&nbsp; The only reason
 I wanted a later version was to open the VERY occasional .xlsx file that someone emails me... and once (an overblown legal case) I hit the limit for number of columns and formatting, which for all that is holy, I hope never to do again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll keep 2007 on
 the computer but won't be using it for daily work - I'll also be able to use the shading colors I've been using for 20 years (maybe there's a way to save these with 2007, but it sho

<p>I figured out that if I select two excel file at the same time and press Enter in order to open them, I can not copy one formula to other (It is acting like they are compeletly different programs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open one file, then I open the other; I can copy the formula and everything works fine..</p>

<h2>            how to give customer feed back</h2>
                    <p>I was just on a live chat with Magiel, after taking 30min to try to get access to some one. he said that I have the wrong area as I have Office 365 home, windows 10 and left a link then hung up, not waiting for a response, the chat is gone and now I have
 no link. I have office 365 on my computer and my android phone and im not able to delete appointments in outlook, contacts don't always sync, cant get one drive to use the extended memory SD card on the computer.&nbsp; So where do I go now, I previously clicked
 on Office 365 for pc android.&nbsp; I have had a number of problems with this set up and this is the absolute worst customer service I have ever had. I've been disconnect on the phone and no call back after taking an hour to get access to someone . This is the
 2nd time the chat person has disappeared. They have promised to have a&nbsp; tier 2 tech&nbsp; call me at an agreed to time on 2 occasions&nbsp; and no call. They have not fixed a single problem and I have spent hours trying to get help. I've spent so much time with their
 dysfunctional support people and little to no time with someone working on a problem</p>
<p>Is it realistic to have office 365 home and 1 drive as a solution on my pc and android including using outlook for email appointments contacts as a seamless solution or am I wasting my time? Does anyone have this actually working as advertised?&nbsp;</p>

            I am fully with you. As a customer, you deserve 100% respect and nothing else.
<br />
<br />Wasting of time of a customer is something which should not be acceptable.
<br />
<br />To answer you question - Yes, you are correct. You should use Office 365 / Outlook  on Windows / Android for a seamless experience.

<br />If you could explain the problem, experts on this forum will extend helping hand to you.

<p>Dhiman2 I appreciate you spent time to reply, so I used your link and it took me to the following choices:&nbsp;</p>
<p>onedrive</p>
<p>office for Mac iOS&nbsp; Android</p>
<p>Office or Office for windows</p>
<p>which I could choose any one of these they&nbsp; all fit asI have purchased Office 365 that comes wiht one drive and outlook</p>
<p>Last time I selected the android one, about 45 min to get to the point where the chat person Magiel gives me this link&nbsp;</p>

<p>no solution here..... I'm starting the same dysfunctional access process</p>
<p>If I understand your direction&nbsp; you are saying repeat the process and ask for a level 2?</p>
<p>I have had 2 level 2 callbacks not followed through with as per my previous comments</p>
<p>I see you are the community moderator, I don't understand the role beyond the obvious, or relation to MS, this direction comes across as there&nbsp; is no problem just spend my time&nbsp; doing the same thing that has not been successful again</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply E,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook calendar on android unable to delete duplicate appointments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a number of all day appointments extend over 2 days on android not on&nbsp; PC</p>
<p>The problem appointments are ones that came over from google calendar or are invited from an email invite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have problems with one driver not using the extended memory on the PC SD card. What I read on this says I need to format the card. Well I have more data than will fit on my PC hard drive on the card. Is there a way to put the data in 1 drive and not
 have one drive put it on my c drive so that I can format the card then move the data back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tech support set up the connection with my previous gmail email, calendar and contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I have gmail logins hotmail logins I was told it wont be an issue I can keep using the gmail as the primary, however I have now become confused as to what are gmail logins for and what is hotmail&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example I tried to answer this on my android and it needed me to login first. It gave me the choice of a gmail or hotmail account the gmail with blank username fields, I used my gmail user name and it came back with user name already taken. I was answering
 its request to login not set up an account.&nbsp; I came back here and it auto logged me in. However if I got logged out I would not know what access to use.</p>
<p>In a similar way my skype account is now connected and this is also confusing because I now have&nbsp; MS,&nbsp; skype, one drive, gmail, google drive, username accounts I don't get the relationships to know how to get back in when they upgrade and the stored login
 info does not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm out of time for today would appreciate any help you can give me. My understanding is that you have first hand knowledge that this is a viable solution and I'm not wasting my time with an over marketed suite of products that have more problems than solutions.
 I feel I need to know that this is worth my ongoing time investment.</p>
<p>thanks&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Threatening email from my own address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natashap13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Threatening email from my own address</h2>
                    I have received two emails in the past few days to my Hotmail account which seem to be from my own account. The subject line says '......@hotmail.co.uk is hacked'. This has come through to my spam email as a 'note to self', which is what happens if I send
 an email to myself. The emails do not show in my sent box and they went straight to my spam. They say that my activity has been tracked for the past 6 months and if I do not pay a certain amount of money, my contacts will be accessed and all my information
 and activity will be shared. I would normally ignore an email like this and report it the usual way, but I am more worried as it appears to have come from my own account. I have changed my password and my account doesn't show any successful attempts to access
 my account. If anyone can provide any help on this topic I would be very grateful. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had the same email but on mine they actually stated an old password of mine which is quite a worry ! Did your email also show any passwords that you use or may have used in the past&nbsp;</p>

            Did yours also appear to be from yourself? It's a lot more worrying than the usual tax or amazon scams, etc. Mine did not contain old passwords, they were made up ones so I checked mine hadn't been changed and it hadn't so that's how I realised it must
 be a scam

            Yes it was from myself, it was quite threatening saying it had been watching me watching inappropriate content and was going to share it with all my contacts if I didn't pay up!! Well I don't watch inappropriate content so I've no need to worry on that
 note but like I said they've got hold of an old password.

            Yes, seems like the exact same email. I was the same, I didn't worry about any sites I have visited I just didn't fancy it accessing contacts or having to get a new email and providing it to everyone! I generally never worry about spam emails just report
 and/or delete but like you've said this is more worrying as it contains personal account info&nbsp;

<br />This is a running scam that's been going on for a while - I've rec'd well over 80+ similar messages (in fact, two of them came in this morning).
<br />
<br />In general, spammers are getting the email addresses from databases of websites that have been compromised and on which you subscribed to something. Just be sure that you don't use the same password for any critical sites (i.e. banking/credit card, Amazon, PayPal, Apple Store etc etc)
<br />
<br />You can check to see if your email address comes up on a compromised database on the following website (created by a Microsoft MVP so it can definitely be trusted)

<h2>            Outlook 2010 keeps dumping good email into trash</h2>
                    I've been an Outlook user for a very long time and have a pretty solid grasp of what has to happen.&nbsp; But this baffles me.&nbsp; Email from Dell and US Cert go to the trash file, ignoring the fact that I added their emails to my address book, said they were
 Not Junk, put the domain in Jumk Mail Settings Safe Senders and the entire email address into the Safe Senders list.&nbsp; Neither of these are listed in junk mail or blocked senders.<br />
<br />
All other email is coming in fine, filtered by a set of rules into various folders.&nbsp; Neither of these are listed specifically in a rule.<br />
<br />
So I am at a loss to know why.<br />

            I check 10 email accounts each time I sync.&nbsp; These are all POP accounts with one hosting company.&nbsp; Most of the time, I set junk mail to "safe senders only" as I get 50-100 spam messages a day from some of the accounts.&nbsp; Most of the legitimate mail I have
 saved their addresses in the contact list, including the two I mentioned.<br />
<br />
I do see a lot of mail go to trash, with the junk setting on High or safe senders only.&nbsp; But these two only always go to trash.<br />

            I sort of know what your asking...<br />
<br />
What E Mail system are you trying to use as I would find it easyer to look at the settings and then advise ?<br />
<br />
I will say the N70 is a pain to set up and more often than not you can see no reason why it will not work.

            Have you looked in:<br />
<br />
Menu - Messaging - Options - Settings - Email - Mailboxes - Scroll to the relevant box - Options - Edit - Mailbox settings -<br />
<br />
Not sure if that will work - if you're saying you need to use a different username and password for incoming / outgoing, maybe you could set up 2 accounts - one for sending, one for receiving...<br />
<br />
Not sure if I've understood fully though, thought I'd try that anyway :)<br />

            Thanks for advice, it works with 2 diffrent accounts (1 for incoming 1 outgoing) but it is not comfortable,<br />
on my old 6230 was in menu Messages-Message settings-E-mail messages-Edit active settings-Other settings-Use SMTP authorisation (yes);SMTP user name (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***); SMTP password (password).<br />

            I have my own domain. My ISP provide mail server for me, i want to have access to my mail box. Mail server require SMTP authorization. Account for SMTP authorisation is different than my.<br />
Example:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** - my account for POP3<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** - account for smtp server.<br />
<br />
If you know some solution i'll be very happy.<br />
Thanks

            I use my own domain too - could you contact your provider/host and ask them to set the usernames and passwords to the same on both? That's how it is by default on mine, so I've never had a problem like this.

            Correct me if I'm wrong but from memory, I don't think you have the option of using SMTP authentication on the N70...<br />
<br />
In this case, what you would have to do is use a server that doesn't require authentication. Normally your email provider would be able to supply you with server details so that you can use a server that will work for you.

            Thanks to both, all that you said i know. Is bad if that possibility was in oldest models like 6230 and not in N-series. The same setting is in all S40 models like 6280.

<h2>            Custom TOC in Word 2011</h2>
                    In Ms Word 2011, I have created a Table of Contents.&nbsp; How do I add a hyperlink to the TOC item instead of the page number?&nbsp; I've tried the \h and it doesn't work.&nbsp; Also when I toggle field codes, I only see the code for the first level no matter where
 my cursor is.

            <p>I thought I'd at least have a lok at a VBA macro, and making a few assumptions, came up witht he following. Probably worth a try, but not putting too much effort in if it doesn't function properly. I can put in a bit more effort if you identify any easily
 located problems, but not a lot.<br />
<br />
It assumes that you have a TOC field that generates a page number, and that the separator between the ToC entry text and the page number is a single character (I've actually assumed it's a tab). Youalso need a couple of blank paragraphs after the ToC. I last
 attempted Kindle book generation a couple of years ago, so will have to leave you to check that part.<br />

<p>Too bad here but looks like Microsoft insider team is willing to have new&nbsp;public build released with a unfixed problem with one of it's a big/large app like iTunes having a major problem. It's funny too that it seems Microsoft to think its own Windows 10
 users will think this is Apple's problem and not Microsoft's. But when Windows 10 user has new public build upgrade completed and then its iTunes app no&nbsp;longer is able to access iTunes store they will know the only change that just&nbsp;occurred is Microsoft Windows
 10 upgrade and not Apple product upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have contention between big tech companies like Apple &amp; Microsoft and they're willing to blame each other for problems rather than work together to fix the problems only leaves pc users with the bad consequences. This will be the case and thousands
 of iTunes users will suffer because of these two huge companies Egos</p>

</p><p><strong>Re: Send Errors</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is in response to the numerous posts regarding Outlook &lt;send&gt; &amp; &lt;folder&nbsp;permission&gt; &nbsp;errors after updating to Windows 10. The issue is being investigated.
<br />
<br />
The work-around.............<br />
<br />
Run the &lt;Command Prompt&gt; with elevated privileges (explicitly select "Run as Adminsitrator" whether you are the admin on your machine or not)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Have all apps closed (<strong>especially Outlook</strong>)<br />
- Search for &lt;cmd&gt; (without the left/right brackets) - or see article below&nbsp;<br />
- Right click and select "<strong>Run as Administrator"</strong><br />
- In the command prompt window type in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sfc /scannow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (be sure to leave a space between "c and /"<br />
- let it run to completion<br />

<p><strong>Re: iCloud Issues</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information about iCloud and other issues in general related to Outlook and Windows 10 can be found at</p>

<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/windows10upgrade.htm#icloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/windows10upgrade.htm#icloud</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The following will be of interest for those using iCloud as posted by &lt;RickDixon&gt; in the following thread on 8/1/2015</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save everyone some time - his post reads as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I just finished a screen share with Microsoft techs and they advised that Windows 10 is not compatible with the "old iCloud app" and that it's up to Apple to update so it can integrate with Outlook Contacts &amp; Calendar. Regarding all the contacts that were
 wiped out in the Windows 10 upgrade, they classify those contacts as "personal" and not part of the Microsoft program - so sorry - no contacts or calendar detail for you.."</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit - 8/1/2015 - Language Packs</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Outlook language packs - please set Outlook to use the native language instead of whatever language pack has been installed and try again. It appears that Language Paks need to be re-installed manually.</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Edit - 8/2/2015 - if nothing else works</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who still encounter errors after following the suggestions &lt;exactly&gt; as described in this post related to the particular error being encountered, you should do one of the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Download and run &lt;<strong>OffCat</strong>&gt; (instructions/documentation contained in a file included in the download)</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool </p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=36852</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lt;OR&gt;</strong></p>
<p>#2 - Create a separate new thread containing information specific to the problem being encountered along with details about your specific configuration if item #1 doesn't resolve the issue</p>
<p><strong>&lt;OR&gt;</strong></p>
<p>#3 - Contact MS Support directly who will be able to remotely connect with your system</p>
<p>&nbsp;- the quickest way is <strong>from within Windows 10</strong>, type&nbsp;"Contact Support" in the search box to access the Win10 support app from the Microsoft store OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;- go to <a href="http://support.mcrosoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.mcrosoft.com</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) select &lt;Contact Answer Desk&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) select &lt;Services &amp; Apps&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) select appropriate choice (i.e. Windows or Office etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) select &lt;Technical Support&gt; and then choose from<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Chat online with a Microsoft Answer Tech<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Call me as soon as possible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Schedule a Call</p>

            <p>Thanks Karl. &nbsp; I ran the sfc /scannow earlier and received nothing but everything ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Office Professional Academic 2010</p>
<p>2. I upgraded from 7 to 10</p>
<p>3. It's installed on a Desktop PC</p>
<p>4. Email is a Pop/Smtp</p>
<p>5. Nothing that I am aware of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. &nbsp; I really not sure what you want....my outlook started having issues about a month ago when I received a 10 or 12 updates to Windows 7. &nbsp; After they were downloaded and installed, my Outlook data file simply was gone and I could not receive or send.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on the road in preparation to retirement and used yahoo mail on my cell phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you come up with something. &nbsp; I really do hate yahoo mail.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10 and then "it" started happening... the dreaded 0x800CCC13 error message - but only on one of my IMAP accounts. I run 4 email accounts in Outlook and it is only happening on 1 despite that 2 are essentially the same
 settings.</p>
<p>
#1 - Outlook 365
</p><p>#2 - Windows 8 to 10</p>
<p>#3 - Surface Pro 3 i5</p>
<p>#4 - Win10 login used - local</p>
<p>#5 -&nbsp;1 POP3, 2 IMAP and 1 other ?<br />
#6 - GoTo Meeting add-in - but disabled</p>
<p>#7 - Only happened after updating to Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran&nbsp;the SFC scannow routine and some corrupt files were found and repaired. I can now send email from my affected account :o)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sake of helping others, I thought it may be useful to share the relevant extracts from the log file for the scan. It&nbsp;is all gibberish to me, but anyway, it has the following details...</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstalling superseded driver: C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS\amd64... - many variations on this theme</li><li>Warning - Overlap: Duplicate ownership for directory... - many variations on this theme too</li></ul>
<p>End result from the log file is as follows:</p>

                    <p>Office 2010, Win7 x64.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When in a document, I select Open and the Explorer screen displays the proper folder listing for the file I am working on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I select the parent folder (to open a new file) I see a listing of ALL files in that parent folder, minus the subfolders -- i.e. the contents of all subfolders are displayed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I then go to its successive&nbsp;parent and back again, the problem is resolved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This appears to be a bug.&nbsp; How shall I go about reporting such?</p>

<h2>            USB Control WIndows Mobile 6.5 on a Motorola ES400</h2>
                    <p>Apologies if this question has already been asked, but I need to know if it is possible to disable usb data transfer but retain the power on a Motorola ES400 running Windows Mobile 6.5.&nbsp;For addtional security, we would need to retian the charging function,
 to allow a 12v carger to connect and charge the device, while preventing access to the data funtion, while away from the base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I believe that by making use of the docking cradle available with this phone, that the copper connections of the battery door will provide charging and data transfer capabilities, but am not certain whether this is considered to be a second individual USB
 port, or just a replication of the standared USB connection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks, </p>

            Hello. The device shouldn't really interact with the PC if you don't have the sync client software installed. You can also turn off "disk drive", activesync, and any other options in Start&gt;settings&gt;connection tab&gt;USB to PC.

<p>You have stated it that you have a small business and purchased a business plan. These 2 subscription doesn't match I believe. Small business is no longer available for purchase in the market. Maybe you need to do a switch plan first?</p>

    <title>Perhaps a stupid question - what happens after April - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Perhaps a stupid question - what happens after April 15th&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Not sure if this is answered in a MS Faq somewhere but this is my first time participating in a Technical Preview of a version of Windows and I believe I have read that as of April 15th (or some date around there) the Windows 10 Technical Preview will end.</p>
<p>Now I believe that I also read that Windows 10 will not be released till later in the year, so:</p>
<p>(1) What will happen to the Technical Preview that we have installed? I assume it will continue to work but there will be no further updates?</p>
<p>(2) I am running Win 10 as a virtual machine on an iMac through Parallels - which means that my Windows 8.1 install is not on the same virtual drive where the Win 10 TP is installed (meaning they don't see each other or know the other installation actually
 exists). When Win 10 is finally released, I assume that I will have to do the free upgrade from the Win 8.1 install - not base it on my existing Win 10 TP?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><strong>Builds 9841, 9860, 9879 will expire on April 15th 2015 and will go into reduced functional mode, this means, they will shutdown every 2 hours. If upgrade to build 9926 this will extend the expiration to October 1st 2015, subsequent builds will likely

<h2>            Word refuses to open any files&#63;</h2>
                    Just a few days ago, it was working fine. But today I tried to open a file containing an assignment and it would not open. No error message for the first few tries, but nothing would happen when I clicked the 'open' button. The same ting happened with
 every other file. After a little while it simply said "The file (insert name here) cannot be opened". These are all files created and last edited within a week.&nbsp;<br />
Any advice?

<p>You can find Mail for Exchange application <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/289487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Did this person manage to get update 14.53 for the Asha. I am in South Africa and somehow it is STILL not available here. Nokia SA can't tell whether it is due to them or the carrier. Please help, I really need to use Mail for Exchange. I have had the phone
 since July and am on the verge of getting another phone (which I really don't want to ). Had an E63 which was great. This shouldn't be a step down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Updates have to be approved by the operator before they become available, so it may be that it it still pending for approval. What you could do is to contact your operator and ask them about the matter or visit your closest
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/za-en/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care Point</a> and ask if they could update your phone to the newer firmware version (please note that you may have to pay service fee for this).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After updating the OS from 14.26 to 14.92 via USB cable and not through WiFi because it is impossible (in fact, does not detect the new version).<br />
<br />
I unloaded Mail for Exchange via store on the phone memory, and then start application by filling the various fields.<br />
Domain remained empty as shown in other forum<br />
Use SSL YES I left as the default.<br />
<br />
Then I started synchronization, but:</p>
<p>Pop up :&nbsp; â€œError&nbsp;&nbsp; No folder to displayâ€&nbsp;&nbsp; then OK<br />
The following message: State of sync "Waiting for network. New attempt in 60 sec.<br />

<p>However, I can connect to internet and then view different sites.<br />

<p>Can you help to find a solution ?</p>

<p>You can delete first your e-mail account if it's already set up in your phone. You can do a soft reset after deleting it. Soft reset can be done by going to Settings &gt; Restore factory settings &gt; Settings only &gt; Enter the default code. The default code is
 12345 unless changed. You can set up again your account after doing the said step.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. :smileyhappy:</p>

<h2>            How to set up folder specific audible alert for Outlook 2003</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am Microsoft Customer Service Representative that posting a question on my customers behalf.
</p>
<p>They would like to create an audible alert that is folder specific for incoming emails in Office 2003.
The folders allow them to determine most of the pertenant emails that&nbsp;they get and so if the alert comes in once these requirements are met then&nbsp;they have a better chance of getting to them right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They already set up the audible alert using the following link below:
</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/change-the-sound-played-when-messages-arrive-HP001091699.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/change-the-sound-played-when-messages-arrive-HP001091699.aspx</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this are not folder specific as they describe above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly assist my customer with their issue and any suggestions are considered hepful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Are they using rules to move the mail to the folder? If so, set up the rule to move the message and play a sound.

    <title>Duplicate emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mailuser_444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate emails</h2>
                    I am using outlook 2016 configured with two mail accounts.&nbsp; The default account is an exchange email account.&nbsp; The second account is configured under IMAP.&nbsp; Both accounts have their own .ost file and I have a folder list for each account.&nbsp; The problem
 is that the IMAP emails are showing up in both the IMAP inbox and the exchange inbox.&nbsp; Exchange emails only appear once in the proper place.&nbsp; The IMAP emails come to the exchange inbox after a short delay from the time they hit the correct in box.&nbsp; How do
 I correct this?

            Yes, if you don't want duplicates. When its set up as a connected account, it'll download new mail into the Exchange mailbox. You could remove the imap account from outlook instead, but if you send mail from the imap address, you'll need to use the web - outlook can't send mail from connected accounts at this time

            <p>Hello Stefan,</p>
<p>Thank you for all you help.&nbsp; I figured out what the problem was.&nbsp; The table has Content Controls and Bookmarks in it.&nbsp; I don't know about the Bookmarks but the Content Controls restrict some editing if the document is not in Design Mode.&nbsp; So by going to
 the Developer tab and selecting Design Mode I was able to then move the table.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>
