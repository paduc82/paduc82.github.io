<h2>            Office 365 for MAC - Outlook - Network traffic</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>every time I launch outlook&nbsp; client, outlook make about 250MB of network traffic without any mail sent or received.</p>
<p>I have a router with limited monthly traffic (5 GB) and 250 MB every time i open the client is unacceptable. Network traffic wasted to do nothing!!!!</p>
<p>How is it possible to limit the network traffic to few MB (max 5 MB)?</p>
<p>I have Office 365 for MAC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft, please correct this huge bug!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestion</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Mario</p>
<p>
</p><p>Little correction:<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>after half an hour about 560 MB of network Traffic</strong></span></p>

<p>Hi Mario,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Internet is enormously complex. Sometimes, the issue may not be related to the Outlook client. To narrow down the root cause of the issue, I'd like to confirm the following concepts to understand the situation much better.</p>
<p>1. Please make sure that the Outlook app has installed the recent update. Meanwhile, share the detailed version with us.</p>
<p>2. Check if there is any email that placed in the <strong>On My Computer Drafts folder</strong>.
<span>The On My Computer Drafts folder is a local folder, and does not synchronize to the server.&nbsp;Therefore, this email message will no longer try to send or synchronize to the server.</span></p>
<p><span>3. How do you set up your email account, via Exchange/IMAP/POP?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Have you installed any Outlook plug-ins? If so, would you please disable/uninstall it to check if the issue can be fixed?</span></p>
<p><span>5. Does the issue affect your normal use on Outlook?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Lance</span></p>

<p>thank you for your reply. In Italic my note</p>

<h2>            No printer icon in a Internet Explorer 8 popup window.</h2>
                    We are using a website that pops open an IE8 window for some invoicing. But there's no printer icon on the popup window for us to print the invoice. Is there anyway or any software utility that can put the printer icon on the popup widow?

<p><span>Hi texastig,</span></p>
<p><span>As you are getting the option ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù on right click the issue seems to be with the code of the website where the print icon has been removed from
 the Internet pop-up windows for invoicing. I would suggest you to contact the website in question to determine why they have removed the print icon within the popup window.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get my Skype avatar to save or sync</h2>
                    <p>My Skype avatar keeps reverting back to the default blank one with initials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing it in every version of Skype I could think of - desktop, Windows app, Android app, online beta - nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I update the avatar, and it shows correctly. Then, if I check it elsewhere, it has the default initials one. If I set it, then close and re-open Skype, it's also reverted back to the default initials one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this lately?</p>
<p>Has anyone managed to get their avatar to stick?</p>

    <title>Transfering contacts from phone to SIM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noral.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfering contacts from phone to SIM</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have a pretty big problem and a question. I recently bought a phone (not a smartphone) and before that i had a Windows phone. When i tried to transfer my contacts to my SIM card, I noticed that I just can't, there's no such option as "copy contacts
 to SIM". I've learnt that I can use Microsoft live ore something like it, but in my case that's not helpful at all. So, as far as I can see, the only way to save my contacts to my "new" phone is to transfer them one by one via Bluetooth. Have you ever considered
 releasing an OS that has an option which allows the users to share their contacts with any device or at least to copy them to the SIM card?</p>

</p><p>I know that I can uninstall and suppress the patch on the machines to address the issue, but I have over 300 computers to address at 40+ different sites, states and approx 50 users' homes. &nbsp;</p>

Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support, I am Xxxxxx X, I will be helping you with your query today.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>Hello</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Hi! It doesn't appear the information you entered came through completely, how can I help you today?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>My organization has had errors when printing some types of pages/sites from IE11 since applying patch KB4022725.</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>Computers are Windows 10 Pro 1703</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>Computers that have not patched yet are okay.</strong><br />
<br />
I see. Thanks for sharing the details of your concern. Let me help you with your concern about being unable to print.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I hope that you're doing good despite of having a hard time printing documents. Let me do my thing here for us to get this sorted out.<br />
<br />
By the way, mind if I ask, is this the first time you're contacting Microsoft regarding this?<br />
<br />
<strong>yes first time about this issue</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>i'm doing well thank you. you?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>example error:</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I'm doing great here. Thanks for asking. And I'm very glad that we're in a fine condition today.<br />
<br />
By the way, before anything else, just want to inform you that we provide free support for download, install and activation issues for Windows Operating system. There are other supporting departments as well that I might transfer you over that are well specialized
 in resolving your issue.We also have subscription plans that we can talk about later if there is a need. Self-help options are available here as well which we can send to you through email. For now, let's do our best to diagnose or resolve your issue quickly
 if we can. Alright?<br />
<br />
<strong>okay.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>thank you</strong><br />
<br />
Alright! To begin, kindly take this case number for it covers everything regarding your issue: xxxxxxxxxx<br />
<br />
<strong>what I really need is a way to work around the issue without requiring uninstalling and suppressing the patch in my environment. (too many computers to manage that way.)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>okay</strong><br />
<br />
I see. I completely understand. By the way, you have mentioned that we're getting errors upon trying to print, can you kindly provide me the exact error that we're receiving?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cannot find</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>...:/Users/USERANME/Appdata/Local/Temp/Low...</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Make sure the path or INternet address is correct. [OK]</strong><br />
<br />
Oh I see. Thanks for that information. By the way, can you kindly share to me what troubleshooting steps you have done so far in order to correct this issue?<br />
<br />
For us not to repeat the same method.<br />
<br />
<strong>tries multiple machines that have patched and ones that have not.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>ones that patch with KB4022725 error when printing from multiple sites/page</strong>s.<br />
<br />
<strong>ones that did not patch with KB4022725 operate as expected.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for letting me know about it. By the for those devices that patched, can you try resetting the Print Spooler Service to refresh the printer? And afterwards try to print again.<br />
<br />
<strong>other internet users have reported similar issues</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To do that, kindly press the windows key + R key and type in services.msc<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for the added information. By the way, upon entering the command, hit the Enter key and then locate the Print Spooler.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Right click on it and then choose Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>okay, please stand by while I try</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>note: we have also restarted patched computers and that did not correct issue. Will that not also restart the print spooler?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes. Restarting the device will not restart the print spooler.<br />
<br />
<strong>okay, stand by trying now</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
How was it so far?<br />
<br />
<strong>almost there, had to recreate issue once first on my own computer to be sure that is good test</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>no did not help</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>same error</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>print spooler did restart, just did not help</strong><br />
<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Oh I see. Thanks for letting me know about it. It seems like the device was unable to locate or recognize the path that the printer is trying to print. And by the way, thanks your very for those links but to tell you honestly that we're unable to open those
 up on our end for we do have limited access here.<br />
<br />
<strong>what about the Microsoft.com one?</strong><br />
<br />
Since we have already tried resetting the print spooler service, to refresh the printer system, may I know if we have tried updating the printer driver on the Device Manager?<br />
<br />
<strong>issue seems to occur before printer selection</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>so any printer</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Oh I see. Thanks for letting me know about it. By the way, I was able to open the link, which is the Microsoft.com one and upon checking it, the issue can be resolved by uninstalling the update for it seems to be that the latest update was causing the issue
 with the printer.<br />
<br />
We can do that as well actually so that we may able to continue using the device together with the printer.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>While that will probably work, I cannot reasonably do that on 300PCs and place the setting to stop it from updating later.</strong><br />
<br />
Also, since we're running windows 10 operating system, we can perform as well a reinstallation of the driver or perform an n-place upgrade of windows 10.<br />
<br />
<strong>I'm hoping for a better workaround</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>OS is already windows 10</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Oh, that's a lot of computers. I completely understand the hassle of doing it on all of those computers. Well, there are still basic troubleshooting steps that we can try but for me it would be best to perform the troubleshooting step that will surely work
 for it will able to revert back the device to its best working condition again.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
The other things that you can try is by uninstalling driver, clean boot and/or running an SFC scan.<br />
<br />
But doing so will take a lot of time as well for these troubleshooting steps will require multiple reboots which will consume more time for possibility.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>At this point I have no reason to believe that a driver is involved. It is clearly the result of KB4022725.</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>I need a hotfix or non-invasive workaround.</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Actually the fastest way to get rid of the issue is by uninstalling the update. The other way around is the in-place upgrade in which this method will download a whole new operating system from the web and use it to override our current windows operating system
 to fully recover any error within the windows operating system.<br />
<br />
<strong>I cannot do that in my environment. Scope and interruption is too great.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The in-place upgrade process doesn't affect any files and programs on the device but it normally takes 30 - 45 minutes to complete depending on your connection for it will need to download the entire windows operating system from the web.<br />
<br />
<strong>I would like to escalate and request fix be generated for patch.</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Regarding on that one, I would happy to grant your request its just that the affected device are connected on a Domain network in which only authorized people are only the allowed ones to make any changes on the computer.<br />
<br />
If you want, you can still escalate this case to the IT department of your company or institution for they are the authorized people by the group who can make further changes on the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>The issue occurs on non-domain connected computers too.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>please do.</strong><br />
<br />
I see. If that's the case, for us to escalate this case to the higher level team, we will need to perform the said troubleshooting step first on the non-domain connected devices and check if the issue will be resolved first.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
So that our higher level team will able to verify the exact issue that we're having for them to be able to provide appropriate and immediate assistance once they handle this case on their end.<br />
<br />
Or if you want, you can subscribe to our Assure Plan Service in which this subscription will grant you a VIP access to Microsoft for us to be able to escalate this case to the higher department.<br />
<br />
May I know how would you like us to proceed?<br />
<br />
<strong>Please escalate. I can verify that uninstalling the patch on a non-domain connected machine corrects the issue.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>...or using one that has not been patched yet.</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I would love to escalate this case right away for you. What I can do is to take note of this issue and inform our higher level team about this. Since we have verified that uninstalling the patch will able to correct the issue, then we will have to uninstall
 the said update at the moment for us to be able to use properly the devices together with the printer.<br />
<br />
<strong>thank you</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you very much for understanding. And I thank you as well for the patience and cooperation you have shown all throughout the chat.<br />

Yes. Please do keep it handy for future purposes and you can use it to contact us either through phone or chat.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>How and when should I expect updates?</strong><br />

<p>The only type of scaling that Word itself offers is to a particular paper size other than the one chosen in the Page Layout dialog. That can be selected from the bottom dropdown on the Print page:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ee64aca-2217-4943-b356-a9144179eb49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ee64aca-2217-4943-b356-a9144179eb49" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need a percentage scaling, that may be offered by the Printer Properties dialog, which is provided by your printer driver rather than by Word. Each manufacturer, and sometimes each model, has a different dialog, so you'll have to consult the printer's
 help file to find the scaling option. For example, here's a portion of one from my Canon printer:</p>

<h2>            Pictures with links in emails not showing</h2>
                    <p>Ok, i use my hotmail account on my iPhone and PC, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the mail app from iOS at my iPhone and for PC (Windows 10, updated) i use Firefox and I have everything updated, Java, acrobat, plugins, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fromt time to time, I receive emails that have a picture in it and the picture has a link (you click on the pic it opens the brower /takes you to another tab) the problem is that, I have no problem doing this at my iPhone, however is at my PC where, the
 email is just blank... I know the pictures are there because I can see the same email at my iPhone with the emails, bot no, it just won't display at my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Chrome and the pictures appear like little broken boxes, at least here if you click on it, takes you to the link, but still no solution to have this properly displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the add to your safe list email and enabling the content (attachments, images, etc) from safe list and nothing: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oattach/cannot-view-images-from-within-outlookcom/531c83cd-4a6d-4b82-aea0-245a351b46c7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also read another treads with similar issues and funny thing, no real solution to this exact problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and just FYI, If I try to forward the email... there you go, the pictures are properly displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Keys getting automatically pressed and Screen moving automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have been using a Nokia Lumia 520 for the past 10 months. Recently, since last week, i have facing a new problem. Whenever am going to type anything in Office or Whatsapp or any other app, the keys are getting automatically pressed in the keyboard.
 To get rid of that problem, i have to side lock down my phone, then open it again to use the keyboard. But that helps for around 10 minutes, again the same thing. Apart from this, whenever, i try to swipe any screen, it continues swiping on its own for few
 seconds, and then gets locked totally. I have to go through the whole lock process then it gets over. But the same thing happens after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Please help me out, and NO HARD RESET! CANT RISK LOSING ALL MY DATA! Is there any screen problem? please let me know!</p>

</p><p>A&nbsp;hard reset might cure your screen problem, but it is unlikely. flexing the screen might re-align whatever part of the capacitive interface is loose, but this is temporary at best. There is something wrong with the way the capacitive layer is bonded to
 the screen, to the glass and the rest of the body. something is peeling loose, or badly connected. you are looking at sending your phone in for repair, or more likely replacement, which is kind of like a hard reset, only worse since even data recovery experts
 cant recover data from a device that never had it in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your data is not backed up, it might as well already be lost. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;phone is an extremely fragile place to keep it, you could lose it, have it stolen,&nbsp;and now&nbsp;it is&nbsp;broken. be grateful that it is broken in such a way that might let you recover it first. then look up the work 'backup' in a paper dictionary and do not even
 touch another computing device until you understand and practice the concept</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of your data should be synchronised in from other sources, your email, contacts calendars are stored in the cloud, your phone merely accesses them. after a hard reset you simply re-sync.</p>
<p>Your photos are either backed up to OneDrive, or downloaded to your PC over USB. Data stored in apps is the responsibility of those apps, but most also sync their data with some service.

<br />
<span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
</span><br />
Provide more details to help you better.<br />
<br />
1) Through which browser are you accessing Excel Online?<br />
<br />
2) What happens when you manually enter the choices instead of pasting it? <br />
<br />
I was unable to reproduce this issue when I manually entered the lines. <br />

            <p>So to add a bit more to this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I count up the number of characters in the long description I get a little over 1000 (but NOT 1024)</p>
<p>If I create a new questions with short answers I can add 283 choices ( 1,2,3 through to 283 ) although this only equates to 741 characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So questions....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there a limit to the number characters allowed in a choices question?</p>
<p>2) Is there a limit to the number of choices allowed in a choices question?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is Andrew Stegmaier, and I'm the Program Manager in charge of Surveys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're correct to note that the limit to the number of questions in a choices question comes from the number of characters in the "Choices" field, not the number of questions itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you hit "save" Excel Surveys is parsing what you've typed in the Choices field and adding a character to delimit separate questions. This parsed field can't exceed 1024 characters. So when you had a list of 283 choices that had 741 total (pre-parsing)
 characters, the parsing operation added another 283 characters, which took you to the 1024 limit (283 + 741 =1024).</p>

If you visit this link, you will notice that this is a commercial program, not built into Excel. It is easy to obtain from this page.&nbsp;

Hi, </p>
<p>Please include the following code and follow the instructions to create the waterfall chart.</p>
<p>'Steps to create the Waterfall Chart:<br />
'1.Copy the Range of cells for which the chart is to be created to Sheet 1<br />
'2.Select the copied range. For example, A4:E5<br />
'3.Press Ctrl+Q or Run Macro AddWaterfallChart<br />
'4.The data required to build the Waterfall chart will be created in Sheet 2<br />
'5. Row 2 in Sheet2 will serve as input data for the water fall chart. The rest of the cells are calculated automatically.<br />
'6.The cells(upto row 7) in sheet 2 can be copied to other files and chart can be created based on the data<br />

            <p>I know this topic is over a year old but I just wanted to thank you Suresh! This code has been extremely helpful and has helped me create quick and easy Waterfall charts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could maybe help me with a modification. Would it be possible to alter the code so that you could have&nbsp;more than one interim&nbsp;stopping points?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, I am trying to walk expenses from 2012 to 2013 to 2014. So my ends would be 2012 and 2014&nbsp;and 2013 would be in the middle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

Unfortunately in excel 2003 the macro hangs and I'm not able either to manually edit the range to manage the effects or to understand why the macro hangs.<br />
<br />
Thx in advance</p>

            Hi Ib-Auken
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You can use the below formula
<br />=TRUNC(LEFT(A2,LEN(A2)-3)/60,0)&amp;":"&amp;MOD(LEFT(A2,LEN(A2)-3),60)&amp;"."&amp;RIGHT(A2,3)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8dd2eaef-72aa-4785-a320-9b78166d9bc0?upload=true" />

<p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>I have tried the formula, but am getting "There's a problem with this formula".</p>
<p>Does the Column A need to be formattet as "Text", "Numbers" or !? And how about Column B !?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping out :)</p>

            I have assumed pure numbers. This won't work for text. Column B is general format.
<br />
<br />If this is not working, I will like to see few data in your Excel file.
<br />
<br />Request you to please prepare and upload a sample / dummy file sans confidential / sensitive data to Onedrive and share the link? It will help me to give prompt and right solution.

<p>Thanx everyone :)<br />
<br />
I ended up with this formula:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/523b0ef8-199b-4737-a39f-849f65b4df2b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/523b0ef8-199b-4737-a39f-849f65b4df2b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So with good help, pointing in the right direction, and a little tweaking, I ended up with what i needed :)<br />
<br />
The "longer" formulas didn't work, but maby that's because I'm using Danish/Faroese format on the system, and Excel didn't "like" me trying to use/make custom format mm:ss.000, but mm:ss,000 was OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Thanks alot, everyone...</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a question about text message in PDA</p>
<p>Is there any way to backup the text message in my PDA (O2 XDA Ignito with WM6.1)</p>
<p>I have quite lots of message store inside my pda, and everytime I want to open my inbox or write message, it takes sometimes to open the folder.
</p>
<p>I am thinking to store it in other places instead of delete it. but, I can't find any option for me to backup or move my text message to other place.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Hanson</p>

<p>Suggest, you install latest public build 16299 first, then wait until Dona announces new insider build for fast level. Dona has delayed new insider build last week and this week for a bug with UWP which maybe even effects the current insider download. Have
 seen quite a few new insiders having your same error.</p>

            If you are on XP it will not upgrade to Win10, why did it change well it's like everything else improvements so that it will be faster with more options as for not working well it's XP and it's not supported by Microsoft anymore, If it was my system I
 would update to Win7 just saying.
