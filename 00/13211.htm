<h2>            deleting or moving emails in MAC does not reflect on Outlook server or Ipad</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Original title: issues with outlook.com account on mac</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running an outlook.com account on both iPad and Mac. If I delete an email on iPad this replicates at the server, no problem. If I delete or move an email on the Mac, there is no change at the server or iPad. Any suggestions?
</p>
<div>Also on the Mac I cannot move emails from the mail account to an offline folder...</div>

<p>Thanks for reaching out to us and letting us know about your account's concerns. As I understand your post, you are having issues with your account added in a mail program in Mac. You wanted to see the changes that you made to your account via Mac on Outlook.com
 online account. Though on your Ipad, you can see the changes on your online account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us to be able to determine that cause of this behavior, please confirm to us what protocol you used when you add your Outlook.com account to Mac (Example, is it via POP or via IMAP) and the settings that you used when you configured the account to Mac.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, please refer to MAC Support for your issue on unable to move emails from mail account to an offline folder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Should you have questions about Outlook.com, please feel free to come back anytime.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!<br />

            Many thanks for your reply.
<div>The account is set up on imap with settings as follows:</div>

            Hi Rhyan O,
<div><br />
<div>I have checked all the settings and even deleted the account and re-set it up again but still having problems. It appears that other users are having a similar issue at the following thread:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/imap-mail-stays-in-inbox-when-i-delete-it-from-my/ae12dbd3-a3c3-480f-ae3d-1593dfda7f5a?page=2</div>
<div><br />
<div>With the most detailed description below, which is exactly what I am experiencing. The moderator in that forum suggested a new thread be started....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Incidentally, I note that in my mail preferences, the outgoing server is set to smpt-mail.outlook.com whereas if I right click on one of the folders in the mailboxes / get account info. / tab - summary, this shows the server as smtp.live.com - not sure
 if this has anything to do with it but seems a bit strange?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope you guys can help get this fixed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Duncan</div>

<div>I don't have an issue with GMail. &nbsp;I only used the reference to GMail to explain everyone's point, that Outlook.com IMAP email doesn't behave properly.
<div><br />
<div>I am currently using the Mail application in Mac OS X 10.8.5, connecting to my outlook.com mail account via IMAP. &nbsp;I am also using the outlook.com website, plus an iPhone using Exchange Active Sync to connect to the same outlook.com address.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is an example of my problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;I receive a new email. &nbsp;It instantly shows up on the outlook.com website, my iPhone, and when Mail on my Mac laptop retrieves my inbox, it shows up there too (it's set to sync every 15 minutes).</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. &nbsp;If I delete any email via the outlook.com website, it instantly is deleted from my iPhone, as well as my Mac desktop (on next sync). &nbsp;As far as I can tell, the deleted message is moved to the trash folder.&nbsp;<b>WORKS AS EXPECTED.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>3. &nbsp;If I delete any email via my iPhone, it instantly is deleted from the outlook.com website, as well as my Mac desktop (on next sync). &nbsp;As far as I can tell, the deleted message is moved to the trash folder.&nbsp;<b>WORKS AS EXPECTED.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>4. &nbsp;If I delete any email via my Mac desktop, it's never deleted from either the outlook.com website, or my iPhone. &nbsp;It just stays there. &nbsp;<b>DOES NOT WORK AS EXPECTED</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let me know if you need any more information. &nbsp;I believe this is the problem everyone seems to be having. &nbsp;Using a gmail account (different email) using the same examples, everything stays in sync and works as expected. &nbsp;I'm just trying to get the
 same functionality.</div>

    <title>Unable to change region from China in Bing settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to change region from China in Bing settings</h2>
                    I have a recently acquired a new&nbsp;Nokia Lumia running windows 10.Yesterday I used Bing to search on a subject.The results appeared in Chinese.I was unable to change the regional settings and then carried out a hard reset. (now on reset no. 4)As soon as
 I connected to my home wifi the same problem appeared. Although the phone settings are English region and language the search engine settings state that Bing is set to People's republic of China ,whenever I try to reset to UK it immediately returns to the
 Bing Home page in Chinese text. I have had no help from O2 and other than spend my day visiting the local dealer 7 miles away I am stumped .Any suggestions?I think other people have experienced this&nbsp; but I have not seen a solution Thanks in advance. Paul

<p>Hi Ramesh, I had tried all of the above before your response &nbsp;but was not successful as it would not allow me to save the changes before returning to the Chinese version. However as I felt it only happened after logging in to my home wifi I took the phone
 to my son's home and had no issues when connected to his Wifi.On returning home I re-booted my router and the problem has now been resolved, not sure why but the phone is functioning correctly now. Thanks for your reply.</p>

    <title>Vista &#43; WM6 not syncing... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eriktp2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista &#43; WM6 not syncing...</h2>
                    I bought a HTC TP2 a few weeks ago. Tried to synchronize it with my laptop (Vista 32-bit and Outlook 2007). Didn't work... Tried all the tips and tricks i foud on the internet and called 3 hours with HTC-helpdesk. After ending the relationships and establishing
 new, changing the mail-profile in Outlook, running the diagnostic tool on Outlook, reinstall Outlook... still no syncing. Yesterday i connected my phone with a XP-computer and activesync 4.5... Guess what? Syncronizing!!! Back to Vista and WM 6.1... not syncronizing.
<br />
<br />
To be exact: my notes are synchronized, but my calender and tasks are not. Any ideas here?

<h2>            Deleting fonts seldom, if ever, used</h2>
                    How are fonts safely deleted to save space and which ones shouldn't be touched because they are part of windows OS? &nbsp;Also, what is "YAMMER"?

            <p>The link Joanna gave explains how to delete fonts, but it doesn't say anything about which ones you shouldn't delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, be aware that deleting fonts -- even a lot of fonts -- isn't going to save all that much space. In Windows 10 with Office 365, the total size of the C:\Windows\Fonts folder is only about 400 MB. On most modern drives, that's a drop in the bucket.
 To some people, though,&nbsp;it's more important to reduce the length of the font list in programs like Word, to make it easier to find the desired fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't located a definitive list of required fonts. However, experience says these should not be touched:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Segoe family, used for menus and various labels in Windows</li><li>the Windows "core fonts for the Web", listed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web#List_of_fonts_and_files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web#List_of_fonts_and_files</a></li><li>a few of the "dingbats" fonts such as Symbol, Wingdings, and Webdings</li><li>Cambria Math, used in Word's equation editor</li><li>any other fonts that you know you have used in documents that you may want to edit or print in the future</li></ul>
<p>If you ever write or view documents in languages that use non-Roman characters (Asian languages, Hebrew, Arabic, etc.) keep the fonts that are commonly used in those languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word, if a document uses a font that is not installed (or has been uninstalled) on your PC, the program will substitute a font that it considers "similar" -- although it may not seem similar at all to you. To find the substitution and understand what
 Word is doing, see&nbsp;<a href="https://wordribbon.tips.net/T012657_Finding_Words_Font_Substitutes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://wordribbon.tips.net/T012657_Finding_Words_Font_Substitutes.html</a>.</p>

    <title>Outlook randomly inserting recipients AFTER pressing send &#40;since - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vnmatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook randomly inserting recipients AFTER pressing send &#40;since last Windows update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an incredibly serious issue right now. I have been using Office for many years with no hassles at all. However, I received a windows update last night and now this morning, Outlook is randomly adding recipients to my emails AFTER I press send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very concerning. I have looked on Outlook.com directly and it appears there is no problem there, but for the desktop client, it is showing an additional recipient (not even the same recipient) for my last few sent emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Windows Update history, the following were installed last night:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB3172729</p>
<p>KB890830</p>
<p>KB3176493</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of those seems to be related to Office as far as I can tell, but regardless, this problem has only appeared now, this morning... and it won't go away. As a freelance software developer, I am very much reliant on my emails and not sending sensitive information
 to the wrong client. Please help me resolve this!</p>

I was thinking of something like this: =ABS( IF(B13&lt;0,B13+DataEntry!B$52,0))&nbsp; the answer must always be a position in this cell and I could only think of using ABS.&nbsp; But this formula does not work with the cell reference.&nbsp; I am doing&nbsp; a Cash Budget so it needs

<br />
In the REPAYMENT cell it should state the following IF (B15&gt;DATAENTRY!B$52) then add the remaining amount in the repayment.&nbsp; In other words if the cell B13 is a positive amount such as 29750, and the company wish to keep cash on hand in the amount of $10000
 then the remain 19750 should be enter in B15 (Repayment Cell) <br />
<br />
Is there anyone that could help me in doing an if statement for these cells.&nbsp; For the first If statement the problem is the DataENTRY!B$52 it seems that the amount in this sheet is not adding to the amount in the cell B13.&nbsp; Why is that.&nbsp; What is wrong with
 the formula.&nbsp; In the second, I do not know how to create such and If Statement<br />
Please help me.&nbsp; It is for an assignment.<br />

ABS has no problem with cell references.&nbsp; The issue is that you are mixing positive and negative numbers.&nbsp; If B52 on the data entry sheet is a positive number than you must change the sign of one of the 2 numbers before adding them.&nbsp; So, one option is</p>
<p>=ABS( IF(B13&lt;0,B13-DataEntry!B$52,0))</p>

                    I am using N70-1(Music Edition) Cell phone but i don't know some how when i was just opening the other Nokia cell phone it was 1600 i believe but within that I believe that i inter-changed the battery's as both were(BL-5C) of both cell phone its because
 this after that instance my battery backup is bit less...<br />
But still I am not confident about it.So is there any possiblity to identify the battery is for which model or any relationship between IMEI number and battery number just to identify our cell's battery in case of these kind of problems .Pls help and suggest....

            AFAIK there is no identification on the battery that could be linked to specific IMEI number of a device, maybe you should use a black marker pen next time to mark yours, so it wouldn't get mixed with other batteries.<br />

            Sorry Rajkumar, the batteries are not dedicated to mobiles, but the last thing you can do just check you packing box, might be the number of battery is writen there.

<h2>            C6-00 Keyboard Response to Text Causes System Freeze Up</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, i just received my C6 yesterday. I m using software version v 11.2.029. As of today morning, I was trying to respond to a text message while using my keyboard. After a sentence the system halted. I was not able to use the keyboard, the on/off switch
 did not work, closing the keyboard and turning vertical did not result in portrait landscape. Basically the system froze up. I had to remove the battery for a while and restart it. I then tried again with the same problem. I did this 5 times all with same
 results. I was able to reply to the text message using the non-keyboard version (e.g number keypad); however, I prefer to use the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone else having this problem? Nokia, do you have a recommendation/solution. Do I need to send this in for repair? I just received the phone yesterday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hold your horses for a while, I took a few days off and tried to get rid of the annoying jet lag + lack of sleep and now I'm finally back at the office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment it seems like that the SW fix will be deployed on next week (most probably on Monday morning GMT+2). I'll get the actual details + confirmation on Friday, so if there's a change in the schedule I'll let you know by then.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Publisher</h2>
                    I just created a newsletter (which I do every month) using Microsoft Publisher 2010.&nbsp; I saved the file to my computer and tried to open it. I receive a notice saying "Publisher has detected a problem in the file you are trying to open. To protect your
 computer, Publisher will not open the file. Any ideas as to why? I need this printed today. So frustrating.

            <p>I'm afraid the culprit is the 8 years old battery in the BH-503.</p>
<p>Does it work on battery power for some hours after one hour of recharge?<br />
If so, use it until the low battery warning blinks and beeps, then recharge again.<br />
Also please try another Nokia charger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 2-3 charging cycles fail to restore normal functionality, then the official advice is consult the retailer for a refund or replacement of the headset. (It is out of official Nokia/Microsoft support for years, only the

<p>
</p><p>Lithium batteries wear out over time also in a 'new' item on the shelf in a store.<br />
Any device or accessory with a lithium battery older than 5 years is a gamble.</p>
<p>The battery in BH-503 is non-removable, officially.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t deleted OneNote pages appear in recycle bin&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzzzqwert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t deleted OneNote pages appear in recycle bin&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally deleted a page from OneNote while using the latest (12/30/13) Android version of OneNote (15.0.2 etc.) and I cannot locate the page anywhere on the Android device and I incorrectly assumed it would be in the SkyDrive online recycle bin but
 it wasn't. It's nowhere on my PC and I've looked in every folder related to OneNote on my laptop or online.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is my question...why are pages deleted on Android (and maybe other mobile devices) not displayed in the recycle bin of OneNote online? If I delete a page while using my laptop it moves it to the recycle bin so why doesn't the same thing happen when
 the pages are deleted from a mobile device since they all sync with the online OneNote on SkyDrive?</p>

    <title>Word Files Move After Save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyberphonics  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Files Move After Save</h2>
                    I think this could possibly be related to this other thread but my issue isn't exactly like this:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/officeversion_other-office_install/ms-office-desktop-icons-move-after-i-modify-and/b2221e29-bf6c-4ba1-b01e-e9cd38d5ff96</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I usually open a folder, click on a Word document to open it and work on it, keeping the folder open in the background for convenience rather than using File&gt;Open. I noticed that after I open a file and make changes, when I save it, the file jumps out
 of place to the bottom of the file list in the folder. It doesn't matter which list view I'm using and it doesn't matter how I have the files sorted.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I figured this might be related to the issue people were having with files saved on the desktop moving after modifying them only this is happening in my folders, not on the desktop. Any suggestions? I've been using Word 2010 for a while now and I don't
 recall it doing this before. Any suggestions?</div>

            It sounds like you have Windows Explorer set to the details view and sorted by date modified-ascending.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you modify a file that is anything other than the latest, on save, it will move to the latest position in the list.&nbsp; This is exactly what I want.&nbsp;
 But if it's not what you want, switch to the default name (alphabetical) sort.<br />

            Thanks all. I wasn't expecting a response from Microsoft, just someone who may have a suggestion on how to fix this behavior. I don't have it sorted by modified, that was the first thing I checked when I saw it happen, I have it sorted by name and like
 I said, the list view doesn't matter.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It's annoying because the folder will have a ton of word documents in it and for what I'm doing that I don't feel like going into, I usually have to change the name of the file in relation to something after I modify it and I usually have to do a few at
 a time.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>With the file jumping to the end of the list after being modified now, that means I have to scroll all the way to the end of the list to find them again so I can rename them or hit refresh so they'll all jump back to the right place and then scroll back
 to them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything does go back where it should be when the folder is reopened or refreshed but that doesn't help me as I go. It used to be the file would just sit there. It's just tedious and adds more time with this happening now so I figured I'd ask in case
 this is a new issue/feature with so many people complaining about this movement of files in regards to Office 2010 specifically. If it's just one of those weird quirks that a lot of people are getting and a lot of others aren't, I'll just deal with it.</div>

<h2>            Saving Styles</h2>
                    I have saved a formatted word document both as a template and as a quick style. My goal is to import a mindmap into word and then use quick styles to set the formatting to what I want. My problem with my current approach is 1. the template has words and
 it would require me to paste the imported document into the template and move the text around (surely there's an easier way?) and 2. saving as a quick style doesn't actually seem to save any of the formatting I've created in the document. For the second one,
 I've gone to the change style -&gt; select style set -&gt; and save it as a quick style. The formatting doesn't transfer (for some reason it's normal all over again). &nbsp;Does anyone know a fix?&nbsp;

            There are a number of very separate issues here.<br />
<br />
Template is a special document type intended to hold resources for other documents.<br />
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Templates in Microsoft Word</a>
<br />
<br />
A template can hold <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Styles</a>. Some of those can be designated as Quick Styles. Designating something as a "Quick Style" controls its placement in the Quick Styles gallery. It does not change anything
 about the formatting of the style. A document cannot be saved as a Quick Style.<br />

<br />
<br />
If you have an existing template with styles you want to use, you can do a number of things.

<li>One of those is to attach the template to your existing document.&nbsp; When you do that check the box to update styles from the template. (Go back later and uncheck this box, though.)
</li><li>You could create AutoText entries formatted in your style and save those in your template. Such an entry could contain a

    <title>Fillable form &#34;laggy&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fillable form &#34;laggy&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I created a fillable form using Microsoft Word with Active X controls including radio buttons, checkboxes, and text boxes. The form is somewhat complex with charts and several pages, and I notice a lag when I scroll from page to page with the boxes of the
 fillable content turning black. I was wondering if there was any way to avoid this? I appreciate your input.</p>

<p>I believe Charles is correct in pointing at the ActiveX controls -- especially when there are a lot of them in one document -- as the cause of the lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read at least the "Appropriateness for the Task" section of&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140269(office.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140269(office.10).aspx</a>&nbsp;for a summary
 of the drawbacks of ActiveX objects. Although the article is old, nothing has changed in the meantime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue you'll encounter in replacing those controls with content controls is that there is no exact equivalent of radio buttons. You can use dropdown list content controls instead.</p>

<p>Unless you have users using Word 95, I urge you to use Content Controls rather than legacy Active X controls.</p>
<p>1. They do not work on macs or mobile devices.</p>
<p>2. Users have to permit macros to run if you put any commands in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Content Controls have been around since Word 2007.</p>

<p>hi jason,</p>
<p>firstly, i’d like to explain that the url like <a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bing.com</a> is not supported by page viewer web part. in this situation, we can use the url like
<a href="https://bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://bing.com</a> to display the bing page in page viewer web part.</p>
<p>meanwhile, i’d like to confirm if you have enabled the custom script. to check it, please go to
<strong>sharepoint admin center</strong>&gt; <strong>settings</strong>. turn the <strong>
custom script</strong> on as the following shows.</p>

<p>note: the settings related to custom script may take up to 24 hours to take effect.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. about “they can’t work”, have you seen any error messages? if so, could you send a screenshot for our reference?</p>
<p>2. a screenshot of your permission on the site level.</p>

    <title>MOVIES &#38; TV APP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariannemoravecka  say:</h3>
<h2>            MOVIES &#38; TV APP</h2>
                    Ever since the update of Windows 10 last November, the app won't play/import FLV (Flash Video) and .Webm files, unless they are converted to an MP4 first. Once converted, the video quality is poor. None of the recent updates have a fix to this as of yet.
 Has anyone else had this issue?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I haven't had this specific issue, but I wouldn't say it's abnormal; .flv flash files were really intended to be played within a browser (ditto .webm),&nbsp;and the .webm file container isn't supported by Windows players unless something has changed very recently.&nbsp;
 Regarding your poor quality, you may get better results converting those files into .avi instead of .mp4.&nbsp;
<em>In general,</em> there's less compression with .avi,&nbsp;but because these are container formats vs. actual codecs, it may depend more on the original file and/or the player being used.&nbsp;&nbsp;You also may want to consider trying out a free player that can read .webm
 files like VLC, which would take the conversion issue out of the quality equation:</p>

            Again, the App currently doesn't support .avi files either, unless they are convrted to an .MP4. This wasn't an issue until the Windows update last November. The VLC Player is not very "user friendly" and the current basic version of Realtimes player only
 gives you a limited amount of space, for video files unless you pay for the full version.

            Movies &amp; TV and WMP should play .avi files fine as long as they're not DRM-managed (Audio Video Interleave is a Microsoft-specific introduction), I just played an .avi file on both with no issues.&nbsp; I've never played with Realplayer, so I'm ignorant on
 that one.&nbsp; Windows players should have never been able to parse .webm files without a separate codec pack installed (for VP8 video/Vorbis audio, which are Google-owned)&nbsp;so if you were able to do it before that's the first I've heard of it; but again, this
 may be an issue with the actual codec and not the file extension/container.&nbsp; VLC is generally regarded as the easiest to use player around, but Winamp is also listed on webm's site as being compatible; I haven't used that player in at least ten years, so again
 I don't know there.&nbsp; Because both of the formats you mentioned are designed specifically to work within either Flash-enabled or HTML5 browsers, you may want to try opening those files within your browser and see

    <title>Any way to add vertical&#47;horizontal lines to folder pane to make - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any way to add vertical&#47;horizontal lines to folder pane to make parent&#47;child folders easier to navigate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In outlook, the small indent used to differentiate between folders and sub folders is not enough for me. With some vertical or horizontal lines it would take a fraction of a second to make sense of the folder pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See this reddit thread for comparison (Ignore the content, just an example of how it is formatted). Notice the vertical lines and slight off coloring that make it very easy to see parent-child relationships.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8341345e-64e7-48c9-ad07-7f187500c015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8341345e-64e7-48c9-ad07-7f187500c015" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now compare that to Outlook:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The solid black background makes it harder to follow. Is the Archives folder under Active Assignments or Assignments? It should only take half a second to see, but this set up makes it hard.</p>
