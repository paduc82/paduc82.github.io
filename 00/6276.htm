    <title>Insert Symbol menu in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petergodbois  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insert Symbol menu in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p><span>I recently upgraded from Word 2003 to Word 2010.</span></p>

<p><span>I've discovered that the
<strong>Insert Symbol</strong> menu in Word 2010 is missing a few characters.</span></p>

<p><span>In
<strong>Subset: Basic Latin</strong>, the <strong>Latin Small Letters E and O With Tilde</strong>, that were included in my old Word 2003, are missing in Word 2010.</span></p>

<p><span>Example:&nbsp;the
</span><span>ẽ</span><span> with a tilde from a Word 2003 doc to show what it looks like.</span></p>

<p><span>I need the e and o vowels with tilde to use in trancribing manuscripts that were written in the 16th Century, which used those symbols. The omission of those symbols from Word
 2010 seems to have been oversight, rather than a deliberate exclusion. How can it be corrected?</span></p>

            The Insert Symbol dialog (even in Word 2003) can be resized; resizing changes the location&nbsp;of any given symbol within a row. Often it is handy to make the dialog very large, to save scrolling, but sometimes it can be more helpful to make it small enough
 to make symbols less likely to "hide" in the jumble.

<h2>            HD7 - error when getting email&#47;synching with Hotmail</h2>
                    
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>I have an HTC HD7 that has been running very well since initial purchase but seeing very odd errors lately in regards to synching my email with my Live mail account.</p>
<p>Starting roughly 10-14 days ago, when I click on the live tile for hotmail on the front page, I get an error message that there is an error in the setup for m.hotmail.com and I should contact a support technician.&nbsp; If I go into settings, email accounts,
 the Windows Live entry will show a notice message of "attention required".&nbsp; If I click on it, I get a very similar error message that the setup is wrong.</p>
<p>Both messages will say that last synch was (randomly) 1 day to a week ago even though I DO sporadically get my email.&nbsp; Things will work fine and I will get email quickly randomly, then I will also get this error randomly for a couple of hours.&nbsp; I went into
 the account config last night, unchecked email, rebooted, checked email again and now I dont see that error as much, but in settings-email config- I see the status message of "not up-to-date".</p>
<p>The actual error message I get when I click on the email live tile is:</p>
<p>Windows Live Error<br />
Last updated about a week ago (though I just got current email)<br />
We're having a problem connecting to<br />
m.hotmail.com.&nbsp; Try again later.<br />
Last tried 2 miutes ago<br />
Error code: 80072EE2</p>
<p>Any help with this?&nbsp; This problem is happening randomly 3-20 times a day, started roughly two weeks ago, and nothing changed. live account still active and running, nothing changed on the phone.</p>

<p>yup.. using live calendar, which has synched but appears to be out of date maybe?&nbsp; I can hit the link and login and it shows my calendar... no problems there.&nbsp; Phone still throwing errrors.</p>
<p>Just talked to the Zune support line and they are telling me hard reset is the only "solution".. which I haven't done yet.</p>

            do you have the latest version of WhatsApp installed from the Store? and does your data connection work correctly in other apps? if so, would liaise with WhatsApp directly as to what the problem is.

<p>Yes. Latest version after it went missing for a while. If I install/reinstall, would I lose the file? As it hasn't officially downloaded? Wishful thinking I guess, lol. :p</p>

<p>
</p><p>If your Office application suite is giving you intermittent problems or not starting at all, the OffCAT diagnostic tool is the first place to start. While OffCAT is not a 'Fix-It-All' tool, it can identify problem areas from a frequently updated central
 storage of known problems and suggest steps to take where you arrive at a solution. The programs from the Office suite that are addressed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access</li><li>Excel</li><li>InfoPath</li><li>OneNote</li><li>Outlook</li><li>PowerPoint</li><li>Publisher</li><li>Word</li></ul>
<p><span>If is not the purpose of this article to simply reproduce the information already available through OffCAT's own screens or its accompanying DOCX ReadMe document. Rather, I will try to provide some Quick Start steps to guide you to some immediate results
 and suggest some direction for what you can do with those results. In the event of any&nbsp;</span><span>confusion between this article and the official OffCAT documentation, the official documentation should be assumed as the&nbsp;authority. The most current documentation
 is available from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">OffCAT quickly identifies your Office application suite (or suites if multiple versions reside on the computer) and examines many facets of your computer's individual configuration against a set of known issues.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">While there are some requirements for installing and running OffCAT, they are minimal and any system with one of the Office versions that OffCAT is designed to analyse *should* already meet those requirements. For the vast majority

 to be run, as if the likely hood that Office has gone south is fairly high.<br />

<h3> andrewz.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 Excel AutoRecover not working at all--settings all seem correct</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Excel in Office 2016. &nbsp;The AutoRecover is never saving any files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Excel Options - Save:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- "Save AutoRecover information every10 minutes" is checked</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- "Keep the last AutoRecovered version if I close without saving" is also checked</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- AutoRecover file location is set, and the folder is easily accessible thru Windows Explorer, so no permissions or access problems. &nbsp;I saved test Word and Excel files to the folder with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears as though no backups at all for Word, Excel or PowerPoint have been saved since I bought the computer and installed Office 2016 6 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No clue what the problem is, other similar posts here on the forums have only offered suggestions to check the settings I just listed out. &nbsp;Mine are fine. &nbsp;I discovered the problem after accidentally deleting an entire sheet out of an Excel file, and the
 only backup I apparently have is from my previous computer (6 months old). &nbsp;I'm resigned to the fact I've lost that data, but I'd really like AutoRecover to work moving forward. &nbsp;It just won't save anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone that can help.</p>

 files. </p>

            <p>I didn't delete the Excel file, I deleted one sheet IN the file. &nbsp;I still have the file, but was hoping to retrieve an automatic backup of it before I made the mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my old harddrive there were dozens backups in the AutoRecover directory, its just the most recent was 6 months old. &nbsp;I'm just not sure why there would be so many on the old system, but absolutely none on the new one.</p>

            Andree--that actually makes sense. &nbsp;My new computer has been MUCH more reliable, and not crashing nearly as often, thus no emergency recovery files have been saved. &nbsp;Its entirely possible everything is fine, the AutoRecover just hasn't been needed.&nbsp;

<h2>            Office 2013 Shows Wrong UPN For Domain Account</h2>
                    I have changed my domain account's UPN in Active Directory from @old.com to @new.com. This is the account I am signed in to Windows 8.1 with and thus automatically signed into Office 2013 with.<br />
<br />
However in Office 2013 it always shows my account signed in as @old.com. I have deleted the profile and identities cache from the registry but it still refuses to show my new UPN.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final feture in Word is only a way to see the document as it is supposed to be with all the markup accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to permanently remove markup you have to either ignore or accept all the markup in the document.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you select the Accept button and choose the Accept all feature you will get the same result as with final but your markup will be permanently removed after saving the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is no good&nbsp;automagic way of merging two Publisher publications but you could try the&nbsp;described by Mary Sauer:
<a href="http://msauer.mvps.org/combining_publisher_documents.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msauer.mvps.org/combining_publisher_documents.htm</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can manually copy and paste the page content from one publication to the other. If you Ctrl+A to select everything on the page, Ctrl+Shift+G to group everything&nbsp;and copy Ctrl+C&nbsp;then you can generally paste entire pages at one time. Once you have pasted
 Ctrl+V&nbsp;the group on a new blank page and arranged it you can ungroup by again Ctrl+Shift+G.</p>

<h2>            Slower Performance After Planner Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest Microsoft update has caused Planner to be incredibly slow.&nbsp; There's lag time in creating new tasks, opening the tasks screen, etc.&nbsp; It's gotten so inefficient that we are considering no longer using it.&nbsp;Has this been reported by others and will
 this be addressed in the short term?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;when coming into my plan now, it defaults to a bucket grouping that I don't use.&nbsp; Every time I have to change it to my preferred view.&nbsp; How can I change this so it opens to the view I want to use every time?</p>

<p>Hi Mew_1980,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the slowness, I would like to know whether this occurs on all plans. If possible, please create a new plan so that we can create a baseline and compare it to other plans that exhibit slowness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to know whether the slowness only occurs when loading (creating/opening something) or there is a general lag in the interface. It would be helpful if you could record a video for
 us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding default view, there was a
<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Planner/New-UI-changes-rolling-out-in-Planner/m-p/88711#M952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
UI change</a> on July 19th that implemented this. It is not feasible to change the default view to Progress. Given the situation, we suggest posting to the
<a href="https://planner.uservoice.com/forums/330525-microsoft-planner-feedback-forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Planner UserVoice</a> to provide feedback. this is the best way to make our products and services better for you and others.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Your phone is not worthless. It still works as a single SIM phone. But I know what you mean - I have a dual SIM phone and 2G will be turned off in Australia by early next year. The problem, at the moment, is that almost all Dual SIM phones (Windows and Android)
 have the exact same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that there are a couple of Android phones that work with 3G/4G on both SIMs at the same time, but I also hear that this causes them to have limited battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully new phones will come out soon with better specifications. I'd hate to go back to carrying two phones.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would disagree. What I would say is worthless is your ability to check if a product (in this case, your phone) is suitable for your purposes. A simple internet search would have found this out. Anyway, good luck finding a more suitable phone. Currently
 they are rare.</p>

            My main take away from your helpful comments is that you are a dick. Try asking Microsoft store about this, they know nothing. Or perhaps call att. They said they would research the problem. Read the forums, it's just now coming to light.

                    <p><span>When trying to send an attachment of a picture to an email I click on attach files (in my hotmail account) and it takes me to my library.&nbsp; When I click my pictures it takes me into folders that are out of date.&nbsp; I have since edited/deleted
 the folders it shows.&nbsp; If I try and click on any of these folders it says that they are empty (which is correct as they no longer exist).&nbsp; The problem is I cannot access any of my actual pictures to send as attachments. I have tried to access them via my c
 drive/users etc but neither my pictures or my documents even show up when searching this way!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems to only be a problem on outgoing messages as if I try to 'save as' a downloaded picture from an email it&nbsp;shows my current picture library no problem.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This happened in both Internet explorer 9 &amp; 10.</span></p>

    <title>Printing from Excel 2007 gives &#34;out of memory&#34; on the printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grades00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing from Excel 2007 gives &#34;out of memory&#34; on the printer</h2>
                    Not sure if this would be better off in the HP forums, but the issue ONLY happens while printing from Excel.<br />
I've got an HP LJ 1522nf and whenever i try and print out of Excel I get the above error on the printer after a couple minutes, even on a test spreadsheet with 1 cell of text. No weird formatting, links, pictures etc.<br />
Windows shows that the document failed to print. I've tried changing the spooler settings, Page file settings, reinstalling the driver, and everything else i can think of.<br />
Anyone else have any ideas?<br />
Thanks!!<br />

</p><p>We understand that you're trying to sign-in your account on the Messenger app in a Windows Phone. Facebook and Messenger no longer support older Windows platform. To fix this, you'll need to update your phone to Windows 10 Mobile and it will work again after
 you update the app. If your device doesn't support Windows 10, as an alternative solution, you can use your phone browser to use its services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if your device is eligible for the upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, you'll need to download and run the

            <p>No, not try to install wmc. Many sites reports, that windows recognizes itself as Windows 8.1 with multimedia pack, because of this you will get not Windows 10 updates any longer and maybe other things not work too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used WMC too in the past. In my case for looking television with an USB-TV-Stick. I used another program to do this now, and hope that WMC will come back in the final Version.</p>

            M$ has stated that WMC will be removed in W10 and as a consolidation they will offer a free DVD player program for those like me who paid for the add on to 8.1, Like I use WMC for DVD's.&nbsp;For me&nbsp;the primary feature is the tuner w-guide programing. I hope
 they allow integration since it is basically the same platform as 8.1...Or maybe someone with the skills will provide an instruction path for the end user to do this on their own.

<p>Hello, This is not available, If you use your upgrade method. Windows 10 will remove the Media Centre. I had it too. some people may try to manually move from previous windows version as a copy is kept on the system. and my advise to them is this -
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "TO ANYONE READING IT WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS, PLEASE DONT WAIST YOUR TIME"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to Anti-Climatic - Not to sure if they will incorporate in the future. I had it too.&nbsp; However there is a good side with an alternative being offered. Not sure if it's installed automatically dependant on version or even if you have to present your WMC
 Key to Microsoft. Hope this helps in all fairness I have tested what you get with the Windows 10 Home Edition and this version and there players are awesome. Just my opinion though Mate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this Helps<br />

<p>If this was just about a DVD player I would use VLC.</p>
<p>The main reason is the OTA TV tuner w-guide and DVR scheduler recording.</p>
<p>They need to create a standalone installer for those who paid for it.</p>

Agreed.. I still have 8.1 and dual boot because of it to watch tv on my pc. It's pretty messed up how they did away with it considering there is nothing wrong with it.

<h2>            &#34;Shut down&#34; tile update</h2>
                    <p>Wondering what that missing feature is in your Start Menu on&nbsp;Windows 10? Remember that permanent&nbsp;tile in Vista's or 7's Start Menu (that could even be personalized)? That tile in the&nbsp;bottom right corner saying "Shut down" near what there was an arrow to
 browse among other options as well. I think it would be a&nbsp;good idea to update the one we have now... I mean it would look a lot nicer. It should look like the "File Explorer" tile.</p>

<h2>            Active Sync problem with Office files</h2>
                    I have an old iPAQ 3950 which I have been syncing with a PC running XP for years.&nbsp; Recently I got an "Unresolved Item" for every MS office file.&nbsp; All the Outlook files continued to sync OK.&nbsp; After reinstalling Activesync (v4.5) and a hard reset the problem
 was resolved for Word but not for Excel.&nbsp; I can syn Excel files from the PC to the iPAQ, but any Excel file created or changed on the iPAQ will not sync back to the PC.&nbsp;
<br />

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

            Hi,<br />
By defailt the iPAQ 3900 series will save the files as .PXL which is not recognized on the desktop.&nbsp; Try saving the Excel files as .XLS and see if you can open the files on the desktop.&nbsp; Otherwise ActiveSync will try and convert the files.&nbsp; However later versions
 of ActiveSync 4.x does not include the converters and this may be the issue you are seeing.

            <p>You can insert a TITLE field in the header, but this won't help unless the actual title of the document has been added to the Title property. And the field will update when other fields in the header are updated but not necessarily immediately. A better
 approach is to use the Title style for the document title and add a STYLEREF field in the header. This will update automatically and is the most efficient solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming by "Title"&nbsp;you do mean a title that is in the document or the Title property, as opposed to the filename (for that you'd use a FILENAME field).</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>To use the Office 365 Planner Preview, there are some prerequisites, such as it requires that the entire organization be enrolled in the First Release program and After enrolling in the First Release program, you’ll need to wait for a message letting you
 know that Office 365 Planner Preview is ready to be added to your subscription(This message won’t show up right away, as it may take several days for Office 365 to get your subscription ready). More detailed information can be found it the following articles:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-Office-365-Planner-Preview-to-your-account-1843f004-8309-4ecd-9b35-17b77998b420?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add Office 365 Planner Preview to your account</a><br />

<strong>Fig.2</strong>: Time zone option in outlook.com under the account detail settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet, even after days of using the email (and clearing the browser's cache, using different browsers, restarting the browsers and even the computer itself), the time issue still persists. As seen below, the time the email is using is off by 4 hours (I've enabled
 the additional clock to show the real-time offset as indicated by the draft's saved time):<br />

<br />
<br />
</div>
In the past, I have not bother much on it but now, the accuracy of the timestamps for the (incoming) mails that I received is important for when I'm dealing with business transactions, shipping processes, and so on.<br />
<br />
Reading similar threads posted here didn't help much as I have done all that need to be done. Since I don't encounter this time zone problem on other sites, this bug has to be on Outlook Hotmail's end.

            Yes, I have already done that (refer Figure 2).<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I have found a pseudo-solution to this which is changing my country to any one that is using the UTC+8 time zone. Apparently,
<strong>Outlook doesn't support certain countries</strong> at all and as a result will default to the Universal Time (UTC).

            <p><span><strong>Hi Panos33,</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1) What
</span><span><strong>is\are</strong></span><span> the
</span><span><strong>KB article number(s)</strong></span><span> of the
</span><span><strong>updates</strong></span><span>?<br />
2) Have you made </span><span><strong>any other changes</strong></span><span> on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1-</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to check for </span><span><strong>KB article number(s)</strong></span><span>
 of the </span><span><strong>updates</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Open </span><span><strong>Windows</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>Update</strong></span><span> and select “</span><span><strong>View
 Update History</strong></span><span>”.<br />
b) Now, select “</span><span><strong>Installed</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>Updates</strong></span><span>”.<br />
c) Make a note of the </span><span><strong>KB article number(s)</strong></span><span> of the
</span><span><strong>updates</strong></span><span> and let us know by your next post.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2-</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to perform a </span><span><strong>System Restore</strong></span><span>
 to undo the changes made on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</strong></a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-system-files-and-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-system-files-and-settings</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: Performing a
</span><span><strong>System Restore</strong></span><span> will undo any changes made on your computer earlier.
 You may also lose unsaved information as well. Proceed at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><strong>Method 3-</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform
</span><span><strong>Clean Boot</strong></span><span>.<br />
Putting your system in </span><span><strong>Clean Boot state</strong></span><span> helps in identifying
 if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You need to follow the steps from the article-</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem
 by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: You need to follow
</span><span><strong>Step 7</strong></span><span> from the article to get the computer back to
</span><span><strong>Normal Startup</strong></span><span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Now try and install the updates.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, I would have you refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/no#appliesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>How to optimize Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><span>The
</span><strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong><span> feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of
</span><strong>Trusted Sites</strong><span>. The </span>
<strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong><span> feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the
