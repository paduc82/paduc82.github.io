<h2>            Windows 8.1 closed app keeps running in a background.</h2>
                    Hi. Have updated my win 8 to win 8.1 from the app store. All went ok and 8.1 looks much better in some cases. But i found one strange thing.
<div>Once im opening app or some of them and then closing ( moving them down the screen and waiting until reverse ) app's are still opened and working in a background and using RAM memory . So to close them completely i have to open task manager and to close
 app's in there. I understand that app as mail service should work in a background but app as healthy or travel or games shouldn't work in a background using&nbsp;</div>
<div>pc resourses once i have closed it it should be closed.</div>

Any "metro" app that has a live tile will continue to run (and use ram) so that it can update.&nbsp; If you dont want specific apps to run in the background turn off the live tile for it.<br />

            From the top center of the App pull down to bottom of Screen and hold until app flips. viola! .&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

            Silver thanks for your reply . :) I know how to close app correctly and yes i pulling it down from the top and waiting until it flips. but no viola then you go in to Task Manager and you see it still active and using pc resources even if life tile is off
 for this app. I think ill make a video later for better understanding what i am talking about. :)

            this is a problem&nbsp;really isn't it. my computer is rendered basically dysfunctional by all the apps running unbidden; just realised after thinking it was broken that this was the problem. i'd have thought a more elegant default would have been developed
 for thick people like me.

            Nope, no viola, nor any voila! apps with live tile remain running in the background, and need to be closed via task manager. Try it. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a problem in windows 8.

            Ok I'm getting mad for Idiotic replies. Dear SouravBagchi did you read upper posts????????? we know how to correctly close the app even alt +f4 leaves app active in a background . About 10 active app in a background eats around 1GB of memory . Guys before
 you make an answer please read uppoer posts don't write the same is written.

    <title>100&#37; CPU usage without many programs being run windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandeep1985  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; CPU usage without many programs being run windows 7</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have a WIndows 7 Home Premium 32 bit OS on a HP probook 4320s ( Intel i3 processor, 3 GB RAM ). I have a problem that even if I run no major programs ( basic prograps like winamp, freecell, 2-3 tabs in firefox/chrome, McAfee AV ), at many times, CPU utilization
 reaches 100% and the computing experience suffers drastically.<br />
<br />
I've been checking in Task manager everytime this issue comes up, however I find no particular trend in the usage data.
<br />
<br />
Following are the things I tried out but failed to identify the issue.<br />
- Reinstalling Windows 7<br />
- Uninstalling major programs ( including MS Office 2007 ) and having bare minimum stuff like hp drivers, Open Office, Adobe reader etc<br />
- Changing Antivirus from AVG to McAfee and disabling real time scanning. I always had an antivirus in my computer but this intermittent slowdown of system never used to happen around 6 months back. I'm sure nobody faces such slow performance issue in an i3
 processor 3GB RAM enabled PC because of an AV.<br />
- Shutting down web browser at that time, but then System processes like SVCHOST take over the system resources<br />
- Disabling Windows Update<br />
<br />
Can it be due to overheating problem ? I can check this out by using my laptop in an Air-conditioned room so that cooling is faster.<br />
My laptop is under warranty, so I can go to HP as well, but that would be my last resort as their service is just too bad.<br />
<br />
I'm totally frustrated now. Having two consecutive bad experiences ( once in HCL desktop and now in this HP laptop ), I am keen on trying out my luck on a Macbook next time :P<br />
<br />
Please help me out in resolving this issue.<br />

            <div>Download an application called Coretemp, should tell you you're current CPU temps.</div>
<div>it should also list the thermal Maximum for your model CPU (think it's the Tj temperature on the main window)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you've already formatted and whatnot and still get the same problem i'd suspect it may be a hardware issue like a bad memory module that could be causing memory leaks and corruption of certain applications. But without taking a closer look I couldn't
 say for sure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also verify memory issues using the windows memory diagnostic (just search for it in the start menu search)</div>
<div>next time you start the machine it will run the memory test.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You could also try a BIOS update for the laptop from the HP website.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also.. btw.. Macbooks are notorious for overheating...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

            <p><span>In Windows 7 use Ctrl+Shift+Esc rather than Ctrl+Alt+Del. It gets you to Task Manager quicker. When the computer locks select Task Manager, the Performance tab, Resource
 Monitor, and Memory tab. What are the figures for Hardware Reserved, In Use, Modified, Standby and Free?</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you download Process Explorer. This freeware utility performs a similar function to the Windows Task
 Manager but it goes much further.</span></p>
<p>For further information about Process Explorer see here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/SystemInformation/ProcessExplorer.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/SystemInformation/ProcessExplorer.mspx</a></p>
<p>When you open Process Explorer you need to customise settings. You do this by checking options on the View menu drop down. Click on Select Columns and then the Process Image
 tab. Check the boxes before Description, Image Path, Image Type, and Command Line. I suggest you also click on two other options on the View dropdown, namely Show Processes from All Users and Show Fractional CPU.</p>
<p>The extent to which you can customise is considerable. You can dramatically change what information is displayed and this leads to confusion and frustration at times.
</p>
<p>With the CPU column you will see System Idle Process frequently showing a high figure. It is important to always remember at all times that this figure represents CPU capacity
 not being used. The figure displayed is 100.00 less the CPU being used by all running processes.</p>
<p>The Processes are listed in the left column. Some names appear to be duplicated. This is not so. An example of an apparent duplication is svchost.exe. You commonly something
 like 10 instances listed. If you right click on one and select Properties, and the Image tab you will find that the Command line differs for each instance of svchost.exe. Each instance of svchost.exe serves a different group of services. You can see a list
 of those Services if you click on the Services tab.</p>
<p>When you are experiencing high CPU usage you can see which process is using the CPU. What you should then do is post the command line of the process you have identified as using
 the CPU. We can then suggest how you should investigate further in order to discover the cause of high CPU activity.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 can&#39;t access network drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesfairbairn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 can&#39;t access network drives</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think there are other people with my issue but nothing I've tried has resolved it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have 2 laptops, one running Win 8.1 and the other Win 7 Home Premium plus I have a Netgear Readynas Duo v2.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Win 7 machine works perfectly and can see the NAS, access the NAS etc plus can also see and access the Win 8.1 laptop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, the Win 8.1 laptop can't see the NAS (let alone access it). It can see the Win 7 laptop but when I try and access it it states it's not accessible and that I might not have permissions etc..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried to join the 2 laptops via a homegroup which all went through successfully (share the same passwords etc..) but the Win7 laptop doesn't show any members in the group (except itself)&nbsp;but the Win 8.1 shows the 7 laptop but nothing happens if I try and
 access folders.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So far I have ensured that both are all are in the same workgroup and no IP conflicts (as far as I can see). I can ping each device from both laptops. I've tried making tweaks to the registry from advice
<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/531992/windows-8-pro-nas-not-recognized/531998#531998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can't remember when it all stopped working but I only got the 8.1 laptop in late November and would have set it up with access to files on the network so it must have stopped in the past month.</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I tried a lot of different ways, one simple method worked for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Windows explorer</li><li>On the top navigation bar chose computer&gt;map network drive</li><li>Clearly specify the full path of the directory e.g. "\\Nasname\\directory" or "\\10.10.10.10\folder" in the "Folder". Do not browse and connect because this will give the same "0x80070035" error.</li><li>Make sure you tick both "Reconnect at sign-in" and "Connect using different credentials".</li><li>Click Finish and when asked for credentials put in your admin/user credentials.</li></ul>
<p>While I understand that the NAS needs to know which user is it allowing through but this happens even when I have turned on guest-login and only on Windows 8.1. Well, this simple way of mapping a network drive worked for me which I totally skipped trying
 to think of more complex ways. Hope this helps someone if not everyone.</p>

            <blockquote>These methods don't work for me. I, too, have two Windows 8.1 machines, one of which can see all network devices and the two NAS machines. The second laptop sees the media device portions of the NAS devices but not the data
 storage portion. I also can't access via IP from that same laptop as suggested above, in terms of mapping the drive, but on the other laptop, no problem.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi Pressdisk</p>
<p>I've just been searching on this problem and found your thread &nbsp;I may have a solution..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't accessed my NAS for quite some time, but when I tried it recently I had exactly the same problem even with media server access but not main files...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think a firmware upgrade may have inadvertently turned off file a file transfer protocol &nbsp;(CIF).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went into settings on the NAV and went through the setup wizard and noticed that all file access protocols were unchecked, I rechecked CIF and completed the wizard. &nbsp;Hey presto file access was back. Phew!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the short answer the longer answer's full of blood sweat n tears... but you dont need that.. Phew &nbsp;again!!</p>

<h2>            Wireless Network Continually Dropping from Error ID 1003</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having recent trouble out-of-the-blue with my internet randomly dropping me. &nbsp;I've looked in the event viewer and traced it to Error ID 1003's (which occur every couple of minutes or so): "Your computer was not able to renew its address from the
 network (from the DHCP Server) for the Network Card with network address 0x8CA982A7F852. The following error occurred: 0x79. Your computer will continue to try and obtain an address on its own from the network address (DHCP) server."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the basic premise behind the problem, that my laptop is having difficulties communicating with the DHCP server and thus having its IP's revoked every time it gets pinged. &nbsp;The strength of the wi-Fi signal is fine when it's connected, and the
 router hardware is all new. &nbsp;I've tried most of the basic fixes with no success, and spoke with my ISP several times, but I'm out of ideas. &nbsp;Is there something I'm missing, or anything else I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted Solutions:</p>
<p>- Resetting router</p>
<p>- Flush and renew dns</p>
<p>- Changed connection to static IP</p>
<p>- Update network adapters</p>
<p>- System restore&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Change network encryption from AES/TKIP to AES</p>
<p>- Replacing all routers/ethernet cords/etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware involved:</p>
<p>- HP dv7qte laptop running Windows 7</p>
<p>- **** TG862&nbsp;modem (AKA Comcast all-in-one Gateway)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help at all would be appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate the effort put toward trying to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>Did you check if the issue still persists in safe mode with networking?</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)"><span><span>Since you have tried most of the troubleshooting steps with no solution yet, the issue can be caused due to various other reasons. To diagnose the issue, let's try the following methods and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)"><span><span><strong>Method 1: To open the Network troubleshooter:-</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)"><span>Open the Network troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tap
<strong><span>Search</span></strong> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong><span>Search</span></strong>), enter <strong><span>network troubleshooter</span></strong> in the search box, tap or click
<strong><span>Settings</span></strong>, and then tap or click <strong><span>Identify and repair network problems</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue does not persist in safe mode with networking, perform a

</span>to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow
<strong>Step 7</strong> from the link to start the computer to <strong>Normal startup mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> </span><span>Disable the<span> </span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> <em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>

<h2>            wifi connectivity issue &#47; disconnects - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing a problem with my wifi on my ASUS F554LJ notebook.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Wifi Adapter: Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network Adapter.</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually works on start up and randomly disconnects when navigating the internet. Disconnecting and reconnecting Wifi will fix the problem, unfortunately only for 30sec to 2min.&nbsp; After that websites will stop loading again and display an error message
 'no connectivity'.&nbsp; So disc/reconnect every 2min is really frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all various suggestions for trouble shoot I was able to find online, all drivers are up to date, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started yesterday without having made any upgrades or changes to my notebook in the recent past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wired connection seems to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hey Sam Bloomfield,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s a little insight on how rename function works in Windows explorer depending on many scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you are renaming a file to a different name, you can make the mouse cursor stay in the naming field. Slowly double-click on the file which is already selected. This highlights the file to be renamed.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To match the double-click sensitivity of the mouse to your finger's pace, check the speed of your mouse.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the topic&nbsp;<strong>To change how the mouse buttons work</strong><span>fromthis article
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-mouse-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Change mouse settings</span></a>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you try to copy an image to a location wherein another image with the same name exists, Windows explorer will prompt you with these three options:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is already a file with the same name in this location. Click the file you want to keep.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Copy
 and Replace</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Don’t
 Copy</span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Copy,
 but keep both files</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span></span></span>
<p><span>If you choose the last option i.e&nbsp;<strong>Copy, but keep both files</strong>the file you are copying will be renamed with the same name differentiated
 by numbering. For instance, if the file in concern is&nbsp;<strong>test.jpg</strong>, the file you are copying is renamed to&nbsp;
<strong>test (2).jpg</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you try to rename a file&nbsp; <strong>xyz.jpg</strong> to an already existing name, say for instance&nbsp;<strong>test.jpg</strong>, Windows explorer prompts you to either rename&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>xyz.jpg</strong> to&nbsp;<strong>test (2).jpg</strong> or cancel the rename process.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also have a look at this article&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Rename-a-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Rename
 a file</span></a>&nbsp;</strong>for more insight in the rename command.</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t import from Digita video camera - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emmajyx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t import from Digita video camera</h2>
                    <p>It recognises the file starts to import and then says tape is blank &amp; to check it.Also when I try to import whole of tape it rewinds the tape on the video camera then plays it on the camera but on the computer screen nothing is happening - it is on the "capturing"
 part but no time is ticking over and no picture is being shown.</p>
<p>Why does it say the tape is blank or there is no tape when it has only just shown a part of the tape playng back on the screen?</p>
<p>I am using latest WLMM which I downloaded today and my video camera is a Canon MV650i.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            Can we confirm that the cam is in playback?<br />
That you have connected it via firewire and NOT usb?<br />
Do you have another computer/cable and cam to see if all your items are working properly. Firewire is a two way process along the cable and if one pin isn't working correctly you may see some actions work ok and some not.<br />
So set up test pc/cam/cable test it all works ok.<br />
Swap each item with one of yours, so first try your cable adn see if it works, if it does we know the cable is ok, if it doesn't, try the known to work cable with your pc/cam and see if that works. If it does buy new cable and you are sorted.<br />
<br />
Don't assume that more than one item can be faulty, pushing the firewire cable in wrongly may have damamged the cable and the firewire port.<br />
<br />
Once you've tested all three items you'll either know what is faulty, or we need to delve deeper into the software as we then know all the hardware is ok.<br />
<br />
Please keep replying to this thread, rather than starting new ones.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry about starting a new thread with my 2 question – it’s the first time I’ve been on here to ask something
 so I didn’t know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have done following your help instructions:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes my camera is in playback mode and I connect via firewire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plugged my camera and firewire into another computer (my old one) that had Movie Maker 4 on it and it all imported and worked correctly as it used to.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The camera, digital video tape in it, firewire cord &amp; all worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when I plugged it back into my new PC with WLMM same problems happen again. It plays back the footage on (and controls) the camera but when pressing ‘import’ or ‘finish’
 the error message is “Video did not import correctly. Verify that the digital video tape is not blank the try again.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, WLMM detects my camera as ‘Microsoft Camera &amp; VCR’. Even if I am not in the program, when I turn on the camera attached via firewire the program automatically pops
 up the ‘import’ box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step by step here is how I ‘try’ to import the video file. I startup WLMM then plug the firewire into the camera. I turn the camera dial on to play vcr (playback mode).
 WLMM detects it and brings up the “Import video” box (or I go to file &amp; import from device then I select the camera). I type in a name for the file and then it goes to next screen to import. I press the ‘import’ button and then ‘stop’ and then ‘finish’ when
 I’m done. At this point I get this error message: <span>&nbsp;</span>“Video did not import correctly. Verify that the digital video tape is not blank the try again.”</p>
<p>While ‘importing’ WLMM is controlling my camera (rewinding it &amp; then playing back; but with a black screen on the PC – it does not show the video footage although the time
 ticks over as though it is playing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What file type does my camera generate? I’m pretty sure the files generated by my camera are .avi or .wmv (but how do I find
 this out for sure?)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have followed the exact instructions from the help “</span><span>How do I import photos and videos
 from cameras and other devices?” and I still have the same problem with it saying the tape is blank when it is not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I really appreciate your help. :)</span></p>

<p>Also, have you tried to copy and paste the files in your desktop before importing it to Windows Live Movie Maker? If not yet, please do so we can isolate if the issue.&nbsp;Here are the detailed steps:</p>
<p>1. Copy and paste the files into your desktop computer.</p>
<p>2. Play the file using Windows Media&nbsp;Player&nbsp; or other player to verify if it's working correctly.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Open Windows Live Movie Maker.</p>
<p>4. Click <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Photos and Videos</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Select the files.</p>
<p>6. Wait for the client to complete the process.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Play the file in Windows Live Movie Maker by&nbsp;pressing <strong>Spacebar</strong>.</p>
<p>If there's an issue&nbsp;while performing these&nbsp;steps, please let us know.</p>
<p>Note: I merged your two related threads.</p>

            Try installing windv, a very small and free programme just for capturing from dv camcorders.<br />
If this works on your new pc we have two options, we keep trying to find the cause of the problem or you capture using windv and then import the video into WLMM for editing.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't work, it does look like the pc firewire port is faulty.&nbsp; You could fit a new pci firewire card.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm one of the people with the same problem. I did the method 2 and it worked, but only for a few seconds. What should I do now. I'm starting to think that I have a virus but I can't just assume. I need to be positive. If you can respond that would help.
 Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t find a document anywhere</h2>
                    I got my Surface Laptop in November and around that time was working on a word document. I have screen captures from the document and I am 100% certain that at least one version of it was saved, as the captures are from several days apart. I'm less sure
 on what I saved it as, but I have searched ALL my files, searched key words that I know are in it, used recovery software, searched unsaved files, deleted files, everything, and I'm coming up with absolutely nothing. It seems to have disappeared into thin
 air and it's really frustrating, as it&nbsp;<em>definitely </em>existed at one point.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what I could do to locate it?&nbsp;

            Have you checked in your onedrive?
<br />
<br />Since Windows search has not worked, if you remember any of the words you may have used in the file name you can try a file name search tool called Everything.  I've been using it for years.

<br />Personally, I prefer to use the "Portable" version since it avoids using the registry.

<br />(Short form: use these links at your own risk, just like everything else from MS!)
<br />
<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
<br />
<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

                    <p>This issue has been frustrating me, trying to troubleshoot, and getting shot down.
</p>
<p>First off, my computer recognizes every local wireless network, but won't identify it, it will continuously sy that it is identifying.</p>
<p>I checked in the device manager and the virtual WiFi miniport adapter has a warning sign saying Error code 31- Te device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device.
</p>
<p>I tried updating the driver, and it said it couldn't update it.</p>
<p>After a while of updating, it said that the driver was updated, yet the error persists. It won't let me Roll Back the driver.</p>
<p>I have tried disabling the device driver, that did nothing. I am at a loss. HELP! PLEASE!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> The Error Code 31 signifies that you might have an old driver for the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the “Fix it”, mentioned in the link below to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> The issue could also be related to missing drivers. Updating the drivers would fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update the driver by clicking Update Driver on the Drivers tab. This starts the Hardware Update wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the
 device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the
<b>device Properties</b> dialog box, click the <b>Driver</b> tab, and then click
<b>Update Driver</b> to start the Hardware Update Wizard. Follow the instructions to update the driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the links below for more info on updating drivers:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</b></p>

    <title>Application Error 0xc0000142 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judd-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application Error 0xc0000142</h2>
                    <p>Last week I turned on my Hp Envy 17 and got an error message saying that the application was unable to start correctly(0xc0000142). &nbsp;So I clicked OK. &nbsp;It appeared again! &nbsp;After a few more I realized there maybe 20 different application errors in a row. &nbsp;I
 called Microsoft for help and spent 5 or 6 hours on the phone trying to resolve the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The agent said he would call back the following day to research the problem. &nbsp;I turned on the computer about an hour later and it worked fine. &nbsp;The next morning I turned it on to find the same problem again. &nbsp;I can't sign into my account, it will only sign
 e in on a temporary account and nothing will be saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this solution but don't have the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Driver Update Utility" listed. &nbsp;Any ideas?</span></p>
<p><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">OK, a<span>fter some reading you are correct this is not a Sony only issue, that service is also contained
 in a lot of Intel Software Products, p</span>lease try this:</span></strong><br />
</p>
<p><span>Go to Control Panel (accessible by right clicking your Start Menu button)</span></p>
<p><span>Open Programs and Features.</span></p>
<p><span>Look for&nbsp;<span>Intel Driver Update Utility, if you find it, uninstall it</span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
You might be receiving this kind of error message due to a variety of reasons. It can be due to incompatibility.<br />
<br />
That being said, you may check from the software developer's website if it's compatible with Windows 8.1 since you've mentioned that it's working fine on your Windows 7 PC.<br />
<br />
If your software is compatible but still doesn't work, you may contact the software developer's support for further assistance.<br />
<br />
You may share with us here how you will get your issue resolved to help others having the same issue as this.<br />
<br />
We're just a post away should you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s): 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .evtx file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:

                    How do I send a large number of photos using email?&nbsp; Using 'Send To' in Picture Tools lets you attach the photos by clicking 'attach' but then does not go on to provide an opportunity for the receipient's name and email address to be entered.......

 could also use that same keyboard to navigate Internet Explorer, Search functions in apps like Netflix when looking for a movie title. I think there would be many people interested in that option. I know I would like to type my messages faster so that I can
 get back to my game quicker.&nbsp; Party chat is good but I don't always communicate with everyone through that. If I am in-game&nbsp; with a few friends I still type messages to others not in that game. I think it would be useful to have keyboard capability by usb.

<p>Hi there. You will be pleased to know that you can already use a standard USB keyboard on the Xbox One. I am however unsure as to whether you can use a wireless keyboard. An alternative would be to use Xbox smartglass to type messages to friends. You can
 download that application on most Windows, android and IOS devices in the store.</p>
<p>USB keyboard support comes under the February update on the following link:</p>

<h2>            BSOD stop 0x0000008E error when trying to remove HDD protection</h2>
                    Please Help!!<br />
I have been trying to upgrade to W7 from WVista Home Premium on a Toshiba U305-S7446 and it told me that I needed to remove my Toshiba HDD Protection.&nbsp; So I tried to uninstall the program through the control panel's uninstall function and after allowing access
 to do so my computer immediately displayed the BSOD with this error code.<br />
0x0000008E (0xC0000005, 0x82601DBA, 0xAC141904, 0x00000000)<br />
<br />
I've tried removing the program in safe mode and it does not work.&nbsp; I believe it has something to do with a bad windows installer but I have no idea what version WVHP I'm running or what platform, so I wouldn't know where to start.<br />

            Hi Mohamed,
<div>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>2. Are you able to connect other Bluetooth devices?</div>
<div>3. Did you try connecting the device on another computer and check if it works?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Error Code 28 corresponds to&nbsp;the drivers for the device&nbsp;is not installed.</div>

<div>Creative Bluetooth speakers do not need any driver to operate. You may need to update the Bluetooth driver of your computer's built-in Bluetooth adapter.

</p><p>Follow my comments:</p>
<p>1) "<em>The error message that you're getting usually occurs when you're trying to back up files and it is not completed successfully</em>."</p>
<p>This is not the case. I just have external HDD connected via USB to access information store on it.</p>

</p><p>2) "<em>For us to understand what's causing the issue you're having, can you provide us the exact error message you're getting when trying to access files in your external drive? A screenshot would be appreciated</em>"</p>
<ul>
<li>When I tried to get the error message afyer I received your message, at first I could browse the external HDD BUT when I tried to open any file, the associated application launched but file never opened.</li><li>After one day I tried again and I got the error message (see file 01.jpg)</li></ul>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">3) "In the meantime, we suggest that you perform the System File Checker (SFC) scan and run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to check the PC for any corrupted system files. For steps and more information
 regarding SFC and DISM, check this Wiki Article by ZigZag3143 (MS-MVP)."<br />
I ran all steps decribed on that Wiki Article with these results (all OK):</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;sfc /scannow&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</li><li>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;No component store corruption detected.</li><li>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;100.0% The component store is repairable.</li><li>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;100.0% The restore operation completed successfully.</li><li>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;sfc /scannow&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</li></ul>
<p>(Although no error were reported by SFC or DISM, I will monitor the behaviour of this problem after I ran this procedure)</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
A few possible reasons that cause this error when trying to access your external hard drive could be a damaged controller that's why the hard drive fails or there could be bad sectors on the hard drive that has damaged it.
<br />
<br />
Since you're unable to stop or safely removed the external hard drive, you may try uninstalling your external hard drive through Device Manager. Check out

Let us know how it goes.<br />
