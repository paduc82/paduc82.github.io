<h2>            The instruction at 0x000000</h2>
                    So about a month ago I was on my old pc and I was getting this every time I turned off my pc and it brought it to the shutdown screen "The instruction at "0x75606eb5" referenced memory at "0x0000. The instruction at "0x75606eb5" referenced memory at "0x00000008".
 The memory could not be "read". Click on OK to terminate the program" and recently I built a new computer and it started happening to this one too! I know that the ram is not bad I just got new 16gb vengeance ram. So if anyone can help me, I think, from what
 I have read this could be a "Trojan Virus" please if anybody knows anything on this let me know.

            I have tried sfc /scannow in cmd, I have also tried multiple antivirus programs. But the thing is this was on my old computer too so I think it might be something over my network.

    <title>Trouble initializing a USB drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcrowley203  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble initializing a USB drive</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble initializing an HDD that I have connected to my PC via USB.&nbsp; I'm stuck, and I need some ideas.&nbsp; Below is detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10.&nbsp; The outboard HDD disk in question was previously the internal C: drive on this PC.&nbsp; I replaced it with a larger drive about four months ago purely so I would have more storage capacity; it was running fine at the time I replaced
 it, and it has been stored carefully since.&nbsp; I am using a USB 2.0 to IDE SATA adapter cable to connect the disk to my PC via one of the PC's USB ports.&nbsp; I've used this same cable to connect other HDDs to this same PC in the same manner successfully in the
 past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I navigate to ThisPC, the drive does not appear.&nbsp; I right-click on START, choose Disk Management, and the following is displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I click OK, and the following is displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I run DiskPart, and I get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Event Viewer shows me this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>... and this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>... and this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that the second to last screen says the disk was "not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea where to go from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Easy responses would be "the disk is bad" or "the disk is old and no longer supported".&nbsp; I doubt that either is the case.&nbsp; The disk worked fine until it was excised from the machine and replaced four months ago.&nbsp; Since then, it's been stored carefully and
 not subjected to impact, moisture, extremes of temperature, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi PC.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Be aware that sometimes these makeshift external drives need power, too.  The USB port can only power them so much.  If it needed power before then it likely still does.  I'd shop Amazon for a case that includes power supply, or an adapter like this which is standard:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Generic-Adapter-Converter-Optical-External/dp/B002OV1VJW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Generic-Adapter-Converte...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise go into Device Manager and locate the drive under Disk Drives, right click to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            Hi  pcrowley203, sorry, your screenshots are not coming through, can you please try that again, pasted images do not work on Communiity . . .
<br />
<br />How to do that:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type snip and hit Enter - this will open the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Set Mode to Full Screen, then click New to take a screenshot
<br />
<br />Save that file to your Desktop and close the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Then in your next Post, click the second last button on the toolbar above your post to select that image and upload it to your post . . ..

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt that the issue is power.&nbsp; I've successfully done this before with other disks.&nbsp; Plus, I can feel by touching the drive itself with my hand that the disk is spinning.&nbsp; Plus, see below ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the Device Manager, deleted the drive, and rebooted.&nbsp; The drive still doesn't show up under ThisPC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open Disk Management, and I'm told "You must initialize a disc before Logical Disk Manager can access it".&nbsp; I hit OK, and I get a pop-up that says "Data error (cyclic redundancy check)."&nbsp; This is a change from before the reboot.&nbsp; Prior to the reboot, the
 pop-up at this stage said "Incorrect function".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run DiskPart and I select the disk and the volume.&nbsp; I then assign a letter to the volume.&nbsp; This works, insofar as a drive with that letter (I chose the letter Q) appears in ThisPC.&nbsp; However, when I open it from ThisPC, I'm told it's empty.&nbsp; The disk is
 definitely not empty, but perhaps I've created a new partition on the disk, and the new partition is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>

            Thanks Dave.&nbsp; Please see my response to Greg's response to my original post.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I've made some progress since my original post.&nbsp; Rather than recreate my lost screenshots, which may now be moot, let's see what response I get to my response to

            Actually, my last observation ("<span>perhaps I've created a new partition on the disk, and the new partition is empty") can't be right.&nbsp; DiskPart reports that the size of the partition is 549 mb, which is the entire size
 of the disk.</span>

            Also, the icon that appears in ThisPC reports that 139 mb of 549 mb are free, implying that 410 mb has been written.&nbsp; So why does it show up as empty when I double-click on it?

            Have you tried the drive in another PC to compare and isolate the problem to the drive itself and not possibly the PC?
<br />
<br />I haven't seen one yet in Windows 10 but in Windows 7 what worked for Cyclic Redundancy check error is one of these:  <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Fix-a-Cyclic-Redundancy-Check-Error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Fix-a-Cyclic-Redundancy...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you'll need to try to recover data which isn't as hard if it hasn't been formatted over (which makes it nearly impossible except for expensive forensic means):  <a href="https://www.easeus.com/resource/fix-data-error-cyclic-redundancy-check.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/resource/fix-data-error-...</a>.  This is one tool, you can also try Recuva:  <a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva/features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/recuva/features</a>

<p>Yes, I've tried this on my laptop as well with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not inclined to go through the trouble of downloading and installing a third-party utility in an attempt to fix this.&nbsp; In my experience, they rarely work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran chkdsk against the drive.&nbsp; The results seem very normal.&nbsp; See below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51dbf8d9-8432-4896-b794-a78fa0addfd2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51dbf8d9-8432-4896-b794-a78fa0addfd2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to understand why chkdsk can see the files, but I can't use the file explorer to browse the disk.&nbsp; Similarly, at a command prompt, I can navigate to Q:, but dir shows the disk as empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not inclined to try a file recovery yet.&nbsp; It seems like there ought to be a way to get this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've seen other threads where users have had similar problems.&nbsp; I didn't see where any were solved, but I didn't look very hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more ideas?</p>
<p>

            It says plainly in the Disk Check results that it's the System Reserved partition which boot Windows.  Run Diskpart List Volume to see if it finds any other volumes on the drive to Disk Check.  
<br />
<br />I wouldn't have suggested to run the tool if it wasn't needed.  I help people in forums by the tens of thousands and most cases like these I've helped solve hundreds of times before at a minimum.

<p><strong>Basically I am using a Huawei E3131 dongle, unlike other 3G dongles it is picked up as a&nbsp;Remote NDIS based Internet Sharing Device and not a modem. Every other dongle I have used is picked up as a modem and I've had no trouble getting on xbox live,
 however this one just won't connect. I've spent hours watching various tutorials and none of them work. Can I still connect to xbox live with this device and an Ethernet&nbsp;cable? When I test connection it connects to network but then not internet, but I evidently
 have internet. I have changed my sharing settings but nothing seems to work. Please help as this is bugging me and I just want to play some FIFA, thankyou :-)&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Try to select both the "NDIS based Internet Sharing Device" and your LAN connection. If necessary, hold the "CTRL-key" while clicking on either icons. Then right click and choose to bridge that connection. Does that work?</p>

<p>Could you then try the following: Right click the NDIS adapter, and choose "Properties". Then look for the "Sharing" tab, and place a checkmark that this connection should be shared to other users in the network to allow them
 internet access.</p>
<p>Make sure your LAN adapter is set to automatic IP settings. If you check the status of the LAN adapter, it should then have an IP of 192.168.137.xxx (with xxx usually being 1)</p>
<p>Connect your console to the LAN port, and check if the console also has an IP in the 192.168.137.xxx IP-Range.</p>

<h2>            PC crashing at random with BSOD DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION</h2>
                    <p>Nearly everyday for the past month my PC will randomly freeze up for roughly 30-90 seconds and then BSOD with the error DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION.</p>
<p>It happens mostly when browsing the internet or playing video games on the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the PC reboots Event Viewer shows a BugCheck Error:&nbsp;The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x00000133 (0x0000000000000001, 0x0000000000001e00, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dump from the most recent crash is linked in a dropbox linked here:&nbsp;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8jmkqirvfsdobk1/021118-20171-01.dmp?dl=0</p>

<p>Hell Crehab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have this issue try doing the following :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1# :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run CMD As Administrator</p>
<p>Type In CHKDSK /f (If Prompts To Scan When Restarting Dont Do It Yet)</p>
<p>Type In SFC/SCANNOW<br />
Reboot And Wait For CHKDSK To Finish</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2# :</p>
<p>Reinstall Windows By Doing The Following :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot From USB Or DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Press Shift + F10</p>
<p>Type In diskpart</p>
<p>list disk</p>
<p>select disk 0</p>
<p>clean</p>
<p>convert mbr</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>exit again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accept</p>
<p>Select Custom</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Install</p>
<p>Wait For It To Install And Try It Out</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I Still Think That This Is A Violation So SFC/scannow Command Should Fix It But Im Not Sure, Never Had This Error Before On My Windows 8.1.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried the chkdsk scan twice now with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a windows installation on hand to completely reinstall the OS nor do i really want to jump to something so drastic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping someone could look at the memory dump i linked and help pinpoint what exactly is causing the issue before doing any major consequential solutions like factory resetting the PC, purchasing new hardware off speculation, or completely reinstalling
 Windows.</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Surface Go charger has 110 to 240 volts. This is compatible to any country where you want to go. However, in order for this charger to work on the country where you are heading to, you need a
<strong><em>type I adapter plug</em></strong> for Australia and <strong><em>type A / B adapter plug</em></strong> for Japan.</span></p>

<h3> bennett yeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network adapters cannot start &#40;Code 10&#41;</h2>
                    <strong>Symptoms</strong>
<ul>
<li>After restarting computer both wireless and Ethernet adapter will not start</li><li>Going to device manager (devmgmt.msc) and disabling/re-enabling wireless driver allows wireless driver to work</li><li>Doing the same for Ethernet causes causes mmc.exe to hang and eventually fails to start driver.</li></ul>
<hr />

<strong>Attempted fixes</strong>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
In an effort to reduce generic boiler-plate answers, these are the steps I have taken to try and rule out what is causing the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reinstall drivers</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Failure</strong>. This yields the same result for wireless adapter as disable/re-enabling
 it (success). Reinstalling Ethernet adapter hangs mmc.exe, then fails with same error code (code 10).</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Reinstall drivers using files provided by manufacturer's website (ensure using latest driver)</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Failure.</strong>&nbsp;Same
 result as reinstalling drivers from device manager.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Disable antivirus/Disable firewall</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Failure.</strong>&nbsp;Tried two different antiviruses (antiviruses integrate
 into firewall) Eset NOD32 and Bitdefender (Bitdefender cannot be completely "disabled").</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Go back previous build</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Failure.</strong>&nbsp;No change in symptoms.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Reset computer (but keep personal files)</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Temporary success</strong>, restarting enough times causes symptoms
 to come back.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Clean Install</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Temporary success</strong>, restarting enough times causes symptoms to come back.</p>
</li></ul>
<hr />

<strong>Hypothesis</strong>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I have a strong suspicion that Windows Update may be corrupting my drivers, although at this point I would not completely rule out the possibility that an application I have installed keeps on corrupting the driver.&nbsp;<a href="http://pastebin.com/KfJvprE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Upon reading the details you provided, you already installed the manufacturer version driver and it didn't worked. Now, try to install the Windows version by following this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 your computer manufacturer for hardware troubleshooting.
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Managed to figure out the issue by using&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restore points</a>&nbsp;and narrowing down when the computer would exhibit symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out the issue was caused by&nbsp;<strong>Primo Ramdisk</strong>. For some reason the software seems to cause my network adapters to not be able to start when I have a RAM disk that boots an image file on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears this is a freak issue that is specific to the software and/or hardware because no one else has reported this issue, and I never had this issue on an older device with which I ran the software on.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Clips Got Deleted </h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>I wanted to get my old xbox clips back on my pc but when i go in my xbox app I only&nbsp;find&nbsp;half of them ( of course the least interesting ones ). I clearly remember taking the time to edit/rename them to make them easier to found, turns out those are the ones who disappeared.</p><p>Is there any way to get them back as they were&nbsp;?</p><p>( most of them were from destiny 1 and rainbow six siege )</p><p><br /></p><p>Best regards&nbsp;</p><p>-Alex</p>

<p>Give it time.. The forums were dead before the new forum :) Don't expect a change any time soon. Damage has already been done, and most people will not return due to the fact that they think they can just throw a new forum out and make everything alright

<p>The previous forums were alright (in my opinion) the only things which needed some work was;</p>
<p>- Cosmetics (colours) </p>
<p>- More moderation</p>
<p>- More moderation powers (users rating 1 star threads)</p>
<p>- More staff interaction</p>
<p>I don't see what new forums are going to achieve. It took me about 30 minutes to find the UK Gen section due to the poor navigation.</p>

<p>I purchased a full copy of Windows 7 Ultimate from an acquaintance who did not need it.&nbsp; The package was in the original shrink wrap.&nbsp; I installed it with no problems, but now when it tries to activate, I get the dreaded "The product key you typed has been
 blocked for use by Microsoft".</p>
<p>What's interesting is that when I run Windows Validate, it passes as genuine Windows software.</p>

<p>EDIT: Additional information<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067 for Ultimate, 220 area for Pro and the 230, 231 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
If you have a similar PID, or your key is blocked and you want confirmation post a new thread with a report from the MGADIAG tool, download and run the tool, click copy and paste it in a new post here and Darin Smith from MS can verify your key for you. NEVER
 post your key, the report will suffice.<br />

            Unfortunately, the product key used to install your copy of Windows 7 Ultimate is a MSDN subscription "not-for-resale" product key.&nbsp; Once the Microsoft Anti-Piracy Team discovered this fact, the product key was entered into the "blocked" product key inventory.&nbsp;

<br />
<div>You can wait until after the 30 days are up - then follow the non-genuine notification links, and buy the WGA Kit from MS&nbsp;- this is then bound to the PC for life.</div>
<div>OTOH - for the same money (near enough) you can buy a Genuine Retail Ultimate &nbsp;package from a reputable store, and use the Key from that.</div>
<div>Or - for less money - buy a more sensible version of Win 7 (you almost certainly don't need the bells and whistles in Ultimate) such as Home Premium, and then do a clean install.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HTH?</div>

            <p><span>Hi Hussain,
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that you facing issues when you connect your camera to the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In order to help you better, please answer the following questions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. What is the exact and complete error message you are getting?<br />
3. Have you tried to connect the camera to a different USB port?<br />
4. Do the other USB devices work fine<span>&nbsp; </span>
on your computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the USB device is not getting detected in Windows 8, then I would suggest you to run the hardware troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Follow the steps:</span></strong><b><br />
</b><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press “Windows + W key”.<br />
b. Type “Troubleshooter” in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c. Select “Hardware and Sound” from the Troubleshooter Window.<br />
d. Select “Hardware and Devices” under Devices option.<br />
e. Follow the On Screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<span>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the USB controller from the device manager. Then download and install the latest “Chipset” driver from the manufacturer’s website<br />
Follow these steps:</p></span>
<p><span>a. Press “Windows key + W” from your keyboard.<br />
b. Then type “Device Manager” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.<br />
c. Expand “Universal Serial Bus Controller”.<br />
d. Right click on the each controller and select “Uninstall” option.<br />
e. Then restart the computer for changes to take effect.<br />
f. Then download and install the latest driver from the “Motherboard” manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<b><span>
<p><br />
</p></span></b><span>You can also try to install the latest software for the camera in the computer and check if the issue persists.<br />
</span>
<p><span>You can refer to the link mentioned below to download the software which is compatible with Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>started up my Xbox one x and Star Wars battlefront 2 then realized every so often my system keeps reviving up. This reviving lasts for 5 seconds maybe. I counted how many times it revved up and it was around 5 in a row. Is this common or an issue ?</p>

            <p>Hey I VICI0US I! The console will be taxed more while running a game or app which can cause the fans to work harder. If the sounds continue at all times or if you believe the console should not be making that sound, I would suggest getting it serviced.

Use this link and download software for VX-1000 for Windows 7.&nbsp; I am using Windows 8.1 and it works for me.<br />

Just be advised that some functions may not work but works fine for me on Skype and OovoO and the like.&nbsp; Hope this helps you.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - side menu and start button not opening</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new computer - a Dell OptiPlex 9020. These are one of Dell's high performance work computers. I have used Dell computers since 2010. Anyway, the computer came pre-installed with Windows 7, but it included a DVD to upgrade to Windows 8.1, which
 I&nbsp;decided to use.&nbsp; I reformatted the hard drive and then installed Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 works really well in my opinion. But the other night I encountered a strange issue. When I put my mouse at the upper right corner, or bottom right corner, the side menu that normally comes up did not. Additionally, nothing happened when I clicked
 the 'Start' button, so I was unable to get back to the Start screen with all the tiles.&nbsp; Everything else, however, worked fine. I had no issue opening a web browser, Outlook, or any other file on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hot keys, such as windows key + "C" worked well in order to access that side menu. To access the Start screen, I simply pressed the windows flag key on the keyboard. Again, holding the mouse top right corner/bottom right corner, or clicking the Start button
 with the mouse did not work until I restarted the entire computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what might have happened here?</p>

If all of that does not help then something like a 3rd party antivirus, utility, or driver is
<br />
probably interfering with the process (and maybe even if those seemed to resolve the<br />
issue).<br />

            Hi Tom, <br /><br />I suggest trying Malwarebytes. It’s done very well for me in the past. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/</a><br /><br />The free version is perfect, will find the Trojan and remove it. Download, Install, and run and then let me know! <br /><br />- C

            The surest way to remove malware is to perform a backup of all your data to an external drive, gather all the software you've installed since purchasing the PC, then formatting your main drive and reinstalling Windows from scratch. Afterward, reinstall your software and restore the backup. Yes, you can use something like Malwarebytes, but you can't guarantee it will find all the malware you might have. It can't remove what it doesn't know about.

            Brian has explained it better. However, if you cannot afford to do a clean install which you should do, try removing viruses in offline mode:

<h2>            Black ops 2 modders</h2>
                    <p>last night i was playing black ops 2 online. Thr first game i played in was fine. The 2nd started fine but then a modder joined the game and started messing it all up. They then unlockd a load of achievements for the game without my permission. I dont want
 to get banned as i have had my account since 2005 and have never modded or cheated online ever. Can i delete them from my account as i didnt earn them. The lobby wasnt a modded one it was just 1 plsyer who joined and started hacking and unlovking achievements.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Trying to get Brazilian Keyboard to work with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to get Brazilian Keyboard to work with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I just received a new computer with Windows 7, and I'm trying to get a Brazilian keyboard to work with it.&nbsp; My old computer was XP, and this same keyboard worked fine.&nbsp; I set up a different language for when I was using this keyboard, and it would let me
 use all the keys (I don't remember what was the keyboard layout that I used).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try and set it up with Windows 7, however, there is no keyboard layout that matches my layout.&nbsp; The ABNT and ABNT2 options look the same, and both are missing two keys.&nbsp; My keyboard has the \ to the left of the z, and the / to the right of the ;.&nbsp;
 Is there some error with how Windows 7 has set up one of these keyboards?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            &nbsp;i just bought a windows 7, but before the deal was done &nbsp;i told the guys from dell, that i needed a computer with brazilian keyboard layout. also i payed 50.00 dollars more and they installed the software to change the computer's language to portuguese.
 here is the deal, window 7 professional or windows ultimate you will have the layout and the language...so it works perfect . now if you want to get the keyboard layout and language on the regular windows 7 all you have to do is go to microsoft.com and download
 it. hope this is helpful . then you have to figure out how to use the keyboard, the codes can be an exercise. but in a day or two you will find out. remember to do all updates as soon as you buy a computer. after you set up your pc and all the new updates
 start pop up, just download every important updates. all this infos was passed to me buy dell's sells person.

            Hi Elizabeth
<br />
<br />The red dot next to this Skype icon means that there is a new, unread message or notification on your Skype Profile

            Hi ElizabethNewquist,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Do you mean on the taskbar? This means that you have notifications in Skype that you have not yet viewed - this could be missed calls/messages etc.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!

<h2>            Can&#39;t install windows but can install linux</h2>
                    whenever I tried to install windows, at the partition menu, I get an error 0x80070057 if I tried to format any drive. I can install Linux(Fedora 28) any time and works perfectly. Also, I tried "diskpart", where also I cannot execute "format fs=ntfs quick"
 command, after cleaning the disk and creating a partition. the command generates the error " Diskpart encountered an error: The parameter is incorrect". please help, and thanks for taking the interest.
