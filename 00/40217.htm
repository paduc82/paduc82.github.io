    <title>&#34;Microsoft Windows&#34; Application has stopped working Pop-Up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Windows&#34; Application has stopped working Pop-Up &#91;Win 10&#93;</h2>
                    <p>For a couple of months now, my computer has been randomly freezing every now and then. I have been unable to reproduce the issue at all, which makes troubleshooting very difficult. Freezes also occur in random intervals. Sometimes I get multiple freezes
 a day, while other days the system is running 8+ hours without a problem under same conditions.</p>
<p>Here a short description of the symptoms:</p>
<p>- Sound and all other operations stop immediately</p>
<p>- There is no noticable indicator as to when the freeze will occur, before it actually occurs (no slow-downs etc.)</p>
<p>- The pc will remain frozen for several hours if left unattended and does not recover on its own</p>
<p>- Screen display will remain as it was at the time of the freeze and does not blue screen or disable at any point</p>
<p>- Freezes have occured at various actions and could not be narrowed down (listening to music, browsing the web, working on a file, watching a video, ...)</p>
<p>- After the system is shut-down by a hard reset the desktop icons have been aligned towards the left-hand side of the screen even if they were spread out before the freeze</p>
<p>- Usually freezes occur after the pc has been running for more than 3-4 hours, but I have already had freezes after less than 45 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my last freeze I have seemed to have gotten a new hint (and hopefully not just another problem):&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the computer actually froze, I got a pop-up window, which is usually meant for unresponsive applications. The window looked identical to this one:</p>
<p>https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/093a62c3-6378-4b6b-a542-d445512bb693</p>
<p>Maybe this information can further the troubleshooting process.<br />
</p>
<p>Would be glad to get any pointers in any direction. Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I have already tried multiple "fixes" found on the web, but they did not seem to work for me (e.g. updating drivers ...). I will let you know, when I have tried a fix in my replies, but it might take multiple days until the error re-occurs even after
 the recommended solution is applied, because of me being unable to reproduce the issue consistently.</p>

<p>After the recent freeze today, I ran the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</p>
<p>again. The result was that there were "corrupted files that could not be restored," even though the last scan resulted in no corrupted files. Apparently now, after patching and a couple of restarts and another freeze, files have been corrupted again. Maybe
 as a result of the freeze?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now again run</p>
<p><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></p>
<p><span>and
</span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resulting with the message that the corrupted files were successfully repaired.</p>
<p>Running sfc /scannow one more time completed with the expected result of "did not find any integrity violations"</p>
<p>I will monitor for further freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I assume that I am yet to find the root cause of the issues.</p>
<p>Any further pointers/leads on what I could do?</p>

<h2>            Re-associate zip files</h2>
                    I have been able to download zip files (from the teaching company) and unzip them to an intended folder.&nbsp; Now, the download associates the zip file with Itunes and I can't unzip it the file.&nbsp; ITunes opens up, but nothing happens.&nbsp; I (believe) I need Windows
 7 to take control of the unzipping, but I don't know how to re-associate zip files.

            <p>Hi Per Olausson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting us here in Microsoft Community. We will be more than happy to assist
</p>
<p>you in concern. I understand that when you are trying to slow down the movie file, the audio suddenly disappears. We would like to ask a few questions for us to isolate the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the movie file has its own audio?</li><li>If you are adding audio onto the video file, what is the file format of the audio file?</li><li>Have you tried adding any effects or transition on your movie?</li><li>Could we know the version of your Movie Maker? (<strong>Note: </strong>Press <strong>
ALT </strong>+<strong> F </strong>then select <strong>About Movie Maker</strong>).</li></ul>
<p>You may also provide us the raw files on the movie you are creating so we can recreate it on our end. The steps in uploading them is on the private message that I have created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please sign-in to this website in order to see the Private Message that I have crated. We also need you to reply back to this post if you already provided the information on the private data area. This will help facilitate our actions
 regarding your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<br />
<span>Yes it's the movie files own sound that disappears.</span><br />
<span>I got no problem with adding other audio like music etc... and changing the video speed.</span><br />
<span>The sound disappeared as soon as i put on the slow motion effect on the movie, or the speed up effect it happens only with those
 effects. </span><br />
<span>It's the Windows live movie maker Version 2011 (15.4.3538.0513)</span>

            the sound automatically goes away when you do a speed change in MM2011, but the 2012 version keeps the sound and changes its speed also.

            <div>Hi,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>DCIM </strong>is short for "Digital Camera Images." It is a folder that is automatically created on flash memory cards by digital cameras. Most digital camera manufacturers, such as Canon, Nikon, and Olympus, as well as some cell phones use the
 DCIM folder to store the photos captured by the camera. Software programs that import digital photos also look in the DCIM folder for photos to import. The DCIM folder typically contains JPEG images, but it may also include subfolders and other files such
 as index files that keep track of the photos taken by the camera.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since digital photos are stored in the DCIM folder, other data besides pictures can be stored on the camera's card as long as the card is not set to "read-only." For example, you could store text documents in a different folder and transfer them to another
 computer directly from the card. Just make sure not to drag extra items into the DCIM folder, since it may cause your camera to not recognize the list of photos.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can see pictures on Windows 7 computer and you cannot after you transfer them to your phone. I suggest you to contact Phone manufacturer for further support.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Often that should be interpreted as having the window open off-screen or on another monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check with the Project dialog (Win-P) to see if it is set to Extend to know if it could be on another monitor.&nbsp; Press Win-Shift-CursorRight (or Switch Project
 to Duplicate) to bring it back.&nbsp; You could also try moving the window.&nbsp; E.g. press Alt-Space M, CursorRight and then see if you can drag it into view.</p>

<h3> rob&#39;s xboxonex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition game hub is display instead of royal Edition on Xbox One X Console.</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">their seems to be a bug on my Xbox one system, where my copy of Final Fantasy XV Day One Edition and now also royal edition (Xbox one Physical Disc)&nbsp; is loading the game hub for Windows Edition, instead of Xbox Edition for its
 game hub to add to home page, this problem has existed for months still on new xbox one x, if theirs going to be a fix, no updates for this game in 2019, last game update was 2018 I think. I just last week went and got the royal edition, which unlocks the
 new addons and stuff included, but yes that add to home for this one game still is not working correctly, all other games including kindom hearts III works correctly, I don't think this one game will get an fix for that, otherwise it still launches correctly
 and plays fine. I think my first post about day one edition was like either in 2016 or 2017 before the xbox one forums had changed design, anyway at this point I don't think theirs going to be an fix for this game, that new royal edition was only around $20
 dollars, it doesn't even cost as much as we paid for the Day one edition when it was an new game at all.</span>

                    <p>Hey, I've recently gotten the new Xbox app for Windows 10, and have been trying to get it to let me sign in for almost over a week, but it keeps saying that it cannot sign me in at the moment, I let it go for a day or so and it doesn't work still.&nbsp;I understand it's a Beta for it but still, every one of my friends has gotten a custom GP and with no hassles whatsoever. Is there anything I could do, apart from uninstalling or downloading a specific program, because I've tried both and they don't work.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
<p>There are several reason why Xbox app will give you Error (0x409), in this case some of the components of&nbsp;Xbox app are maybe&nbsp;corrupted&nbsp;or the drivers of your PC needs to be updated.</p>
<p>To resolve Error (0x409), we would suggest you try the following methods below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Check for Store Updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Windows Store. ( Press Windows key and click on Store tile)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Click on the USER icon and select Download and update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click on Check for Updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If there are any pending updates available select Update All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>:&nbsp;Reset&nbsp;Windows Store&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and click on Command Prompt (Admin) to open the Elevated Command Prompt. If prompted for a password, type the password and click Allow
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Type WSreset.exe and hit Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Exit Command Prompt.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Don't forget to let us know how it turns out. </p>

<p>Did you try the hard reset on the console? &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until it shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the cord back in and power up the console and test.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work try logging out of your profile and logging back in. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mouse Flicker and Drop-Down Menu Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chinook249  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mouse Flicker and Drop-Down Menu Problem</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 today. &nbsp;The mouse pointer flickers between the normal arrow and the arrow with a spinning circle (background task), on and off about every 100ms. &nbsp;In some windows, like the Settings page, the whole window flickers too, as if focus
 is being switched to and from it repeatedly. &nbsp;Drop down menus (like the one used to make this post) don't stay open for more than about half a second, making selections difficult, if not impossible. &nbsp;Right clicking does the same thing - the menu opens, but
 it closes almost immediately. &nbsp;If I try to drag a window and move it, it'll work so long as I do it in half a second or less, otherwise it snaps back to where it was. &nbsp;Similarly, if I Winkey-Tab to switch workspaces, it snaps out in a few tenths of a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the issue and tried virus scans (clean), plugging/re-plugging my mouse, uninstalling and reinstalling the mouse and keyboard drivers. &nbsp;I looked in Task Manager and nothing seems out of the ordinary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc scannow and it came up with no errors. &nbsp;My next step will be to reinstall windows 10 to see if that fixes anything; does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            Never mind, I have mended the problem. &nbsp;Go to Task Manager and start deleting everything that it lets you delete. &nbsp;I believe I ended a task with a name that had "driver service" somewhere in it. &nbsp;Windows 10 is marvelous now! &nbsp;Now I need to figure out how
 to stop it from starting itself when I boot.

            1) Did you also have trouble typing in web addresses where it would highlight everything and cause you to retype over what you already typed?&nbsp; I have had similar issues, except for the settings page issue you described and it's taken me about 4 hours of
 asking Cortana about it before I stumbled onto your post (thank you by the way, I've spent almost all day today running all sorts of debuggers and troubleshooters).<br />
<br />
2) How did you know what tasks/apps/background processes to end/delete? Apparently I have around 105 background processes running and I don't know what they do or what they are for (if they do anything) and I want to make sure I don't screw up.&nbsp; Did most of
 the tasks you ended take up 0% CPU, &lt;1MB Memory, almost 0 MB/s of Disk, and almost 0 Mbps of Network usage?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give, this has been really helpful (especially since this problem has made it near impossible for me to update my discogs collection)!<br />

            <p>Hi , I have exactly the same problem after upgrade to win10. (Chinook 249)</p>
<p>Running on HP Envy dv7 (core i7) 64 bits.</p>
<p>I have found a work around that I need to perform every time I log on or reboot.</p>
<p>either:</p>
<p>- goto device manager - video card - driversettings&nbsp; : deactivate and reactivate&nbsp;device (Intel HD Grapics 4000)</p>
<p>- click the button to ducplicate screen.&nbsp; screen becomes black (there isn't another screen) .&nbsp; Toggling further to the normal screen again, the screen goes black again and after 2 times the problem disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is a 100% work around.&nbsp; Although not a solution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done:</p>
<p>- reinstall triple win10</p>
<p>- update all screen drivers via the supplier website and tools</p>
<p>==&gt; no solution.&nbsp; the problem persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any advise / real solution</p>

            <p>Hey, it's me again:<br />
<br />
So deleting background tasks was just a temporary fix and sometimes that didn't even work.&nbsp; Eventually, if I had my laptop running for long enough (overnight while I was asleep) the problem would just disappear and I wouldn't have to deal with it until I had
 to restart my computer, then it popped up again.&nbsp; Then over these past couple of weeks with the first windows 10 update I had to do, the problem went away.&nbsp; Then after the 2nd update, the problem came back, and same with the third update.&nbsp; This time though
 the problem went away after awhile, then my windows explorer would freak out and restart and the problem came back.&nbsp; I think I finally found the solution (If you have an HP laptop with HP SimplePass/fingerprint scanner) though which is in this video:<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXoO2B7lyyY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXoO2B7lyyY</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/zXoO2B7lyyY?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/zXoO2B7lyyY?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an HP laptop, you probably have the fingerprint scanner and have HP SimplePass.&nbsp; I have never used the scanner before so when I opened up HP SimplePass I had to actually register a finger to bring me to the point where I had a window that gave
 me the gear icon and then I just disabled everything.&nbsp; Right when I did that the problem went away.&nbsp; I just did this 5ish minutes ago, but it did work.&nbsp; If the problem continues after another restart or after some time I'll reply to/update this post saying
 it didn't work, but so far it is working.</p>

<h2>            Legendary weapons pool...</h2>
                    
<p>Ive been trying to get this achievement for ages now and not been able to achieve it. IM guessing its not only me that is struggling to get them all. So ive come up with an idea but it will only work if we can get a good few people to all agree to it and
 all help each other out. By pooling all our weapons into the same place and each get the achievement 1 at a time.</p>
<p>Im guessing that between everyone on here that has posted about trading weapons between us we have everyone weapon at least once. Add you name to the list below if you think this could work i dont mind organiseing it but if everyone traded there weapons
 to 1 person for them to get the achievement then they just send them all to the next person and so on and so on until everyone has got the achievement. personally after i get the achievement i dont care about getting the weapons back.</p>
<p>What you all think???</p>

<p>StartUp Repair often works from a Windows Vista Installation Disk or Windows Vista Repair
<br />
Disk when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed how to make a Windows
<br />
Vista Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made on any computer with a CD burner
<br />
running XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses no files from the Host computer.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you |<br />
do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one.
<br />
Also your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />

            Hi thanks for your reply, sorry i didn't look at this since i posted...
<div>&nbsp;
<div>No I haven't made changes other than windows update every time it wants to. I have looked at these support pages before but could not find my problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Don't get no tuner error, I am able to tune in all the channels, but the menu option "my tv" is missing in media centre, so I can't see anything. device manager says all works, drivers up-to-date, but when i open media centre i can only see my pics, more
 programmes and settings, no tv option</div>
<div><br />
<div>???</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you so much for your interest</div>

<strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X </strong>keys and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Expand
<strong>Network Adapters</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Double-click the Network Adapter and click on Power Management Tab and make sure that you have unchecked the box against “<strong>Allow
 the computer to turn off this device</strong>.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>d. Click Ok to save changes.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Basith.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was at work of thought of a solution and tried it out when I got back home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remembered that while running windows 8.1 windows update installed new Broadcom wireless drivers, which caused the same problem when coming out of hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when i got to my place I used the Vaio software to install the older drivers. I then tested it a few times to see if the problem had gone... it had :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time and effort to give me help and advice :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this advice! I also had the same problem as the original&nbsp; poster and had been troubleshooting for 1 week after upgrading to Windows 10. I did as you suggested, unchecking the box that allowed the computer to turn off the device, and
 magically, I have been connected to my home network and to the internet for 2 days without any interuption! I'm so happy, happy, happy!! Again, thank you!!</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0xC03F300D on Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As i think above issue can be solved as per below instruction ,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Whenever you try to purchase or download any app from Windows 8 Store, you get "Your purchase couldn't be completed" error message. No extra help or links are given to fix the problem. You just get an error message with 2 buttons "<strong>Try
 again</strong>" and "<strong>Cancel</strong>" as shown in following screenshot:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmedia.askvg.com%2farticles%2fimages4%2fWindows_8_Store_Incomplete_Purchase_Error.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>Reason:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The reason behind this problem is a built-in service which is called "<strong>Windows Update</strong>". If this service is not running in background and if the service is set to disabled in Windows 8, you'll always
 get this strange error message while downloading any app from Windows 8 Store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>Solution:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Solution is very simple. You just need to re-enable "Windows Update" service and your problem will be fixed. Simply follow these simple steps to fix the problem:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>Win+R</strong>&nbsp;keys together to launch RUN dialog box. Type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong>&nbsp;in
 the textbox and press Enter. It'll open Services Manager.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Scroll down to bottom and you'll see a service "<strong>Windows Update</strong>" in the list. Double-click on it and set its&nbsp;<strong>Startup
 type</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmedia.askvg.com%2farticles%2fimages4%2fWindows_Update_Service_Automatic_Running.png" /></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;Also make sure that "<strong>Windows Firewall</strong>" service is also set to&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>.&nbsp;<em>Thanks
 to our reader OKI for this tip.</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;That's it. Close services manager window and now you'll not face any problem while downloading any app from Windows 8 Store.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I don't see any reason behind disabling "Windows Update" service in Windows 8 as its an important service which helps in protecting your Windows by installing latest security and other updates released by Microsoft. If someone is using a pirated Windows 8 OS,
 there are chances that the user disabled the service to prevent Windows from installing updates which automatically detects pirated Windows in computers. It might also possible that some users disable the service accidentally which is rare though...</p>

<blockquote>how to add signature to new windows mail account&nbsp;</blockquote>
<br />
Open Windows Mail &gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; Signatures.....<br />
Under Signature Settings, UN-check both boxes.<br />
Under Signatures &gt; click New &gt; under Edit Signature, put a dot on Text &gt; type your signature &gt; OK<br />
<br />
The above method is the basic way with only one signature in the list.<br />
<br />
If you require more than one signatures, just repeat the procedures. There are some complicated steps if you have more than one signature listed.<br />
Post back if you do.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
When you are done&nbsp;composing e-mail, you can either ...<br />
1. Tool Bar, click Insert Signature. Your signature will be inserted automatically.<br />
or,<br />
2. Menu Bar, click Insert &gt; click Signture. Click the one you want, if you have more than one in the system.<br />

<h2>            Upload Studio only sends some clips to OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I have not had the same issues I have seen in the forum of not being able to send from Upload to OneDrive. My issue is that when I multi-select clips and choose "Upload to OneDrive", only a portion of them make it to OneDrive.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>My last attempt was to test how it was working. I tried to send 43 clips and screenshots of varying length by multi-selecting using the list check box and then choosing "Upload to OneDrive". It then asked me if I wanted to send these 43 clips to OneDrive and I confirmed. All 43 went into the Upload queue and began to be sent.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I received all of the screenshots (3) and 18 out of 40 of the videos. There is not consistency in size, game or anything else about why the other 25 were not sent.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>This will happen regardless of the amount as well. Prior to this I attempted to send 8 and only received 3. All of them cleared out of the queue and there were no error messages displayed in Upload or OneDri

<p><del>I would like to see a OneDrive upload queue, they never appear in the Upload queue from the drop down list.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>So after posting this I added some brand new clips to upload to OneDrive and they appeared in the queue. However before I posted I added 7 clips that previously didn't upload in a batch and within a minute they appeared on OneDrive.
 My internet isn't fast enough for that. So it seems like the clips must fail but remain cached on OneDrive and when you re-upload them they continue from that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I noticed another strange thing which makes me think I pinpointed the behavior. I had the OneDrive web page open at the folder it uploads to. A clip had uploaded to this folder and another was in progress. When the second one
 uploaded I noticed that the first clip was replaced with the second. It appears they both had the same file name 21-09-2018_10-28-28_PM.mp4 and it's my suspicion that when they are queued to upload to OneDrive some of the clips must be queued at the same second
 and hence have the same filename. I'm going to play with adding each clip to the queue one by one instead of selecting them all and uploading them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would also be great if you could specify OneDrive as the default upload location for clips, instead of Xbox Live.</p>
