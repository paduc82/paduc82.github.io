<h2>            E&#58; File Location Not Found</h2>
                    <p>Recently I inserted a DVD in my E: drive, and the message File Location not found. Have checked Device Manager and says device is working properly, tried various suggestions to disable/remove and reboot with no joy. Checked Windows updates around the date
 this problem occurred and appears there were no updates. I am not a computer wizard as in real detailed investigation throws me with wording and instructions etc. Am currently running Windows 10 Home Edition version 1607, on a recently purchased Packard Bell
 iMedia S2984 TOWER. Any help would be greatly appreciated and if possible with easy to follow instructions.</p>

            <p>Thank You for your help, prior to the fault coming up there were no software or hardware changes, I have tried 6 or 7 discs and each time comes up with E: File Location Not Found, but if I go in This PC option E: drive actually tells me which DVD I have
 inserted i.e. the latest DVD came up as &nbsp;DVD RW Drive (E:)</p>
<p>HOBBIT_BATTLE_OF_THE_FIVE_ARMIES 0 bytes free of 6.35GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp; was using a program called DVD Copy but this was working ok too, but have since removed this after the problem with my E: Drive began.</p>

            <p>Thank you for providing more information about the issue. You mentioned that since you have removed the program called DVD Copy, you have been experiencing the issue. If you checked the article on
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/apps_windows_10-windvd/how-to-use-the-windows-dvd-player-in-windows-10/a773e360-f48d-4f07-a628-711be63db099">
how to use the Windows DVD Player in Windows 10</a>, it was stated that <em>Windows 10 removed DVD Playback support completely. Users who need to play DVD movies, will need to purchase the Windows DVD Player app or depend on a third party application such as
 VLC Player, which works just as well.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to purchase the Windows DVD Player app, kindly refer to the article on how to use it.

            <div>The problem actually started before I removed the program, but today I downloaded VLC, I still get the message E:\File Location Not Found but if I open This Computer and right click on titled DVD and select play with VLC&nbsp;it opens and plays ok, this I can

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your last post, you said that although you are able to play the DVD but still you got the error message of E:File Location Not Found. Kindly check the
<strong>AutoPlay settings</strong>, could be that defaults have been altered.&nbsp; Kindly look in the<em>
<strong>Removable drive</strong></em> drop down if the option has been set to something else and try to change it and see if the error will still appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I'm not 100% sure, but I think you have to buy a product key in order to activate WIN 8.1 even though it is a downgrade. NO FREE LUNCH,&nbsp;

            Oh and you have to do a fresh install that means you have to back up all your data on a separate hard drive and format your old hard drive and then install Win 8.1. Either that or create a partition on your current hard drive if you have one, load your
 data on that, then format the partition that contains Win 10, then install Win 8, then in the process of updating Win 8 you get the update to Win 8.1. Win 8.1 is not sold stand alone.

<p>The question is about installing 8.1, NOT 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 has not been supported since Jan, 2016.</p>
<p>

</p><p>

<p>Than you, all, guys for your valuable help. If I understand correctly:</p>
<p>1.Windows 8.1 is not going to save me storage space.</p>
<p>2.I have to pay for a key, eventhough I have a digital license for Windows 10 linked to my MS Account.</p>
<p>3.My 2 in 1 gets useless, if I want to continue with MS Windows.</p>
<p>4.If you have any suggestions, before I turn it into a beautiful sous-plat, please, feel free to suggest.</p>

<p>I think you could use your 2 in 1, you just would only have about 8 GB for software as Win 8.1 with all updates until now takes about 24 GB, so you wouldn't have much room. Another guy suggested installing an SD card to expand your memory, do you know if
 you have a slot for that?</p>

<p>How's it going? Glad to see some outgoing people for Zombies. I'll be more than glad to play a round of Zombies on Black Ops if you'd like. :)</p>

<h2>            Mass Effect 3 &#34;currently unavailable&#34; in store, do I have to have the disc to play on XBOX One&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I no longer have my Mass Effect 2 &amp; 3 discs so I went to the store to&nbsp;download them&nbsp;so I can play on my XBOX One. &nbsp;XBOX&nbsp;Store keeps showing both titles as "currently unavailable", but Mass Effect 1 is there (I downloaded&nbsp;it already). &nbsp;Do I have to have the discs to play ME 2 &amp; 3 on XBOX One now that they're backwards compatible?</p>

<h2>            Cannot map drive on my pc - get &#34;Not Enough Server storage is available error&#34;</h2>
                    I have two pc's networked at home. Both are running XP Pro with all the latest updates and patches. Here is the problem:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>On the pc that I am trying to map to (a hp laptop), I have set the folder's sharing up and have allowed users to connect to it.
</li><li>From my desktop pc, I try to map a drive and I get this error: "The mapped network drive could not be created because of the following error: Not enough server storage is available to process this command".
</li><li>I have tried mapping various other shared folders on my laptop and I get the same error. Any ideas?

<div>This was a known issue with NT server and I think I had it happen once when accessing an XP share.&nbsp;To work around this problem, modify the registry on the server computer by using the following information:</div>
<br />
<strong>Important</strong>&nbsp;This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base:
<div>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">322756</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</div>
The registry value IRPstackSize, which may be listed at&nbsp;<br />
<div>
<div>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
				
<br />
defaults to 0x4 if the value is not explicitly present. Valid values range from 0x1 to 0xC (1 to 12).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To increase the value of the parameter when it is not already present, go to the key:&nbsp;<br />
<div>
<div>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
				
The value of IRPStackSize defaults to 0x4 if it is not explicitly present. If the key is not present, click Add Value in Registry Editor. The Value Name should be IRPStackSize and the Data Type is REG_DWORD.</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Let me know if that helps or if this is too complex to follow. You can get more information on this at the following KB article:&nbsp;<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/198386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/198386</a></span></span></div>

            Cody,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your response. Well, let me tell you a bit more. I figured out that the registry got messed up by me using one of those "registry cleanup" programs. I'll never do that again!! Ok, I did exactly as you said and well, no change. I cannot map
 or even look at a shared drive on my laptop while on my desktop pc. I get the same error message. Yet, I can map drives on my laptop pc! Ok, any ideas? Is there a way of reinstalling XP without wiping everything out?<br />

            I'd highly recommend using a Restore Point to restore the registry. For more information on that, see the following KB article:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084</a>

<div>If you're still looking to do a repair install, have a look at the following KB article:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978788</a></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I went back 3 months for the restore point, and I still get that same error. I also just re-ran the network wizard from the control panel. Which, gets me to another question. On the last panel in the wizard you are given several choices. One is to
 create a floppy disk, and another is to use the Windows XP DVD and there are 2 other choices. This pc does not have a floppy disk on it. So, I always choose the last selection which is to not create a network disk. Question, is what I did correct? I do remember
 being able to map drives when I first installed windows on this pc (I build this one myself). So, I know it did work. Funny thing is that I can see those shared folders from my laptop, but I cannot connect to them. Something tells me I am going to have to
 wipe C: drive and do it all over again. Sigh. . .<br />

            Hi  sahilsachan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Type the following command NETSH WLAN show drivers and press Enter
<br />    In the results look for a line Hosted network supported, and see if it says Yes or No.
<br />
<br />If it says No then this is at fault, since your WiFi adapter does not support this feature, and there is not much to do about it (except buying another WiFi adapter that does support it.)

<h2>            PC keeps crashing &#40;BSOD&#41; while playing ARK Survival Evolved</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my Windows keeps crashing with different error codes everytime while playing Ark Survival Evolved. Not during any other applications/games though, simply when running that game. This is driving me insane and I don't know what to do other than updating
 all my drivers and trying to monitor what's causing the issue. Below is the link to OneDrive containing my minidump files and system information.

I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.

It probably is an issue with Ark Survival as the sticky post says the following: <br />
<br />
<em>Hey Survivors! </em><br />
<br />
<em>We have submitted a fix for stalls during gameplay on console and they are in the certification process.
</em><br />
<em>Prim Plus PC issue is still proving a bit difficult, but we're working on it!
</em><br />
<br />
<em>We will be posting more updates when they become available. </em><br />
<br />
Secondly, <br />
the last 2 pages of the thread provide many solutions to your issue, like downgrading Nvidia drivers to 399.

 This scanner was built to be compatible with Windows 9x.&nbsp; It's now at least 10 years old and well past it's lifecycle.&nbsp; Although you may not like it, Fujitsu do not feel it's economically worth their while to rewrite software for the few still in service.</p>
<p>Sorry, but that's the world of technology.&nbsp; It runs quicker than we can wear out products.&nbsp; However Microsoft do realize that there is still life in these old hardware devices and that's one of the reasons that they made XP Mode is FREE for users of Windows
 7 Ultimate and Professional.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m trying to play splitscreen xbox live with my roommate on xbox one, but it says guest accounts are not allowed&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to play xbox live on xbox one, splitscreen with my roommate. I get a message that says guest accounts are not allowed. I know in xbox 360 this was allowed so we didn't have to create 2 xbox live accounts. Is this a new rule or am I missing something?
 New to the xbox one community here, please help me out.

            On Xbox One, a single Xbox Live Gold subscription can cover all users. Also on Xbox One, each user must use their own Microsoft account. So, for best results, your friend should sign in with their own Microsoft account (or create a free one if they don't
 already have one), then they can play games you own on your Xbox One, and share any benefits you have, like Xbox Live Gold or Game Pass.

            Hi, Most Xbox one games don't have the split screen option anymore, Each user requires their own account, separate console, TV and copy of the game. What game are you trying to play together ? &nbsp;You may just have to do what Randy suggested and create an
 account before being able to play as you want to.

            We are tying to play Black Ops 4. I mean I'd be astounded if they took that option away for that game, considering the fact that many people with siblings play split screen together growing up which helps create brand loyalty.

<p>If Black Ops 4 doesn't have split-screen, that's on Activision, of course. But as choppy pointed out, many developers have stopped using split-screen to focus on the full-screen experience (and the fact that most players now interact via Xbox Live and the
 Internet instead of on the couch, as you remember growing up). </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for those games that do support local multiplayer, each of you will need your own Microsoft account, but your friend can use your games through Xbox One's Home Xbox feature.</p>

<p>Hey Cody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out, we'll try our best to sort this out for you. With most games, you are able to use a guest account to splitscreen or "couch co-op" no problem. Some developers however, require a secondary account to play together for one reason
 or another. Depending on the game you wish to play, you may or may not need to setup another account. As our great ambassador Randy mentioned, you would only need a gold subscription for one of the accounts if you are planning on going co-op for an online
 game. Hope this clears some things up, if you wish to get info on a certain game of franchise we encourage you to reach out to that developer's site. I personally enjoy good old Borderlands and since I do play online, I have a secondary account just in case
 a buddy wants to tag along for some mayhem.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>HELP NEEDED Switching Windows Live Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sweatshirtsteve  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP NEEDED Switching Windows Live Accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have been having a great deal of trouble with Microsoft Live support so I was hoping someone here might offer a solution.</p>
<p>The problem is my Windows Live account has been compromised and I doubt I will every get a response from the automated technical support there. The account I am using right now I created for when I have friends. So I was wondering if it was possible to move
 my Gamertag: SweatshirtSteve to this email account. I have tried searching for a solution for hours and it seems I will never get access to my old email account through the Windows Live site or on the Xbox 360 gaming console. My gamertag still works with everything
 intact, though I fear if It gets deleted it will be gone for good. All I have is my original 20gb HDD with the profile intact in case my 250gb HDD is damaged or destroyed. Please Help.</p>
<p>Original Windows Live Account: [Removed]</p>
<p>GamerTag: SweatshirtSteve</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ha, I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation. I have been through all those quick help things on this site and the Windows Live site. I literally cant access my account, doesn't matter if I change the password or not. I clearly even posted
 I couldn't access it from my Xbox gaming console. I did call several Microsoft help lines and the only ones that seemed like they could help aren't 24/7 and its now Sunday morning. As for the comment about how posting my email is probably what got me compromised
 in the first place. Well I'm not going to pretend that you know me, so **** off with the condescending attitude and go try to impress the little kids that need a lame suggestion like that. Is there an admin or someone with a relevant suggestion out there?</p>

<p>Nope. I tried that. I keep getting the "not a valid password" message. In fact even when I type in my password it is showing up with more than 5 additional characters, in the "*" format of course. I don't know if that is normal or not. I have never had issues
 with any Microsoft product, but from what I gather Windows Live has the absolute worst customer service ever. I couldn't even post a question on their forums. Thanks for the friendly advice though.</p>

<p>To help clarify it was compromised through phishing do to my own ignorance on facebook and who my real friends were. It is blocked on all sites and I cant even log in on this site with it. It is blocked because it was sending out massive amounts of spam,
 I'd say 300+ an hour when I saw that my email box was filled to the brim on my cell phone. I have tried changing my password, already opened up new email accounts, and have changed my credit card just in case. The only issue to be resolved is moving my gamertag
 over to my current email. Though with a blocked email it will always come up as an invalid password and/or email account. This is clearly a Microsoft Windows Live issue and not an Xbox Live issue, but as stated above that site is notorious for horrible automated
 customer service. Not the most critical issue I guess. Might just need to wait another 24 hours until I can talk to a human.</p>

<p>Zen was not right. The Windows Live support line is fully automated, and openly posting my email address on a public forum and having my account set to public instead of private on facebook are two very different things. But I am willing to apologize for
 the harsh remarks I made out of frustration. So yes I am sorry and maybe when this matter is resolved I will send Zen a game invite so he/she can thoroughly punish me in virtual combat. There are enough punks on the internet to worry about, decent people who
 try to help don't deserve to be snapped the way I did. So Zen Like Calm I, SweatshirtSteve, formally apologize for any and all wrong doing on my part, especially telling someone trying to help me to *pee* off.</p>

<p>Judging from several other forums with the same exact issue Im facing Im going to label this as answered because it seems the only way this can be resolve is by calling (800) 4MY-XBOX and not the Windows Live support line. Though it looks doubtful that they
 will be able to do anything without having my current WLID unblocked. Still beats the hell out of dealing with Apple.</p>

<h2>            Random deleting of words since upgrade to Win 10</h2>
                    I'm having a strange problem since upgrading to Windows 10 on my Toshiba Satellite. Quite often, as I'm typing, it will randomly delete words as I'm typing them, sometimes the same word, 3 or 4 times in a row. Considering I type for a living, this is getting
 rather annoying. Any ideas?

    <title>Live Mail unable to send MP3 attachment IN FULL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gas1126  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail unable to send MP3 attachment IN FULL</h2>
                    <p><span>I have windows Live Mail 2012 using only Hotmail accounts. For ever I have successfully been able to attach and send every variety of file. Suddenly, I cannot send MP3 music
 files. Every other attachment still sends perfectly. The email with MP3 attachment hangs in the Outbox and eventually fails and gives an error message (Error ID: 0x80191002). Strangely the email - plus some of the MP3 - attachment actually gets sent but when
 the recipient tries to play the MP3 track, only half of the track is present. Moreover, the email is shown as having been sent in my SENT box (often on more than one occasion). If I open the SENT file and then open the MP3 file, only half the music track will
 play before is stops and Media Player reports encountering a problem. I have reloaded entirely Live Essentials. I have run the Essentials Fix. I have deleted and reloaded the email accounts. The MP3 files are small ‚Äì less than 3mb. &nbsp;But, I still have the problem.
 Any ideas please?</span></p>

            Thanks for your interest. Any size limit is not relevant here because the file is only 2.8mb. Previous tests before this problem arrived were always successful. Moreover, when I use the Hotmail website to send a message (other than sending from Live Mail)
 the attachment travels without problem.
<div>I am only sending the message and attachment to myself for test purposes as I have several email accounts. It is a Live Mail problem and only occurs when the attachment is a a music file (MP3 or WMA).</div>

    <title>FTM 2010 Windows 10 Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlosmercado2  say:</h3>
<h2>            FTM 2010 Windows 10 Issues</h2>
                    <p>Tried reinstalling FTM2010 onto new Windows 10 HP laptop as administrator, Windows 7 (from which it came!) and finally Vista compatibility. Even the straight Windows 10 install yields same error message: "FTM 2010 was not properly closed the last time it
 was used. You may need to compact your last opened file to resolve any issues caused by an improper shut down...." It then tells you to choose "Compact File" from the tools menu. Weird!</p>
<p>No data present and still get same error msg. I even tried buying PC Mover from LapLink and moving program and data from old Win 7 64 bit computer.</p>
<p>Same error message. Any suggestions?</p>

            Hi Carlos,
<br />
<br />A very simple way to attack this, but have you tried running FTM under elevated privileges? Right-click FTM 2010 and hit Run as administrator. I've heard it fixes a lot of issues with it, but if it doesn't, let me know so I can venture on other solutions.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

<p>Ethan B.</p>
<p>If you read carefully my previous post, I stated that I tried installing&nbsp; several times one of those attempts was "install as administrator".</p>
<p>The original install was on a Window 7 Pro 64 bit HP computer. I even purchased LapLink PC Mover Professional and tried transferring a working install to the new Window 10 Pro HP laptop computer. Same error message. I cleaned any reference of FTM from the
 registry, attempted to install as "Administrator" with a fresh install with the original install CD. Same error message. I think that FTM 2010 is NOT compatible with Windows 10. Perhaps an install in a "virutal space" as was previously available with windows
 XP? If you have any suggestions in that possibility, please reply.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
