<h2>            Charity Database - Silent Auction Question</h2>
                    <p>I have created a database using Access 2010 for a charity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One of my tables has a one to many relationship for donors.&nbsp; This means that a donor can donate multiple items.</p>
<p>I have also created a report that prints a Silent Auction Bid Sheet for EACH donation.&nbsp; All of this works fine.</p>
<p>However, I'm now told that they would like the ability to 'group' items into ONE silent auction sheet.&nbsp; For example John Smith donates a bottle of wine, Mary Johnson donates a night at the B&amp;B and Bob Brown donates a car rental.&nbsp; We want to bundle ALL of
 these three donations and make it ONE Silent Auction Item.</p>
<p>I need to keep everyone's donation separate in order to provide them with tax receipts.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas / solutions on how to accomplish this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANKS!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You'll need to include a column in the donations table as a foreign key referencing the primary key of
<br />
a SilentAuction table and give each one an item number, e.g.<br />
<br />
Donors<br />
....DonorID (PK)<br />
....FirstName<br />
....LastName<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
Donations<br />
....DonationID (PK)<br />
....DonorID (FK)<br />
....DonationDescription<br />
....SilentAuctionID (FK)<br />
... SilentAuctionItemNumber<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
SilentAuctions<br />
....SilentAuctionID (PK)<br />
....SilentAuctionDate<br />
.....etc<br />
<br />
So, with your example, to which I've added a picnic hamper, the Donations tale might include rows like this<br />
<br />
DonationID&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DonorID&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DonationDescription&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SilentAuctionID&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SilentAuctionItemNumber<br />
21&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottle of wine&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
30&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Night at B&amp;B&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
33&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Car rental&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />
42&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picnic hamper&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2<br />
<br />
The ID numbers I've used are entirely arbitrary of course.&nbsp; All are items in the same silent auction (ID #7), the first three being grouped as a single item (number 1) the last as a separate item (number 2).&nbsp; To produce the silent auction sheets you just need
 to group the report first by SilentAuctionID and then by SilentAuctionItemNumber and force a page break after the SilentAuctionItemNumber&nbsp; group.<br />

            <p>Been there, already done that!</p>
<p>You don't have too many choices.&nbsp; You'll have to create another table to track grouped items.&nbsp; Basically create a Lot&nbsp;table and then a Lot Items tables&nbsp;where you itemize each individual item which comprises a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you generate a bidding sheet for each Lot and then sheets for each donation not included in a lot, or create a lot for each donation.</p>

<h2>            merge separate accounts into one family account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a family, we seem to have three separate accounts on the go (all of which I pay for!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My two kids both have MS accounts that they use for their Xboxes and laptop and i have one which I use for my Office 365 on my laptop and desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can merge them all under mine as a family account without disrupting their gamertags and downloaded games etc on the two Xboxes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You can link them to your account as family members - this shouldn't affect anything as it just links you as a family - but you cant merge the accounts into one.

<h2>            outlook 2013 keeps asking me to re-activate product key</h2>
                    <p>This is the 3rd time it has happened to me these past 6 months. &nbsp;Each time, the IT support team comes, uninstalls and reinstalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today when it happened, excel has been currently opened for days says the product is activated. &nbsp;In file/account menu, it says all products activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I happened to close outlook, which has been running for days as well, now it keeps asking to re-activate product. &nbsp;In file/account menu, it says reactivation required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change i recall doing was installing httpwatch recently.</p>

            It's a complicated question and hard to explain to a 5 year old, but I'll try to make it as simple as I can and my answer may not be technically accurate, since I am not a VOIP expert.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have used Skype for years and I have recently ported a landline over to an entirely VOIP service, called Lingo.&nbsp; And this is what I know about it:<br />
<br />
VOIP (Voice Over IP) is a way to send and receive phone calls entirely through an internet connection.&nbsp; To use it, you'd plug a VOIP box into a broadband or DSL router (to get access to your high speed internet connection) and then you'd plug a phone into the
 VOIP box.<br />
<br />
Once the service is all connected up, anyone can call the phone from any landline or cellphone (and even a compatible VOIP line) and the phone will ring in your home or you can call any landline or cellphone from the VOIP phone. (I'm actually using a two-line
 phone for this - one line is my home phone number, which is a regular landline, and the other line is for a charity organization I direct - this phone number was a regular landline, but to cut costs I ported it over to Lingo and now it is entirely handled
 via VOIP).<br />
<br />
VOIP can replace your landline if you choose a service that can port your existing phone number.<br />
VOIP service providers generally provide discounted international calling (I do not know of any purely VOIP services that provide FREE international calling).<br />
<br />
Skype is not an entirely pure VOIP service.&nbsp; Skype's free service allows you to call any other Skype user anywhere in the world, similar to the way you can instant message via Yahoo messenger or Windows Live messenger (only instead of messaging you are talking
 to the person - Skype also provides free messenger services).&nbsp; To use the Skype free voice services, all you'd need is a headset and microphone to plug into your computer and an internet connection.<br />
<br />
Skype also offers some paid services that allow you to have a phone number and would allow you to call from an internet-capable phone that is plugged into your broadband or DSL router (thus bypassing your computer).&nbsp; If you subscribe to the Skype phone number
 plan, you could place calls from the phone to any landline or cellphone and you could receive calls that are placed from any landline or cellphone.&nbsp; The internet-capable phone would ring when a call is received similar to the way a landline rings.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Skype also provides discounted calling to international numbers.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you subscribed to the Skype phone number, calls received to and placed from that number would use a combination of landline/cellular and voip technology to transmit and deliver the phone call.<br />
<br />
Now that I've provided an answer, I imagine some other folks will chime in at least to correct something I've posted here.

            it seems to work now but the other problem is that the windows button is not working and even when I try to click open center it does not appear, when I try to install or download anything it say it is blocked and it fail downloading, As I told you, you
 fix another problem and the other appear in windows 10.

            <p>I've discovered that wireless keyboards seem to often get confused with W10 (not mice strangely) my fix has been just remove the battery's of a few seconds then replace them. "Connect" seems to have no effect. I also have a Saitec gaming board that is behaving
 erratically. My R.A.T 7 refuses to work at all, although in this case I suspect that I should have installed the software in compatibility mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It it sounds like you have many issues simultaneously, did you check the hash of your install ISO? You may have a corrupt copy.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Upgrading motherboard after upgrade to RTM Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel case  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading motherboard after upgrade to RTM Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This system has been using the insider preview builds from scratch back in December 2014. Build 8xx I think.</p>
<p>It was built on the minimum platform that was running Windows 7 at that time in my organization.</p>
<p>3GHz PIII dual core with 4GB, 64 bit, 80GB drives, onboard video.</p>
<p>All those systems have now been upgraded and license keys re-entered and most are still running Windows 7.</p>
<p>They are being upgraded to Windows 10 successfully one at a time. (From Retail versions of Win 7 Pro).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to upgrade this system's motherboard and video card now.&nbsp; It has never had a previous version of Windows installed.</p>
<p>It is still running build 10240, even though I have chosen the fast channel and Insider Builds are enabled.&nbsp; (???)</p>
<p>Upgrade to i7-4790 w/16GB, 1TB hdd, w/GeForce GT630 video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's 2 questions; First is how to upgrade the mobo without losing activation.
</p>
<p>Second is how to get latest builds to download and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am continuing in the Insider program and will continue testing our configurations on this system before upgrading any of the other systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first attempt was to clone the HDD onto a new system, it lost activation and would not re-activate after being online for 10 days, so it got wiped and reloaded from scratch, same results.&nbsp; I want to retire this mobo, it is obsolete.&nbsp; The new hardware
 configuration makes this one appear to be stuck in a tar pit!&nbsp; That much faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>
<p>

            <p>The activation for Windows 10 is the activation of the computer.</p>
<p>When you change the motherboard you then have a new and different computer.</p>
<p>To activate the new computer you have 2 choices.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Install Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 from your media and upgrade to the public of Windows 10.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Buy Windows 10 and install it.</p>

            <p>Appreciate your time to read the questions, please reread the first sentence. This computer was built from scratch for the insider previews back in November of 2014.&nbsp; It has never had anything other than Windows 10 on it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple articles in the Insider Blog explaining about Win 10 tying activation to the motherboard.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Which brings up another question; What exactly are they activating, the CPUID, the BIOS version and serial number, a combined hash of the information found from CPU and BIOS?&nbsp; If so, just upgrading the BIOS on the same motherboard could violate the activation.&nbsp;
 !!&nbsp; AND, if they use the CPU information, upgrading the CPU on the same motherboard (i.e. i3-xxxx to i7-xxxx) would violate the activation as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer was intended for insider preview builds, and has no other purpose, it does no "real data processing, word or number crunching."&nbsp; It does check email occasionally.&nbsp; It provides no data processing benefit to the organization.&nbsp; It consumes space
 and electricity and my time, I justify it by "preventing data loss and loss of productivity by validating upgrades".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will continue to be strictly for insider preview analysis. </p>
<p>But since this configuration will no longer be used in my organization, this configuration is no longer valid to use as a test-bed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>back to original questions:</p>
<p>1) How to get it to download and install latest insider builds?&nbsp; (It discontinued after the installation of build 10240.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How to upgrade it and keep activation, or, will Microsoft allow me to use a phone activation to keep it on the insider program?</p>
<p>

<p>Most of us understand that Microsoft has to protect their interests in the huge investment of OS development.&nbsp; Tying activation to a hidden piece of data or code on the system drive, or in a signature in the boot sector would allow someone to clone the hard
 drive and deprive Microsoft of rightful revenue by creating multiple computers that are loaded and activated.&nbsp; The downside is, if the HDD dies, you must have a complete backup available to rebuild the HDD and get that computer back up and productive.&nbsp; A computer
 is valuable only as long as it is online and productive.&nbsp; Sitting on the shelf, it is just a collection of parts, growing obsolete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tying activation to the system board (or motherboard, as us old timers call them) does have advantages in preventing piracy and unwanted duplication.&nbsp; However, hardware is pieces parts, and parts still die.&nbsp; No matter what method Microsoft uses to implement
 "one license = one computer" policy, parts will die and forcing a customer to purchase new licenses because a part died and had to be replaced is wrong. There must be a legitimate path that can be taken to invalidate to old machine ID and repair/upgrade it,
 keeping the same license key for that computer.&nbsp; Kinda like the old "per seat basis" for licensing connections on MS servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question will continue to be bashed around, it has been getting bashed since HP was licensing their Unix software way back when (before NT5.0 became Windows 2000).&nbsp; My first PC was a Heathkit H89, running HDOS and CP/M.&nbsp; Xerox had word processing machines
 using "windowing software" and GUIs before MacIntosh or Microsoft Windows. I was a Honeywell mainframe systems programmer, we spoke nothing but assembler, been an MCSE since NT 3.5.&nbsp; I think DELL has a good idea about the individual System IDs and storing
 them in CMOS,&nbsp; Not sure if they're still doing that, haven't touched a DELL in a few years.&nbsp; I think that should be an industry standard and could be one approach to licensing.&nbsp; Still have to contend with parts dying and transferring the license to the new
 system and invalidating the old system ID.&nbsp; This soap box isn't going away any time soon.&nbsp; I'll probably go away to my heavenly rewards before this question does.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to tomorrow, Have a good one!</p>

            <p>Hello Daniel, this is all AFIK:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your machine-key is a combination of your MSA, hardware configuration, time? and whatnot. There is some flexibility in this, that is, you should be able to change most hardware, discs, NIC's, etc. and have no trouble. Don't know if this extends to the MB.
 I once (older OS) got into trouble because I was changing disc configuration between RAID and back, say 5 times in one day (always accompanied by a clean install from a (legit) DVD). A simple call to MS-support at the time solved it with no huhu. But, alas,
 no support for us Insiders. So you are on tricky ground there</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your not getting offered any updates: It's a (hopelessly) long shot but you might try: Uninstalling the
<strong>Insider Hub</strong>, restarting the PC (don't skip), then installing it again (it's in Optional Features not the Store)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Not even an original Win7 DVD/Key?, that would work as well</p>

            <p>Just read some of the related content answers, the situations brought up can be mind boggling, when did you upgrade it? Was it from an activated copy of previous version?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There is an article in the blog, (lost the reference) about transferring licenses from OEM vs Retail versions.&nbsp; Basically, an OEM version is tied to that system, period, no transfers.&nbsp; Retail versions are transferable.&nbsp; I have worked for a company that used
 OEM versions on Intel mobos and we swapped mobos and HDDs regularly with no issues, as long as the part number and revision numbers agreed, no issues. Using one of the HDDs on another brand mobo? It would boot, report that it was invalid and shut down. No
 way to get it to be usable at all, by design. </p>
<p>Our current systems running Retail Windows 7 Pro, upgrade mobo; check that system has changed, re-enter license key, and activation happens.&nbsp; Then we can upgrade to Windows 10 with no issues.</p>
<p>But some of the situations that Lawrence is answering are quite complicated and I applaud how he is keeping all the scenarios straight.&nbsp;

            <p>The insider preview issue has been solved.&nbsp; I had 2 other PCs at home that used my MSA account to log onto Windows 10 after they were upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 Pro. Switched them to local logins, 2 days later, no change.&nbsp; During this time I loaded
 Insider Hub from the store, rebooted, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Windows 10 Insider Preview PC, I opted out of the Insider Builds on the Advanced Options screen of Updates. rebooted the PC, Went back to the Advanced screen, and re-enrolled in the Preview Builds, Fast Track. Today = tons of updates including upgrade
 to Insider Build 10565.&nbsp; Went on without a hitch, just took almost 2 hours.&nbsp; After the first login, when you're getting those cute screens about setting up your apps, just a few more tweaks, then the last one was "This is taking a bit longer than usual, should
 be finished soon." (That's why I want to upgrade this mobo.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, now build 10565 is up and running so far.&nbsp; The Mail app crashed the first time I opened it, then is running OK on 2nd try.&nbsp; Have to test more of the apps and check out the customization options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went looking through the Insider Community posts, a lot of people had problems with 10565 install, most of them seem to be laptops.&nbsp; Would be interesting to tabulate by model &amp; config to see if there are compatibility issues, or just operator errors, like
 shutting down at the wrong time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did click on the "Learn More" tab in the activation section, opens up browser at the page describing the different activation modes.&nbsp; Nicely done, informative, and described my issue with activation after clean install of Windows 10 Insider with hardware
 upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to call Customer Support.&nbsp; Should be simple enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both issues will be considered resolved after the mobo swap and a phone call. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Built out another PC for my niece, installed Windows 10 using my MSA account, then added her ID as family and administrator, then disabled my ID and changed my password using my PC.&nbsp; Now her ID shows up on my PC as an additional login,&nbsp; Not an issue, just
 interesting.&nbsp; The store tracks more than you would think.&nbsp; Does it track everything done with my MSA account?&nbsp; Big Brother?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good one,</p>

            It will be interesting to see if you convince Support to activate Windows on your new motherboard without a prior Windows 7 or 8 license.&nbsp; I believe their only recourse will be to issue a unique Windows 10 product key, which I doubt they will do with no
 prior Windows 7 or 8 license for the computer.&nbsp; If you had replaced the motherboard on October 1st or earlier, you could have activated a pre-release build and upgraded to activated RTM, but those pre-release builds are now expired and cannot activate.

            <p>I attempted to upgrade early in September, activation was blocked, did not call MS support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agreed, might be difficult, I don't know if getting the insider builds to work again, and upgrading to build 10565 today will work against me or not.&nbsp; Was on build 10240 for a long time, now I have the watermark in the lower right again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to get an ISO of build 10565 and do a clean install on the new mobo?&nbsp; That's asking for the whole load in one shot!&nbsp; Dreaming, right?&nbsp; Must upgrade the HDD soon, this 80GB drive is filling up! the only app I use any data with is the
 Mail.&nbsp; Next item on "to do list" is check out if the clean-up tools are still there, and remove old updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sent in feed back already.&nbsp; Are the scroll bars in some apps disappearing way too early?&nbsp; In the feedback app, they go away after 1/2 second and clicking where the scroll bar WAS doesn't work.&nbsp; You have to move the cursor around and back to the scroll bar
 to get it to work again.&nbsp; This ain't gonna fly with some of my users, I can hear the cries already!</p>

            <p>I used Hyper-V to download 10565 and as soon as it began getting ready to upgrade and had created the C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\install.esd I copied that install.esd file from the VM to a network share on my host PC. &nbsp;I could then create a Build 10565 Pro
 ISO from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of making an ISO, I formatted my Windows partition and applied the install.esd to that partition using DISM and used bcdboot to have the BCD point to the new Windows files to finish the install. &nbsp;Making an ISO and doing a clean install is much simpler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally use ESD Decrypter 4.7, which I believe is a script written by some MDL Forum users. &nbsp;The ESD file created by Windows update is not encrypted, which is why DISM works with it, but the script is a simple way to convert the ESD to a bootable ISO.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/instructions-create-a-bootable-iso-file-using-esd/d2768b51-221a-436e-af4e-d3b9118a8864">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/instructions-create-a-bootable-iso-file-using-esd/d2768b51-221a-436e-af4e-d3b9118a8864</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, you can make a 10565 ISO and clean install it on the new motherboard. &nbsp;I would get Windows 7, 8 or 10 activated on the motherboard first if you can. &nbsp;There is a GenuineTicket.xml file that can be created on a running and activated Windows 7, 8 or
 10 and then used to activate clean installs of Windows 10 (on that same device) if auto-activation ever fails.</p>

            <p>OK Don, followed your notes regarding how to make an ISO of the new release.&nbsp; Captured the install.esd just before rebooting for the upgrade to build 10586.&nbsp; got the ESD decrypter, made the ISO.&nbsp; Then allowed updater to go ahead and upgrade the PC.&nbsp; So far
 everything is clean and good.&nbsp; Even captured the GenuineTicket.XML file.&nbsp; So I should be able to perform a clean install of build 10586 on this motherboard after replacing the HDD with a faster and larger one. There's a 320GB SATA II sitting on the shelf just
 begging to be tried, replacing this 80GB SATA I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Been too busy with other upgrades to really mess with this machine recently.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several .XML files in the C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources directory that describe your machine and it's inventory. I could not
 find references to HDD make, model, type or size.</p>
<p>They got you nailed as far as motherboard goes, manufacturer, model, serial, CMOS info, BIOS info.&nbsp; What they allow to change and still activate? only those writing the programs, maybe those managing the servers are in the know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure those that work
 the activation part of customer service have scripts to run and show them exactly what's been reported and allow them to make decisions.&nbsp; At least with the 320GB drive, I can port it over to the new board and try by placing the GenuineTicket file in the proper
 place.&nbsp; Not expecting to be successful, may end up just purchasing a Win 10 key from the Store if I can't talk customer service into activating the new board.&nbsp; Found an uninstalled box of Windows 7 Ultimate in the filing cabinet, might go that route, and suffer
 through all the upgrades again.</p>
<p>Update!&nbsp; was looking through the announcements and starting with build 1056? they allow input of a valid Windows 7 or 8 or 8.1 key to activate a clean install of Win 10.&nbsp; So, I think that's the route to go, and just rejoin the insider program to receive
 insider builds once it has activated.</p>

    <title>Nokia 808 PureView YouTube issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bakoscsaba82  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 808 PureView YouTube issue</h2>
                    On YouTube mobile site I can't start playing videos in Nokia browser. It was working before but for 3 days now it doesn't. The mobile site loads, I can log in, share, like, but can't start videos. When I click on play it does nothing except brings up that
 small panel with like, dislike, add and share buttons.<br />
I can watch videos from Opera mobile, but it doesn't load the html5 site of youtube. I can also watch videos from ****, it works fine, but not from stock browser.<br />
Is the problem on youtube's side or on my device?<br />
<br />
I'm using Nokia 808 PureView with Belle Fp2

            most likely the fault of Google who may have stopped support for certain browsers, and considering it works in other browsers such as Opera Mobile or CuteTube (which have had updates to rectify the break in operability that was made by the recent changes
 in YouTube's API). i honestly would go with CuteTube anyway, always an excellent client and found it much better than anything i've ever used for YouTube.

            I'm afraid too that this issue is connected to youtube API changes, but I couldn't find any complaints on forums or blogs that youtube's mobile site isn't working for someone. I'm still wondering to reinstall my firmware, but my phone is less than a month
 old and I don't really want to go through that painful process to backup all my data and reinstall all applications especially if it won't solve my problem for sure.<br />
Could You or someone check that youtube is working or not on Nokia Belle devices?  <br />
<br />
I like CuteTube too, I use it to browse or download videos. But when I just saw an interesting link to youtube, it was so much more easier to click on the link and open it in the browser then to start CuteTube and search for the video.

            I'll try and have a look on my N8 tonight and get back to you. I think though that with re-installing your firmware, it won't change a thing. It is an API thing and as the browser itself hasn't changed or been updated to be compatible with the API changes,
 then it won't work. Unfortunately as Symbian is now in maintenance mode, there may be no more firmware updates for your device. But there have been statements that the 808 will continue to be supported.....the extent of that support remains to be seen, and
 if the web browser will be updated etc etc.

<p>Lenovo laptop model 8925 and using windows 10 pro. After downloading 17091 for 4 to 5 hours, it quits the setupand say returning to previous 17083. I down a bit of checking using the update troubleshooter and it found and fixed the following 3 items: potential
 windows update database error detected, windows update components must be repaired, check for pending updates.</p>
<p>Now when i check for updates, it keeps saying you are up to date.</p>
<p>windows insider program 17083 works fine.</p>
<p>Only change done to laptop was AVG program was added prior to me trying to update to 17091. Could this be stopping tne downloading?</p>

<p>Yes, it definitely could be the issue.</p>
<p>Uninstall it using the manufacturers&nbsp;</p>
<p>removal tool if they have one.</p>
<p>If this solves the issue, the 1st thing you should&nbsp;</p>
<p>do when/if you get on 17093 is to go into the</p>
<p>Power Options in Control Panel.</p>
<p>Choose what the power buttons do, then on</p>
<p>the next screen click Change settings that are</p>
<p>currently unavailable and untick Fast Startup.</p>
<p>This option is causing boot issue for many.</p>

            I removed AVG and went to update and it updated windows defender but then a msg said that it couldn’t be completed. Still when i check for updates it says you are up to date.

<p>Hi Crazykats</p>
<p>i &nbsp;found it set to slow and set it fast and back and forth several times and left it on fast. Went to updates and it is downloading 17093.1000.</p>
<p>will let you know how it turna out later</p>
<p>Fred</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi CrazyKata</p>
<p>went all the through until half way working the updates and then said there was problem, it tried to fix it twice and then said was returning to previous version 1708 which it did. I noticed when it first started downloading at the start it fkashed that
 darn RuntimeBroker.exe - Applcation error which probably needs correcting in order for 17093 to install completely. Any ideas.</p>

            I'm having this issue with a Lumia 950XL, with music pass. I have no owned music in one drive. I formatted my micro SD card and upgraded to a larger capacity one and now have this issue. I have tried signing out, and back in. Syncing my music, even put
 the old micro SD card back into my phone, but nothing seems to have fixed the issue. I've tried restarting my phone but I'm not wanting to reset, that's a pain.

            Can you explain what issue you are seeing?&nbsp; All of your music pass music is gone?&nbsp; All of the mp3s you have on your phone are gone? If so, I'm assuming you transferred them to the new SD card?

            all of my music is showing from my music pass, but it won't allow me to play any of it. I had my music
 pass music set to download so that I could listen offline. I formatted my old sd card, inserted the new, and tried to download onto that for offline use. Now it won't play at all via streaming.

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I found my entire collection in Recycle bin !! It seems every time you delete a playlist in Groove you also lose the files in the respective folder on your system .... just guessing . I had deleted all my playlists to create a new one .</p>
<p>Don't know what happened luckily I read a post on groove in which one guy found all his songs in his recycle bin so I too checked and found all my collection there ....WEIRD !</p>

            I have reset my phone and it seems to have resolved the issue.... A real pain though having to do that just because you have swapped an SD card.

<h2>            Visio 2016 Crash consistantly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had an ongoing issue with Visio 2016 (Office 365 click to run edition) for a while now. When ever I click on the "Line" drop down menu, Visio reports a crash, stops responding and then restarts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at a few solutions, namely, disabling graphics acceleration, running system checker tool and re-registering DLL files. Nothing seems to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's rather frustrating, as when it does it it also resets the settings in visio, not to mention looses everything I work!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone out there come across this? </p>

<p>
</p><p>If possible, could you please provide the detailed Event logs about the Visio Crashing? Also check your Visio 2016 version numbers (File &gt; Account &gt; About Visio).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please start Visio application in safe mode (Open Run in Windows, type Visio /safe, press Enter), confirm if the Visio application crashes in safe mode or not.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In addition to the crashing, I've found that even though "AutoRecover" is enabled and provides a popup window telling me that it's autosaving the file, I'm not able to find or access the recovered file.&nbsp; When I open the file, it just opens back to my last
 manual save and doesn't prompt me with the usual "recovered" file.&nbsp; None of the following seems to keep the program from crashing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Running a Quick Repair or Online Repair</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling Visio</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling Office and then Visio</li><li>Disabling graphics acceleration</li><li>Running system checker tool and re-registering DLL files</li></ul>

            <p>Hi Gene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean about you cannot disable them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Visio 2016 safe mode, please go to File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins, select Manage COM Add-ins, click GO. then uncheck the checkbox next to the first Add-in. Restart Visio in normal mode, confirm if the Visio Crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat the steps to disable Add-ins one by one to find out which one is the root cause about it.</p>

            <p>Hey Winni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know,&nbsp;that was the first thing I was trying to do, but they didn't appear in the COM Add-ins window that opens.&nbsp; It was very odd to see them appear under Active Application Add-ins, but not in the COM Add-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked around this issue by removing the PDFVisio.vsl file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\PDFMaker\Office.&nbsp; Now this removed all the listed add-ins, so I won't be able to diagnose which one(s) caused the issue.&nbsp; I'll keep running Visio in
 normal mode and see if this corrected the&nbsp;stability issue and if&nbsp;autosave now works, and report back when I have&nbsp;a higher confidence that the problem was resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other&nbsp;interesting fact, is that I have a Windows10 machine&nbsp;with the same versions of Adobe Acrobat and Visio, and this machine has not had the same issue as my Windows7 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said above, I'll report back in a few days on the status of this work around (removing the vsl file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gene</p>

            <span>Hi guys after 2 days of figuring out what's the matter with visio 2016. So sharing this, I have my Office Pro 2016 already installed before Visio. Since my version
 is a Click-to-run (c2r) I updated my Office 2016 version for example in the Word &gt; Account &gt; Updates &gt; Update now. After updating it, Visio also works without crashing. :D&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            Secure Data Erase in Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    I was just wondering if there are any secure data erasing tools to wipe free space in the SD Card and Phone memory of windows phone.<br />
Something similar to Recuva as in Windows 7 for PC.,as i am unable to access the phone's storage using softwares in my PC.<br />

            <p>The data on your phone's device is extremely secure.&nbsp; There is no supported method of wiping or inspecting that free space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your CD card, you will need to use a card reader and any applicable software to wipe the device.&nbsp; Or better still, physically destroy it (burning it to a crisp would do the job).</p>

            I understand that the data is secure in windows where it cannot be wiped like you said.<br />
But what if someone uses linux or any other os to recover the deleted files?.I assume linux can do a pretty good job of locating almost every kind of hardware<br />

                    <p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>My Surface 3 is currently running Windows 10 build 10074. Periodically, it downloads and attempts to install a new build. During the installation, it reboots to the “Surface”
 screen, and never gets past that point.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>It appears to be in a CPU loop, since leaving it alone results in a steadily increasing temperature.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>At that point, the only thing that has any effect is to press and hold the power button for a while. This eventually reboots it, and I get the message:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">The biggest issue is that there appears to be no way to tell it not to attempt to install the update, and no way to predict when it will try.
 Several times now I closed it up, but it in my case, and when I went to take it out a few hours later it was displaying the “Surface” screen and it was so hot I could barely touch it.</span></p>

<h2>            Dependent Drop Down List</h2>
                    <p>I want to have two drop down lists. One list is dependent of the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e899180e-7933-40e0-b8a3-e398e799e19c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e899180e-7933-40e0-b8a3-e398e799e19c" /></a></p>
<p>Zone Lengths will be the first drop down. From there i want to create a drop down that filters 1-6 depending on what was chosen in the first drop down. I was unsure on how to do this because of the repeating values of 1-6.</p>

<h2>            Excel linked table in Access</h2>
                    <p>I have data in an excel table that is in the time format hh:mm:ss. These numbers are durations of calls and need to stay as time. However, when I link the table in Access, it converts it to date/time. My table in excel looks like this:</p>

I've tried to change the cell format in Access, but it tells me that I cannot because the table is linked and read-only. Also, I can't seem to find the right format in Access anyway. I don't know what to do. I need the data as time only in Access. How do I
 fix this??

            <p>The primary issue is that you/someone&nbsp;is storing a duration of time in a point in time format. I would always store time durations as the number of minutes or seconds or hours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Access date/time values are actually stored as numbers with the whole number part being the number of days since Dec 30. 1899. The decimal part of the number is the part of a day. Noon is 0.5 and 6:00 PM is 0.75.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use format properties in controls on forms and reports to display as times.</p>

            <p>Don't confuse data&nbsp;<em>storage</em> with data <em>presentation</em>. They are different tasks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Duane says, an Access Date/Time value (and there's only one datatype, not separate dates and times) is just a number. I'd agree emphatically with him that you should store durations as just a duration, a count of seconds. You can&nbsp;<em>display</em> this
 count in minutes:seconds with an expression such as</p>
<p>
</p><p>[duration] \ 60 &amp; ":" &amp; Format([duration] MOD 60, "00")</p>

            <p>Are you linking the Excel spreadsheet with a view to importing the data into Access, or are you using the data directly from the linked table?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, you can convert the date/time value to a number of seconds by multiplying it by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Int([Fieldname] * 86400)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If importing, you can do this in the append query that inserts the new data into your table. &nbsp;Otherwise, you can do it in a select query as the data is being processed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't need to process the data at all, but just display it, say, in a report, then you can use an expression to format the date/time value on the fly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Int([FieldName])*24 + Hour([FieldName])) &amp; Format([FieldName], ":nn:ss")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first part of the expression takes the number of whole days, multiplies it by 24, and adds the number of hours from the date/time. &nbsp;The second part formats the minutes and seconds and appends it to the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best!</p>

<p>Yep. Timevalue("00:01:30") * 86400 returns 90 (seconds). Timevalue converts a time string to fractions of a day, and there are 86400 seconds in a day.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            There is a further complication here.&nbsp; Access and Excel use a different origin in the implementation of date/time data.&nbsp; For instance your first value, #1/1/1900 4:21:00 PM#, in Access when expressed as a duration in the format hh:nn:ss&nbsp; is 64:21:00, not
 40:21:00. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can see this if you apply Graham's expression (corrected slightly) to the literal value:<br />
<br />
? Int(#1/1/1900 4:21:00 PM#)*24 + Hour(#1/1/1900 4:21:00 PM#) &amp; Format(#1/1/1900 4:21:00 PM#, ":nn:ss")<br />
64:21:00<br />
<br />
or using the following function, which is one of a bunch I've thrown together over the years:<br />
<br />
Public Function TimeToString(dtmTime As Date, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional blnShowdays As Boolean = False) As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngDays As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strDays As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strHours As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get whole days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngDays = Int(dtmTime)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strDays = CStr(lngDays)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strHours = Format(dtmTime, "hh")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If blnShowdays Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeToString = lngDays &amp; ":" &amp; strHours &amp; Format(dtmTime, ":nn:ss")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeToString = Format((Val(strDays) * 24) + Val(strHours), "00") &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format(dtmTime, ":nn:ss")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
? TimeToString(#1/1/1900 16:21:00#)<br />
64:21:00<br />
<br />
Shorter durations are represented correctly, however, e.g.<br />
<br />
? TimeToString(#12/30/1899 4:50:54 AM#)<br />
04:50:54<br />
<br />
Looking at your sample data I think anything less than 24 hours is being represented correctly, but values over 24 hours are offset by one day, so
<em>if this is consistent throughout the data</em> it could be corrected with:<br />
<br />
TimeToString(IIf(TimeField &lt;1,TimeField,TimeField-1))<br />
<br />
You can see how this works in the debug window:<br />
<br />
TimeField = #1/1/1900 4:21:00 PM#<br />
? TimeToString(IIf(TimeField &lt;1,TimeField,TimeField-1))<br />
40:21:00<br />
TimeField = #12/30/1899 4:50:54 AM#<br />
? TimeToString(IIf(TimeField &lt;1,TimeField,TimeField-1))<br />
04:50:54<br />
<br />
To see the values corrected in this way in Access you'd call the function as above either in computed columns in a query or computed controls in a form or report.&nbsp; In the linked table's raw datasheet view the values would be represented as at present, but that
 is immaterial as data should never be exposed to a user in raw datasheet view.<br />
<br />
If you wish to do time arithmetic on the data then you'd need to conditionally adjust each value by -1 if it is 1 or above before using the value in an arithmetic expression.<br />
