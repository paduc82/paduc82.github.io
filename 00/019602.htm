<h2>            Adding &#34;old&#34; skype accounts as contacts in case of homonymity with legacy username and live&#58;username</h2>
                    How can I add a legacy skype contact in case of homonyms with live: contacts? It's already the 2nd time I put a precise username and I'm given only the equivalent live:username contacts along with similar ones... but not the "old" (pre Microsoft Live)
 username. Is there an equivalent prefix to facilitate the search of older accounts in case the same issue occurs?

            Hi M
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Do you have an example for replication of this problem? I am assuming contact is not disabled.

<p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can certainly provide examples, however that would expose the usernames.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say you have an old skype account (pre-Microsoft) named MySkypeID and someone else has a skype account named live:MySkypeID</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're telling everyone to add you by looking for MySkypeID, trouble is that everyone else finds live:MySkypeID
<em>first</em> if you are lucky. However, if you aren't, in the search results would appear only live:MySkypeID and a plethora of useless accounts with similar IDs. But NOT the old MySkypeID.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question could be simplified as in: is there some sort of a handle to identify old accounts, like
<strong>o</strong><strong>ld:MySkypeID</strong>, in order to distinguish them from new homonyms, like
<strong>live:MySkypeID</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of concrete examples of recent conversations made "complicated" by this issue (fixed by the other party looking for my contact in turn) and can obviously provide screenshots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>M.</p>

<h2>            Ability to move Action Centre and Popup Notifications to different screens or monitors&#63;</h2>
                    I was wondering if there are plans to allow users to move the Action Centre and Popup Notifications to different screens when using multiple monitor setups in the same way you can have the Taskbar appear on only one screen even if it's not the primary
 screen/monitor?

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, I’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. How did the clients set up their Office 365 account into the CRM, via POP?</p>
<p>2. Did they set up their Office 365 account into the CRM as the following settings?</p>
<p>Server name: outlook.office365.com</p>
<p>Port: 995</p>
<p>Encryption method: SSL</p>
<p>3. How many clients who are using Office 365 account with the CRM encounter the same issue? All of them?</p>
<p>4. By saying “accounts are set not to retain a copy”, would you mind sharing the detailed steps of how you did it?</p>
<p>5. To identify whether the issue is related to the 3rd party client or the Office 365 account, could you please ask the problematic clients to set up their Office 365 accounts into their Outlook client to see if the issue persists?</p>
<p>I appreciate your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<p>Saw another thread with similar issue <a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/419305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
community.office365.com/.../419305</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>CRM can only do pop3 </p>
<p>Server name: outlook.office365.com</p>
<p>Port: 995</p>
<p>Encryption method: SSL</p>
<p>User name is full email address &amp; password </p>
<p>I know of at leads 8 driftnet domains/clients all use the cloud based office 365 email is what we have also saw as the commonality. &nbsp; Not every email is having the issue is what we find odd
</p>
<p>My self and clients effected know by default office 365 done not retain a copy and it has to be done on the receiving email client./application that being the crm which does not have that capability it will remove the email . &nbsp;We checked the inbox rules
 &amp; permissions and all are defaulted we compared to accounts not effected rules and permissions are the same. We also tested via tel net commands like in
<a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/419305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">community.office365.com/.../419305</a> and the email will not remove from the inbox of the account. Only solution we see is so far is recreating the accounts on offfice 365 side
 &nbsp;we recreated them in the crm at first issue still happend. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to install 10565 Enterprise on top of 10547</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running Enterprise Build 10547.&nbsp; Fast ring.&nbsp; Trying to install 10565.&nbsp; I was surprised when 10565 didn't appear in Windows Update for a few days after it was released to the Fast Ring.&nbsp; It finally appeared after it was released to the Slow
 Ring.&nbsp; However, I can't get it to install.&nbsp; I try to "Restart" from Windows Update and I just get a regular reboot.&nbsp; In Windows Update, I see "Updates Available" and it lists "th2_release Enterprise 10565".&nbsp; If I click "Details" and then "Requires Restart"
 I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p>th2_release Enterprise 10565</p>
<p>10/11/2015</p>
<p>th2_release Enterprise 10565</p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe the Fast Ring update did get recognized.&nbsp; Anyway, I can't get the install to fire.&nbsp; I also tried downloading the ISO, but I can't figure out the right product key.&nbsp; I'm using our Enterprise MAK key but it's not being accepted.&nbsp; Maybe the ISOs are
 not Enterprise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stuck.&nbsp; Looking for help.</p>

<h3> ghamzi  say:</h3>
<h2>            E65 Code &#38;amp&#59; Language check B4 Update</h2>
                    Hello there,<br />
I am planning on using the NSU to update my firmware.<br />
I have Arabic language on my phone and I really wish not to lose it.I would really appreciate if someone would help me with few questions.<br />
First, my phone has the following information:<br />
Nokia E65<br />
Code: 0553428<br />
IMEI: 3569610104xxxxx<br />
Firmware:<br />
2.0633.65.01<br />
03-10-2007<br />
RM-208<br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
1)What is the detailed changelog of the newest available firmware?<br />
2)If such information is not available, Sliding the phone off hangs up the call, did it became a controlled process with an option in the settings? (This is the only problem that bothers me)<br />
3)Is my code a real Gulf area code? I bought it from UAE at an "Authorized Nokia Dealer"<br />
<br />
Finally, Thanks in advance for all your help!

            hello there i don't have all the answers but here are some:<br />
<br />
1. change log is not official public knowledge for consumers therefore it can not be posted on Nokia borads<br />
<br />
RM 208 is E65-1 however your product code does not match any codes that I have been able to find for your device, there is not code starting with 055... for E65 anywhere i looked.<br />
i can't answer your slider issue as i do not have any hands on knowledge of E65 so sorry. i hope this little bit at least helped. you can google e65 product code query and you will find lists of product codes as those are done by specific regions and perhaps
 i missed something that you will find. good luck.

            First, hank you for your reply<br />
Second, I know dealers tend to change the Keypad for their markets but I do have Arabic keypad as well, I am thinking since it is a slider phone the dealer would not be able to change it, unlike other Xpress On Nokia phones. Am I thinking correctly?

            That's great. Thanks for the help.<br />
But this brings me back to the question, will the update have Arabic also? I really don't want to lose the Arabic language I already have.

            if you bought it from Nokia dealer or official store, you should have nothing to worry about. also if you lose your language pack, you can always go to Nokia Care point and they can install it for you for some cost, you will lose that language pack if
 you update firmware or have to reformat your phone in the future. SO there are ways that you can still get your language pack even if you were to lose it after update. I was unable to find this product code to tell me specifically what region it was meant
 for. but you have options.

            I understand that, This happened to me before with my Nokia 6630. I know I can take the phone later on to a Nokia care point and get the language installed. The problem is I live in the US now and there are no care points close to me. I also know there
 are other ways to get the language pack which is considered to be almost "illegal". I am not planning on on altering any of the phone defaults and risk losing it.<br />
I have 5 languages actually on the phone at the moment. I understand if I went ahead with the update there will be only three?<br />

            Something I might have just realized. My own product code even though if it is an Authentic Gulf Arabic code, the languages installed on the phone are not the languages that should be in a Gulf Arabic code.<br />
<br />
I think my code might not have been authentic!<br />
tell me what you think.

check this out, now it is for a different phone but i think that language packs should be pretty much standard. see if yours is somewhere.

            I looked at that before actually, I even looked at a list for E65 specifically. So far, it seems no language pack has the same exact language I have on my phone. I think my phone doesn't have an original product code.<br />
Comparing both and what I saw on all sources:<br />
Original Arabic code should have: English, Arabic, French, Farsi, Urdu<br />
I have: English, Arabic, French, German, Dutch.<br />
<br />
Just makes me wonder :)

I have a similar Outlook problem after Windows update. I cannot see my contacts or calendar. Ugh, many years of bad experience with MS updates. Next time I will not be an early adopter/updater/lab rat.

<h2>            OneNote Class Notebook Issue</h2>
                    I am a teacher and am using the class notebook add-in. 99% of my students have been able to click the link I provide and have their OneNote sync up and open the class notebook from my class. 1% however are having a common issue. They have OneNote installed,
 they are signed into the correct school account, but when they click the link I provided to access the class notebook it does not link up and sync like every other student's notebook has. My class notebook does not show up in their OneNote. We have tried many
 common troubleshooting steps together. We've closed the app and re-opened it. We've turned off wifi and tried going through data and vice versa. We've powered down the phone, then turned it back on. We've even uninstalled the app and re-installed. Still the
 same issue. What else can I do to get these student's OneNote to link up and sync with my class notebook?

but when they click the link I provided to access the class notebook it does not link up and sync like every other student's notebook has. My class notebook does not show up in their OneNote.<span>&nbsp;</span>“, could you upload some related screenshots? I’d also
 like you to check if they are having the latest version of the OneNote 2016 applications and provide full screenshots of the Account pages in the OneNote 2016 applications they are using. If no, let them update the version first. They can access the Account

Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community Forums. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
1. What do you mean by “couldn't do anything else until the download gets done.”?<br />
2. Is the update installed now?<br />
3. Are you installing Windows technical preview new build 9860?<br />
4. Are you installing Windows updates if yes whet is the KB of the update?</span>

<p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no such module in my Windows directory. It must be a module from a program that you have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also has a suspicious name and file extension. Be careful.</p>

            I just checked my installed applications and saw 2 applications installed, which I find suspicious because I didn't install it. When I try to uninstall them my anti-virus software pops up saying it found a threat.<br />
<br />
*Update* I think my anti virus deleted the app. Cause when I uninstall it, It says it's already removed. Hoping it's already fixed.<br />
<br />
Thank you sir!

<h2>            User Login Issue for OneDrive App</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
One of our users is having a problem logging into his OneDrive via the Android App. His Mail account works fine on his phone, and he can access OneDrive just fine via his browser. His email address is<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>O*******n@D****y.com</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he tries it on the app, it says 'We Couldn't Sign You In. Please Try Again Later. If the issue persists, contact your IT Department."</p>
<p>As an admin, I can log into both my mail and OneDrive just fine via the Android Apps. Is there some kind of permission I need to set for him to be able to use the app?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Paul</p>

<h2>            How to Set Analog Clock as Screensaver for Nokia 2730 &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just bought my 2730 - very nice. &nbsp;At one point, I had a beautiful analog clock as my screensaver. &nbsp;But, I kept playing with the features and for the life of me cannot get the analog clock to return as my screensaver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done the obvious - but clock settings let me choose only between 12 and 24 hour options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            type ahead drop-down list</h2>
                    <p>Using Excel 2007 I've setup a Validation List in several fields in a form I've created.&nbsp; How can I add a type-ahead feature to each one of those lists so I can begin to type one of the items in my list and get to that item (i.e., begin to type P to get to
 Potatoes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked a lot of different forums/answers and if I'm suppose to use the combo box and/or combo list, I can't figure out how to do it properly.&nbsp; The other sites I found used VB, which I'm not sure how to use in Excel and have very minimul experience with
 VB in MS Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, if someone can assist, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Hi, Doug.&nbsp; Well, I wasn't able to start Word in Safe Mode by holding down CTRL.&nbsp; The program just came right up anyway.&nbsp; But your words did inspire me to go find the winword.exe file and right click on it.&nbsp; One of the options was Troubleshoot Compatibility,
 and since the problem just started happening recently on all my machines at once, it must have been a Win10 update.&nbsp; Anyway, I ran the compatibility tester, and it chose WinXP SP3 as the best mode, which sounds about right.&nbsp; Of course, I can't tell if it's
 fixed until it crashes again at some future critical moment.&nbsp; But thanks for the help.</p>

            Hi Ninoslav,<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer your query, you can only reinstall your Outlook 2010 if you still have the product key for Office 2010.<br />
<br />
For further information, you can refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-2010-1B8F3C9B-BDD2-4A4F-8C88-AA756546529D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            iOS 11 Crash After Singing In</h2>
                    Does anyone know of a way to make Skype work in iOS 11? I figured it's an issue with the app itself not being compatible though I need this for work ASAP.

            Same issue here. The app crashes every time it reaches the screen in which you have to devide between dark and light mode, immediately after login. It is just disgraceful.

<p>Hi Prabhavathi </p>
<p>
</p><p>We set up the Automatic Replies &nbsp;(Out of Office) as we should, following all the rules for internal and outside messages,</p>
<p>but the outside automatic reply does not work. The reply message isn't sent, it is as though no auto reply as been set up, yet internal replies are working! It says Outside my Organization is on. If I didn't say this is Office Home and Business 2016.</p>
<p>

<h3> 2b john whitehead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not able to connect network or USB drives.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am having difficulty accessing network and USB drives since upgrading to Windows 10. I am able to go to Network and see the WD My Cloud, click on the folder and see sub-directories. When I click on a public folder, I get error code that the folder
 is not accessible from this device. The same is true for USB drives connected directly to the computer. If I use the WD software, I can access and make changes to the folder from my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling and re-installing network adapters, reset USB and network drives, reset router, etc. If I reload Windows 8.1, everything works again. Load back Windows 10, no access to drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Contacts No Longer Sync Properly After Fall Mobile Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ss377  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts No Longer Sync Properly After Fall Mobile Update</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I just received the Fall update on my 950 XL.&nbsp; Whenever an app is given or takes over access to my contacts I loose them from the people app.&nbsp; They completely disappear and it's as if I have no contacts in my phone at all.&nbsp; But for some reason when I receive
 a phone call the information shows up as normal.&nbsp; But texts and Outlook are unable to sync to my Microsoft account contacts as well.&nbsp; If I reset the phone from scratch everything comes back until Outlook Mail/Calendar sync to the people app/contacts (and anything
 else for that matter) and then everything is lost and People goes blank.&nbsp; I've reset my phone 5 times to test this and it's definitely a problem.&nbsp; A friend of mine also has the same problem so I know it's not just my phone.&nbsp; I know there are only a few of
 us who love these phones enough to keep hanging on but please at least don't kill us through updates.&nbsp; Any suggestions my phone is pretty much dead without being able to use the people app and the Outlook Calendar.&nbsp; Neither of these sync with my Microsoft
 account contacts once updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you Ian&nbsp; This is very helpful to hear.&nbsp; By the way, the link you reference for tracking this issue is NOT WORKING.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I have been able to successfully retain my contacts since my last post by going to the permissions for contacts in settings/privacy
 and completely switching everything off by setting the master switch to NO.&nbsp; Ever since then I have been fine. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for staying on top of this issue.&nbsp; Otherwise, all else is well.&nbsp; Our family loves our phones and will keep them until MS comes out with their next device to replace our 950 XL's.&nbsp; We also use a 1520, an 830 &amp; a 930.&nbsp; The 930 has a minor issue with
 the mic muting in speaker phone mode which is highly annoying but we've learned to live with it because everything else is so good.&nbsp; So, please keep up the good work on these phones.&nbsp; We've tried the rest.&nbsp; Lumia's really are the best!</p>

                    I have just installed Excel 2010.&nbsp; I created a complex spreadsheet under an older version of excel where I was able to select "non blanks" from&nbsp;a filter.&nbsp; In the new version of excel, the option to select "non blanks" has been removed when I click into
 the drop down menu. Why was this option removed and can this option be reinstated?&nbsp; I need it for my spreadsheet to work.
