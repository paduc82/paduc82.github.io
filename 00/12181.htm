<p>bizarre - there is no way to get of the clock either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would say reinstall the FW again and do a hard reset - I see no other option.</p>

            There is no Home Premium 2010.&nbsp; There is Office 365 Home Premium, a very different bird.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it is most likely an Office 2010 trial. Go into File menu &gt; Help command. If there is no help command, is there an Account command?&nbsp; Help indicates 2010, Account indicates 2013.<br />
<br />
Where are you getting the Product Key from?&nbsp; If it is a sticker on the computer, take a much closer look. If there is only one key sticker it is almost certainly for Windows, not Office.<br />
<br />
Expired trials will go into limited function mode, as you have experienced. <br />

            <p>You have apparently paid for Microsoft Home and Business 2010 given it has been activated. Dell installs and activates any version of Office that you pay for, but they also include the other Office&nbsp;programs as trial verisons. Publisher is not included in
 the verson of Office that you paid for. As the trial has ended or expired you cannot run a trial twice. You might be able to install the Publisher 2013 trial...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want Publisher 2010 you will have to pay for it and I am not even sure that option is still&nbsp;available to you. Office 2013 is rolling out including Pub 2013 and I am not sure you can even get Pub 2010 or any of the Office 2010 programs anymore. You
 might be able to do it via the advice and link&nbsp;that Voluneer J gave you. You might find a copy at OfficeMax or your other local store, but I doubt that you can download it anymore. I would suggest you contact Dell customer service for further explanation if
 you doubt what you paid for...or just look at your invoice.</p>

            Clicking on install appears to be the problem. I think what happened was that initiated the install of a second copy of Office. Now you have 2 installations, on activated and one not.&nbsp; This is a common problem which cause the activation system to get confused,
 and for the users to be equally confused because they know they have an activated copy and just don't understand where the unactivated one came from.<br />
<br />
Go back to the Help screen that shows you have 2 installations. One says Home and Business activated. Is there more information about the bundle that is not activated. Could it possibly say something like "... Single Image ...".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After you make careful note of the one that is not activated, go into Programs and Features and try to locate that installation. You will then uninstall it and do a Repair of the remaining copy of Office. Boot the computer and see how things look.<br />

<p>The factory installed trial is typically called something<span>&nbsp;
</span>like “Microsoft Office 2010 Single Image” because it allows the factory to install all 3 trials (Home and Student, Home and Business, and Pro) at the same time. (For this problem you can ignore Office Starter, and an entry that is just "Microsoft Office
 2010") <span>&nbsp;</span>If you are uninstalling the factory trial to clear up conflicts with another installed copy, you MUST do an Office Repair of that other installed copy, boot the computer and you will probably have to also do an activation of the
 installed copy.</p>

                    <p>I am using Windows7 Ultimate - 64-bit, and have a CentOS 7 virtual running in VirtualBox with a 64-bit MySQL 5.6.32 server. I want to be able to connect to this MySQL server via Visio 64-bit to import data for linking to shapes. To this end I've run "%WINDIR%\System32\odbcad32.exe"
 and created a File DSN, which upon clicking "Test" results in a "Connection Successful" message. Indeed I can connect to said database server just fine using the same credentials as in the File DSN with MySQL workbench, telnet, other Linux machines, etc. However,
 every time I attempt to connect to the MySQL server from within Visio I get "Connection failed: SQLState: '08001' SQL Server Error: 11 [DBNETLIB][ConnectionOpen (PreLoginHandshake()).]General Network error. Check your network documentation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both MySQL ODBC 5.3 ANSI and Unicode Driver's installed at version 5.03.04.00.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Al, I hadn't thought of trying it in Access. I just opened a new desktop DB in Access 2013 and was able to import external data from the MySQL server using the ODBC File DSN that I created for use in Visio. It worked perfectly on the first try.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>I managed to get it working in Visio, after attempting to enable tracing as defined in the URL that you provided. Enabling tracing from both the interface afforded by&nbsp; "%WINDIR%\System32\odbcad32.exe" and via editing the registry was to no avail, i.e. in
 spite of tracing being enabled a log wouldn't generate.</p>

</p><p>This led me to explore the directory in which the ODBC 5.3 drivers were installed on my windows machine, in my case "C:\Program Files \MySQL\Connector ODBC 5.3". The "README.txt file" in this directory documents usage of the "myodbc-installer.exe" CLI tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running said tool, with elevated privileges, without any parameters afforded exactly the details necessary to remedy my issue. In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>myodbc-installer.exe -d -l
<ul>
<li>MySQL ODBC 5.3 ANSI Driver</li><li>MySQL ODBC 5.3 Unicode Driver</li></ul>
</li><li>myodbc-installer.exe -s -l
<ul>
<li><em>no output</em></li></ul>
</li><li>myodbc-installer.exe -s -a -c2 -n "<em><strong>{name of DSN to create</strong></em><em><strong>}</strong></em>" -t "DRIVER=MySQL ODBC 5.3 ANSI Driver;SERVER=<em><strong>{IP of server</strong></em><em><strong>}</strong></em>;DATABASE=<em><strong>{DB name}</strong></em>;UID=<em><strong>{DB
 User}</strong></em>;PWD=<em><strong>{DB Pass}</strong></em></li><li>myodbc-installer.exe -s -l
<ul>
<li>Name of created DSN</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>I then selected this newly created DSN from within Visio and viola, it worked! I'm not sure why the other ODBC DSN defined via "%WINDIR%\System32\odbcad32.exe" worked just fine in other programs and not Visio, but doing the above steps did the trick. Thank
 you for helping me to get in the right direction Al.</p>

            <p>One other important factor is the <strong>architecture of your app</strong>. &nbsp;We had a 64 bit Win 7 system that we installed the MySQL 64 bit ODBC drivers, first for current ODBC 5.3 and then an older ODBC 5.1 version during troubleshooting. &nbsp;No matter what
 we tried from above, the list of available connections in Vision 2010 was always blank, and there were no MySQL ODBC drivers available in Visio (when you "Setup" the Generic ODBC item).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We Googled for a lot of different things, but finally found another MSAnswers question where a MS Expert asked a user having a Visio ODBC problem if their MSOffice was 32 bit or 64 bit. &nbsp;We checked her Visio 2K10 and it was 32 bit, so we downloaded the 32
 bit version of MySQL ODBC 5.3 and installed it right over the top of the old one. &nbsp;She deleted the User DSN and System DSN, she recreated the User DSN, and she restarted Visio. &nbsp;When starting the Reverse Engineer wizard, now the MySQL ODBC drivers were available
 in the Setup screen, and the defined User DSN was visible. &nbsp;There was a warning message complaining about something, but we knew from other articles found online that this was an expected warning (not a fatal error). &nbsp;Then ODBC worked as expected and the Reverse
 Engineer function produced the desired ER Diagrams.</p>

    <title>Hyperlink in PPT opens, removes, and is editable - but it will not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parrotslave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlink in PPT opens, removes, and is editable - but it will not copy</h2>
                    <p>This is on&nbsp;PowerPoint 14.0.7229.50000 (64-bit) in Windows 8.1 (64-bit). Hyperlinks work perfectly in Word. Hyperlinks in PowerPoint will not "copy." "Edit Hyperlink" will open up with the actual hyperlink in the edit field, from which it can then be copied,
 then manually pasted into a browser. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Copying the slide with the hyperlink into a new, blank presentation yields the same problem. Yet copying either the complete slide or the text containing the hyperlink into Word yields a hyperlink that can be copied via the right-click "Copy Hyperlink" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought at first that this peculiarity might be due to the fact that virtually all my ppt files are downloaded from elsewhere, i.e., they have to be opened in protected view. Clicking "Enable" does not change their behavior. However, creating a brand new
 ppt presentation, then inserting a link, gives the same behavior. The source of the ppt file is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, though, most of the original ppt files on which I noticed the problem were downloaded from SlidePlayer.com. I discovered the problem when I realized that, long ago, I had failed to annotate those files with the originating URL. I decided to clean up
 my files and folders a bit by going through them and annotating them manually by adding an extra slide to each, but I had to use info in the presentations themselves to do an internet search to try and figure out where I had gotten them--but the "Copy Hyperlink"
 for what was already in those presentations didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a similar problem to the behavior discussed in&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/hyperlink-to-sharepoint-document-in-a-word-doc-not/0f1b3cc6-b0ee-46dd-be7a-ea4265cfcc33, but there is no answer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is a Windows problem or a PowerPoint problem. I have observed, over the last couple of years, that, in any situation, it's more difficult to do a plain old right click and copy. Sometimes I have to do it several times. I've gotten different
 mouses to see if that's the issue, but it might be that the "hot spot" is smaller these days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of the mouse, though--and this is unrelated--is there a way to STOP the mouse from dragging and dropping? I first noticed, with Vista, as I recall, that files and folders would sometimes "disappear." My instantaneous reaction was panic--it had to
 be a virus, right?--until I realized that I was unintentionally dragging them into some other folder. Is there not mouse software somewhere for those of us who merely want a mouse to be a mouse, and not do anything fancy?</p>

<p>I just repaired it not long ago, something I do every now and then on "general principles," and even tried to see if OffCAT would do anything. I also regularly run SFC, and even DISM, just for the heck of it, out of long experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the mouse, I have more than half a dozen right now, some usb, some bluetooth. I thought that the simplest, most basic Microsoft usb mouse might get rid of the "fancy" behavior, but, no deal. I've used a couple of other brnad, but the one I keep
 going back to is a simple Logitech bluetooth one. Alas, to make sure that the mouse doesn't get too "old," my parrot regularly chews up the scroll wheels, so I have to keep buying new ones.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the "fanciness," I got rid of the Logitech software, and just stuck to what's in Windows. I did finally decide that maybe, instead of getting the most basic mouse possible, I ought to see if a super-fancy one might actually be better,
 so I bought a gaming mouse (even though I'm not a gamer, other than FreeCell), despite it costing an arm and a leg, but it had the identical problem. It could not possibly be the mouse being "flaky."</p>

<p>The Office 2010 repair is not as effective as the online repair in&nbsp;Office 2013 and later, which effectively reinstalls the software. If it really bugs you and you have your original install media and product key, you could uninstall and reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using 4 different mice on 8 different computers, and I never seen any problem with dragging files when I didn't intend to. Do you have the same problem on other machines? If not, it must be an operating system problem.</p>

<p>Thanks. The drag-and-drop (or copy, or move) when I don't want it is not unique either to this computer or this OS. I had WinMe before Vista and 8.1, but I don't recall it occurring in WinMe. It is infrequent, though.
</p>
<p>I just found a fix for it:&nbsp;https://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-drag-and-drop-in-windows:</p>
<p>"<span>The reason...to disable drag and drop in Windows 10/8/7&nbsp;is that, either they or somebody else, inadvertently dragged and dropped
 the files from one folder to another. If you realize or know that this&nbsp;has happened, you may be able to reverse it. But it may happen that you or someone else may do&nbsp;it accidentally, without being even aware of it. In such a case, you might end up spending
 time searching, where the files may have ‘disappeared’!...</span><em>If it is the accidental drag-and-drops that you want to avoid,
 then you will have to change the drag sensitivity or threshold. This means that you will have to move the file or folder, to a longer distance, to execute this operation."</em></p>

            No, it's not checked. I do have "enhance pointer precision" checked, in the hope that that might make it necessary to be more exact when doing anything.&nbsp;I am addicted to the way my mouse was two decades ago, before all the fanciness appeared,&nbsp;

<h2>            Cannot open smime.p7m files in Outlook on Android phone.</h2>
                    <p>When my client, federal government, sends me pdf attachments the files always appears as a smime.p7m file and will not open on my phone in Outlook. The same attachments appear as a standard pdf on my desktop and open as expected. My understanding is the
 secured signature within the pdf is causing the issue on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting, or some voodoo/black magic, that will allow me to view the pdf files on my phone within Outlook?</p>

<h2>            Font issues&#58; wrong font shown in ribbon font case &#43; font change after selecting all text within a table cell</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently noticed some issues that I don't recall seeing before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Whenever I try to write over some text within a table cell (whose contents were copied after an OCR process as such), although my font was set to Arial, size 10, after I select the text within and start typing again, the font changes automatically to
 Times New Roman, size: 9.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I performed a Clear Formatting within the table and now when I type, the font is shown as Times New Roman although the actual font I see is Arial. Only when I press Tab to get to the next row, the Font information in the ribbon gets "updated". But when
 I actually type, I get the wrong font naming (mismatch between the seen font and displayed font in the ribbon case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you encountered this before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>For an app seen as the best in terms of text editing features, it is rather odd to perform this operation after only 2 months of utilization. I suspect this behaviour to be restricted to that particular document, given the fact that some parts of it were
 copied along with the existing formatting of another application. I just wish I better understood some behaviours in such cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your feedback. If required, I will proceed to the repair (although it is painful to re-configure it).</p>

<p>For font formatting to be reliable in Word table cells, make sure that the font formatting of the Normal style matches the font formatting defined in the document defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see which font formatting has been defined for the Normal style, you can do the following to display the Modify Style dialog box: Press Ctrl+Shift+S; in the Apply Styles pane, type in
<strong>Normal</strong> and then click the Modify button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, to access the document defaults, click the Manage Styles icon in the Styles pane (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S) and then go to the Set Defaults tab.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you asking if you can install Tamil font on your Nokia C5? Note t<span>hat the language pack made available on a Nokia phone is market and country dependent. The Tamil language is only available on Nokia phones&nbsp;intended for countries
 where the language is mainly used.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;may check on your device if the option is available by following the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Messaging. </li><li>Select Create message. </li><li>S<span>elect Options.</span> </li><li><span>Select Input.</span> </li><li><span>Select Options.</span> </li><li><span>Select Writing language.</span> </li></ol>
<p>If the option is unavailable, you may go to any Nokia Care Point to have the software installed.&nbsp;Please make sure to bring the proof of purchase to verify the warrant of the device. However, if your device originally came from a country that does not support
 Tamil, it will not be possible to install it as it is part of the phone's software. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you're not referring to the Tamil font of your device, please provide us more information as to why you need help with your Nokia C5.</span></p>

    <title>A message problem when Playing free MSN free online games using IE 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louelany  say:</h3>
<h2>            A message problem when Playing free MSN free online games using IE 10</h2>
                    <p>Since discovering free online games with MSN I have noticed a recurring problem, which causes&nbsp;any game I have tried to abort spontaneously, especially when I am doing well and going through a stage of high scores!&nbsp; The following message appears, and wonder
 if anyone else has encountered the same problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure you want to leave this page?</p>
<p>Message from webpage:</p>
<p>EXIT WITHOUT SAVING YOUR SCORE:</p>
<p>Click 'OK' to end this game without saving your score.</p>
<p>Click 'Cancel' to view and save your score.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, either clicking 'OK' or 'Cancel' both cause the game to end prematurely and forces me to have to start again, which is very unsatisfying and frustrating.&nbsp; I have tried clicking elsewhere on the page to stop this message from appearing, but
 nothing I have tried works so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been coming on quite early in the game, such as in Text Twist.&nbsp; Tried to see if this problem has been reported before, but what I have seen is not quite in the same context.&nbsp; Certainly, none of the suggested solutions have worked so far.&nbsp; I've thought
 it may be a ruse from preventing long play on the free games, but there should have been some warning to suggest this if the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may not be very important in itself, but worry if it starts to crop up during other circumstances.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi to All in my situation,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the passage of time since my last reply, I have answered my own question!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to stop the Adobe Flash Player 3rd Party component message that appeared, was to undertake a complete Computer Refresh as the last of last resorts.&nbsp; It also put right the problem&nbsp;I had when trying to play&nbsp;video clips.&nbsp; This action clears more,
 if a more 'simple' Reset does not work, as with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is accessible from the Start Page.&nbsp; Access the Charms bar, choose Settings gear symbol and then select 'PC settings', then 'General'.&nbsp; However, a word of warning in that if this is undertaken, to realise this is a drastic measure.&nbsp; It will remove a layer
 of recent programmes, printer drivers and updates (including those for&nbsp;the Apps)&nbsp;in the process, though it will tell you what has been deleted in a file placed on the Desktop.&nbsp; The other odd thing that happened with me when I tried it, was that it also deleted
 the facility to undertake a Computer Refresh again, because in the process, the update was removed that permitted this facility to happen!!!&nbsp; However, the capability was restored in the Windows 'updates' that soon&nbsp;followed afterwards&nbsp;&amp; were returned&nbsp;- 33 in
 one session following!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because it is an extreme measure, it is not one I care to repeat in a hurry, and now I feel my original problem - the message that kept intruding on trying to play the free online MSN games and which stopped further play - I now more think is more to do
 with them being 'free'.&nbsp; Since the total Computer Refresh, I no longer bother with the 'free' MSN games, and this is not the loss to me since encountering all these problems, as it once was!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I export to PDF sometimes from Onenote 2007 SP2 the table columns are extremely narrow. Is there anyway to fix this formatting issue?</p>

<p>This is a bug in OneNote 2007 that has been fixed in 2010.&nbsp; The issue is caused by multiple auto-sized table columns that get confused when they all try to fit on a PDF page.&nbsp; If you encounter this bug, first try restarting OneNote to force it to recalculate
 table layout.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, the recommended work-around is to manually resize the table columns to force them to use a fixed size.</p>
<p>Full Page View isn't the real culprit.&nbsp; Auto-sized columns depend on the page size, which may depend on the window size.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Full Page&nbsp;View&nbsp;increases the page size it could affect column sizes, but not always.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please don't clear your cache over this!</strong>&nbsp; This is a brute-force method intended to resolve file corruptions - it's not meant to address&nbsp;PDF layout bugs!</p>

    <title>Office365 Pop and IMAP turnoff for all but one group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office365 Pop and IMAP turnoff for all but one group</h2>
                    <p>Hi, we have a relatively new installation of Office365, which was set up in a very "vanilla" kind of way, without a lot of restrictions and security in place.&nbsp; We have recently realized that all employees can connect remotely to Office365 using POP or IMAP,
 it is turned on for all.&nbsp; We are an ecommerce environment and would like to turn that off for most of the users to product PII data.&nbsp; I've researched on how to turn it off across the board using the steps below and that is a great solution.&nbsp; However, we have
 many users who use the native mail applications on their phones to receive email and they are part of a group in AD called "Outlook Exempt".&nbsp; If I turn off POP and particularly IMAP, I believe those users will not be able to use that app and will be forced
 to use the Outlook iPhone and Android app, which they do not want to do (and some are Executives, so I can't say no..) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some additional language I can add to the PowerShell script for the users in the "Outlook Exempt" group so I will not disable POP or IMAP?&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>1. Connect to Exchange Online:<br />
$Credential = Get-Credential<br />
$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri "https://ps.outlook.com/powershell" -Credential $Credential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection<br />
$ImportResults = Import-PSSession $Session</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>2. Read all user mailboxes and disable POP and IMAP:<br />
$Mailboxes = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited<br />
ForEach ($Mailbox in $Mailboxes) {$Mailbox | Set-CASMailbox -PopEnabled $False -ImapEnabled $False }</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>3. close your session to Exchange Online:<br />
Remove-PSSession $Session</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp; Diane Huff&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Diane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. Based on my personal experience, there isn’t any PowerShell command can meet your needs. As a workaround, you can disable the POP and IMAP settings for all users and then re-enable it for the specific users in your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we have a dedicated forum handling customize PowerShell commands questions. You can seek help from them via this link:

    <title>MMS APN settings missing on Mobile 10136 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaegermeiste  say:</h3>
<h2>            MMS APN settings missing on Mobile 10136</h2>
                    <p>Maybe related to a similar problem on AT&amp;T for an older build:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_call/multimedia-messaging-service-mms-andor-cell-data/49add8a6-45d5-4070-8a32-db0fd3af5a30</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related thread on Windows Central: http://forums.windowscentral.com/windows-10-mobile/361768-cannot-download-attachments-mms-new-10136-build.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Phone: Lumia Icon (929)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario: After rolling back to WP 8.1 GDR 1 from 10IP 10080, I updated to 10IP 10136. Aside from the notification problems that plague 10136, I began to notice that I couldn't send or receive MMS. After a former life of rooting Android devices, I suspected
 the APN settings were missing and I was correct. TO be clear, NO MMS APN was listed, not default, not Verizon, not anything. Using the Verizon MMS APN widely available online, I created a vzwinternet APN for MMS. After extensive testing, including sending
 MMS to myself, sending to others, and recieving from others, nothing would work. I then theorized that the MMS APN may piggyback on the internet APN. I created a new Internet APN using Verizon settings, which kicked me down to 3G from LTE but allowed me to
 download MMS (but not send). I reverted to the default Internet APN to restore my LTE data. I then tried factory reset to no avail. Eventually I downgraded back to 8.1 GDR1. One cannot simply copy the write down the APN settings from 8.1 and enter them in
 10, because 8.1 weirdly does not let you view the contents of the default APN settings, it simply lets you override them with one you build from scratch. (To be fair, 10IP doesn't let you view the contents of the default Internet APN either for some reason).
 Reupgrading from 8.1 GDR1 to 10IP 10136 doesn't restore the settings either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that the following settings don't work:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(88, 88, 88, 1)">

</p>
<p>Nor any combination of the above. This is an issue that seems localized to Icon users on VZW, but if you lost the MMS APN on 10136, or your MMS isn't working at all on 10136 and you don't know what an APN is, post here!</p>

            I too had this issue with Telstra on my 925 Build 10166. It turns out I was a real Wally (sheepish grin). I only had my Wifi activated for data not Mobile Data. Perhaps a message could pop up to indicate Mobile data is off if a user attempts to download
 an MMS message and Mobile data is not working?

            I see this was posted in 2015, but the issue seems to persist today. I upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile shortly after it became generally available for the Verizon Lumia Icon on June 23rd, 2016. Since that upgrade everything works great except MMS. I see
 the Internet APN but no MMS APN. I took my phone to the Microsoft store and they made the same comment, that it was missing. I called Verizon tech support and they had no clue. When will the MMS APN be added?

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add students to class&#47;Student notebook disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I have a class notebook set up through our team. I previously had all my students in my class and all had access to their own notebooks that I could see through class notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, one of the student's notebooks disappeared. She still has access to our team, our notebook, and our collaborative space...but does not have her own notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is weird to start with!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to add a student, and it repeatedly takes me to a page that says I have no notebooks. I've tried adding student through the desktop and online versions of OneNote and also through Teams. I've contacted my IT department and everything seems to
 be working on out end. We updated to the most current version of OneNote and addressed some syncing errors to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I'd love to be able to get this student back online without having to create a brand new notebook!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Carmen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook/notebook-fix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the Fix notebooks page on OneNote.com</a>. Select
<strong>Fix Permissions</strong> beside the notebook people are having trouble with. When you see
<strong>Permissions Fixed</strong>, then check the result.</p>
<p>In the meantime, does the issue only happen to this specific notebook in your organization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I had done the permission fix before I posted. It didn't change anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two class notebooks and I can't add students to either of them. Both were created through the TEAMS app. When I click on Manage notebooks, one of my notebooks appears (the one with the student missing) but not the other one. When I click on add/remove
 students or add/remove teachers it says I have no notebooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to add the student to the team, it says she is already a member. Yet, when in class notebook and I connect to Teams and map my students, she is not listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very perplexed!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Carmen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, if you mean that for the class notebook created in Teams App, when you tried to add a student to the notebook, the student
 don’t show up?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you mentioned you tried to map your students, and the student is not listed, please check if you can see the student in the Teams.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Besides, may I know if the issue just happens to one specific user? If it happens to all students in your organization when you add or remove, please
 try to check Connections between OneNote Class Notebook and Microsoft Teams. </span>

<p>Hi Iry,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She is a member of our team. She has read only access to our notebook and does not have her own student notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have much of an organization. I'm the only one in my school using either program and one of two or three in the division using teams. Our IT team is not familiar with the ins and outs of the programs and are unable to help me out. So far, I've only
 had that one student disappear. But we've only been on it for a little more than a month....so there's only been a small window for catastrophe!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried mapping the notebook I created in class notebook (see update above) and it would let me map that notebook to my teams class in the online app (in theory) but the changes did not work when it synced. I tried again on the desktop version and the class
 notebook wouldn't even come up as an option on the mapping menu. It would only let me map the notebook that was created as part of creating that team. It is very frustrating!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Carmen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For “The notebooks created through the TEAM app do not show up” you mentioned, if you mean the notebook didn’t show up or the student didn’t show up in the notebook in the Teams?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your last reply, it seems that you tried to sync the notebook from OneNote Class Notebook to Teams but it failed, right? If I have any misunderstanding, please feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know when you click the Add/Remove Student, if you can see the notebook and the student you mentioned as below capture?</p>

<p>This is sort of a moot point now because I ended up deleting our original team group and starting a new one so that she could contribute in class again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'd still like to work toward a solution because if it happened once, it is bound to happen again. In that case, I would really love to not spend hours copy and pasting all their work (and mine) into new notebooks because I have to create a new
 one again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I click on add/remove student, I get a screen that says I don't have any notebooks. I can't add or remove any students from any notebook. I can't even get to the screen you attached an image of because I have no notebooks to click on in step one to
 get to step 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I click <em>manage </em>notebooks, it lists the notebook. From that screen. I can edit permissions for the collaborative space and add sections, etc. etc. for the notebook.</p>
<p>I've attached pics for your reference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Carmen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your last screenshot you provide to us (Manage notebooks), it shows that you have not created a notebook. Since the notebook named 4 Homeroom Notebook is a default notebook named by your channel. It’s a Co-owned notebook. The notebook you created will
 show under <strong>Your notebooks</strong>. So, you cannot see the notebook when you add or remove students (The second screenshot you provided).</p>

<p>
</p><p>So, please try to create a class notebook (beside Add/Remove Students) and add the student to the notebook to check the outcome. Besides, for the&nbsp;4 Homeroom Notebook, based on your first post, if you mean the student disappeared there?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem then is that I can't map it to my team space.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Click-to-Run error when installing Publisher 2010 download</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've purchased and downloaded Microsoft Publisher 2010 (64 bit), but am having problems installing it. An error message appears saying:</p>
<p><em>This 64 bit product may not be installed&nbsp;with Microsoft Office Click-to-Run.&nbsp;Remove Microsoft Office Click-to-Run and try again.</em></p>
<p>When I went into 'add or remove programs' to uninstall Click-to-Run, it said that uninstalling would also remove Microsoft Office 2010 from my computer.</p>
<p>Not sure what to do next.</p>
<p>Please help,</p>
<p>Thanks. Laura</p>

You have a few of options:<br />
<ul>
<li>a DIY macro to do both "save as" saves</li><li>a 3rd party utility/macro to do the 2 saves</li><li>use the skydrive function that backups specified folders</li></ul>
<p>There is another option that creates backups, but not necessarily to Skydrive (it may be an option, but I have not investigated it myself). That is using the new Windows 8 File History feature.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<b>True Autosave Macros for Office</b>
<p><span>This file you are working on is HIGH VALUE (to you). You MUST take extra steps to protect the time and creativity you have invested in this file. You MUST make frequent backups.
</span></p>
<p><span>A good general rule for backups is:</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Remember 3-2-1 to have good backups --
</span></i></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><i><span>at least 3 copies of any file, </span></i></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><i><span>on at least 2 different storage mediums (say on a hard drive, thumb drive, DVD or the cloud),
</span></i></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><i><span>at least 1 copy offsite -- in case of fire!&nbsp; (say thumb drive or DVD moved to different location, or the cloud)</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Gibson </span></i></b></p>
<p><span>PS: yes “correct” the plural of medium is media, but I don’t speak latin! &lt;grin&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>You can do your backups manually or make use of automated tools.&nbsp; A strategy I have used is timed backups during the editing session (5 minute). Then the final end of day save is copied to second medium. I rotate the "second"
 medium with an Offsite copy.&nbsp; Once a week I go in and clean up the 5 minute incremetal backups to keep just the end of day copy (to free up space!)</span></p>
<p><span>I have used the "autohistory" tool at codeplex. It is easy to use, but like any automated process it uses up a lot of space.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, although Office apps have been around since the the mid 1980’s, MS has not figured out that we need a good “Autosave” backup feature. In the past there was a “versions” feature in some office apps, but it only kept incremental
 copies of files, not ful files. Win7 has a file “versions” feature, but it is tied into “System Recovery Points”. Not very useful.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following links tell how to setup macros that run automatically and use SAVEAS to save full copies of the file with the date/time included in the file name. You have to manually delete the “extra” backup files, but you control the process rather
 than Windows or Office. It is a bit more work, but I find it worth it for very important files that are changing frequently.</p>

<p>Graham has created an addin that does something MS should have done 20+ years ago.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, Word has no integral means of automatically saving the current document, nor of backing-up the current document. What it does have is an option to save
<b>AutoRecover</b> information after a specific and configurable interval and an option to save a backup copy of the
<b>previously saved</b> version of the document with the default file extension of
<b>WBK</b> (and although there is no reason to do so, Word also allows the option to change this extension to the user's choice). This is not a true backup in as much as it is not a copy of the
<b>current version</b> of the document.</p>
<p>A function to create a true automatic backup is provided by the
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/SaveInTwoPlacesAddIn.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b><span>Save In Two Places add-in which is detailed in a separate page</span></b></a>, There is also available from this web site a complementary add-in which provides numbered versions of a document.

<b>Summary: </b>Need to force users to save their work? It may be as simple as implementing an AutoNew() to force every new file to have a filename, and an AutoClose() to save the current document BEFORE closing. It could, however, also have something to do
 with training users.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 replies to meeting request using the wrong e-mail address</h2>
                    <p>I have many e-mail accounts set up in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>I use my outlook.com/office365 as the default - meaning it is the default data file so it's calendar is the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want only 1 calendar so that all works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is when another of my e-mail addresses is invited to a meeting.</p>
<p>When I open that meeting request and 'Accept' the meeting by default that acceptance is going FROM my outlook.com account instead of from the email account that was in fact invited to the meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lived with this behavior for YEARS but now one of my customers (who invites me to meetings) has their side set up so that when this happens it appears that I never respond at all to the meeting request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is a workaround - instead of accepting the meeting I can edit the response before sending and change the from on that response to be correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why is Outlook 2016 not sending the response FROM the e-mail address that was invited to the meeting to begin with?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a setting I have set incorrectly that is making Outlook 2016 behave in this incorrect manner?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

</p><p>I think you might have misread my original mail - I am not inviting anyone to anything. This is a problem with me accepting invitations to meetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the answers to your questions....</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter this issue?</li></ul>
<p>As far as I know Outlook for MANY MANY YEARS/VERSIONS has always accepted ALL meeting invitations with my outlook.com/office 365 e-mail because that is the default data file/calendar I have set up in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only become a problem for me recently because my current customer's exchange server is configured such that
<strong>if the response does not come from the address invited to the meeting then the response will be ignored</strong> and it appears to the person inviting me that I have not responded to the meeting when in fact I have accepted it and it is in my calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How are you trying to send a meeting invite to another email address?</li></ul>
<p><strong>I am not sending the meeting invite. I am accepting an invitation to a meeting.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To use sample e-mail addresses... </p>
<ol>
<li>My Outlook default data file account is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</li><li>A customer invites *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to a meeting.</li><li>In Outlook I Accept the meeting.</li><li>Meeting response is going to customer's exchange server from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</li><li>Because the response is not from the address invited to the meeting the customer's Exchange Server ignores the response.</li><li>Customer checks the meeting in their Exchange calendar and sees 'No Response' beside my name on the meeting.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Does this issue happens on all of the other email address you are trying to invite?</li></ul>
<span>outlook.com/office 365 e-mail because that is the default data file/calendar have set up in Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Lumia 640 dual sim and other models windowsphones</h2>
                    Hi...<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows Phone for me are better than Android and iPhone, now I need dual sim that does not carry two smartphones, I bought Microsoft Lumia 640 dual sim but is impossible to set different ringtones for each sim, why???<br />
<br />
Will you finally solve this deficiency?<br />
<br />
It should not be a big problem for your developers for Win 8.1 and Win 10, a small update, and how many years it lasts longer.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance and with reverence<br />

    <title>How do I Max Out CPU Usage when Running a Query&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich brownstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I Max Out CPU Usage when Running a Query&#63;</h2>
                    I have a large database and run big queries. &nbsp;I also have a quad CPU (i7 950). &nbsp;But I can't Access to use more than 13% or one eighth. &nbsp;
<div><br />
I looked in Task Manager to see in Set Affinity if all CPUs are checked and the are. &nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I assume that the queries would render faster if it used more CPU than that. &nbsp;Any suggestions?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>That is by design.</p>
<p>You cannot control how Access chooses to run your query, but indeed it often, if not always, runs the query on a single cpu.</p>
<p>If you want more performance, you will need to upgrade to a server-based RDBMS such as SQL Server, which can, if the conditions are right, run your query across all CPUs.</p>

    <title>Error - Microsoft Outlook 2010 configuration did not complete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathon jones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error - Microsoft Outlook 2010 configuration did not complete successfully.</h2>
                    <p>I noticed, in File &gt; Help in Outlook 2010 that it states "Product Activation Required. Microsoft Outlook 2010. This product contains Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp;
<u>Change product key</u> This product is unlicensed.&nbsp; Connect to your corporate network or contact your system administrator for further assistance."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on "Change product key" and enter the product key supplied by my host (Fasthosts - yes, I know!), who provide the Exchange Mailbox that we're attempting to configure, it seems to recognise. or at least acknowledge,&nbsp;the key we enter yet when
 we then click on "Continue" and subsequently "Install Now" (even though Outlook 2010 is clearly already installed!) we are presented with the following error:</p>
<p>"Microsoft Outlook 2010 configuration did not complete successfully."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered this before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can't get the product activated despite having a valid product key.&nbsp; We've contacted Fasthosts and they assure us that the key is valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would appreciate any advice offered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
