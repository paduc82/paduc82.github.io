            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />May I ask why you dont' want iTunes which is the universally recognized way to do this?  
<br />
<br />Otherwise there are these other popular methods:

<h2>            Error 1935 when trying to install Crysis2 on Win 7 64Bit</h2>
                    When I try to install the subject game I get error 1935. I am running Win7 Home Prem 64 SP1. The error in question refers to Visual C redistributable x86 32Bit.<br />
Does this mean that I cannot install the Game or is there a work around.<br />

            Hi Douglas,<br />
<br />
Follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> <br />
<br />
I would suggest you to check whether the Windows Installer Service is running in Services.msc window.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Click On start; In the Start search, type Services.msc and Hit Enter.<br />
b. Right click on Windows Installer and click on Start (Only if the Service has stopped).<br />
<br />
<span><br />
If the file has .msi extension, you may also extract the file and then try installing the software from the setup.exe file and check.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></span>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86). This should help with the error for Microsoft.VC80.CRT

            <p>Hi marihakim,<br />
<br />
We need to verify if you are referring to the photo albums in your Windows Live Photo Gallery. If so, first we need to check if the folder for your photos are still saved in your computer. Browse Windows Explorer to where it is originally located and verify
 if it is still there. If so,&nbsp;please follow the steps below on how to include the folder again:<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;1. Click the
<strong><span>blue/file</span></strong> menu tab in your Windows Live Photo Gallery.<br />
&nbsp;2. Select <strong><span>Include Folder</span></strong>.<br />
&nbsp;3. Click <strong><span>Add</span></strong>.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select the folder where the photos/videos are located.<br />
&nbsp;5. Then click <strong><span>Include Folder</span></strong> click
<strong><span>Ok</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you did not find it in the original location, I suggest that you check the Recycle bin if the folder was deleted. Let us know if you were able to find it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Gerard G.</span></p>

            Hi Gerard,<br />
<br />
Yes, I used to save them on Windows Live. But the PC with which I saved them, I do not have it anymore, too old, hardware crashed down.<br />
I still used see them in my photo gallery after I changed the PC. It is weird because some of them I can still see and the ones that I care the most, are not there anymore. Why?<br />
Please, is there a way to retrieve them?<br />
thank a lot in advance.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since you have a copy of the images that were missing on your SkyDrive account, what you could do is to download them directly from your SkyDrive account and copy them to your computer. To do this, please follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Go and sign in to your SkyDrive account.<br />
2. Select the folder of the missing images from your computer<br />
3. Once you have selected the folder, on the right-side of your SkyDrive account select
<strong>Download with Photo Gallery</strong><br />
4. You would be asked what images you want to download, then click <strong>Download</strong><br />
5. Now you would be directed to Windows Live Photo Gallery and the images would be included on the list view section.<br />
<br />
Thanks!
        </p>

            Hi Joseph,<br />
I don't think you read the thread of emails before you replied to me.<br />
The problem is that on my SkyDrive I cannot find some of the albums I uploaded a couple of years ago. I can still see some which I uploaded together with the ones I cannot see anymore.<br />
All the pictures where uploaded from my previous PC which I do not have anymore because the HD crashed down.<br />
So my question is: have I lost those albums or there is a way for you to retrieve them?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            Hi Mari,<br />
<br />
Since your previous computer crashed down and you are not able to use it anymore. It is possible that the missing photos are not recoverable. If you still have that computer "which crashed down", what you can do is contact the computer manufacturer and asked
 them to check if the missing photos can still be recovered in your hard drive.<br />
<br />
To prevent losing important photos or files, I suggest that you save copies of them in storage devices or websites such as "Flash or External hard drive, SkyDrive, and others".<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Gerard G.

<br />
that's exactly what I have done: I saved them on SkyDrive like many other albums&nbsp; that I'm still able to see while those particular albums have disappeared.<br />
Is it due to the storage space limit of SkyDrive maybe?<br />

            Hi Mari,<br />
<br />
If you are certain that you uploaded all the albums and photos in SkyDrive "that are now&nbsp;missing"&nbsp;before your old computer crashed. It is possible that this is a SkyDrive issue. What we can do is to check all the folders in SkyDrive if they are available. It
 is possible that you uploaded them in a "folder in another folder or so on". You can reach the SkyDrive support by creating a thread in this link:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/skydrive-files">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/skydrive-files</a>. It would also help if you can provide them the exact procedure you performed when uploading them in your SkyDrive. Also include the storage capacity and usage you have in your SkyDrive
 account.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi Famousman,
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button
<br />Select any device in the list
<br />At the top, click 'Action' - Scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />Windows should find the appropriate driver and load it
<br />
<br />If Windows does not find the driver, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your System?
<br />
<br />Right click your Internet Adapter, choose Properties
<br />On the resulting dialog, click the Details Tab
<br />Change the Property Drop Down to Hardware ID
<br />Copy the top line in the list and paste that into your next post
<br />I will then find the correct driver for you . . .

                    <p>I am using an external drive as a backup. &nbsp;I was removing some files when a whole directory structure disappeared from windows explorer. &nbsp;Using the command prompt I can't see the top directory that disappeared but I can change directory to the "lost" directory
 and see all the files and sub directories below it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to continue backing up I created a new directory in explorer and using a batch file and xcopy started backing up files. &nbsp;Again the new directory disappeared but using command, I can't see the new directory in the root drive, but I can change to
 the &nbsp;directory and see all the files and sub directories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened to me before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the hell happened, how do I restore the view of these directories and how do I stop it happening in the future</p>

<p>xcopy does not change file or folder attributes but robocopy does (at times).</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Pro activation after Physical to Virtual migration &#40;P2V&#41;&#58; error 0x803fa071</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a laptop (physical machine) where was installed Win 8.1 RTM Professional. Then, in June, I successfully upgraded it to Win 10 Pro and activated it for free, so that&nbsp; (thanks to ShowKeyPlus software) I am able to retrieve the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Product Name: Win 10 Pro</p>
<p>Product ID: xxxx</p>
<p>Installed Key: xxxx&nbsp; </p>
<p>Original Key: xxxx</p>
<p>Original Edition: Win 8.1 RTM Professional OEM:DM</p>
<p>OEM Key: xxxxx</p>
<p>OEM Edition: Win 8.1 RTM Professional OEM:DM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I wanted to move the windows 10 installation from the physical to a virtual machine, I successfully managed the P2V migration. In fact, now I can perfectly boot Win 10 Pro in a VM. The only problem is that now its original "activated" status is actually
 lost, so is NOT activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to reactivate it with the Original Key value results in Error 0x803fa071. So, I called the support to the number given by the "slui 4" output, which told me that this type of activation was not doable via phone. Moreover, they suggested me to write
 my problem in this forum and here I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, how could I re-active my Win 10 Pro after a P2V migration? Should I transfer the license or what else?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your customer orientation and clarifications.</p>
<p>

 it, it will bounce.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Sync&#58; What is included in &#34;Other Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjniez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Sync&#58; What is included in &#34;Other Windows setting&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my desktop computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and my Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10. &nbsp;So, I am new to the concept of syncing of Windows settings since this is the first time I have had two Windows PCs running the same version of Windows
 and having the ability to sync Windows settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that, does anyone know what is being controlled by the "Other Windows settings" on/off switch in the Windows 10 Sync settings? &nbsp;I generally wouldn't mind syncing settings between my two computers. &nbsp;But, I have a desktop and a Surface Pro 3 and the
 mouse pointer speed appears to be being synced. &nbsp;On the desktop, the mouse pointer speed was too slow. &nbsp;So, I adjusted it. &nbsp;Then I went to use the SP3 and found that the mouse pointer speed of the touchpad mouse became too slow all of a sudden. &nbsp;I can totally
 understand that the pointer speed would need to be different between my desktop with a 27" 16x9 wide screen and a regular wireless mouse and my SP3 with a 12" screen with the built-in touchpad. &nbsp;So, unless your PCs have exactly the same hardware, I see no
 point in syncing the mouse pointer speed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than simply turning off syncing all together, I would think that mouse pointer speed syncing is being controlled by the "Other Windows settings". &nbsp;So, I will try turning off syncing for "Other Windows settings." But it would be really nice to know
 what else won't be synced if I turn this option off. &nbsp;Further more, it would be really, really nice if there was a separate option for syncing mouse cursor speed considering the vastly different devices/hardware that can and will be running Windows 10!!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Other Windows Settings contains your other settings of Windows like mouse, printers, File Explorer and many more can be synced.&nbsp;So if you turn off this options sync to all this will be disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try a clean boot and see if this helps increasing you system speed:</p>
<p><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called <strong>
Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important: </span></em></strong><em><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or
</span>when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.</em></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Hope&nbsp;this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks confirming that mouse settings syncing is controlled by the "Other Windows settings" sync setting. &nbsp;But, I still think that Microsoft should share what exactly everything that is controlled by this setting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off syncing "Other Windows settings" and was able to maintain independent mouse pointer speeds. &nbsp;However, after talking to another Windows 10 user who has a Surface Pro 3 and a desktop computer, I tried uninstalling the Logitech SetPoint software
 for the desktop wireless mouse and keyboard. &nbsp;I then turned syncing "Other Windows settings" back on and I do not seem to have a problem with mouse pointer speed on my Surface Pro 3 and desktop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion on speeding up my system. &nbsp;But, was not having a system speed problem. &nbsp;But, maybe someone else might find this info helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>If you had read it, you would have realized it was about the synchronization of settings, not the speed the system.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sync "Other Windows Settings" :&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note that it is still "Settings" related and not operational or part of the OS. It means the Taskbar&nbsp;position, lock status, and others as well as other Desktop settings. It does not include OneDrive which has its own settings and App.<br />

            <p>I have discovered Sync Other Settings does include Sounds.&nbsp; I use a separate PC in my home theater/Hi-Fi room for outputting digital hi-rez music files to an outboard DAC.&nbsp; This requires "No Sounds" be selected in Control Panel.&nbsp; On my other PC I like to
 use Windows Default Sounds. I have to deselect Sync Other Settings to be able to do this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears deselecting on one or the other PC does the trick. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Big,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There are two actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Big.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try these fixes next:  
<br /><a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recognize-headphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recog...</a>
<br />
<br />Some report that what worked is turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings.  Restart and then disable Hibernate file to clear it, restart PC again and enable Hibernate again:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hiberna...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>This is the nature of adding a transition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me try to explain. Let's say you have two photos that are each 7 seconds long. Their total duration is 14 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you put a transition between them (say for 1.25 seconds), that's a period of time where the first picture is transitioning to the second so essentially both photos are running simultaneously; they overlap on the timeline and that shortens the overall
 duration of those two photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visually:</p>
<p>[ ..... 7 seconds .... ][ ..... 7 seconds ..... ]</p>
<p>&lt;------7.00------&gt;&lt;-------7.00------&gt; = 14 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>After adding the transition:</p>
<p>[ ...... 7 seconds ... ]</p>
<p>.......................... [ ..... 7 seconds ..... ]</p>
<p>&lt;----5.75---- |1.25| ---5.75 -----&gt; = 12.75 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what basically happens is you lose the amount of time devoted to the transition from the total duration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple ways you can workaround this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the pictures and apply the transitions first, then add music and synchronize.</li><li>For any transition you add that shortens the total duration, add the corresponding amount back to the duration of one of the photos.</li></ol>

                    <div>Hello.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently purchased a new H3S-00003 and having a ton of problems setting this up. My computer doesn't have bluetooth so I purchased a Asus&nbsp;</div>
<div>USB-BT211. When I try to sync the mouse I see it, but adding it gives me an error 0x80070015. I've tried this on 2 computers with the same result. I also have an older generic bluetooth dongle (no name on it) which has a similar problem (error 0x800704dc).
 Any ideas?&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons that may cause an app not to open or crash when used. Are you getting an error message when you try to open the app?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you <span>boot your Surface in a <strong>clean boot</strong> state and check if the issue persists. Doing this allows us to eliminate any possible conflicts between a 3rd party app or an anti virus that may be preventing Fresh Paint to
 work properly. Please click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, and follow the steps on <strong>how to perform a clean boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we recommend that you perform the steps on this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/apps-and-windows-store/troubleshoot-windows-store-apps-on-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Please ensure that the latest Windows Store update is installed and the date and time on your Surface is correct.</p>
<p>

            <p>Nothing can be guaranteed, but the very first thing any user should do is check their PC/Laptop Manufacturer's Website for evidence that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- it has checked and reported Windows 10 compatibility for your PC/Laptop Model;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- any BIOS, Driver and other support software updates have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Driver and support software updates for any added peripherals such as Routers, Printers, Scanners, Keyboards, Mice, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- software compatibility, especially if you are running any 'old' software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make sure you have system and data backup plus recovery media available, just in case.</p>

            <p>It's almost as if Microsoft said "remember how people took issue with with windows 8? why don't we give some upgrade the tackles all that criticism and MAKE IT EVEN LESS FUNCTIONAL! Everyone will love it!"<br />
<br />
You guys wanted your start button?<br />
<br />
No problem! Here's a start button but the entire task bar will only work sporadically. It might even freeze up because we all know how much you love turning things off and then on again to get them to function. Amirite?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh hey guys we got the multi-desktop thing again. There's even a button for it! Good thing too. When your cursor is lagging over the task bar it's actually pretty neat.<br />
<br />
Oooo and what a nice little search button we have! The better to find all your apps that don't have a folder because who cares? Also handy when your start button still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
And wow oh wow is microsoft edge great! Want to use another browser. Haha! I hope you like rebooting pages everytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never experienced network or audio or video playback problems before?! Well Windows 10 has got your back! Now you can experience what it was like to have a computer with dial-up and a trojan virus! Fun!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's so clear that a ton of work when into making it suitable for ALL platforms. &nbsp;Now every platform can have the same crappy underperforming experience that is Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Good job guys! Never thought I'd see the day where I can say I miss Windows 8.. or Vista.<br />
<br />
Although, if anyone could provide me with a Windows 7 download that would be great. Seriously. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just to add, in the middle of posting this my taskbar disappeared! So you can add that to the list of features as well.</p>

            <p>I upgraded from Windows 7. No sound from my Dvico Fusion HDTV! Notepad opens every time I boot! Takes unbelievable amount of time to boot! Won't shut down properly - says something about ResManager.exe still open!</p>
<p>All in all I'm extremely disappointed. I have gone back to Windows 7. I really can't understand why Microsoft can't get it right!!?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for the record I had backed up my Windows 7 partition so 20minutes or there abouts and I had my original OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I might go Apple or Linux - gotta be better than Microsoft.</p>

            I upgraded and it was so bad I asked them to return it back to 8.1 and in doing that a UAC control took over my windows 8.1 ans asked for a password from a hidden administrator that I had never used. HP told me I had to reformat on a brand new computer
 and I lost everything. My old computer had some original information so I contacted Microsoft for support and after four calls and a chat I was told I was on my own. They don't give a dam about customer service and they are very aware that windows 10 is a
 bomb and it is killing a lot of computers. Don't download windows 10 unless you are prepared for a lot of headaches and zero customer support. If someone started a class action lawsuit I would be on board in a heart beat. My next system will be an Apple and
 I am done with Microsoft. I bought my daughter one and she loves it and their support is second to none. Windows 10 will drive customers to Apple before they even get the bugs out. The absolute worst service of any company I have ever dealt w

<h2>            Brookstone Bluetooth stereo headset BT-H31 will not open correctly.</h2>
                    I have desktop with Windows 7 recently updated.&nbsp; Desktop is a custom build.&nbsp; Been using it for several years successfully with many different hardware and software components. The BT device is a USB small profile Cirago. It works fine on my HP laptop with
 my headphones, but have this repeating issue with my desktop - it will not open / connect, keep getting a yellow warning triangle advising to Troubleshoot, which I have done multiple times but can't get the connect to work.&nbsp; It says I need to reinstall the
 MONO driver, which I do but problem just keeps coming back.&nbsp; Both Laptop and desktop are running the same version of Windows 7.&nbsp; I have been able to get the headphones to work afer messing with the trouble shooter and clicking here and there for many different
 iterations&nbsp;but can not put my finger on why it works sometimes and not others. I have noticed that if the headset is on and searching at the time of bootup it seems to work most of the time.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made to your computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>What is the exact error message or error code that you get when you try to use the Bluetooth device on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps and check if that helps you in fixing the issue
 on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Hardware troubleshooter wizard on Windows 7 and check if there are any errors using the hardware on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Method 1 does not help you in fixing the issue on your computer follow Method 2.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to download the Software and Driver for your Cirago Bluetooth adapter from the manufacturer’s website and install it on your computer and then you can try reconnecting your
 device using Bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link to download Software and Driver:</p>
<p><a href="http://cirago.com/wordpress/support-2/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cirago.com/wordpress/support-2/downloads/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also check for the latest driver updates using your Windows Updater.</p>
<p>Click on <b>Start</b>,
<b>All Programs</b>, <b>Windows Update </b>and check for the available updates.</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p><strong>Put the computer in clean boot and test
</strong></p>
<p>Follow <strong>
Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service. After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program,
 if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> - Remember to put the computer back to normal startup
<strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When you perform
 a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I hope this information helps. Please get back to us if you have any more questions about this issue.</p>

            Thank you for your response Frederik! I would like to avoid installing anything on Windows CE. That is why I would like to run command line prompts from the Windows 7 that will run a program on the Windows CE system, without installing. Thank you!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are a couple of things you can try:</p>
<p>Change the Screen Resolution;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not fix it, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers download Section &gt; then Key in your Computer Model number &gt; look for your Operating System &gt; find either Graphics / Video or Chipset Drivers and download and install them.</p>
<p>Then try&nbsp;to do the Screen Resolution change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or do a System Restore to before this happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html</a></p>

<h2>            win10 HDMI worked then stopped working</h2>
                    <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>win 10 w ASUS P8Z77-M motherboard using on board video. very vanilla setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after win10 upgrade, it took me a while to figure out I needed to update motherboard stuff but finally got HDMI monitor working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then today a giant step backwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugged in a mini USB hub and now HDMI quit working under windows. It works fine when running diags&nbsp;initially but when it transitions to windows, no more HDMI signal. so unplugged usb&nbsp;hub but now no HDMI in windows. this blows. i appreciate it was my bad
 not to do all mobo upgrades prior to win10, but this is nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i am open to suggestions on how to resolve this. I'm shocked HDMI would have stopped working in windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THanks,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>i appreciate your response but as mentioned i already unplugged the device in question and windows10 still doesnt recognize HDMI connected monitor (primary and only monitor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>and trying your step 2 (which tbh seems very generic and doesnt&nbsp;explain what happened) is now a challenge as i have to untabled my setup and redo with RGB cable to debug/deduce/get things workings. I'll get to it but was hoping for more definitive advice
 based on experience. a simple search tells me i'm only one of many many people struggling with any number of HDMI issues.</p>

            <p>I use ASUS products myself.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have a RAMPAGE IV EXTREME with a an additional video card ASUS V1156 video card...&nbsp; It seems to work well with WINDOWS 10 PRO.&nbsp; I use the drivers from the manufacturer directly !!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have problems pixelating in playing WATCH DOGS (UPLAY game) only.&nbsp; Yes, I have many games and I work with AUTO-CAD.&nbsp; So we are working on tweaking my system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would purchase a separate video card if you have HIGH DEMAND for video and not trust the on mother board video.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion - hope it helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>thanks for the feedback. my video demands are light so was hoping to make due w mobo video. I resolved problem by resinstalling&nbsp;latest drivers from ASUS. BUT it then happened again after a few days. Seems crazy. so buying a basic video card in hopes this
 solves the problem. I'm not living with windows 10 losing its mind regularly which seems to be whats happening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try these steps and check if it helps.</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:</span> </p>

</strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/KB/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/KB/310353</a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> </span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual. Refer “</span><span>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup
 state”</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable antivirus software installed on the computer.</span> </strong>
</p>
<p>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.

<h2>            Permanent removal of candy crush etc</h2>
                    <p>I have recently reset my computer, using Windows 10. The below apps have reappeared in my start menu. No matter how many times I hit uninstall and unpin from start they keep reappearing. Not just on the left hand side of the start menu but also as a tile
 on the right. Its rather annoying as if I try to pin Facebook etc to the tile menu it keeps vanishing and the below games reappear.....I don't mind having them on the start menu if I have to, but not in the way of apps I use on my tile section! I've gone to
 settings, personatization, start and turned off occasionally show suggestions in start. What else can I do??</p>
