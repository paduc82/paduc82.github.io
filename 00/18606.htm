<h2>            Excel map won&#39;t show Vietnam</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get a map chart to color Vietnam or Viet Nam. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tried both those variations of the name</li><li>Same data with another country displays fine</li><li>Different data and another country in that cell&nbsp;displays fine.&nbsp;</li><li>Moving the Vietnam name and data to other cells that work ... Vietnam still doesn't work.</li></ul>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>X-Axis Scatter Graph Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronrosenfeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            X-Axis  Scatter Graph Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem defining the X-Axis data for a scatter graph in Excel 2016.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, given a multicolumn graph, in Excel 2007, the first column would be used as the X-Axis values/labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in Office 365/Excel 2016, it seems ALL of the columns are being used for the Y-Axis, and the X-axis is merely a sequential value (same as a line graph).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that deleting the column label from the first column will cause Excel 2016 to treat that first column as the X-Axis, but it seems there must be another way that allows one to retain the column labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran into this trying to graph an ephemeris of Sun rise and set times, where the three columns were Date, Rise, Set.&nbsp; All of the values, except for the column labels, are numeric.</p>

            <p>Hi vbajpai,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Based on your description, it looks like you may be encountering an issue with the Microsoft Account on your phone properly syncing and accessing the Live ID services online.&nbsp; To confirm if this is a connection issue, I'd like to have you perform a manual
 sync with the Microsoft Account on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Manually Sync the Primary Microsoft Account on Your Phone</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>From the App list on your phone, tap </li><li>Tap <strong>Email + Accounts</strong></li><li>Tap and Hold your primary account </li><li>Tap <strong>Sync </strong>from the menu (the primary account will not have the option to delete)</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; You'll see a message indicating the sync is in progress, and an error message if there is any issue (otherwise, you'll just be brought back to the accounts page).&nbsp; If there is an error, please toggle your connection between Wifi and Data to see if you
 can sync then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Regarding the contacts, any new contacts created on the phone will be automatically synced to your Microsoft Account.&nbsp; If there is a syncing issue with the account on your phone, this can explain why they do not appear online.&nbsp; If the contacts were created
 on the phone, once the sync is successful they should be updated on your Microsoft Account (AKA Windows Live ID).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I hope this helps and we appreciate your post here in the Answers Forums!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            hi&nbsp;Greg<br />
thank for your reply.<br />
i tried&nbsp;your sugestion of synching but result is same.<br />
i&nbsp;see only a fraction of my phone contacts on&nbsp;mail account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
my probmem is that if i try to reboot my phone&nbsp;to solve error no 80070490 as advised on the support site, i wil loose all contacts as i do not have any back up of them anywhere. i can back up&nbsp;other data&nbsp;in Zune but i guess contacts can only be done&nbsp;via live
 id&nbsp;account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Could you suggest further steps for resolution...please help.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hello tahone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with your accounts on the Windows Phone 7.&nbsp; At this point there are a few thing that can be considered to resolve this issue with a Microsoft account and I have one suggestion if you
 are trying to add a Google account as a secondary account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having this issue with the primary Microsoft account on the phone try the following to see if you can properly sync this account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the phone and tap settings &gt; time + date &gt; set the time, date and time zone manually.&nbsp; Once this is done, go back to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the Microsoft account &gt; select the sync option.</li><li>If this account continues to fail to sync the next thing to do is tap the error you receive.&nbsp; You should now be on the screen where you can enter your password.&nbsp; At the very bottom of this screen try entering the following in the server name field, m.hotmail.com,
 blu-m.hotmail.com, bay-m.hotmail.com.&nbsp; After entering each, go and try to sync the account.</li><li>The final thing I would suggest at this time is to go to accounts.live.com and sign in with the Microsoft account you are trying to use on the phone.&nbsp; Go to security info and look for the option related to two step verification.&nbsp; If this is currently ON,
 you will have the option to create an app password.&nbsp; Please create one and then enter this in the password field on the phone.</li><li>If all of this fails to improve your situation, I am afraid the only other option is to reset the phone and try adding this account at initial set up.&nbsp; If this fails, try adding a different Microsoft account to the phone.&nbsp; This test will tell us if your
 issue is with the phone or your account.</li></ul>
<p>As for the Google account the only suggestion I have here is to add this manually via the advanced setup option in emails + accounts.&nbsp; You will find more information on how this is done here,

<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps and that you can get your account added to your phone.</p>

Thank you SouvikIN. Done what you said a while back. Messaging sound, vibrations and volume is on but nothing happens. I am going to shut down, restart and wait for someone to message me. Hopefully soon. :/

It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails.

<p>You misunderstand what Blocking means to Microsoft. All it means is that the email will end up in your Junk folder. It does not mean it will prevent the email from getting to your mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete all your Rules, Blocks, and Safe Senders. Don't create any for a few weeks and see how your mailbox works. Of course as needed manually move things to the Junk Folder or out of Deleted Items as needed.</p>

<p>Hello Yusuf, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is possibly caused by corrupted or interrupted installation of updates. Most of the time, if this thing happens, a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard reset</a></strong> fixes the issue. It will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was
 first turned on.&nbsp;Please <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/11688/windows-phone-back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up</a></strong> your stuff to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating a backup and perform a hard reset, we recommend that you run the Upgrade Advisory app again and use a stable WiFi Internet connection while downloading Windows 10 Mobile.

    <title>exclusive access error message in access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniellerylant  say:</h3>
<h2>            exclusive access error message in access 2010</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to set up a shared database on a network drive for about 6 users on my team.&nbsp; If one user has the database open and then another user tries to open the database, the following message appears on the 2nd user's screen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You do not have exclusive access to the database at this time.&nbsp; If you proceed to make changes, you may not be able to save them later"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have given full permissions to each group that will be opening this database.&nbsp; I have changed the options in the actual database to NOT display the Navigation Pane, and unchecked the Allow Full Menus and Allow Default Shortcut Menus boxes.&nbsp; I have set
 a&nbsp;Display Form called waitlist database to open when the user opens the database.&nbsp; This form basically has buttons on it that takes the users to the reports they will be working.&nbsp; I have set all forms and the database itself to 'Edited record' for the Record
 Locking choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure why the users are getting this message, but there is a catch to this.&nbsp; If the user clicks the ok button about 20 times, the database will open and everything works perfectly.&nbsp; We are continuing to let the users work in the database by just having
 them click ok about 20 times to get to the reports, but its very frustrating for them to have to do this each time they open the database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what is going on here?</p>

            <p>First, as Daniel said, EVERY multi user app NEEDS to be split. Please read the articles he linked to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is being caused NOT by data changes, but by design changes. You are probably using functionality that is causing design changes. most likely filtering. If you create a filter on a form or report, the filter is stored with the object. For example.
 you might be looking for data for a single date. So A filter is created: Datefield = 1/12/16. That is stored as a string in the Filter property, in effect changing the design of the form. But because someone else has the same form open, even to a different
 record, they can't create a filter because the design of the form has been changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why it is imperative that every user has their own copy of the front end. This way the user can create all the filters or similar functionality that affect design without affecting other users.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I unblock someone&#63;</h2>
                    Somehow an automated message (out of the office), from someone I had emailed and gotten a response from, ended up in my spam folder. When I marked it not spam, I was told I had blocked mail from that address. I wasn't given a way to unblock. I emailed
 the person again to explain what happened but haven't heard back and I don't know if emailing that person unblocked emails from that address.

            The gear icon is in the upper right next to your name. Choose View all settings at the bottom (or Options if you have that instead).  Junk mail settings are under Mail.  The link I posted earlier should take you right to them.

            Sweep feature? I have no idea what that is. I had no plans to clean up mail from the sender. I merely defined one email as "not junk" and all previous emails from the sender went to the inbox.

<h2>            OneDrive for Business was uninstalled after latest Office update</h2>
                    
<p>I just updated Office and the OneDrive for Business client was uninstalled from my computer - extremely frustrating as it was just working fine after months of issues.</p>
<p>Now I have no idea how to reinstall it. &nbsp;I have an Office 365 sub and all Office programs are up-to-date. &nbsp;The installer online for my Office 365 account warns me that I have newer versions of Office so it won't let me update it from there.</p>
<p>I've searched the web and found an MS link that lets me install OneDrive for Business separately - but it doesn't work, just gives me the useful error of telling me that it's not there and it can't install it.</p>
<p>Please, I need this to sync important SP files. &nbsp;It was working fine before this update.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I finally managed to get it installed after about 3 hours of effort.</p>
<p>This whole process was a nightmare though. </p>
<p>I am still at a loss to understand how OneDrive for Business can uninstall itself after a product update?</p>
<p>I run two MS accounts on my computer, a personal one that has an Office subscription, and a business one where I am a user on a Premium Business account. &nbsp;I feel like the whole environment doesn't handle these multiple accounts very well.</p>
<p>I can only assume the Office update thought it was for my Personal account and uninstalled OneDrive for Business as I don't have that as part of my Personal account.</p>
<p>I had to run the repair tool on Office twice to get OneDrive back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For business critical software, this whole environment feels very amateurish. &nbsp;I can't recommend Office 365 at all right now to people given the issues I have with it.</p>
<p>I am one more issue away from moving all online files to Google and giving up on Sharepoint.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>I understand that you have a bad experience about this issue. From your description, the issue could be related to the incompatibility between Office 2016 Personal and the Office 2013 version of OneDrive for Business. In this situation, we recommend you
 refer to the workarounds and explanations in the following KB article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3098502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive for Business is uninstalled after you upgrade to Office 2016</a></p>
<p>Your effort and understanding are highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 105, which earphones would support the 3.5 mm jack&#63;</h2>
                    I got a nokia 105 for long calls with family and friends, so i prefer not to put the phone close to my ears for long hours. It does have a 3.5 mm jack, but I don't know what earphones will it support. I tried a nokia wh108 but doesn't support. I don't
 know much technical details about AV or other type of conmectors existing. Any help is appreciated:)

<p>Generally a 3.5mm earphones without inline controls would work. You can get basic sets from brands like Sennheiser, Coloud, Soundmagic and Philips.</p>

<h3> troy at tlc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 cannot log in &#40;desktop app&#41;</h2>
                    <p>O365 account and upgraded to Office 2016. Everything worked flawless before upgrade. Now Skype for Business 2016 desktop app fails to log in. Log in just says "contacting server and signing in..." with no activity or eventual fail dialog.</p>
<p>- Confirmed sign in is an organization email address.</p>
<p>- Confirmed&nbsp;O365 admin shows email SIP is same as being used to log in</p>
<p>- Confirmed able to log in to Skype Desktop on other computers (both&nbsp;Skype 2015 and 2016)</p>
<p>- Confirmed I can log in to web based Skype on the computer using same credentials</p>
<p>- Did the 'delete my sign-in info' to force a new password dialog - same result, does not connect</p>
<p>- Have uninstalled Skype for Business 2016 and reinstalled (using the O365 app install option)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Win 8.1 Pro (64 bit)</p>
<p>- Office 2016 (32 bit)</p>
<p>- Skype for Business (32 bit, build 16.0.4229.1024)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely a&nbsp;setting on this computer issue, not an account issue. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            I can't remember the terms for 6.5, but you probably want to ask this in the WM6.5 App Hub forum&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/105.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/105.aspx</a>&nbsp;.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've noticed something strange lately on outlook.com and I'm not sure&nbsp;if&nbsp;it's correct or not.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In some of the emails I receive, the email and name of sender appear to be the same as the recipient's. It&nbsp;looks like the email is sent from and to the same person. From:&nbsp;X (name&lt;at&gt;mail.com)&nbsp;To: X (name&lt;at&gt;mail.com), just as shown&nbsp;in the picture bellow
 (I've blurred it for privacy).</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is this behavior normal?&nbsp;It usually happens when the email I receive is a newsletter or a forward that includes many recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum! It can be hard to understand why you are seeing such behavior in the email you received-- the sender and receiver of the email is the same. We'll be happy to answer your inquiry.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the screenshot you provided, it's very likely that the sender of the email put his own email address in the "To:" field so he can receive a copy of the email or for whatever purpose he has in mind. Since his own address is the only one that's visible
 in the "To:" field, it's likely that your email address and the other recipients of the message were placed on the
<strong>BCC</strong> (Blind Carbon Copy) field to mask the information of the recipients of the email from each other. The BCC addresses will only be visible to the sender of the email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies your concern. If you have further questions, feel free to post back for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<h3> nanny lou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge  How do I delete ads on my MSN home page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>2016/01/14 </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated to Windows 10.&nbsp; Now MSN has Microsoft Edge as a browser.&nbsp; AND the ads are back on my MSN home page and other pages I may choose to read an article.&nbsp; WHY?!!!&nbsp; I'm paying for MSN Premium so that I won't have to see adds for things I have no
 interest in.&nbsp; Nor do I want to see adds for things I've investigated for personal purchase or gifts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8 I had the option of "Opting Out" of ads with "AdChoice".&nbsp; It was unsatisfactory and irritating when I had to use it over and over again to keep that&nbsp; off my computer.&nbsp; And it NEVER got rid of ALL of the ads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the "Opt Out" of ads has gone and I don't even have that choice, pitiful as it was.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get rid of the&nbsp; ads now? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I have to suffer them if I am paying for MSN Premium?&nbsp; AND it just renewed!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft... you are&nbsp; off a lot of your customers.&nbsp; You are too greedy.&nbsp; I don't even&nbsp;LIKE Outlook.&nbsp; I liked the old versions of&nbsp;Address Book and Calendar.&nbsp; I prefer to use MSN Mail.&nbsp; What was wrong with them?&nbsp; I was a Beta Tester for a while.&nbsp; It seemed
 to me that many of my fellow testers just enjoyed changing things because they could.&nbsp; A great many of the changes were NOT for the better, witness Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Windows XP and Windows 7 were the best ones I've used so far.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried other browsers and other email programs.&nbsp; I have always preferred the MSN set up.&nbsp; But I'm not liking the way things are changing.&nbsp; Change for change's sake is not a good reason to make changes.

<p>How do you get the waffle app to appear that also shows all of the programs to the right of it?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Harsha,</p>
<p>I checked with Microsoft Support and this Waffle Icon feature is only available by signing into your Office account. "office.com/myaccount". &nbsp;When you click on the Waffle icon they will all appear and they are "Outlook.com, People, Calendar, One Drive, Word
 online, Excel online, Power point online, One Note online, Docs. com and Office online. &nbsp;I have not installed Skype yet and an S appears also and I assume that once I install Skype the S will have more information showing.</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;It motivated me to continue my search.&nbsp;<br />
Chaz&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Setting tabs in word 2008  &#40;12.3.6 version used on Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow struggling with setting tabs while working on my CV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a LEFT alignment (obviously) with dates...then want to create a new alignment/ tab for the name of organisation/ job role.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very non-common sense at the moment...can't figure it out and the tutorials I have seen haven't helped/ show different versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working with 'Word 2008' version 12.3.6 on Apple Mac book pro (early 2015 model).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>

<p>Additional to the information on Tabs in Word's <strong>Help&gt; Word Help</strong> this is one of the most straightforward articles I've seen:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=12&amp;ved=0ahUKEwillK-QxNfXAhUCUd8KHTcGACMQFghaMAs&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uwec.edu%2Fhelp%2Fword07%2Ftabs-m.htm&amp;usg=AOvVaw3iRWEE_UUCIdrVAz6rJ6tg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word 2008: Setting Tabs, UWEC</a>
</p><p>
</p><p>Setting Tab Stops is pretty much the same in any version of Word, though. If you have a specific issue please describe how those articles fail to provide the result you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, what you suggest wanting to do most often is facilitated by using a Table rather than tabs.</p>

                    My menu bar is missing the "FILE' icon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any idea why this has happened.&nbsp; Instead of FILE I now have HOME.

            You are using the Google toolbar.&nbsp; If you uncheck it, you will get the IE menu bar. &nbsp;In your screenshot, the word "File" is showing right below the Address Bar back arrow.&nbsp; What happens when you click the word "file"?

    <title>Why cant i email phtos or pictures&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why cant i email phtos or pictures&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>for some reason I cant send photos or pictures in my emails anymore, it has literally within the last few months stopped working, all I get is the picture sat there waiting to load up with the little progress thingy saying 0 of 1 pictures loaded and that
 is as far as it gets, and then it suddenly says 'there was an error loading this file' in a little red box.</p>
<p>I haven't changed anything on my computer and the pictures are the correct size, in fact I have sent these same pictures before in an email, so it just doesn't make sense as to why it no longer works!!</p>
<p>any help you can offer me would be very much appreciated, as I have some really important emails I need to send with photos attached and time is quickly running out.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help and input.</p>
<p>Ben.</p>
<p>p.s. my email&nbsp;provider is Hotmail/Outlook.</p>

            <p>Hello guys and girls, </p>
<p>its always the case, but after searching for days now and finally posting on this forum for help, I actually found an answer posted by someone on this forum and it seems to have fixed my problem, all I did was went onto the tools section of internet explorer,
 clicked on internet options, went to advanced, clicked on reset and then reset again, once it had done its job, I closed it and restarted my computer and everything seems to be working fine now, I can add photos and pictures to my email and they attach just
 fine and load up correctly. I will have to try actually emailing someone to find out for sure, but for all intents and purposes, it looks like its fixed!!</p>
