<h2>            How to completely remove Security permissions in Vista</h2>
                    <p>I used a CD to install folders and files from my other PC into my laptop. A couple of these folders are preventing me from opening them, or any files I have in them due to the security permissions program. I don't need, or want such a program in my computer.
 There is nothing in there that is not backed up to restore in the way I have made the folder, file, etc, and absolutely nothing that is some sort of 'Cosmic Top Secret' info or file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use the darn permissions 'box' to gain complete access to read, add to, edit, or remove at my will, and not at the will of such a MS program.
</p>
<p>Nothing I have done has made any difference. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to completely remove, or permanently disable this program so that whatever I want to do in my computer is what I can, and will do.

<p>
</p><p>I created a "My Documents" folder in C, and then transferred saved files from my&nbsp;</p>
<p>other PC system that I had put on a CD. I am not able to open the folder, or any
</p>
<p>files within it. Also, I had just installed a new hard drive, and reloaded the OS as
</p>
<p>came with the computer. With everything now backed up I can reinstall all again,
</p>
<p>but this should not have to be done. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I always organize my PC's with folders I create, and files I make, or save in C alone. I
</p>
<p>never use the files/ folders installed in the OS that are outside of the listed C drive.
</p>
<p>In that way I have the organization best for my eyes, and finding what I want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still use my old system with Windows for Workgroups, 3.11 for my most critical
</p>
<p>files as with it, and DOS outside of Windows I have complete control of what is on
</p>
<p>the OS, and what work I put on my system. I wish Microsoft would rewrite that OS
</p>
<p>to work on these newer PC's, and even include all of the original programs that
</p>
<p>were installed at the time. Back in those days a person actually had complete </p>
<p>control of their computer, and all it had in it. If a problem arose that could not
</p>
<p>be corrected within Windows, a person could go into DOS outside of Windows </p>
<p>to find and correct the prob.em. Such is not the case ever since the advent of
</p>
<p>Windows 95. </p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO, my email of everyday use is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and NOT the Outlook </p>
<p>account. </p>

<p>Another interference by MS to interfere with their 'control' on the Internet? This is
</p>
<p>all part of the problem. I cannot change my profile to use my usual account email
</p>
<p>address as MS has yet to address the problem of not allowing me to access my </p>
<p>own account, and, even though a ticket was made and entered, and they were </p>
<p>supposed to get in touch with me to correct the problem, they never have to date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first signed up for a Hotmail account, I was not allowed to use my own </p>
<p>address to connect. I had to use only Hotmail or I could not get access to many
</p>
<p>things I needed at the time. My profile would not even accept my yahoo mail as
</p>
<p>even a second address. Finally, one year I was allowed to change my profile to
</p>
<p>use my yahoo mail account. Now, I have been given four different 'excuses' as </p>
<p>to why I am not allowed access to my own account. The chat Rep I spent much </p>
<p>time with finally advised that just to get in here I should make this "temporary' account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything involving MS is always a roadblock to doing anything not desired by </p>
<p>the MS monopoly. And you tell me I have complete control over my computer? </p>
<p>The only control I have to to turn it on, or off. To have only what I want is not
</p>
<p>allowed. Before the advent of Win 95 the Windows operating system could </p>
<p>have anything removed without disturbing the system. Back then I removed </p>
<p>many things that were part of the system that I did not want, and substituted </p>
<p>them for what I did want. Did you even use and study those earlier systems? </p>
<p>As a Federally licensed 1st Class tech, I did. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, finally, you did not even approach the issue in this reply email as you </p>
<p>mentioned in your previous email. I had outlined the problem as well as </p>
<p>my thoughts of dissatisfaction about how MS has changed in the pure </p>
<p>interest of greed, but you have not done as you stated. Are you wearing </p>
<p>blinders to only read 'selectable' writings, or is it that you can't read well?

            <p>I see that he cannot even read with comprehension of what he 'reads'. </p>
<p>(3rd &amp; 4th grade reading comprehension.)</p>
<p>"you did not even approach the issue in this reply email as you mentioned </p>
<p>in your previous email." ("If you can tell us what folder is blocking you, </p>
<p>we can tell you how to set it with full access.") He seems to be stuck on </p>
<p>no more than this forum rather than the issue at hand. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My frustration with MS is their overall control over the OS to disallow </p>
<p>personal change preferences, such as was allowed in Win 3.11, where </p>
<p>one could substitute any other product in the place of the comparable </p>
<p>MS installed item. (A simple explanation is to completely remove all </p>
<p>traces of MS Internet Explorer, and substitute any other, and it would </p>
<p>even work within the MS site for all things, including downloads.) In </p>
<p>that way they do not allow full control of the OS alone, let alone </p>
<p>online. (But that is probably why MS put DOS, that is responsible for </p>
<p>making Windows work, inside Windows instead of where it belongs </p>
<p>outside of Windows for control over the entire system.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Keene think he gets a feather in his cap for ignoring the real </p>
<p>issue to keep harping on defense of MS? Of course, with his failure </p>
<p>in reading comprehension he would never be able to pass the </p>
<p>federal license exams in communications. They weren't easy enough </p>
<p>for him to make the grade. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally: "Since you won't follow these simple instructions,". What </p>
<p>"instructions"? There is not even one instruction as to the problem. </p>
<p>(Keene - "If you can tell us what folder is blocking you, we can tell you how to set it with full access."
</p>
<p>Me - "</p>
<p>I created a "My Documents" folder in C, and then transferred saved files </p>
<p>from my other PC system that I had put on a CD. I am not able to open </p>
<p>the folder, or any files within it." </p>
<p>
</p><p>My original action - "</p>
<p>I have tried to use the darn permissions 'box' to gain complete access to </p>
<p>read, add to, edit, or remove at my will, and not at the will of such a MS </p>
<p>program.&nbsp; Nothing I have done has made any difference."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>His ONLY contribution, but not 'instruction' was - "You can set the security </p>
<p>the way you described, that's your only option." </p>
<p>
</p><p>Keene is possibly a 'half-way' moderator, but absolutely a complete </p>
<p>failure as one with any degree of technical understanding or technical </p>
<p>writing to be able to fully explain a process. </p>
<p>He must have missed those classes in college as well as the 3rd and </p>
<p>4th grade classes.&nbsp; (If he went to college, or, had studied something </p>
<p>other than basket weaving.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this forum only a hoax, or is someone actually qualified to answer&nbsp;</p>
<p>to this issue? </p>

    <title>Backup will not wake Surface Book from sleep&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backup will not wake Surface Book from sleep&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I use Acronis True Image for backups with the backups scheduled to run at a specific time. This works fine on my Lenovo W530 laptop, however, the Surface Book will not wake from sleep to run the backup. I looked for the Allow Wake Timers option in Advanced
 Power Settings and it does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a critical problem. How do I set the Surface Book so the backup program can wake it from sleep? Thanks.</p>

<ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to resolve this issue?</li><li>Have you tried looking into&nbsp;<strong>Power Options</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Advanced Power Settings &gt; Sleep expecting to find the Allow Wake Timers setting so I could enable it when plugged in but the setting does not exist on the Surface Book, unlike my other Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Also, have you tried checking the system requirement of the application?</li><li>Does it fully comply with the Surface Book's specs?</li></ul>
<p>I don't mean to be offensive but that is a ridiculous question. I don't have either the source code to the Acronis True Image &nbsp;2017 backup software or the Surface Book specs. What I do know is that Acronis is one of the largest suppliers of backup software
 in the world and it works fine my other machines. I searched Google for this issue and as a result I know that this is a well know issue encountered by many other Surface book owners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only advice Acronis has for this problem is to go to Advanced Power Settings &gt; Sleep and ensure that Allow Wake Timers is enabled. Since this setting does not exist on the Surface book the obvious question is does the Surface Book support being awakened
 from sleep mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the second major problem I have encountered with my Surface Book and I am beginning to regret buying it. Thanks for your reply and I hope you can help.</p>

            <p>Well, you can't start the installation for a 64 bit version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 from within Windows XP. You will need to boot from the disc in order to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is my computer 64 bit capable?</strong></p>
<p>Before you can start the process to migrate to 64 bit Windows, you need to find out if your system is 64 bit capable. If you are already running a 32 bit version of Windows 8 on you system, you can find out by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb3.png%3fw%3d396%26amp%3bh%3d383" height="383" width="396" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>System</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d414%26amp%3bh%3d169" height="169" width="414" /></a></p>
<p>Look under <em>System</em> &gt; <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There it will list whether the processor is <strong>x64 based processor</strong> or not. In my case I have 64 bit capable processor. Once you have confirmed this, you can move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>For Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 users</em></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb5.png%3fw%3d419%26amp%3bh%3d398" height="398" width="419" /></a></p>
<p>You can determine if your processor is 64 bit capable by using a <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Instructions </em>field, look for the instruction set called <strong>AMD64</strong> or
<strong>EM64T</strong>. If you see them, then your processor is 64 bit capable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running a 32 bit version of Windows, whether Windows 8 or Windows 7, you need to consider carefully the steps to migrate from it to 64 bit Windows 8. Regardless of the ubiquity of 64 bit computing, key factors such as hardware and application
 compatibility remain a issue, especially for legacy systems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your system meet all the requirements? Having just a 64 bit capable processor is not the main go ahead for 64 bit Windows. What about other hardware such as your video card, audio device, printer and any other critical device or application you are
 using? Also, if you have less than 4 GBs of RAM, I strongly suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows 8 or consider maxing out the installed RAM before you consider upgrading and when I say maxing out, I mean 4 GBs or more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing to do is to create an inventory of both your hardware and software programs. After doing that, go to the manufacturers website and check if there are any 64 bit drivers available. The manufacturer might not have native 64 bit Windows 8 drivers,
 but they just might have 64 bit Windows 7 and Vista drivers which should work. The reason why is Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista all share the same driver model. Application compatibility remains critical, for instance, if you are running applications designed
 for Windows XP or apps that are not fully 32 bit, you might want to reconsider your decision. Applications that are 32 bit but might contain 16 bit code will not work with 64 bit Windows. So, you need to carefully think this true. If it ain’t broke, don’t
 try fixing it might just apply in this case. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backup, Backup, Backup</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gathered all the necessary prerequisites such as driver updates and have certified all your applications are compatible, you need to backup your personal data. There is no upgrade path from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 8 64 bit. Yes,
 that means you will have to reinstall all your drivers (64 bit native drivers) and applications. Some additional configuration might be required on your part.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to handle some of the migration chores is by using the built in Windows Easy Transfer utility (specifically) for Windows 7 users. If you are running Windows Vista or Windows XP, make sure you
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">download the free Windows Easy Transfer utility</span></a>, install it and create a backup of your personal files and settings. Lets take a look at doing
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d437%26amp%3bh%3d345%26amp%3bh%3d345" height="345" width="437" /></a>

</p>
<p>You have a few options to choose from, the best one would be an external hard disk which is excellent for storing large amounts of information. If you don’t have an external hard disk, you can save your backup to a network share if one is available.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb6.png%3fw%3d436%26amp%3bh%3d344%26amp%3bh%3d344" height="344" width="436" /></a>

</p>
<p>Check off the accounts you would like to have backed up. </p>

</p>
<p>You can create a password if you want to protect your Windows Easy Transfer backup. If don’t want to, no problem skipping this step. Click Save.

</p>
<p>Open the external hard disk and save the file there, you can give a unique file name if you wish.
</p>

</p>
<p>Wait while your items are backed up and saved. This can take some time depending on the amount of information you have stored.
</p>
<p>Once your files are backed up, its time to start the migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt to start the installation of a 64 bit version of Windows from within a 32 bit version of Windows, you will receive the following error message.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb6.png%3fw%3d444%26amp%3bh%3d142" height="142" width="444" /></a></p>
<p>Which is understandable, since you are running a 32 bit version of Windows. To begin the installation, we will need to restart the computer and boot from the disc or USB thumbdrive which contains the installation files. So, click the close button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer then load your BIOS and set it to boot from your DVD drive or USB thumb drive. You might need to consult your computer manual for instructions how to do this. See the following article for additional instructions.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reset this PC Takes over 15 Hours</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I selected the option to Reset this PC using the WinRE recovery environment. I selected to keep my files because, there were many important work documents that needed to be kept. The reason for the PC reset is due to a Scareware attack. This
 is taking an excessive amount of time and is costing our company a lot of money in downtime. Is it normal? Should I tell my user that this may take up to 24 hours? If I reboot, will this make things worse?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-Regards</p>

            <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Hi Ionov,</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Well, this could be an issue with the driver for the mouse and keyboard. You may have to update them to try and fix the issue.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Mouse, touchpad, and keyboard problems can have a number of causes:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span>&nbsp;</span>•Incorrect device settings</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span>&nbsp;</span>•Missing updates</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span>&nbsp;</span>•Corrupted or incompatible drivers</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span>&nbsp;</span>•Hardware problems</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>What is the Make and Model of the computer?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Let’s troubleshoot the issue from the scratch and find out the cause of the issue. Follow the methods:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 1:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Refer to the link to run the troubleshooter:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Refer to the section “<strong>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong>”
</font></font></font></p>

</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Let’s try updating the driver for the mouse and keyboard and verify the results. Follow the steps:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a) Press <strong>Windows and X </strong>key together and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>b) Locate the <strong>Mouse and other pointing device</strong> icon. Right click on the driver icon.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>c) Select <strong>Update driver software</strong>.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>c) Select "<strong>browse my computer for a driver software"</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>d) Select “<strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong>”.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>e) Select the driver option according your device model and installed.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>f) If this does not work, follow the steps from ‘<strong>a’</strong> to ‘<strong>c’</strong> and select “<strong>Search automatically for the updated driver</strong>”.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>g) Choose the same steps to update the driver for keyboard as well.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if it resolves the issue. If not, I would suggest you to download and install the latest available drivers for the mouse and keyboard from manufacturer website of the computer. If the drivers are not there for Windows
 8.1, install the driver in Windows Compatibility mode. You will need to uninstall the current version of the driver and install the latest ones.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span>&nbsp;</span>Refer to the link to run the Windows Compatibility troubleshooter to install the drivers:</font></font></font></p>

<p>Yes,&nbsp;if&nbsp;your computer came with <span><span>Windows 8,</span></span> you might be able to restore it back to

<p>I would think that you wouldn't need any space to do a reset (since technically the reset would be erasing basically everything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd try this:&nbsp; Open the "Windows Defender Security Center" app, click the "Device Performance and Health" section, and then choose the "Fresh Start" option.</p>

<h2>            Laptop wakes up when closing the lid</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10. Power options set to "do nothing' when lid closed with battery and plugged in both. I put it to sleep manually, close the lid and it seems it wakes up because battery drained after 5/6 hours if being kept in the bag. So I test it by putting to
 sleep, closing the lid and opening.. it is back on. I would like it to really not do anything when closing or opening the lid. TIA.&nbsp;</p>

            Suggest you to check with the below setting and see if they are causing any issues.

* Click Start, type Power Options and select same when it appears in the list.

* In the current power plan, click the entry Change plan settings, then click on Change advanced power settings.

* Under Power options click on the plus sign in Sleep.

* Click on the plus sign in Allow wake times.

* Now change the preference under Allow wake times from Enable in Disable. If you are using a mobile PC, enable for both areas On battery and Network operation.

* When finished, click OK.

Now see if it fix the issue. Sometimes network card is the most common source of wake-up. Do check with the below setting to confirm the same.

    Press Windows Key + X, then click “Device Manager”
    Expand the list for “Network adapters”
    Right-click the adapter to be configured and choose “Properties”. There may be several adapters, one for Ethernet, one for wireless, and others like Bluetooth
    Then go to “Power

<p>Thanks Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps you gave me is not exactly what I see in my PC (mobile PC/Laptop) but I was able to get to Power Options/Advance Settings and found Allow Wake Timer which was already set to Disable on Battery and "Imp Wake Time.." for Plugged In. So this should
 not be the reason based on your instructions. Is that right? Let me know if you have other options for me to try.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the update Yajnesh. I forgot to ask, whats the make and model of the laptop? Have you installed any new hardware or software since this problem started happening? 

You might want to check if there are updated drivers available for your chipset, display, network and other drivers.

            Hi Yajnesh, Sorry if you found the information to complex. Since its a new laptop, its possible it could be a defect. I would return to the manufacturer or vendor where you purchased it. You could perform a factory reset to see if helps.

Let us know if it works and we can explore some more options.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<span>&nbsp;</span>As I understand you receive blue screen error:
</span><b><span>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL STOP: 0X00000000A.
</span></b><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is it a random Blue screen error?</p>
<p><span>Let’s follow the methods provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1:</span></b><b><span> Try to start the computer in safe mode and perform Hardware Clean Boot and
 check whether Blue Screen of Death error occurs not.</span></b></p>
Refer this link to start your computer in safe mode.
<p>
<b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Hardware clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to get the computer up and running with minimal hardware (disabling Display adapter, network adapter and
 sound card devices) so that you can perform diagnostic tests to determine which hardware of the normal boot process are causing problems.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Start button”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on “Computer” menu and choose “Properties”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Device manager” option in the left pane.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right Click on Sound Card, modem, Network Adapter, Display Adapter, CD/DVD drive and click disable. (If you are playing game online, please do not disable network adapter)</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Then enable the drive one after another one to determine which is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Once you found the device which is causing the issue, please uninstall and reinstall the driver for the device and check for the issue.</p>
<p><b><span>Note: Download and install the updated device drivers from the manufacturer Website.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Microsoft doesn’t recommend you to leave the computer in Hardware clean boot mode. So, please set your
 computer to normal boot mode after performing the troubleshooting steps by enabling all the devices.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>To set your computer back to boot normal mode follow the steps mentioned below:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Start button”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on “Computer” menu and click on “Properties”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Device manager” option in the left pane.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right Click on Sound Card, modem, Network Adapter, Display Adapter, CD/DVD drive and click Enable.</p>

<h2>            Who refunds stolen money from my bank account&#63;</h2>
                    Microsoft took money from my bank account when I did not buy anything (yes, they ripped me off). When I order from them earlier this month, I told them not to retain my credit card information. &nbsp;Obvious they lied about that. &nbsp;Who do I turn to for a refund?
 &nbsp;I've already filed a complain with the Better Business Bureau. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The real problem is that by "hitting" my account for money, they caused me to be charged $25 for being overdrawn.</div>

<h2>            BSOD System Thread Exception Not Handled - SPUVCbv64.sys</h2>
                    <p>On a 2 months old hp laptop (hp spectre x360 with kaby lake intel proc.) I had 2 BSOD in the last day shortly after
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">waking the laptop from sleep</span> while using the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">windows hello feature</span>.</p>
<p>I have updated recently the pc to windows 10 pro (from home) and I have activated the hyper-v and Bitlocker features (but i think the problem is unrelated to these things).</p>
<p>The hp camera driver was also udpate recently (SunplusIT 27/10/2017 ver. 3.6.8.7). Maybe I should revert back to an older version?</p>

So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road.

            <p>Hey there Semper!<br /><br />Let's see what we can do to get things sorted. First off, thanks for all the info you've given us! That definitely helps us get a better idea of your situation.<br /><br /><strong>I see you've already tried deleting and redownloading your profile, but I want to make sure that you've tried it in this order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete your profile</a> ONLY (do NOT delete profile and items).</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a>.</li>
<li>Restart your console.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download your profile</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />If you didn't try that exact order, give that a shot and let us know how it goes.<br /><br /><strong>If that doesn't help, here are a few questions to help us better understand the situation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What actions are you performing on your console when this issue occurs? I see you mention Netflix/Youtube, but does it happen when you're playing games on Xbox Live? How about when you're just idle on the dashboard?</li>
<li>Has this always been an issue? Or is this a recent development?</li>
<li>Are you able to try a wired connection from your router to your console to see if that yields better results?</li>
<li>How about a wired connection directly from your modem to your console?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know how and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a Lifecam HD webcam and I'm currently using it as a document camera while displaying the image using a projector. &nbsp;The camera works great, image quality is excellent however when using the lifecam software you don't seem to be able to resize
 the window and make it fullscreen. &nbsp;While this isn't a huge issue it would be nice if it could be done. &nbsp;Any idea if this is possible and if not using the lifecam software if another piece of software would be able to do so?</strong></p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please answer these below questions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the model of the Lifecam you have installed on your computer?</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you update the latest drivers on your computer?</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you update the video drivers?</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the software working earlier?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I would suggest you to try changing the settings in the livecam software, because if the software settings are changed this issue could occur as the video has no issues.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To perform these settings you may refer the below provided manual.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.livecamserver.com/Livecam-Manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.livecamserver.com/Livecam-Manual.pdf</a>
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above provided steps doesn't resolve then you may uninstall and reinstall the software and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong>Uninstall or change a program</strong></p>

            I too want this answered. The only way I can use the camera off-line with full screen is by using the Windows 7 magnifier tool over top of the small lifecam window...
<br />
I have set the magnifying tool at 125%.<br />
When can we expect this issue to be resolved?<br />
I need to use as a projected image, not on-line.<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>I have the same issue with the Life Cam Studio and the Microsoft LifeCam program. Just use Virtual dub or some other equally useful freeware program. The fact that Microsoft can't even put out a program that supports full screen in 2014,2015 or 2016 is beyond
 a joke. If you pay 100 bucks for a webcam it should work at a basic level...i.e. full screen.</p>

<h2>            Sticky Notes 3.0 BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to Microsoft Sticky Notes 3.0 (Which appears to come in with October updates), our Windows 10 clients Blue Screen as soon as Sticky Notes is launched. This can be when Clicking the icon, or on system startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue can be replicated on all of our 1803 machines. All different Makes and models are affected</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this issue and found a way to fix it?</p>

            A first of its kind case.
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance about posting dump files.

<p>For an update. This appears to be Sticky Notes 3.0 conflicting with our USB Port control software called GFI Endpoint. If I stop the GFI service then Sticky Notes works...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately support for GFI on Windows 10 stops at 1709 as it is being ported to another product. But at least we know what is causing it.&nbsp;</p>
