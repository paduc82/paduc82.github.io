<h2>            Present Online</h2>
                    <p>Using PowerPoint 2013 on Surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using "Present Online", only the laser pointer is available. Is there an option to enable the pen and highlighter for online presentations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you kindly.</p>

            I am not finding the pen either, just the laser pointer for my presentation in Presenter view.<br />
<br />
Looks like pen tools have been modified. In the Pen icon options, Laser Pointer mode is one of the option. I toggled between the option and I can get the pen to work. :)<br />
<br />
Happy to Help<br />

            <p>I have noticed that the laser pointer does not show up in the online presentation itself, though it does appear on the Surface's screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do hope that the pen and highlighter become available (in online presentation mode)&nbsp;once Office 2013 becomes final.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I click on hot links in my document files with ctrl&#43;left mouse click like I used to&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have many downloaded files in which I have hot links or hyperlinks to a site or video online that I have always been able to hit Ctrl+left mouse click to go right there in the past.&nbsp; For some reason when I try to do that now, I get an error message from
 Microsoft saying something like I don't have that ability or my computer doesn't do that or something.&nbsp; Anyway, I can no longer click on these hot links to go directly back to the internet page I was on.&nbsp; I looked at programs and features to see what programs
 microsoft might have installed recently.&nbsp; I repaired one, deleted Silverlight as I never have ever used it in 15 years!
<br />
I tried to repair several things using the troubleshooters, but nothing seemed to be wrong.&nbsp; I did a quick scan for viruses, etc. and I did not have any.</p>
<p>So, what could have caused that to happen all of a sudden after having that capability for a very long time?</p>

<p>Silverlight was an MS utility developed as a Adobe Flash alternative in 2007, and its development/deployment ceased sometime ago</p>
<p>Your issue will be with your unknown version of Win and whatever browser you are using, its not an Office issue</p>
<p>PS If you get an error msg, you need to quote it exactly and not "something like" which is of no help</p>

<p>Sorry for being so flakey with my description.&nbsp; I have Windows 7, they just did not offer that as an option when asking what operating system I have.&nbsp; I was using the Mozilla Firefox up to date browser.&nbsp; I have been able to click on hyperlinks all along
 for several years.&nbsp; Recently it seemed that I had a problem with an update and and had to shut my computer down and wasn't sure if it was going to start again.&nbsp;
<br />
Sorry, about my memory.&nbsp; I am getting old and for some reason, probably massive WIFI overload, I forget things constantly.&nbsp; Very frustrating.
<br />
Don't get old!<br />
I guess I was just being lazy also.&nbsp; I thought that just by chance someone might be able to help with the information that I did provide.&nbsp; I did try to catch what that Microsoft Message box would say when I clicked on the link, but I could never finish reading
 it all in time and certainly was not fast enough to write it down, before it would just disappear.</p>
<p>Sorry if I wasted your time and that of others who read my question thinking they might try to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It's not that big of a deal and I won't be too bothered if I don't figure it out on my own, so please don't give it another thought.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Unwanted advertising on my Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    


I keep getting Outlook Calendar reminders from a company that wants me to buy something from them.  How in the **** can they get access to my Outlook Calendar and how do I get this to stop?  I have gone into calendars several times and I thought I changed all the settings so this would not happen anymore but I must not be doing something right because I keep getting them.  The only difference is now instead of getting them every Monday, I get them every Wednesday.  I have even contacted the company several times and asked them to stop.  They said they will but I am still getting a weekly reminder to purchase from them. This is rediculous.  This is not what my Outlook calendar is for.  Please help me get this off my computer once and for all. 



Thank you.

            <p>In Outlook 2007, click Tools&gt;Account Settings.&nbsp; Select the E-mail tab and look at what type of account you're using.</p>
<p>If you are uising a POP account, then there's no way in creation that anyone can put somthing on your calendar in Outlook because it's local to your PC and completely inaccebbible to anyone other than you or those who use your PC.&nbsp; Moreover, if you have
 something on your calendar you don't want, nothing in the world can prevent you from simply deleteing it.</p>

            <p>They don't have access to your calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe&nbsp;they're sending you&nbsp;ICS (iCalendar) files and you have Outlook configured to process them automatically.&nbsp; Why wouldn't simply blocking them via your Blocked Sender list be sufficient?</p>

            Screen sharing between the two is a feature which is still not there. As regards screen sharing, both are incompatible with each other. You can do screen sharing between Skype to Skype / SFB to SFB but not between SFB to Skype.
<br />
<br />This is a demanded feature and might come in near future.

            This option currently not implemented, but if you want to see it, you should send in feedback to the Windows Engineers to let them know. The more persons reporting it, the higher the chances of them implementing it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />    Open the Skype app and sign in.
<br />    Select the menu button and select Settings, then select Logging.
<br />    Switch Diagnostic and error reports to On, then restart the app.
<br />    Select the menu button and select Send feedback. The Feedback Hub app launches.
<br />    You need to be signed in to a Microsoft account to use this app. If you're not signed in yet, sign in using your Microsoft or Skype account, then go back to the Skype app and select Send feedback again.
<br />    In the Feedback Hub, select the plus button or Add new feedback:
<br />
<br />    feedback hub
<br />    Fill out the details requested.
<br />    Recreate the problem is optional, but if you have marked the feedback as a problem and you can consistently see and reproduce this issue, this section will help us to get specific logs to understand the root cause of the issue:
<br />        Select Start capture.
<br />        Open the Skype app and try to recreate the problem.
<br />        Go back to the Feedback Hub and select Stop capture.
<br />        Add some screenshots if you think they would be useful.
<br />    Select Submit.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 instant search showing no results</h2>
                    I'm trying to help a friend out, he is running Windows 7 on a desktop PC, his Outlook 2010 instant search is suddenly showing no results. I've searched the problem on the internet and tried everything people have said but to no avail. I've rebuilt the
 index many times and have tried indexing the whole C drive and then just the outlook pst file locations. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hello Raju,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>He has an identical IMAP and POP3 account for some reason and the default is IMAP. I have already tried running the scan pst tool on all of the pst files. One psf file had errors which I ran the repair tool for. The largest pst file is about 4GB which I
 believe is fine as the size limit is approx 20GB in Outlook 2010?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm having difficulties fixing my Instant Search within Microsoft Outlook 2010 software.&nbsp; I have tried various fixes without much luck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ran PST Scan but this did not fix my problem</li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Within Indexing Options</span>:</li><li>"Outlook.exe software" is not within the list......... After clicking on Modify, I'm only able to select folders ..... I can't select the actual file "Outlook.exe" ............... Please note that my PST file is within my Documents folder under Outlook
 Files and my SEARCH was working previously but had all of sudden stopped working.</li><li>I included the folder location where my 2 - PST files are located......I have one PST for personal and another for PST for work and both are located within the folder OUTLOOK Files within my Documents folder.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>what&#39;s the difference between &#34;close and remove account&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikepalmer903  say:</h3>
<h2>            what&#39;s the difference between &#34;close and remove account&#34; in outlook 2013 mailbox</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to clean up some old pop accounts and mailboxes in outlook 2013. I just converted most of my accounts to IMAP. I started with a pst file that had the old accounts. I now have my two new IMAP accounts that I can see and my older pop accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved the mail I wanted from one of the pop account inboxes (orders@....com) to my imap mailbox. I deleted the&nbsp;orders@....com from account settings and was left with the mailbox which is now empty. On right clicking on &nbsp;it various times I got different
 choices, one was to "close account" and at other times it said "remove account". The remove account (which is really what I wanted to do) did nothing. In another window I was able to get "close account" and that actually "removed" it from the inbox window,
 however I don't know if that removed it or just closed it. It's extremely confusing and I could find no reference to the difference anywhere. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have this figured out though someone can correct me if I'm wrong:</p>
<p>The " remove account" &nbsp;choice appears when the actual account is still present</p>
<p>The "Close Account" choice appears when the the account is now longer present.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the detail Karl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my edit, I think I've solved it but for future reference, let me clarify and ask again as what I'm seeing doesn't seem to jive with what you're saying:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Yes, I am looking at the files listed in the nav pane and using the right-click context menu.</li><li>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>"Close" applies to PST files with for POP a... &nbsp;Right now, i'm looking at one of my remaining POP accounts (in the NAV pane) where the account is still
 in account settings and therefore the PST file is still present.. Right clicking on that file name
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only </span><span>gives me the option to "Remove" not "Close" as you mentioned above. What I've been able to figure out is that means: there is still an active PST file,
 so therefore, Outlook is asking if I want to remove that PST file as well as eliminating the emails that show in the&nbsp;various&nbsp;boxes&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with it. &nbsp;What I saw previously was that: if I had&nbsp;deleted&nbsp;the account from Account Settings and only the mailboxes
 were there (from the pst file I guess) right-clicking on the account in &nbsp;the nav pane gave me only the option to close (that's because the account had already been "removed".</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Remove" applies to .ost files for Imap.... When right clicking
 on one of my &nbsp;IMAP accounts in the Nav Pane, the &nbsp;choice to "remove" is grayed out. On another, the "Remove" option is there. This may be because, as you mentioned for POP accounts, this is set as the default account.</span></li></ol>

            Hello SYED,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Microsoft community. It seems that you're having a hard time working with e-mails as some recipients have not been able to view the e-mail content that you send. We'd like to know more about the problem. Providing answers to the following may
 help us determine the possible cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
- Are the recipients in your contact or safe list?<br />
<br />
- Does the problem happen when sending via Outlook.com and Outlook mail client?<br />
<br />
I suggest that you try the following:<br />
<br />
- Try using different browsers to see if the same thing happens. This helps us determine the possibility of a&nbsp; browser specific problem.<br />
<br />
- Try sending an e-mail using other accounts&nbsp;and let us know how things turn out.<br />
<br />
Please take your time to try the above suggestions and let us know the result.<br />
<br />
We will wait for your reply.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />

    <title>Trying to restore autosave&#47;autorecovery files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to restore autosave&#47;autorecovery files</h2>
                    You know how they say there are no stupid questions?<br />
<br />
I had a flash drive fail recently. For various reasons, most of which ultimately stem from the fact that I am an idiot, I had a large amount of important work saved to the flash drive (mostly DOC and DOCX; maybe a few RTFs) and nowhere else. I'll spare you
 the boring details, but the flash drive is dead, and for now I am out that large amount of important work.<br />
<br />
The computer in question is running Windows 7 and has Microsoft Office 2010 Starter installed onto what I believe is a hard drive partition (it has the drive letter Q, separate from C, but I'm virtually certain it's not on a separate disk). My only hope at
 this point is to use an "undelete" program to check for autosaved versions of those files, and I'm wondering where to look. Right now I'm looking in&nbsp;<br />
<br />
C:\Users\myname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\UnsavedFiles<br />
<br />
and I'm not finding anything too interesting, as I think those are only files that I at one point had open, but never saved to a physical location.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is whether there are any other folders that might also have at one point contained any files of interest, specifically autosaved versions of files I was working on that were stored on the flash drive; I know I've seen autosaved files that
 weren't saved to the same directory as the file itself. And I've recovered unsaved Word documents during power outages, etc., so I know they're being saved somewhere. Should I poke around in Q as well, or is that simple application data?<br />
<br />
I'd like to do the same process with some Excel files as well (opened in Excel Starter, obviously), but I'm much more concerned about the Word files at this point).

            <p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it's extremely unlikely that you'll find anything useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word does "autosave" to the folder listed in the Options &gt; Save dialog (at least that's in the full Word product, not sure about Starter), which defaults to C:\Users\&lt;your name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word. But if you close the document normally, Word
 deletes that file as part of its shutdown process; the file (with an .asd extension) stays behind only if Word or Windows crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you work on a document and close it without saving the changes, Word makes a copy of the last autosave file (if there is one) in the UnsavedFiles folder that you mentioned. That copy is automatically deleted after four days or the next time you open Word,
 whichever is later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Q drive is a "virtual drive" that holds only the program files and some configuration information. There's no point in searching there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a small possibility that there are some <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/211632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
temporary files</a> elsewhere. Even if you find them, they probably won't contain much, if any, of your documents.</p>

<h2>            Deleting contacts</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
Is there a way of deleting (rather than blocking) contacts on Skype? &nbsp;It is driving me mad. &nbsp;Want to clear out old contacts that are not active anymore.<br />
<br />
Many thanks

Does not work on my desktop.&nbsp; The only options are "add to favorites", "view profile" or "edit contact."&nbsp; Delete contact is not an option.

<p>Unfortunately I'm not very good with formulas :-) so every cell with that formula displays

<h2>            How do I print a background image in Word 2007 without tile&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p><span>I thought this would be a piece of cake but realize now it's harder than it<br />
seems even though it should not. <br />
<br />
I made a beautiful letterhead for my company but have it in Jpeg <br />
<br />
So I decided to write a contract on it with word and paste the letterhead as <br />
a background <br />
<br />
I did some searching on how to do this, because as usual, the most simple <br />
and obvious option of doing something was not apparent in a Microsoft program <br />
:( <br />
<br />
I tried adding it as a watermark, but you only have options of <br />
50-100-150-200 and 500% and none worked (Again no obvious available option <br />
here to include a manual setting or 75% which might have worked), besides <br />
that i do not want a faded looking picture using this option. <br />
<br />
So than i did more research and found an option to add a picture through <br />
page colors option which is next to the watermark option. <br />
<br />
I went there (Word/Page Layout/Page Color/Fill Effects/Picture) and clicked <br />
on fill effects than inserted a picture <br />
<br />
It went in perfectly so i was very happy, I did print preview it showed <br />
exactly what i wanted to print, I was also able to type on it which is what I <br />
need to do. <br />
<br />
But than i printed it and it came out Tiled, why? <br />
<br />
All i simply want to do, for the love of God, is take this letterhead Jpeg <br />
that I have and paste it on a word file and write a contract and print it <br />
<br />
With 1 billion options why cant this simple thing be done <br />
<br />
I was told to visit this page <br />

<p>So for future&nbsp;reference (personal)&nbsp;it's:</p>
<p>-Open a new word page</p>
<p>-Go to Insert than click on Header than Edit Header</p>
<p>-Afterwards, click on Insert / picture (within the Insert panel again, should be visible already) and add your picture</p>
<p>- Adjust the size by clicking on the small arrow on the top right where it says Size to open the size dialog box</p>
<p>- Immediately afterwards click on the Text Wrapping option, which is located again on the top right and select behind text</p>
<p>-Once that's done, you can now&nbsp;move around your background image by dragging it and resizing it as you see fit</p>
<p>-To switch to text mode, I found that clicking on Print Preview and closing print preview would bring me there automatically (image will now appear blurred because you will be in text mode, bluriness will not show up if you actually print though).</p>
<p>- You can enter all the text you like, if it happens to be longer than 1 page, it will automatically create a new page with your picture.</p>
<p>- If you need to return to the image for editing reasons, go back to Insert and than Header and click on edit header. Notice the bluriness leaves because you exited text mode.</p>

<p>The only solution I've found is to not use the Page Color/background option and to instead insert the image in the Header/Footer. I suspect the reason this occurs is because the intention of the Page Color function is for web pages (which tile an image)
 rather than printed documents.</p>
<p>To insert your image in the header/footer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the header/footer area and then click "Edit Header/Footer" </li><li>Insert your picture (Insert tab/Image) </li><li>Size it to fit your page (or however large you want) </li><li>If there is other content in the header/footer, select the picture and on the Picture Tools Format tab, click&nbsp;Wrap Text and then click Behind Text</li></ol>

<h2>            Multiple client web part is not loaded properly, automatically added some white space.</h2>
                    Hi, I am converting SharePoint full trust to SharePoint High trust (Provider hosted) solution. My old full trust solution consists of different custom web parts and multiple web parts added in different web part zone on the same web part page.<br />
<br />
For the conversion process from Full trust solution to High trust solution I am converting custom web parts into app part (Client Web Parts) and when we add custom app parts into one web part page in the different zone some white space automatically added and
 that created the problem for us. It is not working as it was in full trust old solution.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Could you please help me how to resolve this error?&nbsp;
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting on this so quickly. I am using the Desktop version of Windows 8.1. Recently needed on-line help reinstalling Office Home &amp; Business 2013, but on the start menu, I only see Office &nbsp;Excel 2007 and Office Path 2007; also, Microsoft Office
 Diagnostics (which I used) and Microsoft 2013 Upload Center. Not sure what's up with all that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main issue right now is frequent Word "save as" issues. This has happened multiple times in the past few weeks. When I try to save a Word document, a pop up appears claiming that "Microsoft Word is not responding." When I try to x-out of the box, it gives
 me 3-options; wait for the program to try to resolve the problem, restart the program, or close the program. I have tried all three with the same results. My paper disappears and so does all my work. That's pretty much it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise me on this matter?</p>
<p>Desiree</p>
        </p>

<h3> azureliu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel on iOS&#40;iPhone &#38; iPad&#41; not properly updating values for cells with formula</h2>
                    <p>I designed an Excel template for some autocalculation propose, and I want to be able to edit it on my iPhone for mobility. The template runs well on PC, but the values for the cells with formula cannot properly update to the latest value on my iPhone(and
 I also tried on iPad).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used some long formulas in my excel file, some of them are about 1,100 chars long, are they too long for Excel App on iOS? If so, how long can Excel App support for formulas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also used some hyperlink formulas(&lt;150 chars long) to give different link as I adjust its precedent cells. It cannot properly show up when I enter values on the precedent cells(I used iferror and vlookup so if I don't enter values the formula cell will
 return blank), but if I tap on that formula cell, the option "open link" is available(I protected the sheet and the workbook), and if I tap "open link", it does redirect to the proper link page. This malfunction only happens on Excel App too, but it seems
 the App did do the calculation but just not updated on screen?</p>

<h2>            Drop down Boxes in word documents Office 2010&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I recently changed from Office 2003 to 2010. In an old document we had drop down boxes to let people choose one of several names, by left clicking the title the choices would appear, then people could choose one of the several names. Since the conversion
 to Office 2010 it now doesn't work. Please help!<br />

<h2>            Bluetooth carkit on BMW with iDrive Nokia E70 phonebook problem</h2>
                    Hi there all,<br />
<br />
I have a brandnew BMW and a brandnew Nokia E70. It appears to me that NONE of the latest/business oriented NOKIA phone models work FLAWLESSLY on the factory build in carkit that comes with the BMW iDrive system of sept-2006 (and earlier).<br />
<br />
Some of the cheaper mobile models do work of Nokia BUT the more expensive ones do NOT work. We can talk/accept/dial numbers but the PHONEBOOK/call registry/SMS options are not working at all.<br />
<br />
I've hovered the Internet and come to the conlusion that many others have the same problem (sometimes worse they can't even make or accept phone calls)<br />
<br />
HOW difficult is it for NOKIA and BMW to get into contact with each other and SOLVE the issues!!!! I mean, the phone is not cheap, the carkit was not cheap ....... SOLVE IT!<br />
<br />
Or do you want me to buy a cheap phone instead? Well if your marketing department wants me to buy only your cheap models tell me why you have the more expensive ones? Or do you want me to rant about NOKIA and BMW all over the Internet.....<br />
<br />
neahhh<br />
<br />
Anybody with a decent solution and feedback is welcome of course.

            Hi there!<br />
<br />
I've just got a brand new 530xd with iDrive and I have the same problem with my Nokia E61, which was expensive too! :-) I'm so sad that my dealer told me that BMW Bluetooth cannot read phonebooks from "big", "pc-like" phones (the words he used).<br />
<br />
I've then tried with my Nokia 6680, but no success too although it is neither "big" nor "pc-like".<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Louis

            i have the same problem with my 2006 330i and idrive, I think it is a problem with the Nokia S60 software, the S40 works fine with idrive. I tried my girlfriends Nokia 6280 which runs the S40 and you can see the address book and make calls. I hope this
 helps. I guess we will not have a fix unless Nokia release that there is a problem. Hello Nokia, can anybody hear us!!<br />
<br />
Motorola works like a dream with all there phones, I guess it is time to switch :-(

<p>I used the bluetooth in a couple of different BMWs with a couple of different phone models for quite some years now, and I don't want to miss it anymore. For quite some years, bluetooth was a required feature for every new phone I bought.</p>
<p>Now I got myself a new E70, and I am really quite disappointed that it wouldn't work with my 2005 BMW 325 Ci Convertible, which has no iDrive, but a built in radio with bluetooth support. The firmware version of the E70 is 2.0618.07.10.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Nokia connects to the car, sometimes it doesn't, the phone book wouldn't load, sometimes the connection breaks, even in the middle of an operation. I had the case that the connection broke in the very moment when I received a call and wanted
 to accept it. The BMW kept "ringing", I couldn't control the phone from the steering wheel anymore, I was on the freeway, and the phone was in my sport bag which was not accessible securely for me while driving. I had to drive like this for quite some kilometers,
 it was quite annoying.</p>
<p>I de-authorized the BMW in my E70, and when I go on longer trips, I have my old Motorola phone with me, so I switch the SIM to be able to use bluetooth in my BMW.</p>

<p>Well, since the Nokia marketing has to sell their bluetooth car kits, too, they might be interested in creating a proprietary solution so that Nokia phones only work with Nokia bluetooth car kits, and not with those of competitors.</p>

            Hi everyone,<br />
I found out today the Idrive doesn't support nokia symbian phones i have two n73 and a n70 also readying that n80 also don't work..<br />
<br />
This is the way i've got around the problem, we have a nokia 6230i (the only bmw supported phone) and spoken with orange our phone company and they have supplied me with a secondary sim card for one phone number..<br />
I'm sure other phone companies do the same <a href="http://www.business.orange.co.uk/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Business&amp;c=OUKPage&amp;cid=1135953583381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.business.orange.co.uk/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Business&amp;c=OUKPage&amp;cid=1135953583381</a><br />
<br />
This means i will leave the 6230i in the car all the time hidden away, and the bmw still works ;-) and the n73 will work when away from the car's..<br />
<br />
I hope this helps someone else this has taken me all day<br />

My experience is that Symbian S60 is not capable of downloading contacts into car kit - could it be something to do with the fact that you don't normally use SIM contacts in these phones?<br />
I have a Seat Altea/Toledo with factory B.T kit and connection is pretty well 100%, just a shame about the contacts issue.<br />
I would use a second SIM on Vodafone, but then you can't use GPRS and the reason I have an E70 is for the excellent Email function.<br />

            Hi Guys -<br />
<br />
Let me join in !<br />
<br />
I cant get it how my 2/2005 Logitech headset, my 2002 iMac, etc all work well with the E70 and somehow the BMW from 10/2005 does not work !<br />
<br />
It can pair allright, but thats it: I can receive calls, answer them, the radio goes silent when I talk, I can hang up. I can maybe use my BMW as the largest headset available. But, not even ! Even in my bluetooth headset, I can press for 2 secs the main button,
 and then I can enter a voice command. Not in the BMW. Its such a shame.<br />
<br />
I can agree that the shame is with BMW as well, they must update their FirmWare. But, can someone tells us what we need to ask our garage to do ???<br />
<br />

            Not only with an E70 but also the N73 gives the same very disappointing problems!!!! Just had a firmware update and I am able to get the phone paired but that's it.<br />
<br />
I own a Series 1 120D Hogh Executive BMW with iDrive.<br />
Unbelievable....such a high standard phone and a high standard car......and not being able to access my contacts. I still am flabbergasted that something like this is possible. Even with a simple parrot it works like magic.<br />
<br />
I can do it with my husband's 6230i (must be at least 100 years old...) for which I also have a snap-in adapter (as for the 6233,6234,6151) but even if I should wish to buy a "new" antique phone, they are are not even available with my provider anymore.<br />
<br />
For the iPhone there seems to be a solution and a suitable snap-in adapter??? So why not for a Nokia???<br />
Even HTC has phones that work.....HTC....please....<br />
<br />
I just had decided to give myself a new N96, but now....no way!! It has to communicate correctly!<br />
<br />
Please please please make it work!!!

The Phone book should copy but as for the other functions then I dont think that will happen.<br />

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
I just a bought an Audi A6 and I was able to tranfer my whole phonebook (more than 500 entries) using the Nokia 810 Car Kit phone contact downloader onto my E51. No problems there.<br />
<br />
What I am missing is SMS functionality, missed calls etc, i.e. whatever has to do with the SIM, although I have Remote SIM mode "on" on my E51 bluetooth profile.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks
