<h2>            How to recover an unsaved Excel 2003 file</h2>
                    I need to know if there is a way to recover an Excel 2003 file I was working on when the power blinked and my computer turned off.

            He's wrong! Go into Excel then Tools&gt;Options&gt;Save and you will find where the autorecover save file is located. &nbsp;You may need to go into your folder options to show hidden files, but I'm sure it was there at one time. &nbsp;Better late than never right :-)

<h2>            E71 has been charging 15 hours now</h2>
                    
<p>I started charging my Nokia E71 this morning at 6 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>It is now still charging (i can see the battery bar animation, seven bars going up over and over again)</p>
<p>It's now 9h40 o'clock so it has been charging for 15 hours and 40 minutes now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery bars are still going up, so it is still charging.</p>
<p>I am starting to panic. What is going wrong?</p>

<p>Okay, I took out the battery, placed it back, pulled out the charging cord and i restarted the phone.</p>
<p>It is not fully charged after charging for 15 hours now; instead of 7 bars (full battery), there are only 6 bars.</p>
<p>I am now charging the phone again. Maybe the battery got out of place. We will see.</p>

<p>The charger aint hot, as is the battery, and that is kind of strange after 15 hours of charging.</p>
<p>The charger must work though, since the battery animation plays when i connect the mobile phone with the charger.</p>

<p>The charger may be working but if it doesn't pump out enough juice, it will take forever to charge the battery, especially if the phone is powered on at the same time.</p>

<p><font>Thanks for your fast replies!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, at 6 o'clock in the evening, i thought it would be better to turn off the phone, so I did. It has nog been charging 3 hours and 40 minutes while being turned off, and it did not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's hope that removing the battery and putting it back in will solve this problem. I really love my E71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit: Oh, and if the problem is solved now by removing the battery and putting it back in, will there be any damage inflicted to the battery by charging it 15 hours straight? I truly hope not.</p>

            My money would be on the charger rather than the phone. If you have another charger in the house, you could try it instead.

            The problem is that any other mobile phone in the house is an old one. There's a Nokia 1600, a Nokia 1650 and a Nokia 2310 in here, and they all have a charger different than the one that fits for Nokia E71.<br />

<p>Pity. Anyway, you will know in a few hours if it a loose battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, you can get a CA-44 adaptor for your old chargers which will enable you to use them to charge your E71 as well.</p>

<p>The battery was loose. It is now fully charged, and the animation of the battery charging stopped.</p>
<p>Phew! I'm VERY glad. It would be a nightmare if this two week old Nokia E71 would be broken.</p>
<p>Ima send some kudo's your way for your fast replies, thank you! :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way: is the fact that i 'charged' (well, not really, seeing as the battery was loose) the battery 15 hours straight going to affect its quality? I hope not.</p>

<p>Difficult to know if they will be any after effects on the battery. Only time will tell. Hope not.</p>

            Following are likely solutions.<br />
<br />
1. Please try to repair your Office as a quick fix.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.

            I'd assume that no one needs to edit this document any more after you submit it. If that's true, then you should save the document as a PDF file and submit that, because it's much less likely to be subject to problems on someone else's computer.<br />
<br />
With your document open in Word, click File, then Save &amp; Send, then (at the bottom of the second column) Create PDF/XPS Document, then the Create PDF/XPS Document button. In the dialog, choose a folder to save in, give the file a name, and click the Publish
 button.<br />
<br />
When you send a Word document in .doc or .docx format to another computer, all sorts of things can go wrong, from different versions of Word or different option settings, to damage in the file caused during the transfer. It would take time and determination
 to figure out what's going wrong here, which you don't need to do.<br />

    <title>mailNickname and Exchange Online Alias - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iangibason  say:</h3>
<h2>            mailNickname and Exchange Online Alias</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While renaming our AD sync'd user accounts we are noticing the Exchange Online Alias is the only field not updating.&nbsp; For example, we create a Joe S. Smith account.&nbsp; If we rename the last name to Joe S. Jones and&nbsp;wait for the delta sync we see it update
 in the Office Admin panel.&nbsp; However when the changes replicate to Exchange Online the Alias still reflect the old last name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this article that updating the mailNickname AD attribute will update the Exchange Online Alias.&nbsp; After&nbsp;updating the mailNickname it still does not change the Alias in Exchange Online.&nbsp; Is this still valid and will this work?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey Skip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; After two tickets with MS support and referencing this post and the articles we ended up determining we need to do an uninstall and reinstall of AD Sync.&nbsp; After doing that and a full sync we now see the Alias attribute update in Exchange
 Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason in our environment when we installed AD Sync first, then installed Exchange, we needed to perform a reinstall in order to get the changes to sync to O365.</p>
<p>

    <title>Synchronizing My phone Calendar with Hotmail calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mo haghighi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synchronizing My phone Calendar with Hotmail calendar</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
As you know, it is possible to share your calendar (s)&nbsp;on hotmail or live.<br />
If it was possible to sync myphone calendar with hotmail calendar&nbsp;(i mean the one we can access on hotmail or live email) then this way you can even share your my phone calendar with other users and also you can get reminder email for appointments and events.
 Of course it is optional and also it can be added to hotmail as a new&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;(my phone calendar), the same way you can add&nbsp;US holiday calendar.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the feedback and it would be perfect if msn does that.

            Hi Mo Haghighi,<br />
<br />
Currently Microsoft My Phone does not support Hotmail or Live Calendar or Contacts.&nbsp; We're investigating this possibility for future releases.<br />
<br />
Other people have made similar requests recently.&nbsp; I've been compiling these requests and presenting them to the product group for further evaluation.<br />
<br />
Thanks for using Microsoft My Phone!<br />

            An alternative I could think of (and I've been long awaiting to do so) is to allow Outlook calendar to sync with Hotmal / Live calendar<br />
<br />
But I can't find any way to do so (officially / for free)&nbsp; for the time being...

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span>Of course, It would also&nbsp;be a very good way to do so.<br />
<br />
But what I meant was to find a way to synchronise my calendar&nbsp;directly from my mobile into my&nbsp;live calendar. this way those whom I'm sharing my calendar with can easily see my calendar changes instantly.
<br />
In my case, I had no way but to sync my calendar with Google calendar. It is very easy indeed and&nbsp;your WM calendar can be synchronised with your google calendar via microsoft Activesync!!!. Google calendar is also sharable and&nbsp;it's got a unique feature&nbsp;that
 let the calendar's owner to embed the calendar into any webpage.<br />
<br />
I am not a big fan of Google products and services, however I think Microsoft should&nbsp;put some efforts into this matter and make this feature available.&nbsp;<br />
From&nbsp;the software engineering point of view, I don't think it is a big challenge.&nbsp;<br />
The calendar is already&nbsp;capable of being synchronised&nbsp;via myphone into myphone account (using the same live account).<br />
All Microsoft needs to do&nbsp;right now&nbsp;is to&nbsp;bring the that&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;into the live account which is very simple (from&nbsp;my point of view).<br />
<br />
Based on&nbsp;the above reply, I am glad that this issue is under investigation by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Let's hope for the best</span></p>

            This is not the right forum for discussing/debating the Live calendar vs what Google supports, but I will say that the Live calendar, which is synchronized via the Live application (and not Microsoft My Phone), is viewable on the web and is also shareable.&nbsp;
 Both of those options can be found by going to hotmail (or another Live web property) and looking for the Calendar option.&nbsp; (In Hotmail this is in the bottom left of the screen; you may need to scroll down depending on how many folders you have in your Hotmail
 account.)&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As stated above, currently My Phone is unable to synchronize the Live Calendar items.&nbsp; However, if you use Live to sync your Calendar, I believe you will find the functionality you are looking for.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you will need to go to two places on the Web
 to see your data; on the phone, this should be rather transparent.<br />
<br />
For more issues related to Live calendar sync, I'm going to suggest you post in the various Windows Live forums or send feedback directly to Windows Live (https://feedback.live.com/?productkey=wlhomepage&amp;scrx=1).<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to point out that this topic is covered in the sticky forum post "Having trouble with using Microsoft My Phone and looking for answers" which is the first post in this forum, so I'm going to close the thread.<br />

            It should be mentioned the only option from the referenced blog post you can use in SP Online is the javascript one and you can't add that to a "modern" page due to its limited functionality.

            First thing I am noticing is that you are using the Breaks/Lunch Time value twice. &nbsp;Once for setup start time and again for Scheduled completion time. You may need one value for set up and one for job run the total duration of breaks would not be the same
 for a 4 hour set up and 120 hour run.
<div><br />
<div>I am assuming that the first 4 cells are entered data and you want to calculate the Job Start and Scheduled Completion</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to separate the calculation for days and hours</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B&nbsp;</div>
<div>1 Setup time (minutes) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1500</div>
<div>
<p><font>2 Job run time (minutes) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1800</font></p>
<p><font>3 Breaks/Lunch time (minutes) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;60</font></p>
<p><font>4 Setup Start time &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3/1/12 1:00 AM &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>5 Job Start time &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3/2/12 3:00 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>6 Scheduled Completion Time &nbsp; &nbsp; 3/3/12 10:00 AM</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>Cells B1:B4 are entered</font></p>
<p>B5=ROUND((B1+B3)/(24*60),0)+TIME(0,MOD((B1+B3),(24*60)),0)+B4</p>
<p>ROUND((B1+B3)/(24*60),0) give you the full days of B1+b3</p>
<p>MOD((B1+B3),(24*60) give you the remaining minutes and the TIME function allows you to add it as time to B4 plus the setup days</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>B6=ROUND((B2+B3)/(24*60),0)+TIME(0,MOD((B2+B3),(24*60)),0)+B5</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Connector - Does it support reminders for Outlook Calendar items&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using Outlook 2010 with Windows Live Connector and when a reminder is set on a calendar item Outlook returns a dialog box saying "reminder can not be sent as reminders are not supported in this folder."&nbsp; I need reminders for my calendar items so how can
 I get this functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Outlook 2010 (POP3 mailbox) with Windows Live Connector in order to push contacts/calendar items to my Windows Mobile phone (<strong>which I love by the way!).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I create an item on my Outlook calendar with a reminder set&nbsp;I get a dialog box informing me that "&nbsp;a reminder can not be set for the appointment because the event is being created in a folder which doesn't support reminders - Is this OK?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rely on reminders to popup and alert me when things are scheduled.&nbsp; How can I get this functionality?&nbsp; Does the Windows Live Connector not support this functionality?</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reporting this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tested this feature in Outlook 2016 client version 1706 (Build 8229.2045) and found this issue is already solved in this version. Currently, this version is in First Release for Current Channel. If you want to use this version, please contact your Office
 365 admin for help. Also, you can wait for the update released to your Outlook client. Please keep monitor the updates of Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you need any other assistance with Office 365, please feel free to contact us. We are always here to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

    <title>Compare and Match values in two differnt spreadsheets or workbooks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victor kustra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compare and Match values in two differnt spreadsheets or workbooks</h2>
                    To explain in more detail, I have two&nbsp;separate spreadsheets with each one containing matching and non matching data. the first 11 field headers (A-K) of both&nbsp;spreadsheets&nbsp;are the same, followed by 3 non matching field headers in spreadsheet one and 4 non
 matching field headers in spreadsheet two.
<div>What I want to do can be described&nbsp;differently, so I will try to explain in different ways;</div>
<div>1) I want to extract all of the matching data found in both&nbsp;spreadsheets based on a comparison of the same field headers from both spreadsheets.</div>
<div>Or</div>
<div>2) I want to Find all the data from spreadsheet number one in spreadsheet number two and remove all non matching data from spreadsheet number two, while still maintaining the validity of the rest of the field headers data.</div>
<div>Or</div>
<div>3) I want to merge spreadsheet 1 and 2 into one spreadsheet while only keeping and retaining data from spreadsheet 1 found in spreadsheet 2 based on only&nbsp;spreadsheet&nbsp;1's field header.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope that these examples allow for understanding my problem clearly and the solution I'm looking for.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The solution can be a&nbsp;macro, formula or anything else.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

<h2>            Format number gives incorrect result &#40;sometimes&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am looking at an issue with an old access app developed by a someone who is no longer with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Format</strong> seems to occasionally giving incorrect results in a query to clean up SSNs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>? Format("<strong>100-01-0000</strong>","000000000"), Format("<strong>100-01-0001</strong>","000000000")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>100-01-0000</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>-000657434</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea why the Format works this way? It seems to be inconsistent.</p>

            I usually recommend converting SINs to a true number and using a <i>format mask</i>&nbsp;to display the SIN to the user. The following code converts the text SIN to an integer and then formats the integer appropriately for a SIN,<br />
<br />
Format(Int(Replace("100-01-0001","-","")),"000-00-000")

<p>Actually the next step in the import&nbsp;process removes the dashes. I was just trying see if there's a known issue with the Format that I might mention when I correct the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to have anything to do with any number limitation - like rolling over at 65536.

My guess is that the dashes are being interpreted as a character and needs to be replaced BEFORE formatting.</p>

<p>?Format(Replace("100-01-0010","-",""),"000000000")</p>

Try to figure out if it is just when there are possible mathematical operators in the string.&nbsp; I think that is the problem.&nbsp; If you use this method it works fine:</p>

                    How can I set another user up (using Exchange) to send AS me (Not on behalf of me), and be able to read my messages without marking those messages as read?

<div>We have tried multiple times to update our business location address when you search for us on Bing.com. Each time, the address is still listed as our old address, but when we click to update it, it is the new address. Is this just a time lag in updating
 the site and we should see the new address appear shortly? Or do we need to be doing something else?</div>

    <title>Importing multiple .pst files simultaneously into Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidnolle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing multiple .pst files simultaneously into Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I am using&nbsp;Systools' Dbx to Pst File Converter to&nbsp;convert dbx files (taken from Outlook Express
<span>
<span>
<font color="#000000">previously running under Windows XP) </font></span>to&nbsp;pst files for&nbsp;use in my Outlook 2013 running on my new Windows 7 machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;I now have approximately 250 dbx files (folders) which I have converted&nbsp;to .pst files suitable for&nbsp;importing
 into Outlook 2013. I see that each converted file has the following file name structure "Converted_myoldfoldername.pst".&nbsp; I have started to import each one separately into Outlook 2013 by using Outlook's import/export function. Through this process, I see
 that Outlook automatically and correctly strips the "Converted_" from my file name and puts the file correctly into Outlook 2013.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I am discovering that I currently need to move through multiple steps involving&nbsp;17 to 18 clicks of my mouse to incorporate
 each pst file into Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking for a way to import multiple pst files simultaneously into Outlook, but I see that the import/export function in Outlook 2013 seems to limit me to one file for each importation. Is there some way to import multiple
 .pst files&nbsp;at one time&nbsp;into Outlook 2013?&nbsp; I welcome your feedback and thank you for your time to save an old man from carpal tunnel syndrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I fully agree this is absolutely needed - many of us have dozen or more pst folders we want access to messages in and one by one importing is not quick either due to all the steps. This is a major shortcoming of the software, especially considering that
 my windows 8 has crashed outlook to the point tech support said it needed to be reinstalled - I am now importing my pst files for the 3rd time, one by one, in just a few times.

<p>Jason, Thank you for sharing your experience as well as your vote for MS to include this ability as a feature in any future "upgrades" or "corrections" to Outlook 2013.
</p>

</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am sorry to report that no one seems to have the ability or perhaps the interest in developing VBS code to accomplish&nbsp;this task of importing multiple pst files simultaneously.&nbsp; Thus, as we approach the time when many XP users will want to upgrade,
 we may hear many cries of pain regarding the absence of this feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David<br />

            Hugo, Thank you for your suggestion. I did not think of this option; consequently, I&nbsp;did each one separately to insure that I had each pst file as a separate folder in Outlook 13.&nbsp;Because all of the currently suggested workarounds&nbsp;are&nbsp;time-consuming and
 tedious,&nbsp;I think that the correct solution is for Microsoft to incorporate&nbsp;the feature to import multiple data files simultaneously into its future versions of Outlook.&nbsp; David

            Importing is rarely the best way to get data into Outlook when you have PST. &nbsp;Importing loses data. &nbsp;Just open each one with File&gt;Open. &nbsp;Certainly faster than importing each one.

            Brian, When I received feedback on November 12, 2013 from the Microsoft Forum moderator telling me that the desired feature was not available, I completed the process by importing each pst file separately (one at a time).&nbsp;Consequently, I slowly but surely&nbsp;resolved
 my problem. David&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Allow Any Display Scaling Factor -- Not Just 25&#37; Increments</h2>
                    It would be nice if we could scale the display by any increment instead of in just 25% increments at Settings | System | Display. &nbsp;On my monitor, 100% scaling is just a tad to small. &nbsp;But, 125% is just too big. &nbsp;Something in between would be nice.
