            Hi.<br />
<br />
Please check if the Workbook Views on the Views tab is set to "Normal".&nbsp; As soon as this is set to "Normal", freeze panes option should be available to you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            Slow access database is speeded up by changing the directory name of the data server</h2>
                    I have a split Access database with the front end running locally and the data held on a NAS box for multiple access.&nbsp; This runs well but will suddenly slow down.&nbsp; By experiment I have found that if I change the name of the directory holding the data on
 the NAS box and re link the tables on the front end database the speed returns.&nbsp; Strangely if I return the directory to the original name it will again run slow.&nbsp; Experience would suggest that I will have to do this procedure every couple on months to maintain
 the database speed.&nbsp; Has anyone got an explanation and preferably a cure.

<p>Depending on the NAS you can play with oplocks settings for the backed folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are your linked tables using UNC paths?&nbsp; If not, switch to UNC instead of mapped drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you compacted the database, does that help at all?</p>

 on the upgrade. So my older PC gets Windows 10 on it and it both ruins slower and bugs my wife because of the new interface. So I downgrade back to Windows 7 and now i am getting "unlicensed product" notices using any office product. &nbsp;Yeah...</p>
<p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 LTE static IP setting</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some problem to set the static IP in my Lumia 640 LTE. Exactly there is no function for this?</p>
<p>It this serious? I think it's a bad joke. Really guys on the other phones with other operation system there is no problem with these settings. I checked both so I know. But when I tried on my Lumia. I spend almost 2 hours to find something.
</p>
<p>The results: </p>
<p>- Maybe there is a program, what you can buy for some Euro, it will work or not.
</p>
<p>- The other way to pray for an update what will solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can you help me (us) in this case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>

            <p>I have just purchased a Lumia 640 LTE. I am trying to connect to my home wifi. I can see my router in wifi settings but when I write my password and connect "next' I get the error message that I cannot connect to my wifi and try again later. This has been
 happening over 2 days now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen on this forum that the problem can be solved by turning off the manual static IP, but that doesn't appear in my settings. I don't have that ability. I keep trying to connect to wifi without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the problem and how can I fix it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before my new Lumia 640 I had a Lumia 635, which did not have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lumia 640 is running Windows 8.1 update 2. I can't update the phone as I can't connect to wifi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>On the subscriptions page I see Microsoft Office and it only says that I can use a trial or buy Office. I need a product key to download it, but where do I find that? I got some kind of code when first signing up through the invitation but that doesn't seem
 to be the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on? How do I install Office on my computer?</p>

            With the Office 365 subscription, you can download Office in up to 5 devices. To do this you can do the following:
<br />
<br />1-Log in into your account from the computer that you want and install. Check the below link:
<br />
<br />Install:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />2- You can share your subscription with your family. Check the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-your-Office-365-Home-subscription-with-up-to-four-people-b389b9ce-3ae3-4a82-9017-39d79972fcba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow this link to activate your Office:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activate-office-2016-for-mac-7f6646b1-bb14-422a-9ad4-a53410fcefb2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activa...</a>
<br />
<br />Think about how many devices you want them to install on and discuss it with them. As the owner of the Office 365 Home subscription, you can deactivate any install from&nbsp;<a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1535107684&amp;rver=6.7.6643.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL&amp;wreply=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fauth%2Fcomplete-signin%3Fru%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccount.microsoft.com%252Fservices%252Foffice%252Fsharing&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=292666&amp;lw=1&amp;fl=easi2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;...</a>
<br />
<br />if you find you're running out, but it's a good idea to set expectations up front. Learn more about this and what to do if someone doesn't receive an invitation in the How to manage who you've shared with, invitations, and installs section.&nbsp;

            <p>In Windows 8, there are no longer two separate versions of the browser in the start menu as was the case in Windows 7.&nbsp; However, the browser still retains both its 32-bit and 64-bit modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To choose which mode to use, you will have to take a different approach. Enabling/disabling it&nbsp;is associated with security zones, just the way the security settings and Protected Mode are. This means you can set 32-bit mode for the Internet zone while using
 64-bit mode for your local intranet, or you could use 32-bit mode for trusted sites for maximum
<u>compatibility</u> and 64-bit mode for untrusted sites for maximum security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:<br />
</strong><i>Notice that the "about IE10" is the same whether you open iexplorer.exe from the "<u>Program Files"</u> or "<u>Program Files (x86)"</u> location</i>.

<p>Once you have chosen your preferred settings for all the security zones, simply restart Internet Explorer. You will now be able to browse the zones in the corresponding 32-bit or 64-bit modes. This new method seems to be a welcome change considering it removes
 the necessity of having two versions of the same browser installed, while still granting access to both versions.</p>

    <title>Main Form &#38; Subform Continuous Movement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher mwaanga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Main Form &#38; Subform Continuous Movement</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Hi</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Is it possible to have the main form and subform work like a continuous form single form so that it bocomes easier to capture data or navigate using a Tab key. Currently I have a form linked
 properly with the subform and working efficiently , but when I’m capturing data on the main form, the subform is hidden behind the main form , to capture data on it you have to scrow down to locate it ,though it is still fine , but I’m looking at the final
 user , someone may think that after capturing data on the main form&nbsp; that is the end of it all since the subform is not properly visible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Example form 1(Main Form) &amp; form 2(Sum) are supposed to be moving together as a single form like the way the main report &amp; sub report move, one might think that there are no links between the two because they
 move as a single report.</span></p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is impossible! A subform is embedded on the main form so there is no way for it to be hidden behind the main form. It is possible to create a form larger than the screen that would require the user to scroll down to see the subform. But that's not hidden
 behind the main form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have created a form that big, then I suggest you redesign it to use a Tab control. I almost never make forms that require scrolling to see different parts of the form. Instead I use a Tab control to organize my controls into logical groupings and/or
 embed subforms onto a Tab page. This way the user sees the tabs and knows there are more parts to the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forms and Reports are different. I'm not sure what you mean by "moving together". A subform is linked to the main form on a key field. When you change records in the main form, the record(s) in the subform change to match based on the linked field.&nbsp;</p>

            Un fortunately you cannot assign the end key to other functions. Check in Start - Settings - Buttons for other alternatives.

<p><span><span>I did actually copy paste the text and image into Word, then as you say saved the web image to a directory and then inserted it into the Word document.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This method works but is tedious if I have to save each image and then insert it into a document.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I friend did a copy and paste from the same web page into his MS Word 2010 and the image appeared. This indicates the web page is not protected so maybe it’s my MS Word 2013 that
 has the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My friend’s MS Word 2010 advanced settings seem to be equal to my MS Word 2013 ones.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I did a repair on my MS Word 2013 and that did not change anything.</span></span></p>

<strong>5 Days back i have updated my windows 10 technical preview from build 9847 to build 9860 and it worked fine for only 1 night</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>a</strong><strong>nd later that day when i turned on my pc it is reverted back to the original state when u wipe all the data and install new os..</strong><br />
<br />
and windows has created a temp user also ..so when i shutdown or restart every time the files i paste on the desktop or in the c drive will be wiped and all will be in the temp folder.. i have searched for an hour to locate them and i recovered my data but
 .. as of now it created a &nbsp;<strong>user temp</strong> and when i login everytime it just takes me to that user and the data i store on the desktop will be wiped and stored in the
<strong>smart guy user </strong>which is my original user..and i need to take them back from there,..please remove this bug and with is process the start up is taking more than
<strong>5mins</strong>...and not only files all the wallpaper settings,time,sounds and all are going back except windows defender and windows update files....</p>
<p><br />

    <title>8000ffff when attempting to download apps after phone migration - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            8000ffff when attempting to download apps after phone migration</h2>
                    I have just migrated from a Lumia 920 to a 1020. Everything came down correctly except a handful of apps which display as follows.
<br />
<br />
<i>Downloading application<br />
Attention required. Tap here. </i><br />
<br />
Upon which I receive<br />
<br />
<i>There is a problem completing your request. Try again later. Error code: 8000ffff</i><br />
<br />
I read in another thread that someone fixed this by cancelling, and re downloading from the Windows phone app pages. Anyone had any other experiences with this? I don't feel like I should have to use a workaround for a simple phone migration.
<br />
<br />
The rest of the migration went very well BTW, all my settings transferred over perfectly, SkyDrive is there of course, only thing that needs modification is tile configuration.
<br />
<br />

            <p>From my experience this happens with all settings apps from the manufacturer. In the Nokia case: access point, display, glance, extras+info, audio, etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply cancel these downloads and download them separately if they are not already on the device. Because if they are on the device, you should get update notifications within 24 hours and then it will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully Microsoft can handle these special apps better in the next version of the backup/restore routine..</p>

            Unless you use an Exchange account with Outlook, you don't have an Out of Office Assistant.&nbsp; That's a function of Exchange.&nbsp; You could create a rule to emulate the OOA (see this:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to emulate the Out of
 Office Assistant in Microsoft Outlook</a>), but you'll need to leave Outlook going the entire time you're gone and it will reply exactly once to each unique sender during that time.

<h2>            Locked out of Outlook account</h2>
                    <p>HELP ME... I'm locked out from getting in to outlook account because forgot password. Can't remember it at all. I try 'forgot password' and that doesn't work. Another suggestion was to make a reset password disk, but doesn't that only work when you have
 access to computer. The lock out is this, it's girlfriends computer and she is the only administrator to it. I'am BF who should be administrator because of this ongoing problem. In the past we've had to install a new harddrive because of this same problem.
 This is the computer I'm on now. I have access to some tools and downloads, the rest need administrator clearance. Any info from anyone out there who may of had similar problem and is reading this feel free to give your suggestion to me if you will. Many thanks
 ahead of time.. Don't tell me I'm f....d,please, I already know it....</p>

<p>I've just finished a chat session with Microsoft about this. I had to chat with three advisors before getting to the "known" issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a recently introduced "Feature Limitation" i.e. Microsoft have removed something that was working perfectly well before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It affects IMAP mail accounts. You have to change to a POP account in order to be able to see Categories in the Navigation Pane. Pain is the more appropriate word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem with Office 365 v16.20 in my case. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 v16.9 is quite happily displaying categories on the IMAP accounts, on another machine.</p>

<h2>            Word Program Stops Working-Menus Blank</h2>
                    When working in Word, the program will just stop working. &nbsp;All the menus go completely blank i.e. white &nbsp;(not greyed out) to the point where there are no options visible. &nbsp;I am forced to do a "forced quit" just to exit the program because there is no visible
 menu to "close" with. &nbsp;Even the error message is completely blanked out, so I have no idea what the program is saying the problem is. &nbsp;Also, sometimes square boxes appear in my document at the same time that the menus are blanking out. &nbsp;This is very problematic
 because I lose my document and my most recent changes to that document. Is there a way to fix this?!
<div>Thanks!</div>

            The "Word 2003" style set is intended to make the document's styles like those in the default Normal.dot template in Word 2003. The changes that it makes in the
<b>Normal style</b> are those you listed -- the 12 pt font size, Single line spacing, and 0 pt space after paragraphs. It also changes most of the other styles in some way, for example:<br />
<br />
<b>Heading 1</b> changes from 14 pt bold, 24 pt before and 0 pt after, color Accent 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 16 pt bold, 12 pt before and 3 pt after, color Automatic<br />
<br />
<b>Heading 2</b> changes from 13 pt bold, 10 pt before and 0 pt after, color Accent 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 14 pt bold italic, 12 pt before and 3 pt after, color Automatic<br />
<br />
There is one thing that doesn't change in Word 2010 when you apply the Word 2003 style set: The font of each style (Calibri, Cambria, etc.) in Word 2010 is determined by the theme you select on the Page Layout tab of the ribbon. The default fonts in real Word
 2003 documents are always Times New Roman in the Normal style and Arial in the Heading styles. To get that in Word 2010, besides choosing the Word 2003 style set, you would have to click the Fonts button on the Page Layout tab and choose the Office Classic
 font set.<br />

            <blockquote>Your thorough, specific answers are very much appreciated, Jay, as always. So I assume Word's margins are also not affected by a style set but rather are controlled by normal.dot or normal.dotm?
<div>Also, I noted that under Change Styles, Fonts, Built-in, there are two sets of fonts listed for each set. For example, Office 2 has Calibri on the first line and Cambria on the second and the icons show and upper- and lowercase "A." What is the significance
 of showing two fonts.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
</blockquote>
<br />
The 2 fonts you mention are part of the "Theme" concept introduced in Office 2007.&nbsp; Really short intro to themes, if you limit your formatting changes to theme related options, when you change the theme, all of the formatting will change with it.&nbsp; So, if you
 limit font customization selections to those 2 fonts you mentioned (first one is for heading, second for body) then when you change the theme, the new theme will be reflected through the whole document.<br />
<br />
Take a look at a color selection drop down, like the Font color or Background drop down color. At the top you may see the "Automatic" color (not in all drop downs, inconsistent implementation), then the set of "Theme Colors" and below that the old school "Standard
 colors" and below that the custom color selection.&nbsp; So when you are applying color, if you select from the rather blah "Theme" color choices rather than the "Standard" or custom colors, the next time you change the theme, your color selection will change to
 match.<br />

</span>&gt;<br />
<br />
<p><span>Have you ever selected just a few words in a paragraph and then applied a paragraph style, only to have the style apply as if it were a character style—in other words, just to the selected text?
 If so, you were using a linked style.</span></p>
<p><span>In Word 2010, you see this additional style type in the
Styles pane and as an option when you create
styles through the dialog box.
Linked styles are just paragraph styles that you can also apply as character styles (that is, apply only the font formatting from the style to just part of a paragraph).</span></p>
<p><span>For Windows users, linked styles were first exposed in Word 2007. Before that, you could use built-in linked styles as both paragraph and character styles (such as the styles Heading 1–9),
 but there was no visual indication in Word of which styles were linked, and you could not create your own linked styles. In Word for Mac, this is still the case with Word 2011.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Styles pane, notice that paragraph styles display a paragraph symbol, and character styles display the letter a to represent a character. In Word 2010, linked styles display an icon that includes both the character
 and paragraph symbol.</span></p>
<p><span>Nearly half of all built-in paragraph styles in Word 2010 and Word 2011 are actually linked styles.</span></p>
<div>
<span>
<hr />
</span></div>
<p>
<b><i><span>Note:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>One more little style-related tip for Word 2010 VBA users: if you check your document styles by type in VBA, you’ll see 93 paragraph styles as noted earlier. If you check the number of linked styles, it will indicate
 zero. Word 2010 VBA includes a constant for the linked style type but recognizes those styles as paragraph styles.</span></p>

<p>Did you repair Office 2016, before you started meddling with the Profile? and why did you delete the Profile and not simply create a new one?</p>
<p>In outlook.com accessed via your web browser, in settings have you enabled two step authentication?</p>
<p>Assuming you are using Win10, can you add the outlook.com mail account to the Win10 Mail app using the same credentials?</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think is a problema with Office 2016, because it happens me on two different computers, but with O365 servers. It's the third time in a year that I have issues with my account and apps, doesn't matter to be PC or Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same happened to me with my Android device, wich was keeping asking for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I don't have enabled two step authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>It's so frustrating, that I think Microsoft is not doing it's job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another weekend with the same issue. After starting working last monday, today happens the same, without doing nothing different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one hour after opening outlook in my PC, and working fine, it started to ask for password. And doesn't accept the one provided, although is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What int he hell is happening with outlook.com accounts and Outlook software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone explain what the issue is and how to get rid off it?</p>

<p>An outlook.com mail account is not the same as a 365 mail account, and outlook.com uses its own servers.</p>
<p>You have not said what Win version you are using, and if win10 if you add the mail account to the win10 mail app whether that also gives problems.</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Win10 and Win7, with the same results: asking for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say an outlook.com is not the same as a 365 account. Well, I understand. And I have to say that I own a domain that is managed with, well was, because Microsoft decided to remove the option, with Microsoft live domains. So, my account is like a o365
 account, although free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using win10 mail app, but Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, since 17:00 CET that is working fine, withouth doing anything to my profile. Seems clear that there are issues with Microsoft servers, almos from my point of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Bug report&#58; Word 2011 changes font to MS Mincho when capitalizing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eugene dae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug report&#58; Word 2011 changes font to MS Mincho when capitalizing Russian letters</h2>
                    When "Auto capitalization" is used with Russian letters, Word 2011 changes font of the capitalized letter to ＭＳ 明朝 (Body Asian) -- also known as MS Mincho.<br />
<br />
<b>Steps to reproduce:</b><br />
<br />
1) Open Word 2011. <br />
<br />
2) Type a Russian word in lowercase letters:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62e11481-20de-4c5b-8586-095874a0e02e" /><br />
<br />
(The word is "привет" = hello). <br />
<br />
3) Hit Enter on your keyboard. <br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f59e575-5ed7-4ea0-81e9-cfb91edcd1b2" /><br />
<br />
<b>(Note the font of the first letter).</b><br />
<br />
Yes, this is a <b>serious bug</b> because it looks ugly as **** and is a major inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Some people may not always notice the substitution because MS Mincho vaguely resembles Cambria. But if your default font is Calibri or Helvetica, it becomes hard to miss.<br />
<br />
In Preferences, unticking "Match font with keyboard" does <b>not</b> help.<br />
Fixing fonts (and resolving duplicates) in Font Book.app does <b>not</b> help.<br />
Deleting MS Mincho from /Library/Fonts/Microsoft does <b>not</b> help (without MS Mincho, Word substitutes the first letters with rectangles).<br />
<br />
This issue does not occur in any other non-Microsoft applications for me.<br />
<br />
I can reproduce this issue in the Russian version of Word 2011. I use Word 2011 14.3.7 (the latest available as of writing).<br />
<br />
I've been able to reproduce this issue consistently on several independent Mac computers.<br />

            Hold down the Power On/Off key and get your system back under control.
<div><br />
<div>Then go to your Time Machine backup and restore your system to prior of installing Mavericks.</div>

            I'm taking a different approach from Rich. To me, there's no reason why a working copy of Office ought to fail when you update to Mavericks.

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I meant the Proxy Address, not just the characters.</p>
<p>There was a Legacy Community thread that posted there was no limit how many addresses. If I remember correctly there was one who has 200 - 800 proxy addresses. If there is an article reference how many is the maximum or if someone was tried as many that
 can be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, you are correct. Theoretically, we should be able to add about 200 aliases to an Office 365 account, since there isn’t any document saying that Microsoft restricts the maximum number of aliases we can add.
</p>
<p>And I’ve tested it with my Office 365 accounts. I can add 200 aliases to my account without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

            <p>Hi Toby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS can provide a documentation or article about this so anyone that come across can reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be all for now.</p>
<p>
