<h2>            Audio out of sync in video Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Hey, I am running standard Window 10 on 2 different PCs and I have for several years made my own video from an AVCHD video camera. I use both Adode Premiere
 Elements and Pinnacle Studio to make the videos and usually use Windows Media Player to show the result. It had worked perfect under Windows XP earlier, but under Windows 8 and 10 audio starts to be out of sync of pictures. Up to 5 sec delay between sound
 and picture by Windows Media Player on PC 2, and in perfect sync on PC 1 where I have created the movie. If I use VCL Media Player instead of Windows Media Player on PC 2, there is perfect sync between audio and picture.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>What can I do to correct Windows 10 or Windows Media Player on PC 2 to get it right?</span></span></p>

                    When I double click a folder, a search window automatically opens rather than the usual Windows Explorer view that shows the contents of the folder.&nbsp; In order to view the contents of the folder, I have to right click it and select open, then I can see
 the folder contents.&nbsp; What setting can I change to stop the search window from opening, and have the regular windows explorer view show up?&nbsp; Oh, when I right click the folder, the Search option is bolded, but the Open option is regular.

                    I bought my surface pro 4 about 4 weeks ago. Everything was working great until I noticed that the light on the charger stopped flashing or even turning on at all. I have tried different outlets but that did not solve the problem. Is it the charger or
 is it my surface? What can I do to fix or replace the charger?

    <title>Windows Home Edition SP2 Compatible with Windows Vista Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> to microsoft or not to microsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Home Edition SP2 Compatible with Windows Vista Home Edition&#63;  IE7 info too please&#63; Ipod&#63;</h2>
                    

<p><span>Dear folks&nbsp;- are you able to help me please?&nbsp; I have&nbsp;five questions!&nbsp; In some way or the other they all relate to Microsoft - the answer
 to these questions will assist me in deciding whether I should purchase&nbsp;the desired products.&nbsp; I'd appreciate&nbsp;all the advice I am given, which&nbsp;will&nbsp;aid me with my decision. Thank you.<br />
<br />
Q1.&nbsp;&nbsp;My DELL home PC (Spec: 250GB SATA Hard Drive - 160GB SATA Core Dual&nbsp;Processor 1024MB&nbsp;DDR400 2x512) has Windows XP SP2 operating system. I wish to add&nbsp;to this and am looking in to a&nbsp;hi-spec graphic media Laptop from DELL, the Studio 15/17 range,&nbsp;that is
 currently offering Microsoft Vista Premium version operating system&nbsp;I think, upgrade available to Vista Ultimate for a pricy £90 extra!&nbsp; Anyway, having researched this further i believe that both of these operating systems are not compatible with each other!&nbsp;
 Which is worrying me...is this true?<br />
<br />
Q2.&nbsp; In addition, I would be looking to&nbsp;network both my PC and Laptop, for many reasons...from document and 'printer/scanner' sharing through to videos, photographs etc&nbsp;plus&nbsp;other software accessibility.&nbsp; I am told that this won't be possible as both operating
 systems in question are different and most of all I have been provided with the Home Editions, which apparently doesn't have the 'networking' service for home computers/laptops.&nbsp; Is this true? Will I have to get a Data Transfer Cable for this? And what really
 would that do?&nbsp; I want to buy an all-in-one printer which is wireless but I belive that it will only be able to speak wirelessly with my laptop (which would have a built in wireless facility) and not my PC?!&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;want to have to own two printers, one for
 my PC and the other for my&nbsp;laptop, so what's&nbsp;the&nbsp;best way forward?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Q3.&nbsp; Correspondingly, I say this because I think it is related - I'm going to get Broadband for home use (yes, I am still on Dial-up - pathetic I know...long story!), so this would be Wireless Broadband.&nbsp; For this I have to establish if my ISP Broadband Router
 supplier would support&nbsp;&nbsp;several units, as in Laptop, PC and X-box in my home.&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; For this will I have to also buy a PC Wireless adapter?<br />
<br />
Q4.&nbsp; Furthermore, I apparently need Windows XP 3 for my newly bought iPod nano!&nbsp; I have Win XP SP2 on my main PC, how shall I upgrade it?&nbsp; And will I have to back up my system and data?&nbsp; Again, how will this impact on my first three questions and compatibility
 with Windows Vista&nbsp;operating system in&nbsp;my laptop and&nbsp;Wireless Broadband service?<br />
<br />
Q5. My IE7 hasn't worked for a while, it just stopped letting me browse recently...without interfering with it at all, I am currently using AOL's&nbsp;built in browser!&nbsp; Not sure how to rectify this problem, I have managed to find out that two directory link library
 files are missing, eg. 'ie cont.dll' and 'ie cont lc.dll'&nbsp;are these the culprits?&nbsp; What should I do, uninstall and re-install? I would lose everything&nbsp;I have saved in my&nbsp;'favourite' folders for the last three years doing this! :-(<br />
<br />
I know that they are a handful of questions above but I would appreciate your response and thank you for your time in reading this&nbsp;long post.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Best wishes<br />

            Q1 &amp; Q2:&nbsp; The Dell tech was either an idiot, or was trying to sell you another computer.&nbsp; ;)<br />
I have quite the mix of machines here:&nbsp; XP Pro, Vista Home Premium, Vista Ultimate, Windows 7 Ultimate (RC), Windows Home Server, and the occasional XP Home machine that wanders thru.&nbsp; They all talk to each other just fine.<br />
NIC:&nbsp; Take a look at the back of the desktop, look for what looks like an oversized phone jack with 2 LEDs on it.&nbsp; That's the LAN port (NIC) - connect an Ethernet (AKA Cat 5e) cable between this and a LAN port on the router that you're getting.<br />
<br />
Q4:&nbsp; Check the Dell website (in the support &amp; drivers section) for available drivers.&nbsp; Easiest way to find the right ones is to enter your service tag # (rather than the model #) there.&nbsp; If there's nothing newer than you already have listed, run Windows Update,
 and look in the 'optional updates, hardware' section.<br />
Vista upgrades can be dicey sometimes, especially if you're already having issues.&nbsp; If you do want to do that, I'd suggest a clean install (rather than an in-place upgrade) to avoid issues.&nbsp;
<br />

Q5:&nbsp; Running those 'problem' sites in Compatibility Mode (in IE8) would likely have fixed the issue you were having:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/features/easier.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/features/easier.aspx</a>&nbsp;, and click on the Compatibility Mode link on&nbsp;the left for details.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Renee,</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using the Community Forums for Vista.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Normally, I would break up a post like this into separate posts but I think we can handle all of these in one post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If we need to, we'll break them apart later.</span></p>
<p><span>During this process, the link below is your new best friend.
</span></p>
<p><span>Check EVERYTHING against the database to make sure it is compatible.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Vista Compatibility List</span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/</span>
</a></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, Q1. They should work fine together. Yes, there are differences between the systems and sometimes XP and Vista don't talk well. This is usually caused by the hardware that connects
 them not being fully Vista compatible. When it is a software issue, that is easily fixed. There are plenty of helpful posts here about such things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Q2. Same answer. If either both computers have wireless NICs in them OR you connect to an access point that can wirelessly “see” the printer they will work fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Q3. We can't answer that. It's up to your ISP as far as what they support. Typically though, your ISP will provide you with a Modem\router that connects to your ISP and all of your devices
 will connect to that device. PC, Xbox or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span>Q4. Check to see if the Nano works first. If it doesn't, just download SP3. It free. I would always back up before doing any major system updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Q5. I'd chunk IE7 altogether. MS did a great job with IE8. Just install it.</span></p>
<p><span>If you can't, you do need to reinstall 7 at least. If this doesn't help I would post back over it the IE forum.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please let us know if we can do anything else for you.</span></p>

<h3> shadedarkan  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;You have been logged on with a temporary profile&#39; Win 7 Pro Domain Account</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 2008 R2 domain with three client machines added. Two of the clients have no problems, but we recently got the third client machine back from Acer. This machine shipped with Windows 7 Home Premium. The user who sits at this computer had created
 a profile in the interim before it was setup on the network to do work. A few days later I upgraded the OS to Windows 7 Professional through Windows Anytime Upgrade. I then deleted the local user accounts, with the exception of admin. I added the computer
 to the domain and logged in as the domain administrator to verify everything worked. The user then logged in and the account was fine. The user logged off and I logged back in as the domain admin to finish some updates and I noticed that windows had not deleted
 the user files when I deleted the local user accounts. I went ahead and checked that the users were deleted from User's and Groups then deleted the profile folders so there would only be one profile with the user's name. Now, when the user logs on who uses
 this machine, the same user as a few sentences ago, they get the temporary profile.</p>
<p>There is no profile folder under Users for this user so there are no folders to rename or delete from registry. Windows will not create a new one.</p>
<p>I have taken the computer off the domain and re-added to no effect. </p>
<p>No other user or admin accounts have this problem when logging in to this computer.
</p>
<p>The affected user does not have this problem logging in to other computers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*Edit: Much to my dismay, the only thing that I found that could fix this was to delete the user's domain account and re-create it. Deleting a user's profile folder on a client machine was never an issue in a Windows 2003 domain. I don't know what the problem
 is in 2008.<br />

            Denni,<br />
Stop errors are usually caused by a faulty or incompatible software driver, and /or hardware.<br />
In this situation, I would add to Jack's recommendation, by suggesting you visit Nvidia's website and downloading the latest drivers for your graphics card.<br />
Next thing to do is to run a memory diagnostics check. Below are the steps for this:<br />
<p>Memory Diagnostics Tool</p>
<p>If the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool does not run automatically, you can run it manually.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Memory Diagnostics Tool by clicking the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>
<span>pearl, clicking </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Control</span>
<span>, clicking </span><span style="font-weight: bold">System</span>
<span>, clicking </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Administrative</span>
<span>, and then clicking </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Memory</span>
<span>.</span> <span>
‌</span> <span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span>
</li><li><span>Choose between the two options for when to run the Memory Diagnostics Tool:</span>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>You can restart your computer and run the tool immediately.</span>
</li><li><span>You can restart your computer and run the tool later.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>Apply the following options:</p>
<p>Press <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
F1</span> for Options:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Test Mix:</span> Basic, Standard, Extended</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Cache:</span> Default, On, Off</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Pass Count (0 - 99):</span> 2</p>
<p>Use the following keys to navigate:</p>
<p>TAB = Next</p>
<p>F10 = Apply</p>
<p>ESC = Cancel</p>

<h2>            Surface 3 running windows 10 - update problems</h2>
                    <p>My surface 10 was running Ok prior to the February 2018 major update</p>
<p>I initially lost all typing ability via the Surface 3 type cover</p>
<p>Proceeded to work through all of the solutions offered by other members</p>
<p>None worked including a full reset (data retained but on partitioned drive)</p>
<p>Tried type cover on another unit - worked - thus assumed not type cover</p>
<p>Tried alternative type cover on my surface 3 - worked for initial fitting until restart, - assumed probably software</p>
<p>Tried in surface docking station - all fine - assumed not contacts so likely software</p>
<p>Resetting software caused significant home networking issues relating to "network credentials" on 2 other machine. Now all resolved on other machines but surface 3 remains problemmatic</p>
<p>Can sometimes get working properly if adjust "password protection sharing" on and off and saving (leaving off) but goes again following sleep or restart</p>
<p>Cannot save file to other network folders due to "not having permission" despite everything being set ok</p>
<p>Have used "driver booster 5" to ensure all drivers are current and "winfix10" cannot find any issues</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a clue PLEASE</p>

            Brian,
<br />I really think that the only option at this point is to back up files you want to keep and use the official downloadable recovery drive to completely repartition, wipe and reimage. Using third party driver finders only complicates issues (something we've found historically to be the case). 
<br />
<br />Note that we've found some cases where SP4 covers worked when SP3 covers did not and vice versa - only SP3 original typecovers worked. This would indicate some kind of firmware issue (and Microsoft has unfortunately not commented on these typecover issues). 
<br />
<br />1. To complicate things, if you are on 16299.248 and are totally up to date through Windows Update,  the update KB4074588  has caused USB and typecovers to stop working (this is a different issue)
<br />
<br />Try to uninstall this update.
<br />
<br />To uninstall an update, go to: 
<br />
<br />Windows Settings &gt; Updates &amp; Security &gt; View Installed Update History &gt; Uninstall Updates &gt;  
<br />
<br />Select the KB4074588  update and click "Uninstall". 
<br />
<br />If that update is not uninstallable, try this:
<br />
<br />If you can use the on-screen keyboard via a working touchscreen, follow these steps to restore your USB functionality: 
<br />	1. In the search box on the taskbar, type cmd. 
<br />	2. Right-click (or tap and hold) Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />	3. In the Command Prompt window, type the command listed below and press ENTER.
<br />
<br />dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17 
<br />	4. Restart Windows.
<br />
<br />2. The above may not fix the issue, in which case here is the process to do a full reimage from a recovery USB - 
<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a> and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-
<br />
<br />To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose Just remove my files.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).

<br />Hope this helps (and sorry if it is bad news, please don't shoot the messenger).

<div>I don't know what you used to partition the drive. All I can suggest is to get</div>

<div>- use a 16GB US formatted FAT32 - and do a clean generic install using the</div>

<div>SurfacePro3_Win10_15063_1801002_3.msi (you can do this with another computer</div>

<p>Everything done according to instructions</p>
<p>Everything now working EXCLUDING the type cover</p>
<p>Checked hidden devices in device manager and no sign of type cover in keyboard or firmware</p>
<p>Only issues that could indicate something is that all file folders are dated as of yesterday (when install was done) except PERFLOGS which are dated 13/12/2017 - this folder contains a sub folder called ADMIN which is empty inc no hidden files</p>
<p>The other point is that the automatic naming has given the computer the name DESKTOP-HPFxxxx&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Brian,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;Everything now working EXCLUDING the type cover </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are a few SP3 customers (and a whole lot of SP4 customers) who have non</div>
<div>working typecovers. This happened for them after some update (not the same</div>
<div>update). If a complete reimage does not fix, then there is NO fix other than an</div>
<div>exchange. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft has not commented on this issue. The outsourced support folks in this</div>
<div>forum ask folks to check for updates and reimage, etc., but this does not fix</div>
<div>the issue. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The reason I though reimaging would help YOU is because you stated</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;Tried alternative type cover on my surface 3 - worked for initial fitting until restart, - assumed probably software </div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Tried in surface docking station - all fine - assumed not contacts so likely software </div>

<p><span>The

</span><span>It</span><span> can take place of the CD ROM as a “<b>storage device”

<h2>            system32 is having problems&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop had been having problems with opening Steam and a few other games when I try to open one of the games it says something about GLU32.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it sontains a error. I tried to reinstall my game and it didnt work
 still. when i try to open steam it says Could not load model 'bin/vgui2_s.dll. This started happening after I installed all Important updates and all optional updates, even then not all of them installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this, this bothers me on a huge scale since I'm a gamer&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>====Update==== 9/22/2014</p>
<p>I had my step father look at my laptop and he found out that I had the wrong version of windows installed. &nbsp;Recently I got my laptop fixed from a hard drive problem and handed my laptop off to one of my friends who said he could fix it. He ended up fixing
 it up to the point where I updated it, But I'm the kind of kid where if something doesn't bother me then I wont do anything about it so I still have the sticker of my actual windows operation system witch is Windows 7 home premium 64bit. So if anyone has a
 link to somewhere that I can download it then use my code to install it would help. My step father said it should.</p>

    <title>Verify my Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> klaro-20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Verify my Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>I work on two identical computers, main one at home, the other at work.</p>
<p>Both under the same Microsoft Account (same email and account password)</p>
<p>Now - The one at work asks me to Verify my account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email address shown is wrong (must be an old/first try one) ... and ... of course I'm at work and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the phone # shown / registered (last digits) is my home number. But I'm at work - at the work computer.</p>
<p>So - I cannot pick up the phone and receive/type in the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Sunburst.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you click the link "I dont have any of these" so you get to submit another email or phone to text?  The only problem if you change these during this process is that you cannot access your Online Account banking and other information but still access your email, OneDrive, etc.  
<br />
<br />Make sure to always have the phone number be your cell and the email to be the latest.  You can change the account email like this:  <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/micro...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>since these are two computers and everything is fine one the home one - will I screw</p>
<p>everything up by changing things from the work one?</p>
<p>The email shown is incorrect...? If I change it will it delete/change my account/email and everything</p>
<p>at the home machine?</p>
<p>The two machines sipposed to be synced - both machines show in my account details.</p>
<p>The phone number shows the home one since I verified the home machine from there.</p>
<p>I don't have a cell phone.</p>

            It shows in the link to Change MS Account email address how to change the email address by adding the new email address, verify it via an email to that address, then set it as Primary to replace the old email address.  Then it can be removed.  
<br />
<br />I would do this from home when you can do the phone verification.  
<br />
<br />Just follow the steps here: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/micro...</a> 
<br />
<br />Ask back if you get stuck.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>thanks for the reply</p>
<p>It seems awfully complicated.</p>
<p>Just a quick refresher to be sure it's clear what my problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two identical machines (Win10, 64 bit, latest version1803)</p>
<p>One at home - one at work</p>
<p>The&nbsp; one at home was set up first, so account was established from there.</p>
<p>(it was verified and I haven't received any verification requests)</p>
<p>The one at work was then setup under the same account = in my account it shows BOTH</p>
<p>machines.</p>
<p>Now-when asked to verify (work) it has all the saved credentials of the home machine.</p>
<p>Therefore I cannot receive the phone call at work or get an email at work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- why can't I verify from home for both machines? Yet I don't see any verify option</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in my account under the work machine. (the home machine is verified ok)</p>
<p>- do I really need to verify? … any drawbacks if not? .. just forget about it?</p>
<p>-&nbsp;I came home at lunch and had the code on my answering machine … can I take it to
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; work and still use it to verify that machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>since I'm afraid to change the email/account name, which would have me to set up</p>
<p>everything again, can't I, as in the suggested article ...</p>
<p>- just add new / additional phone number?..(my work phone-number)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; would it allow me to do the verification of the work machine and keep that number&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; as a secondary number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            Geez, I thought I made it simple since it's a convoluted process to begin with! 
<br />
<br /> Everyone has a cell phone now so they expect that you can use it to verify the account at whatever PC you're at, If not use an email that's still in existence.  I've never even heard from anyone who signs in with a defunct email for their MS account.  So that's what makes it complicated.
<br />
<br />So I gave you an official tutorial from Microsoft that show how to add a new MS account email as an alias, designate it the Primary Account so it becomes your new MS Account, then later remove your old account that doesn't even exist any more!   And you're afraid of losing what?

    <title>Bios Hijacked, Certs Replaced Even on Clean Install - Unable to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> once i was blind  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bios Hijacked, Certs Replaced Even on Clean Install - Unable to Install Updates</h2>
                    <p>I have an ongoing problem and this new PC is only 3 weeks old. &nbsp;I've spent time in the phone with HP Technical Support, did clean reinstall and the same problems were immediately present again.<br />
<br />
My PC is compromised as were the last 10+ brand new PCs as well as even more Windows / Android phones. &nbsp; I need some kind of help as I cannot continue buying new electronics and have begun to realize my efforts in simply replacing compromised electronics are
 effort in futility. &nbsp;By now the process of infection seems to be so streamlined that I seem to be defenseless against the attacks. &nbsp;Over time I've watched and noticed many different 'ruses' but whatever is in place now is by far the most effective means of
 hijacking my electronics. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've done a great deal of studying and I believe that - well I am sure of the source but the ways and means seem to be knowing my GPS location, sending a 'payload' using NMAP or Insecure.org type hacking means. &nbsp; I've ascertained that the point of entry has
 to be an unknown firewall port, access to the BIOS which causes changes from that point on such as a list of far expired MS Root Certificates - dating from 1999 yet if deleted, the PC no longer functions and on a clean complete reinstall, the certs are already
 back to outdated and untrusted status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please not that NO ONE has access physically to my machine - at least as far as I know. &nbsp;The PC has been out of my site yet that would involve someone having broken into my current living space... which has happened on multiple occasions over many years
 now. &nbsp;Nonetheless I do not &nbsp;believe physical access to my machine is required except perhaps to remove the signs of infection.<br />
<br />
Since my last reinstall which was prompted by a series of events, once of which was the inability to install MS updates, I pulled the battery today which began the updates install again. &nbsp;What happens is updates try to install then the screen states that updates
 could not be installed and thus, it is restoring to the previous state. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no problem with Internet Connectivity or any of the other checks listed on the troubleshooting page.<br />
<br />
Where do I go from here?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal opinion is that you are worrying about nothing when it comes to the certificates...</p>
<p>I checked mine, and I have a number of expired ones as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are most likely included as part of the windows installation... as a result you keep seeing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is about a zero chance you have a virus in your BIOS... unless it was put there with the firmware to start with....</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are in fact multiple types of accounts as part of the Security\Permissions Process....</p>
<p>For most of the folders in C:\Windows, you were never on the list. That's just the way it works...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part those are all system files of some type, and the access is limited to mostly system processes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... There is in fact a hidden Administrator account on the machine that probably has more access that you do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways to change that, but I won't get into the details...</p>
<p>If none of your scans show up with a virus, I wouldn't worry about it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and most 3rd party suppliers update there stuff daily... if not more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because some things don't make sense doesn't mean they are the result of a virus...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you haven't thrown away a ton of hardware and money because of this...</p>
<p>The chance of multiple brand new machines all having the same virus\root kit is zero...</p>

<h2>            Winoows DVD Maker MP4</h2>
                    I used Movie Maker 12 to make a movie. The output was in MP4 format, which is the new standard for MM, and now I find out that Windows DVD maker doesn't recognize that format. What do I do now?

            You can also save out of Movie Maker 2012 in .wmv format. When you are giving your final movie a name to save on your computer, there is a drop-down for the file type.&nbsp; It defaults to .mp4, but you can switch it to .wmv.

            Thanks Mr. Guy,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I figured that out but I'm wondering since they added MP4, is there an upgrade I missed or one coming for DVD Maker. If not, since it defaults to MP4, it would have been nice to put up a warning. It was a large file and took almost 2 hours to create
 the MP4 file.</div>

<div>Thanks for the info.</div>

            I think you&nbsp;can go directly from Movie Maker to DVD Maker using the 'Burn to DVD' option.&nbsp; I also don't know Microsoft's plan for DVD Maker going forward.&nbsp; Currently if you are running Windows 7, there is a version of DVD Maker.&nbsp; But in Windows 8 there
 isn't yet a solution.&nbsp; I'm sure they have something in place by the actual release date in October. We'll just have to see.

            You are right about the Burn to DVD option, but that makes you go through the saving of the movie too. What I did, since I was in a hurry, I converted the MP4 to WMV...and then the DVD wouldn't burn. I was getting an error but it wasn't So now, I went
 back and made a fresh copy of the video in WMV format and am almost done burning the new DVD. And, it worked! Still have to try it in the DVD player. Thanks for your help.

            <p>I have the same problem. It seems that at Microsoft , the guys who maintain Movie Maker and the guys who maintain DVD Maker , did&nbsp; not , or do not , communicate with each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only answer at the moment, is when completing a film or movie in Movie Maker , make sure you do not file it as an MP4 version.</p>

    <title>MemDiag apearing in system task tray after running it and rebooting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hph dj pon3  say:</h3>
<h2>            MemDiag apearing in system task tray after running it and rebooting</h2>
                    So I ran a MemDiag a few days ago and everything came up fine, upon rebooting I noticed the MemDiag icon was still in the task tray and I was unable to click or right click on it. I've checked in my task scheduler and there is no task that boots up the
 memory diagnostic tool, and there is no startup item for it in the system startup list. I can close it with task manager, but with each reboot it appears. SFC /scannow shows there are no integrity violations. So my question is, how do I stop MemDiag from appearing?
 I've also tried <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">bcdedit /bootsequence {memdiag} /remove but it didn't work<br />
<br />
<br />
***EDIT Was able to fix the issue by running the Memory Diagnostics again and then cancelling it</span></p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the infection scans and check System File integrity from Steps 7 and 11 in this  Checklist for Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />This will tell you if anything is corrupted and fix it.  The steps are sequenced in the Checklist so that if you do them all you will also have given Windows its most thorough checkup.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            AdwCleaner found nothing, as did MalwareBytes. There was no "Check for solutions" like step 10 said, so I just ran Maintenance. As for step 9, only issue it found was my UAC wasn't set as default. Step 11, as stated in my original post, I have already
 done SFC /scannow, and it found nothing wrong

            <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>locking the taskbar on the right side of screen is of no use as u cannot use the scroll down on any pages.</p>
<p>when and if it returns to the bottom i will attempt to lock it but it will then hinder web page usage so its not ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>no changes were made, no programs installed other than windows updates which are automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since getting windows 10 , when i shutdown, sleep or hibernate i satrt up again and always receive a windows runtime error....i just close and computer works normally. i am using a hdmi to a monitor so always i need to swap the display to the monitor when
 start&nbsp; up</p>

            <p>Hi Brettri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the following steps and check if that helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Method1</strong>: Set your system in Clean Boot and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">(</span>Also valid in Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.”</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method2</strong>: Run Power troubleshooter and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The power troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix any incorrect power settings. Refer to these steps to run this troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows key +X, select Control panel.</span></li><li><span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons.</span></li><li><span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel.</span></li><li><span>Run the <strong>Power </strong>troubleshooter.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Run SFC scan and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. This article describes how to
<span><span>run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></span> to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example,
 some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Press “Windows Key + Q”.<br />
<br />
b. Type <strong>“</strong><em><strong>cmd</strong></em><strong>”</strong> without quotes in the search box.<br />
<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “<em><strong>cmd</strong></em>” option and select “Run as Administrator”.<br />
