<h2>            Lock folder structure in Windows Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in a large group of engineers accessing shared servers with complex file tree structures. &nbsp;Using Windows 7, 8 and 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to lock the file tree structure so that certain folders don't get moved around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not uncommon for a user to be working quickly, accidentally grab an entire folder, move their mouse and drop it into a different location and not even realize they'd done that. &nbsp;Then there is a period of panic wondering how an entire folder got deleted
 or moved followed by relieve when (if?) it is found again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to be able to lock a folder tree structure without affecting the access and permissions applied to those folders and files in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do that? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asking users to work slowly and methodically doesn't seem to be an option :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Erik</p>

<h2>            Can I re-use my Windows 10 Pro CD-Key on my new PC once I remove the old PC in the devices tab of my Microsoft Account&#63;</h2>
                    I recently decommissioned my old office PC to make way for our newer and better optimized PC. On the old PC, I did all of the steps needed to uninstall the product key (slmgr /upk) and even got the message that windows was no longer activated and no longer
 had a cd-key installed. When I tried to transfer the key to the new pc, It would not work. It gave me an error stating that I do not have a valid digital license and would need to purchase another key from the store. What steps should I take to re-use my cd-key?
 Any feedback on the issue is highly appreciated! Hoping for your responses! Thank you!

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>  through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />

<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

 How the hell do i get rid of this cause it's covering up some of my programs on my desktop and I dont want it there. It wasnt there an hour ago. The search base on the top wont go away.</p>

            Hi gman7862, they keep renaming that bar to stop it being removed . .. 
<br />
<br />Somewhere in your Startup processes that bar must be loading, we need to find that and delete it form your Startup processes . . 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />Look for anything referring to that par on the initial list and also on the Logon Tab, if you find it, right click and delete it
<br />
<br />If you are unable to find it, please post screenshot(s) of the initial list in Autoruns and I will have a look for you . . .

<p>Hi 40alpha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that updating the program you mentioned damaged a Windows system component that is related to the system font used by programs. Before we troubleshoot the issue, I highly recommend performing a
<em><strong>System Restore</strong></em> prior to updating the program. This procedure takes your computer back to an earlier point in time using a system restore point. Restore points are created when you install a new program, driver, or updated. This will
 not affect your personal files, but it will remove programs, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. You need administrative permission to perform this recovery procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, type <strong>Control</strong> <strong>
Panel</strong> and then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Recovery</strong> in the <em><strong>Control Panel</strong></em> search box.</li><li>Select <strong>Recovery</strong> &gt; <strong>Open</strong> <strong>System</strong>
<strong>Restore</strong> &gt; <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>C<span>hoose the most recent app, driver, or update on the list of results, then select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Scan for affected programs</strong><span>. You'll see a list of items that will be deleted if you remove this restore point. If you're OK
 with the deletions, select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Next</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Finish</strong><span>. Or, if needed, select an earlier restore point before selecting<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Next</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Finish</strong><span>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should the issue remain after performing a <em><strong>System Restore</strong></em>, I advise running both the
<strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool and <strong>SFC</strong> tool. These tools will scan your PC for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Make sure that you're signed in as the administrator to run the tools.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button and type <strong>Command</strong> <strong>
Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong> and choose <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>Enter <span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth </strong>and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Note the space before each "/".</span></span></li><li><span><span>This step may take a few minutes to start and up to 30 minutes to run and complete.</span></span></li></ul>
</li><li><span><span>Enter </span></span><span><strong>sfc</strong> <strong>/scannow </strong>
and then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Note the space between "sfc" and "/"</span></span><span>.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span><span>Restart your PC.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>

<h2>            Wn 10 desktop background slideshow</h2>
                    <p>I have chosen to use the Win10 Desktop background slideshow feature. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it working, but there are a couple of tweaks I would like to make.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, is there any way of setting the change interval to less than a minute?&nbsp; I am guessing there is a registry entry for this value, but have no idea of how to find it or even where to look for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, is there any way to get it to also display the file names?&nbsp; I have another app that does slideshows and has this option (Irfanview). I would like to be able to see the file names because I am using pictures I downloaded when I had a much smaller,
 lower resolution screen. So, many of these pictures that looked OK before, are now blowing up into fuzzy blobs on my 4K 42" monitor (gee it is great fun to be able to say that ... )</p>

</p>
<p>I would like to see the names of the blobs, so I can more easily find them to delete them.

            <p>Host applications like Control.exe, Rundll32.exe can't be Pinned to taskbar, but there is a round-about way to Pin them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a desktop shortcut to a program that's not already Pinned to Taskbar.</p>
<p>2. Name the shortcut as desired (eg.&nbsp;<strong>Classic Wallpaper Control Panel</strong>)</p>
<p>3. Right-click the shortcut and click <strong>Pin to taskbar</strong></p>
<p>4. Now, open the following folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">%AppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(Type or paste that path in Explorer Address bar to open it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. In the above folder, right-click the shortcut&nbsp;<strong>Classic Wallpaper Control Panel</strong>, and click Properties</p>
<p>6. Replace the existing target path with the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>control /name Microsoft.Personalization /page pageWallpaper</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Click OK.</p>
<p>8. The desktop shortcut you created in step 1, can now be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pinned taskbar Icon wouldn't refresh immediately; requires a logoff/login or restarting Explorer via Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Optionally, you can <a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/add-classic-page-wallpaper-colorization-control-panel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
add</a>&nbsp;the classic Wallpaper Panel to Control Panel.</p>

            <p>Rohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For #2, you may add "Desktop Background File Location" option to the right-click menu, which when clicked runs a PS script which opens the folder containing the current wallpaper. You can delete the unwanted image there.</p>

<h2>            Does MS need to relax their stance on game mods&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>With the up coming release of Skyrim, and with Todd Howard [Bethesda] stating he doesn't see why user made content can't be used on consoles, as it does work, and the only real losers are the gamers themselves, do you think MS are unnecessarily stopping
 their gamers from enjoying content that&nbsp; PC users have enjoyed for years?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I';m not advocating for the use of mods that give online players an advantage over other players, as i actually fully support MS stance on this particular type of modding, but stopping people from accessing single player, offline content just strikes
 me as a money grabbing exercise.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sony are slowly warming to the idea, after all, LBP 2 allows users to up load and share their creations and Sony are also open to Valve allowing their fans access to this sort of material too.&nbsp; 'Tis strange the dev's themselves - BioWare, Beth and Valve
 to name but 3, have no real issues with their console games being modded and as such allow console users to discuss and create content, content, that if you're found to be using will get you a lifetime ban because MS don't like the idea of people creating
 their own playable content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like i said, I fully support MS with modded content if it's being used online as to gain an advantage, but don't agree with their overall stance on the matter.</p>

<p>For single player games I have no objection at all, mods can add a lot to a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a massive thread on the Bioware social forum about how to mod the 360 version of Mass Effect 2. You can't do as much as on the PC version, as you can't access the .ini files, but there is still a fair bit available that does nothing but cosmetic
 changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though as DSight said, it'll never happen because Microsoft want to be the only one to make money on new stuff.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was the BioWare thread i was referring to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take Oblivion for example, such a superior game on PC that it's like playing a completely different game to the one we play on console. &nbsp;it's not because the PC is the better gaming machine, it's because there's literally over a thousand more hours worth
 of content for the game.</p>

<p>I'm all for user generated content and stuff. Look at all the amazing stuff that's been done with Valve's Source games. Custom Portal challenges, anyone? It would be great for Halo too, since someone could upload a new map, then others can tweak and alter
 it using Forge. Also, it would bring an end to the tyranny of $15 map packs.</p>

<p>There is a big difference between modding and user-created content. I'm all for user-created content such as indie games and custom levels. But I do not want any modding. Keep the cheating gamers off Xbox.

<p>Not really, &nbsp;you're just simply using schematics when there's no real reason to do so as it's obvious what I'm getting at. &nbsp;For example, Oblivion has many mods - OOO being the main one and one of the most popular ones to boot. &nbsp;It changes certain game dynamics
 which by it's very definition, is modifying what you were given by the developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modding a game shouldn't and doesn't automatically = cheating. </p>

<p>Add to that, MS considers altering content and adding user created content to your games to be one and the same, so it's fair to discuss them under the heading 'mods'</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><strong><span>That's one of the things I've come to enjoy in StarCraft II is mods. Of course, there are official Blizzard mods or just custom maps. Some Xbox LIVE games support custom
 maps. The way they've been implemented in Halo Reach is enough for me to not need DLC maps (at least for $10, maybe if they get discounted). There is one mod on SC2 that is literally a mod and supported with custom maps allows the user to play StarCraft 1
 missions (with the SC1 stats) using the SC2 engine. But mod/tool kits for sp games would be nice. I wouldn't care for them too much in RPGs as that is my personal taste but for other genres it would be nice (singleplayer only of course).</span></strong></span></p>

<p>As for the types of modding you are in support of, I totally agree. I can't count how many different games I wish I could be able to create my own levels for and then share with the public. Of course, some XBLA games do come with their own minimal level
 editors, but games like Duke 3D, Doom, and Quake, it would really further the life of those titles if people were able to use their own imagination to be creative.</p>

<p>User created content is going to be a big part of the future of gaming, mark my words. Either MS will learn this and adapt or they will slide to second/third place in the future console wars which will be spearheaded by John Connor's assault on Skynet.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
We have identified a resoltion for some of these reboot loops.&nbsp; Please see the steps below for details:<br />
<br />
We will start by booting into Windows Recovery Environment using the same steps above.&nbsp; I will list them again here for completion's sake:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boot using the Windows 7 installation DVD<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose your language settings and hit "Next"<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "Repair Your Computer" link at the bottom of the screen. This will launch Windows RE.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not click on Install Now</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the OS to repair, and take note of the Drive Letter assigned to the operating System.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see Windows 7 and D:\ (the drive letter may be different)<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Next and you should see a list of the recovery tools<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Command Prompt<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see X:\Sources in white on a black background, you can type commands here</p>
<p>Once you have booted into WinRE please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Type "cd c:\users" at the command prompt. <br />
2. Type "dir /s /p", and look for the words "<strong>is too long</strong>".&nbsp; <br />
3. If you don't see "<strong>is too long</strong>" on the first page, press a key to get the next page
<br />
4. Look on the second page for "<strong>is too long</strong>".<br />
5. Continue to press a key to advance in pages until you find all the strings "<strong>is too long</strong>". (This may take quite a few pages to get to the end)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You may see more than 1 entry that has "<strong>is too long</strong>", please take a note of each entry as we will need the folder names in later steps.</p>
<p>Once you have identified all the folders with "<strong>is too long</strong>" we will need to move them into a temp location.</p>
<p>7. Type "move" followed by the path of the folder, then the name of the temporary location to move to:</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong>&nbsp; MOVE C:\USERS\BOB\DOCUMENTS\DOCUMENTS C:\TEMP</p>
<p>8. Once all the invalid folders have been moved, repeat step 1 and 2 to verify that there are no other folders with "<strong>is too long</strong>"<br />
9. Once completed, restart the computer and <strong>you should be able to successfully boot into Vista</strong>.<br />
<br />
10. Once back into a working Vista, open "Computer" and navigate to C:\Users and open your username folder.<br />
11. Right click on each folder one by one and choose "Properties".<br />
12. Click on the Location tab and confirm that the path shown is correctly displaying the path for this folder.</p>
<p>Example: The properties / location of C:\Users\BOB\Documents should have the same correct path listed on the location tab "C:\Users\BOB\Documents".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
13. If any folder's location is not correct, click on "Restore Defaults" and repeat<br />
14. Once all the folders have been corrected, please reboot the computer and retry the upgrade process again.<br />
<br />
I have unlocked this thread, please let me know if you see success with the above steps.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

    <title>nVidia nForce 780a chipset RAID support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1nferis  say:</h3>
<h2>            nVidia nForce 780a chipset RAID support</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an aging system running Windows 7 Ultimate in&nbsp;RAID&nbsp;on a&nbsp;nVidia nForce&nbsp;780a SLI chipset.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me&nbsp;how to find out&nbsp;if there&nbsp;is&nbsp;a chipset&nbsp;driver available in Windows update for this chipset?<br />
</p>
<p>I don't want to do the upgrade and find out that I'm being forced to do a clean installation back to Windows 7 again.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
During the previous upgrade Windows 10 was&nbsp;running without the system being able to access the HDD's. I could see and access the C-drive, but when ever I opened system hardware properties, the system showed no RAID configuration or physical drives.<br />
</p>
<p>This also resulted in many BSOD's as the HDD's were unknown and thus unavailable to Windows 10. Making Windows react as if I suddenly pulled the HDD from the system.</p>
<p>Both Asus (mainboard is a M3N-HT Deluxe)&nbsp;and nVidia tell me the system is unsupported for Windows 10, but I keep getting the update forced to me&nbsp;to upgrade to Windows 10. With Microsoft
 telling me the system is supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to note that the GPU version&nbsp;(as there is also a&nbsp;GeForce 780 graphics card) is&nbsp;supported, but not part of my investigation.<br />
My system holds a single EVGA <span>
GTX</span>570HD-SC.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Danny,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per your description, I have gone through the nVidia nForce 780a at NVIDIA website, I have found that the graphics driver is not compatible with Windows 10. However, you can try installing the driver in compatibly mode.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nforce-vista-win7-64bit-15.56-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.nvidia.com/object/nforce-vista-win7-64bit-15.56-driver.html</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If that does not help, I suggest you to contact NVIDIA support team for further assistance.
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, I have gone the motherboard website. This motherboard manufacturer did not release the devices driver for Windows 10 yet. I suggest you to go to the below link, download all the latest devices driver and install the same in compatibility mode
 by following the above steps. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M3NHT_DeluxeHDMI/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M3NHT_DeluxeHDMI/HelpDesk_Download/</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you said your system hold single EVGA GTX570HD-SC go to the below link and install all the latest updated driver.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.evga.com/support/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.evga.com/support/download/</span></a><span>

            <p>I've contacted Asus.</p>
<p>Asus&nbsp;has stated the mainboard is Legacy and will not generate Windows 10 compatible drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted nVidia.</p>
<p>nVidia has branded the nForce 780a SLI chipset as Legacy and will not generate drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The nVidia chipset package will not correctly install chipset drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Windows 10 will not use the chipset driver-library as a viable source for RAID-drivers.</p>
<p>Windows 10 will also not use the Win7/8 drivers as a compatible driver source during clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The WGX-app however is still stating my system is compatible and keeps forcing me to upgrade to Windows 10. Even after blocking the two main updates that generate the WGX-app and the upgrade.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for sharing the details. I would like to inform you that since the manufacturer is not releasing any driver, we cant help on that matter&nbsp;since we do not release any hardware driver. The prompt you are getting because it is a free upgrade,
 if your system is eligible for Windows 10 itll prompt. But to install Windows 10 the system has to be compatible with Windows 10. So, I suggest you to go back to previous Windows version and use it as stable.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you. If you need further assistance on Windows let us know we will be glad to help you.

<p>Hi many thanks for your reply to another user, but now my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have this device and now I just can throw it away, because it doe not run under Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ridiculous and when do you decide to provide new updates, so we still can use it?</p>
<p>I don't wanna buy always new devices, just the older one does not get any updates. Is quite enough, that we need to buy always new mobile phones and computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know about this issue because is very inconvenient.</p>

            Suspension length can vary depending on the severity of the situation as well as any previous enforcement actions. So even if you did the same thing, if your friend has less enforcement actions previously, that could have weighed in on the enforcement
 team's decision to give him a shorter ban.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I'm sorry to hear about any issues you may be having due to an enforcement action. For information about the ban, you would need to go to
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enforcement website</a>. That is the only way to contact the enforcement team if you are eligible for a case review. No one on the forums can provide that answer for you unfortunately,
 but our ambassador's statement is generally true across the board when it comes to length of the bans or suspensions. If you have any other questions unrelated to enforcement actions feel free to post them.</span></span></p>

</p><p>When I insert my flashdrive and i open it, it says "application not found". But when I opened it through the navigation pane, it opened. But the files inside my flashdrive became shortcuts, luckily the folders did not. When I deleted the shortcut files and
 when i close the window, it appears again after i open it. And the target location indicates "system32" Is it a virus or what? What should I do to fix it? I need your help badly. Anyone? :(

            <p><span>Hello Diane,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you get application not found error message when you connect your flash drive to the computer. However, when you open through the navigation pane it opens but it includes some shortcut files and they come
 back even after deleting. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are these shortcut files unknown files or already present files have been changed to shortcuts?</span></li><li><span>Have you checked connecting the flash drive to any other computer? Do you get the same issue there as well?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer and your flash drive?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the shortcut files which comes back even after deleting are unknown files, most probably these are viruses. I would suggest you to</span><strong>
</strong><span>scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, just to make sure that the computer is free of all infections.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Download and run Microsoft safety scanner to scan your computer for viruses</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On addition to that you may also run&nbsp;System file checker tool</span><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">&nbsp;to scan the system integration and fix system file corruption (if any).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The<strong> sfc /scannow (System File Checker) </strong>command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.</span></strong><strong><span><br />

 I then had with them on the other laptop is also not showing on this laptop.&nbsp; Surely I only have one skype account across both devices.&nbsp;

<p>trouble shooter - no faults found.</p>
<p>Clean boot - did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>Adding a new account - did not fix the problem in fact it was worse as the app tiles just went black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I added the first&nbsp;new account the first I got several app errors, so I deleted the account and created another new one.</p>
<p>With the second attempt I got this&nbsp;message:</p>
<p>An app default was reset - An app caused a problem with the default app setting for .pdf files so it was...&nbsp; Alas the rest of the message was hidden by the lower tool bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that all other apps open ok.</p>

    <title>How To Get Back Deleted Windows 7 Fonts Without Doing System Restore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How To Get Back Deleted Windows 7 Fonts Without Doing System Restore</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
During the past summer I deleted a number of the Windows 7 fonts that I knew I was never going to use. Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted some that I didn't really want to delete. But I let it pass at the time. Now I'd like to have a few of the ones back
 that got accidentally deleted (e.g. Baskerville, Californian, Goudy). <br />
<br />
I have searched for previous threads on this issue, but none (including this one:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/location-to-download-accidentally-deleted-fonts/b43a8d76-2889-41f2-be0c-9e7c27e2cf30">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/location-to-download-accidentally-deleted-fonts/b43a8d76-2889-41f2-be0c-9e7c27e2cf30</a>) has helped. That thread is about deleting thousands of additional fonts, not restoring deleted Windows
 fonts. And the replies there mainly suggest solutions more drastic than I want to do (system restore [which would change too many things I have done since the font deletion], reinstall of Windows) or suggest other programs for deleting the extra fonts and
 getting back to the defaults that are still present for the OP. (I did download the Powerpoint Viewer which did, indeed, restore some of the fonts I lost, but not all of them.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, my problem is more in line with this thread from someone posting last year.
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/location-to-download-accidentally-deleted-fonts/b43a8d76-2889-41f2-be0c-9e7c27e2cf30">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/location-to-download-accidentally-deleted-fonts/b43a8d76-2889-41f2-be0c-9e7c27e2cf30</a><br />
<br />
That's <strong>exactly</strong> my problem. Unfortunately, the reply from the MVP is very unhelpful. The site 1001freefonts.com obviously does NOT have premium fonts found in Windows 7/Office 2007! (Wouldn't an MVP already know that?)<br />
<br />
But my question is basically the same as the OP is that thread: Is there no place where existing licensed OS users can go to download the font files and then install it themselves ?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I mean, if MS is capable of verifying one's valid ownership of a Windows OS when performing various updates, why in the name of all that is logical does it not provide a link to re-download deleted Windows fonts for valid users??<br />
<br />
So, is there any way to reclaim the full amount of Windows 7/Office 2007 fonts without the drastic system restore or OS reinstall often suggested?
<br />
<br />
Any updates on how to deal with this issue? Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks!&nbsp; :-)

            <p><em>During the past summer I deleted a number of the Windows 7 fonts that I knew I was never going to use.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Not a good idea. Moving the font files to some external storage medium would have been just as effective but it would have left you with a backout path.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>And the replies there mainly suggest solutions more drastic than I want to do (system restore [which would change too many things I have done since the font deletion].</em></p>
<p>-&gt; You need to distinguish between System Restore and Image Restore:<br />
<strong>System Restore</strong> will set Windows back by a few days, maybe two weeks at most. It would have been useless in your case.</p>
<p><strong>Image Restore</strong> will set Windows back to the point when you created the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Wouldn't an MVP already know that?</em></p>
<p>MVPs are appointed because of their high level of expertise and their outstanding community contributions. They are not know-alls.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>So, is there any way to reclaim the full amount of Windows 7/Office 2007 fonts</em></p>
<p>-&gt; If you can lay your hands on a Windows 7 installation DVD then I am prepared to post a set of instructions to extract any of 434 the font files from the DVD. The process is involved and requires a certain amount of careful typing in a console environment.</p>

            There is no way short of reinstalling the software that included the fonts or getting lucky and finding the desired fonts on the web somewhere.&nbsp; Here is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_Microsoft_Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a list of fonts that were present in Windows 7.</a>&nbsp; Oftentimes fonts are installed by applications, so looking at a list of fonts available doesn't necessarily tell you where each one came from.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#34;System Thread Exception not Handled&#34; Problem</h2>
                    I upgraded my Toshiba Satellite C655 Windows 7 to Windows 10.When Windows 10 finished installing it put me in the Desktop and like in 3 minutes my pc restarted automatically and now every time I reboot my pc a blue screen always appears with this problem"System_Thread_Exception_Not_Handled"
 and doesn't let me login.The only way I can enter is in safe mode.I look for solutions in google and all I can see its uninstalling display drivers and install the lateless display driver.I haven't try that method but I try other simples methods because im
 scared to try uninstall something that I'm not familiar with and I don't know where can I download the lateless driver for my computer because I can't connect to my Wifi in Safe Mode.I see a lot of people have the same problem as me and almost all of the time
 they don't have replies to how to fix this horrible problem and thats why im asking here.Please if one of you have a solution to this problem,please reply to me.Microsoft needs to know about t

&nbsp;Blue Screen of Death is displayed with System Thread Exception Not Handled error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Thread Exception Not Handled error in Windows 8 mostly arises due to incompatible or old graphics card drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to fix this issue, the computer must be restarted in safe mode, and the problematic graphics driver must be uninstalled. Once this is done, the latest driver of the installed graphics card must be downloaded from the vendors official site, and
 must be installed in order to make the system work.</p>

            Hi Gunther.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Windows Boot Manager was introduced with the new UEFI BIOS' and must be set first to boot at all times for UEFI installs.  
<br />
<br />To boot repair or reinstall media use only the BIOS Boot Menu key shown here for your brand PC:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Since you didn't tell us what you're trying to do other than boot one of these, I'll give you the general steps to boot media for repairs or reinstall:
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Startup Repair and a System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> chris buhs  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am trying to uninstall a program but it keeps telling me to wait  until it stops doing  something this has been going on for 2 days &#63;</h2>
                    My microsoft little castle is red , rather green, so I go into that area and it says press this button "TURN ON" so iI do this, and it says you must uninstall the program that is currently not working in order to install program that will work. But when
 I try to do this that program tells me to wait until it is available to do so. What is running and how long does it take? Where do I find out? What is happening to my security? as this is my second day trying to do this ? I am very new at this stuff, I was
 told operating this laptop was easy,!! thank you Granny.

            Hey HPCH&amp;NJ,
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to say that this image is honestly long gone, at least that's my take. When it shows up in the Snipping Tool, it automatically doesn't commit it to your storage (be it a hard drive or SSD) and instead it was sitting in RAM. When your computer powers off, everything in memory is erased, and that's where your screenshot was. The Snipping Tool is also too basic to have a recovery feature, as far as I know.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps a bit, I'm sorry about your image.       
        </p>

<p><span>-&gt; Every version of Windows has a clipboard, including Windows 10. However, clipboards exist in RAM only (Random Access Memory). This type of memory is volatile. Its contents disappears as soon as you switch off power.
 Unfortunately there is no way for you to recover your picture.</span></p>
