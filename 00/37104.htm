            <p>Not hardly. However, if you have such low storage space, try adding a drive and consider placing files on it and also consider a device such as a WD Passport or other external storage devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, many recommend not storing all your files on the Windows drive. The Program Files folder in Windows was a great idea when the OS was young. There should be a more flexible way to tie these together, a sort of 'DOS shell' equivalent that registers the
 location of the program, regardless of where it is located. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I fit all the available free 10 download versions&nbsp;easily on a 16 GB USB thumb drive once (even though I reverted later). Making the DVD as also suggested did not work at all, and&nbsp;many others reported problems with that method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I won't dissuade you from converting I would strongly recommend waiting a little while...there are seven months left on the free offer and still more than a few hiccups to work out. Treat it as a very high level BETA for now.</p>

            <p>Yes, more or less.&nbsp; If it is not compressed a clean install of Windows 10 64 bit is 12.6GB for Windows directory.&nbsp; Add to this the included Program Files (more than 1GB), page file (1.5 GB perhaps), ProgramData for defender (0.8GB) and it all adds up to&nbsp;nearly
 20GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install yesterday (with no added programs) and it is 17.3GB which after compression comes out&nbsp;using 10.2GB.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you should:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--add a second drive, if you are near the limits of your C drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>--try changing the drive out and installing you qualifying OS there then guinea pig that one, if you are concerned that you will run out of disk space keeping the old OS during the trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not compress the drive, from years of experience, drive space is cheap and old tricks might well backfire. It sounds like you are in need of more storage capacity, I would get it. The example of the WD Passport I mentioned is often under 100 dollars
 and a new drive to add is also within that reasonable range. You should be able to image your entire average drive in many basic computers (you wouldn't believe how common 80 GB hard drives are and my HP was supposed to have a 1 terabyte unit but the previous
 owner obviously took it with them and left me with about 150.&nbsp; Compression is an old gimmick, leave your drives uncompressed and avoid future problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like with musclecars, there is no substitute for Gigabytes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 clean installation on a Windiws 7 PC</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to install a windows 10 OS on my old Windows 7 PC whose HDD is broken.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I installed a windows 10 from my another PC, burned an ISO file into a DVD.</p>
<p>2. I inserted a new HDD to my old PC which doesn't have any OS now since I removed the broken HDD having windows 7.</p>
<p>3. I inserted windows 10 ISO&nbsp;DVD to my old PC and started windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>4. PROBLEM - I am asked to provide a product key during the installation.</p>

            <p>Hi Asmita,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To install Windows 10 as a clean installation and make use of the free upgrade,
<span>you will have to upgrade from an existing eligible operating system like&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;or Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is no product key for the free upgrade, in case you do not have any previous operating system, you will have to buy Windows 10 license.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you own any one of the eligible operating systems, you may
</span><span>install the same, activate it, update it with all latest updates and then upgrade to Windows 10. This installation will not prompt for any product key to be entered.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This will carry forward your activation status to Windows 10. This key will now be tied to the device`s BIOS along with the hardware IDs.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do reply for more questions.</span></p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Problem with my Hard disk. This PC has an SSD and an HDD, and 4 Months ago, there seemed to be a Windows update that resulted in the failed migration of the HDD, I however didn't find out until today. I googled a bit and here is what I tried till
 now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install New Driver - turns out I have the newest driver installed</p>
<p>2. Uninstall device and restart PC so Windows reinstalls the driver - Didn't Work</p>
<p>3. scf.exe /scannow - Internet recommended it no Idea what it actually accomplished</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be simmilar cases caused by the 10.0.17134.1 driver and some people had sucess by replacing the termsrv.dll of the new&nbsp;version with the termsrv.dll of the old version(?). However, I have no Idea how they did it. If anyone knows how to do this
 or knows any other way to fix this, I would be grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the log for the failed migration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device SCSI\Disk&amp;Ven_TP500G&amp;Prod_\5&amp;ca92a28&amp;0&amp;050000 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.<br />

<p>SCSI/RAID needs to be enabled in the BIOS,if it's set,then go to youre pc mfg web site,download &amp; install the MB Chipset software/driver.Then locate the MB storage controller software/driver,Intel based use the Intel Storage Software,older would be Intel

            Well, I am not seeing the model information. Do you have the box the motherboard came in? 
<br />
<br />I noticed you are still on the older Windows 10 1803 release. I would try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1903 release. 
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you donâ€™t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thatâ€™s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

            funny how even with troubleshooting and error codes there is NEVER A BLEEEP BLEEPIN BLEEP ANSWER!!!! have the same issue same device and its not the first time this has happened! its non-stop! This is just absolutely ridiculous how nothing is ever accomplished!
 nobody follows up and we go all over trying things on our own! I'm on my 20th reset or something close! its like pissing in somebody's living room floor! you just don't do that right! Sorry for those who absolutely try to help! I really do appreciate although
 at what point can the same issues just subside! at least&nbsp; we deserve compatibility from the company who has billions and knows the depth and swipe direction we all use to clean our sh!!. Windows has the timing of a three legged cat doing a handstand without
 fail as far as info or help with anything! help links default to nowhere and its NEVER updated! nothing is ever posted from source as to hey guys my fellow customers...do this until we resolve!!! All my photos are gone and i

<p>In previous Windows releases, when you installed an upgrade version of Windows, if you wanted to reinstall the upgrade version, you had to first reinstall the qualifying version from which you upgraded, reactivate it, then upgrade again and reactivate again.</p>
<p><br />
With Windows 10, this is no longer the case. Once you have upgraded to Windows 10 and activate, you can simply create a bootable copy on DVD or USB and reinstall just Windows 10 without the need to reinstall the qualifying version and it will reactivate automatically.</p>
<p><br />
Quote:</p>
<p>"Windows 10 handles keys differently. When you upgrade to Windows 10 via Windows Update from Windows 8.1 or Windows 7, the process&nbsp;registers your computers hardware, and qualifying OS with a Microsoft Product Activation Server. The device is then considered
 a Windows 10 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequently anytime you re-install (or clean install) the installation checks with those servers, finds the unique installation ID and produces the validation"</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller &#40;Y Button Issue&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcon1006  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller &#40;Y Button Issue&#41;</h2>
                    So while playing Battlefield last night I noticed that my Y Button is sticking. I have the "Day One" Edition controller. Its gotten very annoying. Just looking for some advice on what I should do. If this is something that can be fixed/replaced and how
 I go about doing that. I tried filling out a support ticket but when it gets to the part with the serial #, I try and put in the numbers that are on the controller and it does nothing. Unless of course its asking for the serial of the Xbox? Please advise.....
 thanks, jesse

<p>JCON1006,</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are talking about going through <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://myservice.xbox.com</a>, when you click register a device it is looking for the console or kinect S/N since those are the only devices. The controller, headset, power supply, etc. are all considered accessories. Once the console is registered, you can
 click on Replace an Accessory then select Controller and you should be able to go through the rest of the process. Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Goflex public folder and windows media player</h2>
                    I am using a Seagate goflex home network attached hard drive.&nbsp; It creates 4 default shares, one of which is called public which is set for read access for any devices on my home network.&nbsp; For some reason my dlna devices, including my computers with windows
 media player and my smart tv, are only seeing some files but not all.&nbsp; It is not an issue of codec or file extension and Ive tried locating files that it cant see in the same sub-folder as files it can see.&nbsp; My media player does see that my nas is sharing
 files but the list of files being presented is based on old data.&nbsp; I know this because I am still seeing placeholders for files Ive deleted.&nbsp; I cant seem to force media play to look for a fresh list of what the nas is sharing out.

<h2>            All programs files say that they&#39;re empty&#33; I wanna wipe my laptop.</h2>
                    I had a virus, but I'm pretty sure its gone. But I honestly have no idea it's gone. 2 days ago I found a file called " OpenCandy " and I searched that on google and it said it was a virus from downloading frostwire. So all I did was delete the opencandy file. I don't have frostwire anymore. I dunno if deleting the file actually deleted the virus. So anyways! When I click: Start, All programs.. mostly all the files say they're empty. I wanna wipe out my whole laptop, but I'm not too sure how. I did the f8 thing but it's being a piece of **** and won't work properly! My system restore file is empty in the all programs thing. And I don't have a disk to reinstall Windows 7 or whatever. How do I get the All Programs files back to normal, and how do I wipe EVERYTHING off my laptop without using a disk!

    <title>When joining xbox party the router resets itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hosanna16  say:</h3>
<h2>            When joining xbox party the router resets itself</h2>
                    <p>So i have been at this for a week and no one ive spoken to has any idea whats wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I join a party it will reset my router on my xbox one X and my Fiance's OG xbox, both the same results.</p>
<p>I have mediacom 500mb down and 40 up, with a netgear 3.1 docc and a Netgear ac4000 r8000p router..currently</p>
<p>I had an arris 3.0 and a netgear r8000p(different router)/ a netgear AX8/ and a netear ac1900 r7000(what i started with and worked fine but lost alot in connection)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these had the same affect, but at the time i thought it was the modem or router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time i changed these it was a temp fix and then inevitably it happened again.</p>
<p>Both xbox's were static ip/ but are now dynamic</p>
<p>UNUP-on(was off and port forwarded)</p>
<p>No port forward</p>
<p>Tried wifi and wired, new wires tried too (cat 7 for ref)</p>
<p>Speed test shows everything nice and fast</p>
<p>keeping SIP ALG setting on netgear enabled was my first fix, worked for a day</p>
<p>messed around with ipv6 settings just to make sure because im at my wits ends!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me figure this out, and thank you in advance&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have tried them both off and on, at different times as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive had everything including xbox's,router, and modem off for up to 6 hours where again it might fix it temporarily and let one or both xboxs use the party feature with no issues but it always happens again in the end.</p>
<p>Ive even tried to factory reset my xbox before i realized it happened on both of them. Sometimes it will let one xbox connect but then the other one will shut off the router.</p>
<p>It has been literal hell for me to problem solve all this to no avail&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Hosanna thanks for keeping in touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we think is happening could be that the router doesn't support multiple streaming devices if all the troubleshooting has been done. This could also be a firmware issue on the Network Hardware so what we could suggest reaching out to the ISP since this
 could be on their end. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Talked to Netgear earlier, they said it did support multiple streaming devices and have no idea why my xbox would cause a reset, My isp said everything on their end looks great and the modem and router are brand new and fully up to date in firmware at the
 moment.</p>

    <title>After windows 10 update, half my programs are not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> germanmatviuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            After windows 10 update, half my programs are not working&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After updating into windows 10, google Chrome, Firefox (I bet you heard about these 2 a lot lately heh) and Spotify wont work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome gives me this error: <span>DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET</span></p>
<p>I can open it, it shows the google bar and everything but as soon as I search something it'll give me that message and allow me to play the mini game of the dinosaur, so yeah, It appears as if I had no connection, which isnt true.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firefox wouldn't even search a thing, it launches correctly but cant search anything as if i had no internet.... again..</p>
<p>
</p><p>And spotify... It said that I had no connection, so I couldn't browse or download new songs, just listen to the downloaded ones. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but now when I try to install it, it will show me this message: "Unable to download spotify...
 retrying in X seconds"&nbsp; after trying several times it shows an error called "52" and It basically says that I dont have any internet connection and that I should check that a firewall isnt blocking it.
</p>
<p>So basically now I don't even have spotify at all... Thanks Microsoft! Everything was working just fine before the update, now I can't even enjoy the things I'm paying to use due to whatever the problem is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that the new internet explorer or "Microsoft edge" does work, and so&nbsp;does skype for example, so I do have internet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I try doing a research before posting this? Hell yes, for 2 days straight I've been surfing around and trying their "solutions" but any of them will work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did I try so far?: </p>
<p>Uninstalling and Installing all of the programs named above, several times.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi ,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<div>You could face this issue due to many reasons, if you have any third party security software or when the components responsible for the installation of Window Update are corrupt. I would suggest you to follow the steps given below.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the Windows Update troubleshooter.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow these steps to run Windows Update troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
1.Press Windows key + W and type&nbsp; troubleshooting.<br />
2.Select Troubleshooting.<br />
3.Select View all on the top left corner.<br />
4.Run Windows update troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Move to next method if issues persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong>: Temporarily disable third party security software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus program/firewall, they can interfere with the download. I would suggest you to temporarily disable and check if you are able to download the update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Move to next method if issues persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3</strong>: Reset Windows Update Components.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to Reset Windows Update Components and try installing the update by placing the computer in Clean Boot.</div>

            I have tried all of the recommended steps and my Corel video studio x9 still will not open. I keep getting error status 0xc000012sf,&nbsp;this is not a free or cheap program and&nbsp;I use it for video editing.&nbsp;I do not want to have to upgrade to x10 because a windows
 update has screwed up my systems. I used my program about 2 weeks ago and everything was fine. If I uninstall the new windows update will all my programs work the same as they normally do?

            On Monday my laptop was working fine, today everything has stopped working.&nbsp; I cannot open any of the software I normally use and my printer stopped working.&nbsp; I uninstalled and reinstalled the printer software and that fixed the printer issue, but the
 other programs are all giving me an error message when I click on the icon to open them.&nbsp; I am going to uninstall this weeks Windows 10 update and see if that fixes the problem, but I am getting really tired of having so many issues after the updates.&nbsp; If
 uninstalling the update doesn't work, I am will set up my old Windows 7 laptop and use it so at least I can get some work done.

            I did a factory restore to my computer and it still did not work. Ultimately I had to call the company that the programs are for and they gave me a new code to use for installation. There is a way to restore your computer to a point before the windows
 install was placed on the computer,&nbsp; this option may work because it takes your computer back to the windows 8 program. . Don't do a complete system restore though you will lose all your apps and it will still not work. The windows person I spoke to on the
 phone was of no help either. The only thing that worked was getting those new install codes. Sorry if this doesn't help much.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 folder taking up way too much space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toibit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 folder taking up way too much space</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 PC recently ran out of disk space on the system disk, and this is how big my Windows folder is at the moment.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/039c0fa3-0f35-40a1-baee-ec293880c6cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/039c0fa3-0f35-40a1-baee-ec293880c6cf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders which has sizeable volume include the following, and no other folders are over 1Gb in size</p>
<p>assembly - 1.14Gb</p>
<p>System32 - 5.85Gb</p>
<p>SysWOW64 - 1.51Gb</p>
<p>WinSxS - 7.32Gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various methods I could find online to reduce my Windows folder's size, including delete temp folder content, disk cleaner, turn off system restore, turn off file backup, my virtual ram is only 256mb since I have 32Gb of ram that's hardly a
 problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question at this point is what's taking up the remainder of my hard drive space other than the files listed (I have hidden files showing so there are no invisible folders that I didn't obtain the size of) and also how do I reduce the size of this Windows
 folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not as much worried about why it's so big, as long as I can reduce its size to allow for some Windows updates to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any response!</p>

            <p>1. In Disk Cleanup ensure you clicked the <em>Clean system files</em> button (or launch DC as admin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Don't manually delete any files from Windows\Installers or elsewhere. Run <a href="http://www.homedev.com.au/free/patchcleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PatchCleaner</a> to see if there are any orphaned installers you can safely remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Your screenshots are way too small to see anything properly. Might want to keep that in mind for next time.</p>

    <title>Service Host Local System processes using very high amounts of disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melodyxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Service Host Local System processes using very high amounts of disk speed&#63;</h2>
                    Hey, recently I updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Prior to updating I never seemed to have this issue.<br />
<br />
My computer is running a mobile Intel i7, a 1tb HDD, a 25gb SSD, and 16gb of ram.<br />
<br />
Now, at random my computer will use very high amounts of disk speed, to the point where task manager tells me it's at 100%. It is not constant, but rather happens randomly. In doing this, bad things will happen, for example today Skype popped up with an error
 saying it needed to close because of low memory. So I loaded up task manager, closed Skype because it wasn't responding, and then saw my disk was maxed out.<br />
<br />
The culprit tasks was the 'Service Host Local System' processes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I previously ran into this issue and searched for answers, and the only solution I saw was disabling the automatic windows sharing (seeding) setting. Of course I did this because I don't have the kind of internet to seed all day, but still the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to start the computer in safe mode and check. If usage is normal, place the computer in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Start the computer in safe mode</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 10ssss, hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, youâ€™ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3: </strong></span></span><span>Run System File Checker tool</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></p>

            I dont believe its any specific program thats and issue I think theres some sort of bug with Service Host: Local System. I can understand its the backbone of what keeps Windows running as it all allocated there but its using an obscene amount of resources
 such as my RAM, I left my PC on overnight only to open Task Manager and see this program is using about 10GB of my 16GB of RAM. As I upgraded from Windows 7(Upgraded to Windows 10) I never had this issue, RAM usage barely touched 40% even when opening some
 games. I even had to re-enable paging as I thought that would remedy the issue but it simply hasnt.

                    My internet has been broken on my pc for the past few days after trying to make homegroup work. I have spents the past few days non stop trying to fix this problem. Today I ran a scan on norton as yesterday I thought it might be a virus so i bought a copy
 of norton but now i don't think it is so much. On norton i have found a program that runs a system scan and tells you what is and isn't working and it told me something nothing else has been telling me (not that anything else actually told me anything in the
 first place...) which is that i was not connected to my default gateway. I clicked fix now and that connected it but at least a minute after that it stopped working again so i did a system scan again and again it said i am not connected to my gateway. What
 can i do to make this stop. I am pretty sure that this is the problem and i want to know what is causing it and what i can do to fix it. I will post any extra information that you guys need as I pretty much have nothing else to d

<h2>            PC Auto Starts &#40;from supposed Shut Down status&#41; After Upgrading to Windows-10</h2>
                    <p>The PC: Asus P5Q Motherboard, Intel Quad Core Processor, Nvidia GeForce 9600 GT, Ethernet connection to broadband hub plus NetGear Wifi adapter (disabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the history:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Win7 from DVD then upgraded to full spec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded Win10 USB/ISO installer &amp; created USB installer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgraded Win7 to Win10 using the USB installer, all seemed fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powered of (using Shut Down) PC and 5 mins later it powered itself up!</p>
<p>There were a few notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC continues to auto-power on, from a Shut Down status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked the internet and some other people have this issue with various solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turned off the ethernet card's ability to wake the PC. Turned-off Hibernate as an option. Wifi connection remains disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked Asus P5Q BIOS for any auto start options - couldn't find any. &nbsp;There's no Asus BIOS upgrades available for Win10; however, the PC was built for Win XP &amp; hasn't had any BIOS upgrades since this. &nbsp;Auto start-up did not happen under the Win7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked Tasks: hundreds of Win10 tasks exist!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why would upgrading to Win10 from Win7 cause the PC to randomly auto-start up?</p>

            I also checked the Event Logs and these imply that full shut-down is not happening, but Sleep is. I can only guess this is because Fast Start is enabled which is over-riding all the Power Settings I described above.

<h2>            Really slow response time.</h2>
                    
<p>Last night I played minecraft. So when I turned one my Xbox one today. It goes right back to it and trys to resume play. But I wasnt sign in yet. After I signed in, it automatically restarts the game.... Why Is that? (question 1) here's the kicker. After
 all that. I'm signed in and ready to go. I press the middle button and go to the dashboard. And now out of the blue, the response time is really delayed (Navigating through the menus) About 2 minutes before the action occurs. It's gotten worst too pretty much
 to the point where the only action that works is holding the middle button and to turn the system off. That's all i can make my xbox one do. I did have a game in the disc tray which I was able to remove. Then I tryed to insert the game and see if it would
 correct itself in the game. But an error popped up saying literally word for word (for some reason Fifa 15 has taken too long to start 0x8027025a) what's going on here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any time you run into a sluggish response time like this (which can be caused by a weird login-resume anomaly like you mentioned, or a memory glut from being used for extended periods with no restart) is definitely a hard reset. To do this, you actually
 want to hold the power button for 8-10 seconds (until you see the power brick light flash orange once) then let go until the power brick light goes solid orange. Then it will be safe to power back on and it should be working smoothly!</p>

    <title>Windows Mail Sync Failure after Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Mail Sync Failure after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded my Acer P3 Tablet last night to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>The default email app will not synchronize or work and displays Error Code: 08x000ffff.</p>
<p>I have checked the account and email setting and tried to set up from scratch a separate Outlook.com email account, however I still receive the same synch problem and same error message.</p>
<p>My email and accounts all use: &nbsp;format "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", but I note the server is set to "m.hotmail.com"?</p>
<p>I tried to change to "s.outlook.com" but this did not help.</p>
<p>I suspect there is something wrong in the settings.</p>
<p>All email was working fine as of yesterday in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I can sent and receive to my account online through "www.outlook.com".</p>
<p>So I suspect that the upgrade has screwed up the settings?</p>

            I also have problems with updating the emails on this application. &nbsp;It only shows emails from the day that Windows 10 was installed but no later emails are coming through. &nbsp;(They are shown on the actual email accounts at Yahoo and Hotmail, so later emails
 are available to read there.) &nbsp;The Synch function may not be working, I don't know.

            <p>Read the first link in my reply.</p>
<p>This process fixed several issues on my computer including Mail App issues.</p>
<p>*****************************************************************************************</p>
<p><strong>New repair process for Windows 10 PC Mail App problems.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;After my Original Upgrade to Windows 10, I had problems found by&nbsp;<br />
SFC /SCANNOW that could not be repaired by SFC or DISM. Now my SFC scans are CLEAN.<br />
<br />
<strong>Use this ISO file repair install,</strong>&nbsp;link to the process. (Keep your files and Apps)<br />
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>After the process I did the following.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I checked for and installed Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to right click on my clock (bottom right of Desktop) and change it to the correct time zone.<br />
</p>
<p>I also had to open my Mail App and for each email account I opened SETTINGS then OPTIONS and CHECKED the BANNERS and SOUNDS boxes (they were unchecked).<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Now my EMAIL notifications are working perfectly.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><strong>The ISO file repair install could be the solution to the EMAIL NOTIFICATION problems.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem I found was that MBAM would not open in my User Account. I used the MBAM uninstall tool then reinstalled MBAM. Everything works fine now. THANK YOU. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should have Uninstalled MBAM before doing the Windows 10 Repair Install. I left Windows Defender running with no problems.&nbsp;<strong>The Windows 10 Repair Install clearly states remove any third party Anti-Virus program before running the procedure.</strong><br />
Link to MBAM clean uninstall and reinstall process.<br />

<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Don't forget to check for updates, reset your time zone and go to Mail App settings &gt; options and check banners and sounds when you are finished. Doing a Restart would also be a good idea after everything else.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>

            <p>As suspected the fault was with Microsoft's default&nbsp;account settings for Outlook.com in Australia.</p>
<p>I did not have to do anything, and a recent windows update and patch fixed the issue.</p>
<p>When I opened Microsoft mail today I received a notification screen advising that my settings were out of date, and that when I activated the "Fix settings", my accounts started working and I have received mail for the first time on Windows 10.</p>
<p>The server settings for Mail were reset to: "bay407-m.hotmail.com"</p>
<p>It did take a while to implement the fix 5-6 minutes of watching the Microsoft Circles of Doom rotate on my screen&nbsp;and the pleasant message "working on it", but it appears to be working now for all my Outlook accounts.</p>

            <p>Not helpful. That does not work as "Change Mailbox sync settings" the phrase is not highlighted. You cannot click on it. The only thing allowing action is "Delete account". I think I will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wish I could delete Windows 10. Difficulty in the simplest of tasks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've tried all of the suggested solution in this chain,&nbsp; and still have a problem syncing and sending email&nbsp;for my outlook email via my Microsoft 10 based laptop.</p>
<p>syncing fails with this report;</p>
<p>We're having a problem syncing snt407-m.hotmail.com at the moment</p>
<p>error code 0x86000c0a</p>
<p>Try again later,</p>
<p>- this has been the case for over a week.</p>
<p>All emails are being returned 'delivery status notification 'failure'</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ipad can access and send my outlook mail without issue thank goodness!</p>
<p>
</p><p>can any one please suggest a solution&nbsp;?</p>
