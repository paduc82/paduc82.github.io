<h2>            resource kit&#58; need registry reference on disc set or BDROM-XL disc &#40;whatever&#41;</h2>
                    <p>at LEAST come out with a registry reference in book form, I don't care if it's multiple volumes or if it's on a disc set or blu-ray BDR-XL disc, I will buy it!a person would be willing to buy the drive to get that information...</p>
<p>I was VERY disappointed with what turned out to be only an average user guide for windows 7 when I bought the windows 7 resource kit. I want to throw the book back for a refund - my whol reason for getting it was to get registry entries information so I
 would not have to dig into Microsoft binaries and thus break the EULA (dear Microsoft Legal Dept, please at least allow us to look into Microsoft binaries for strings so we can customize/optimize our computers!).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>like the power management stuff. LOADS of registry entries there I don't quite understand and some of them just only are a possibility because they have not been set and so are not in the registry, like the really important min and max processor core parking
 stuff which maximizes CPU usage instead of making 1/2 of them disabled 100% of the time which is the default, but I could use this stuff to help properly temper this 150W liquid-cooled CPU (and the intel 4th gen has 220W max - ouch - how do you cool THAT?
 liquid nitrogen?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>traditionally, very useful registry entries were documented in the XP or older win9x resource kits - possible values, keys, data type etc. and what it does and how to effect the change. but not anymore. please fix. and also, please fix the core parking thing
 so we can use the whole CPU. some of those core parking entries just don't exist, and need to be set and because of this and Attribute=1 I think, they don't show in Power Optoins in the control panel. so we don't even get to set them in the control panel because
 somebody disabled us from viewing them. and they are not documented (but at least consistent in this area), so only some guessing needs to occur. I stress tested my box to finish adjustments to the % cpu limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for your reference, this is my article for windows 7, which probably also applies to windows 10 since it likely hasn't changed:</p>

    <title>Adding a comma between numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjones72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding a comma between numbers</h2>
                    
<p>I would like a code to add comma's between numbers. The number is taken from a text box called txtNumber. The number in the txtNumber can be from a min of&nbsp;3 digit's long to a max of 9 digit's. Ex.. If the number is 123 i would like it to be 1,2,3 If the
 number is 012345678 i would like it to me 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 I would like it to be put into a string if possible.</p>
<p>Thanks Mike</p>

<p>I don't program in "dotnet", which is what I think your Visual Studio programming language is based on, so I don't know how to code it for you. However, here is another way to do what you asked that uses a traditonal loop and string functions...</p>
<p>For X = 1 To Len(txtNumber)<br />
&nbsp; Answer = Answer &amp; Mid(txtNumber, X, 1)<br />
&nbsp; If X &lt; Len(txtNumber) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer = Answer &amp; ","<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
Next</p>
<p>Perhaps you will find this easier to translate this&nbsp;into the programming language you are using.</p>

<h2>            Unable to use my MS account on mobile devices</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble using my MS account on mobile devices:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what works / does not work on my&nbsp;on my Android device OnePlus Two with Lollipop 5.1:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I can log onto my MS account from Word installed from the Office Word app.</li><li>I can not log onto my MS account from OneNote. I get an error message "There is a problem, We can't complete this task. Try again. Error code 80004005.</li><li>I can not log onto my MS account from OneDrvie.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also have similar issues logging onto my MS account using OneNote, OneDrive and Outlook on my iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can log onto my MS account through Internet Explorer on my PC as well as Safari on my Mac. Therefore the user name and password is not the issue. Nor is the account disabled or blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a second MS account, with that account I can logon to OneNote, OneDrvice and Outlook both on Android and iPad, so I think this is related to something in my MS account?</p>

    <title>Extra onedrive shortcut in navigation pane in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extra onedrive shortcut in navigation pane in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Onedrive has been very unreliable for our company.&nbsp; It will lock up and crash and users will lose their entire configuration.&nbsp; They will have to log back in and re-sync everything from scratch (sharepoint sites included).&nbsp; This happened to me recently, and
 now I have two onedrive - company name icons in my navigation pane in file explorer.&nbsp; One of them points to my actual onedrive.&nbsp; The other one doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like it thought it was created a new folder as it's listed as OneDrive - company name(1), but when you click on the link you get a location is not available error.(see screenshot)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f6d51c3-d2ac-4f11-8e31-c52db83f95f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f6d51c3-d2ac-4f11-8e31-c52db83f95f3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling onedrive and reinstalling again but it keeps the extra onedrive icon.&nbsp; It's not necessarily causing problems, but it's annoying and doesn't seem to be proper functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to remove this extra onedrive shortcut?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The duplicate <strong>OneDrive</strong> shortcut usually shows up when you use OneDrive on other computers or stations, or if you've encountered issues when syncing your files. To isolate your concern, we'd like to verify if you're using
<strong>OneDrive</strong> for business. <br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>Eileen,</p>
<p>I understand if you're syncing multiple accounts you'll see multiple onedrive shortcuts.&nbsp; My company uses office 365 so we were using onedrive for business but have since migrated everyone to the "next generation" client (onedrive.exe).&nbsp; I have a feeling
 something got hung up during one of my onedrive crashes and when I attempted to log back in and sync, onedrive found the original folder was still there ( onedrive - company name ) and attempted to create a new folder ( onedrive - company name(1) ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several things like adding that folder back to my user directory, which allowed me to click the link but that was it.&nbsp; I even tried removing onedrive, re adding it, and using the folder with the one as the new onedrive location.&nbsp; It then let me access
 onedrive via both shortcuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually solved the problem by uninstalling onedrive, deleting all onedrive folders, and going through the registry and finding all the entries that were pointing to onedrive -company name(1) which I understand is probably not the best solution but it
 has fixed the duplicate icons.&nbsp; I used this web page as a starting point to know which entries to delete -&nbsp;https://www.windowscentral.com/how-remove-onedrive-file-explorer-windows-10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then reinstalled onedrive and I have only one icon in my nav pane and it seems to be working fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, the new onedrive has been very buggy for our company and I have had to do this process for several users in our company as after onedrive crashes, they will be logged out and have to start from scratch.</p>

            Dear LowellTuttle 
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />How do you know that they are bounced back if the emails did not reach your address ? Please share the screenshot of full NDR ( remember to remove personal data from it ) In this thread you will find tips on how to insert screenshot into message <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            The e mail is sent to my GoDaddy office365 outlook account address.&nbsp; This happens and I know from visiting the website forum.&nbsp; They send the same message to my Yahoo e mail and I get it.&nbsp; They sent the bounce back notice to that yahoo e mail and it shows
 the reason why it bounced back.&nbsp; I will try to screen shot here...

<p>Hi, LowellTuttle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the NDR you share, those emails are possibly blocked by your cybersecurity protection called proofpoint. If this is undesired, you may try to check the configuration of this protection in your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are using GoDaddy Office 365 account, it would be better to report to GoDaddy because they can do better in this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ariel</p>
        </p>

<p>Even if you update the device via FOTA (in which case Social app stays on the phone), I would still strongly recommend downloading the standalone Facebook &amp; Twitter clients from Nokia Store as those provide a better user experience.

<p>as far as I recall, video streaming on this device model from e.g. Youtube never worked with full screen 320x240 resolution, just 176x144. actually the original sales start SW (3.60) didn't have video streaming support at all - the feature was added in previous
 5.92 SW update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as for local video playback - need to check this. downgrading is not unfortunately possible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>btw. India variants for the update should be now available via Nokia Suite. FOTA will follow probably tomorrow.</p>

    <title>Setup Failed WDMC with HTC HD2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> polonthi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setup Failed WDMC with HTC HD2</h2>
                    Hi, Did a ROM Upgrade with the HTC HD2 to solve an SMS issue. Afterwards I tried to reconnect to my laptop using Windows Mobile Device Center but every time I got the message "Setup Failed" please run setup.exe again. Which of course when I do give the
 same result. Tried to uninstall the WDMC and reinstall but it's not showing as installed. The device is shown as driver could not be loaded.<br />
<br />
Without the activesync I'm pretty much stuck with a nice useless phone.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?

<br />
Where do you get the "Setup Failed" error?&nbsp; On the phone?&nbsp; or on the PC?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a WMDC error, or an external error?<br />
<br />
Let us know!

            Hi David,<br />
<br />
Seems to me a WDMC error from my laptop. The Phone has no issues connecting to other machines.<br />
<br />
The "set up" failed comes from the PC. I&nbsp;connected the phone on my Desktop running XP and it works fine (Activesync). I manage to synchronize with my Office Server as well.<br />
<br />
Now when I connect to my Laptop running Vista it check to install drivers&nbsp;and fails. Then it mentions "Setup failed".<br />
<br />
I tried to connect to the Laptop of my colleague also running Vista and all goes well till I can see the "HTC HD2" icon when running "File explorer".<br />
<br />
On my laptop it doesn't pass that point.<br />
<br />
I tried to uninstall the WDMC then install again, uninstall the drivers in computer hardware and reinstall but nothing works.<br />
<br />
Would love to have a solution besides doing a data backup and reinstall all my hard drive from scratch.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your time.<br />
<br />
Philippe

            Windows Phone devices have a limit of 2&nbsp;partnerships that you can connect to, so it seems that you might be exhausting that by connecting to as many devices as you are (the desktop running XP, the Office Server, and your colleague's computer, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; Since
 I don't know if you are deleting partnerships to make these connections, or if you are connecting as a guest (no partnership involved), I can't be sure of the root cause.<br />
<br />
If you have a dependable backup program that you trust on your phone, I would consider backing up the entire device, then hard-reset to see if you can then connect with your Vista laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can, then the problem is likely a software incompatibility between
 the two devices and you can either re-add all of your applications until the problem re-occurs, or you can restore your device and start removing programs until the problem goes away...

            Didn't register those partnership but anyway would imagine the error message would come at the moment of creating the partnership not at the moment of running the installation of WDMC to get a connection with my phone.<br />
<br />
Already did hard-reset on my phone before as it's easy to redo the setup but didn't change anything.<br />
<br />
The problem is the laptop and WDMC. Is there a way to make sure previous installation of WDMC is totally erased including drivers, registry,... ?

            Hello!<br />
<br />
Ah, you said initially that the problem was when you were connecting, so I wasn't interpreting this as a WMDC installation problem on your PC.&nbsp; Also, the way you're writing the description of the problems, I get the sense that you are plugging in the phone
 when you are getting the errors, so I would recommend that you <strong>DO NOT PLUG IN THE PHONE</strong> for this entire sequence below.&nbsp; I agree that you need to do a clean install of WMDC.&nbsp; Try this:<br />
<br />
1.) UnInstall WMDC from your PC.<br />
2.) Reboot your computer.<br />
3.) Redownload WMDC (using the 64-bit version if you have a 64bit OS) to make sure your copy is fresh and uncompromised.<br />
4.) Install the newly downloaded WMDC on to your computer.<br />
<br />
If you receive any error messages, please report them here <strong>BEFORE YOU PLUG IN YOUR PHONE</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how things go...

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the follow up.<br />
<br />
Now I have done this a few times already. Uninstall "Windows Device Mobile Center", uninstall "Windows Device Mobile Center Driver Update", reinstall all new. Download again (I have a 32bits system confirmed from Computer Properties)<br />
<br />
Always goes to the same result: "Setup Failed, To try again to install Windows Device Mobile Center go to c:\Windows\WindowsMobile and run Setup.Exe" which then give the same message back right away. This always come after "Installing Device Driver Software",
 get a message "Unindentified Device" - "Driver installed successfully". Then this message "Setup Failed, To try again to install Windows Device Mobile Center go to c:\Windows\WindowsMobile and run Setup.Exe".<br />
<br />
At that time my phone isn't plugged in.<br />
<br />
I'm quite ok in IT and before I ask for help it's really that I have tried all the usual basics, Reboot, Reinstall, Re-download, deconnect,...<br />
<br />
Only idea I have now is to reinstall Vista after doing a backup of my data and reinstall all my softwares but it's a long process so wanted to exhaust all options before doing so.<br />
<br />
Now one thing that I find strange is even I uninstall WDMC the folder WindowsMobile is still in Windows will all kind of files like "setup", "wmdcbase", "wmdcsync". Shouldn't those be deleted after doing the "uninstall"?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.

            Let's try another tactic to see if the trouble is with the PC.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Create another Vista profile (e.g. "test") for the computer, log into that new profile, let it go through the motions of auto-configuring your Internet setting on IE8 (or whatever), then try running that WMDC installation program again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If the problem goes away, then the problem was due to some kind of corruption on your original profile.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it doesn't go away, then there could be something else at work (for example, you could have a Virus or Trojan that is messing-up your system).<br />
<br />
Let us know how that works out...

<br />
I'm having the EXACT same problem with my HTC Fuze.&nbsp; I thought your idea to create a "test" account was brilliant...so I tried it.&nbsp; Much to my chagrin, the results were exactly the same.&nbsp; After plugging in the phone in, I get a taskbar notification that the
 device driver software is being installed (Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adapter is searching for preconfigured&nbsp; drivers); however, even after 10+ minutes it will never recognize the phone.<br />
<br />
I've tried all the same as Polonthi above (un/reintalling WMDC) but nothing.&nbsp; Is there a WMDC removal tool.&nbsp; I'm desperate to sync my phone again without having to rebuild my laptop.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your consideration!<br />

<p>Nokia used to produce Mac versions of the PC Suite software back in the long-gone days of the early Communicator series, but Apple applied pressure for that to stop, because they wanted all Apple users to sync with their own iSync software.</p>

<p>Regretably, Apple is not great at ensuring compatibility with all phones from all manufacturers. For more information, go to
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/product-support/isync/compatibility-and-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/product-support/isync/compatibility-and-download</a> - you will see that the original Nokia 8800 is compatible with iSync but that subsequent versions like 880 Sirocco, 8800 Arte etc. are not yet covered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iSync itself is made by Apple, and the Nokia site will link to Apple to download it. Nokia does provide some plugins to make some common models work, but I don't think that later 8800 versions are included. It is possible to search for third-party plgins
 that may solve the issue if your 8800 is not the original model.</p>

    <title>Conversion failure&#58; from Microsoft Office 365&#39;s Word 2016 to a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Conversion failure&#58; from Microsoft Office 365&#39;s Word 2016 to a PDF- &#34;The export failed due to an unexpected error&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am desperately trying to convert a Word 2016 document to a PDF. &nbsp;Converting this document to PDF format is critical to my business. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Word document is large and complex (55.4 MB due to lots of graphics, complex tables, inserted text boxes and it is 78 pages long). &nbsp;I definitely know how to convert from Word to PDF, so be assured this is not the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I get with each attempt is: &nbsp;"The export failed due to an unexpected error." &nbsp;No error code given... just the message quoted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and, yes, I have rebooted, too. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent the last 50 minutes in a chat with a tech rep at the Microsoft Contact Answer Desk and the tech was unable to help me. &nbsp;He suggested I get rid of Office 2016 and drop back to Office 2013. &nbsp;THAT was extremely!!! disappointing, as there is no guarantee
 it would help and I have grown to LOVE Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am begging for some bright and savvy individual to rescue me with some sage advice to solve my problem! &nbsp;Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Pravbhavathi, &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all 3 updates that you suggested, restarted and then attempted the conversion, with no success (and the same message). &nbsp;I then went to your link and followed the instructions to repair, then attempted the conversion again, with no success there either.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think I need to uninstall my trial version of Office 365 and re-install? &nbsp;(I am probably going to buy it after the trial, IF I can resolve this critical issue.) &nbsp;If your answer is yes, then , since I am only 7 days into my current 30-day trial and
 I am worried about an inability to access a 2nd free trial. &nbsp; My free trial came with the new laptop I purchased a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I transferred my document to my old laptop (which is incredibly slow) which has Microsoft Word 2013 on it to see if maybe my file had gotten corrupted but it was not. &nbsp;Since I had created the file in Word 2016, transferring it over and reading it in Word
 2013 was disheartening as the fonts changed and graphics moved, but I WAS successful in getting it saved to a PDF, soooo... this tells me Word 2016 is the problem! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get a "work around" suggestion from Doug below, which I will try next but I REALLY am hoping you or someone else will be able to find me a permanent fix that won't require me to dump Word 2016 and go backwards to Word 2013....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding to my plea for help and hoping you have another idea for me.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding to my need. &nbsp;Before I try your suggestion, I am wondering how this will help me since my issue is not printing out my document for myself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that I sell my work on the internet and need to upload my product as a PDF for people to see, purchase and then THEY need to be able to print it. &nbsp;Turning my Word doc into a PDF changes it size from 55.4 MB down to about 6 MB for my customers
 and keeps the document's features from skewing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I misunderstanding the result I would get by following your suggestion? &nbsp;If so, can you help me better understand? &nbsp;I look forward to hearing back from you or anyone else who might be able to help me. &nbsp;I'm desperate!</p>

<p>Ok, Doug. &nbsp;That makes good and I am VERY grateful to have a stop-gap measure like this to get my product uploaded as a PDF. &nbsp;I plan to give it a go tomorrow!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also appreciate your opinion regarding&nbsp;uninstall during the trial period for Office 365. &nbsp;I'd hate to lose my evaluation period since I am only a week into it and need to see if there are other glitches before I shell out money to buy.</p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft Band 2 Charger Dangerous Short Circuit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonybxxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Band 2 Charger Dangerous Short Circuit</h2>
                    <p>Hi I want to raise a potentially dangerous problem with the Charger design on the Band 2.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was trying to re-arrange my usual birds-nest of various chargers for Lumia Phone, Ipad &amp; Microsoft&nbsp;Band 2.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Band 2 charger was plugged into&nbsp;an adapter but not into the band, the magnets in the charge head&nbsp;attracted an unplugged USB-B charger and it short circuited across the&nbsp;pins on the band charger head and caused the RCD circuit breakers in&nbsp;my house to trip
 leaving me in darkness!</p>
<p>It seems like poor design to put prominent charging pins next to a magnet- surely the pins should be recessed so that they cannot be shorted in this fashion?</p>
<p>As Microsoft do not send a charger plug with the unit- any cheap&nbsp;charger with poor protection could be used- without RCD protection surely this would be a fire risk.</p>
<p>Has this element of design been risk assessed properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

    <title>Mac commands randomly stop working in Office 365 PPT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heyjoegfx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac commands randomly stop working in Office 365 PPT</h2>
                    <p>This occurs when using Mac Office 365 PPT (Normal / Insider Slow / Insider Fast - mainly on OS X Mojave, but I noticed it occasionally prior...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll hit CMD-C, X or V and some other standard commands that just randomly stop responding in PPT. I can still accomplish them with the right-click menu and switch to other apps like Apple Notes or Adobe Photoshop, etc and ALL those commands continue to
 function as expected, just not in PowerPoint - it requires a quit and re-open and then it seems to function appropriately for a random period of time. Could work fine for 1 hour, or 2 days... My machines themselves get frequent reboots, and this happens across
 laptop keyboards, external USB keyboards and bluetooth keyboards on several different generations of Mac hardware that is currently all on up-to-date Mojave or a beta thereof. I've been unable to isolate it to any specific configuration.</p>

<p>HeyJoe, why do I get the feeling that you know a whole lot more about PowerPoint than Tina does?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's obvious to me that there are no troubleshooting steps you can take to rectify this problem. I accept your diagnosis that there is something not quite right with Mojave and PowerPoint. I bet others are affected, but their level of frustration hasn't
 risen to the level that is has with a power user like yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you have multiple machines with various installs of Office, you are the perfect test candidate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With each machine, please go to PowerPoint preferences &gt; Privacy and make sure the box for Help Us Improve: Send full diagnostic data is checked. This box will be checked automatically and cannot be unchecked for machines in the Insider Fast program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this box is checked, if you send a Frown using the Smile button in PowerPoint, a snapshot of your PowerPoint installation is sent along with your trouble report submission. If you would send a frown the moment you experience the problem with any Mac,
 the PowerPoint team can dig into the state of PowerPoint when the problem occurs. It is important to send the frown before quitting PowerPoint. It is important to send a report each time you encounter the issue. It is especially important with Insider Fast
 builds. The more reports, the better. Then the developer team can see what's going on and try to figure out whether the problem is PowerPoint or Mac OS. If it turns out to be Mac OS, they will submit a bug to Apple.</p>
<p>

    <title>SOLVED &#42;Unable to send Roadrunner&#47;Spectrum Emails through - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sheri g-c  say:</h3>
<h2>            SOLVED &#42;Unable to send Roadrunner&#47;Spectrum Emails through Outlook&#42; SOLVED</h2>
                    <p>I actually solved this after 2 days of research and it would not let me reply to the previous threads so I thought I would post it here in hopes to help others!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying NUMEROUS things suggested by x y z all over the net, to Spectrum customer service???...this is what worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized my roadrunner email being a set up as a POP3 account was a problem and needed to be changed to IMAP.&nbsp; I did this process with a test account before I changed my main accounts for fear of losing everything, but this worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete your email account from Outlook.&nbsp; FIRST I did a backup:</p>
<p>In Outlook 2013, hit "File" in upper left hand corner and select "Open and Export"</p>
<p>Next, select "Import/Export"</p>
<p>A box will pop up, select "Export to a File" and click NEXT</p>
<p>Select "Outlook Data File (.pst)" and Finish</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now select FILE again and this time select "Account Settings" on the right. From here you can delete the problematic email account.&nbsp; Once it is deleted, (from the same "Account Settings") you can then add an account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now add the same account.</p>
<p>Your Name : this should be how you want your name to display on your email</p>
<p>Email: full email address</p>
<p>Password: your password for this account</p>
<p>***Before you hit Next, be sure to check the select at the bottom left which says "Manual Setup or Additional Server...."</p>
<p>On the next page:</p>
<p>Email: Full address</p>
<p>Account Type: IMAP (it should be on POP3 as a default, you need to click on that and change it to IMAP)</p>
<p>Incoming Server: mail.brighthouse.com&nbsp; (this was so for me in the Tampa Bay area...some of you may have had Time Warner so check on your provider's site)</p>
<p>Outgoing Server: mail.brighthouse.com</p>
<p>User Name:&nbsp; FULL email address ex. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Password: same pswd used to sign into this email</p>
<p>The box "Remember Password" should be checked below</p>
<p>DO NOT hit Next or Finish...Click "More Settings" on the bottom right.</p>
<p>Click on "Outgoing Server" tab and select/check "My outgoing SMTP server requires authentication".&nbsp; Make sure "use my same settings" is selected below that.</p>
<p>Now click on the "Advanced" tab and set up the servers as follows:</p>
<p>Incoming Server (IMAP) 993</p>
<p>Below that : "Use the following type of encryption" select SSL</p>
<p>Outgoing Server (SMTP) 587</p>
<p>Below that: "Use the following type of encryption" select TLS *make sure once you select this to change the Outgoing SMTP to 587 as it may change</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've finished your advanced settings, hit OK and then Finish. Your email account will now appear and should auto-populate all your emails, folders, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck! I hope it works for you.&nbsp; I understand your frustration as it took me days to figure this out and no real help from Spectrum (oh, the email works from their server so it's a Microsoft problem). NOO..all my other non Spectrum accounts
 work just fine in Outlook!</p>

<h2>            There was an attempt to put malcious software onto my computer</h2>
                    I had a popup from what looked like a malicious site 'servebeer.com'.&nbsp; It was posing as Microsoft Security Essentials Alert.&nbsp; It was saying that I needed to clean my computer to avoid a system failure.&nbsp; I did not run or save the program that it was trying
 to send onto my computer.&nbsp; My computer is working fine.&nbsp; I have McAfee and it is not picking up any viruses on my computer.&nbsp; How can I be sure that nothing of an infectious nature got onto my computer before I start working with personally sensitive information?&nbsp;
 In looking at the Microsoft Virus cleanup tool, this servebeer virus is not on the list of malware included.

            <p>Perform a scan with the McAfee software if you have not already done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these type of malware attacks are difficult to keep up with because they trick you into letting them install. They usually come from an infected web site, and usually through an advertisement. You get a pop-up from the infection and you click
 it to close the pop-up - which allows the infection to install. They can also be delivered in a "drive-by" fashion with no action needed by the user due to the system being unpatched, no matter what security software is running.</p>
<p>When you encounter one of these fake virus pop-ups while browsing, immediately do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>-Do not touch any browser window to close it or browse further</font></span>.</p>
<p>-Use the key combination &lt;ALT&gt;+&lt;F4&gt; to close all running programs, especially the web browser</p>
<p>--or--</p>
<p>-Immediately press Ctrl-Alt-Del and bring up Task Manager and forcibly end all instances of iexplore.exe, if using Internet Explorer, or the executable for your browser for any other web browser.</p>
<p>--or--</p>
<p>-Go to Start/Shut Down and restart the PC without touching any browser windows.</p>
<p>-If you used task manager to close browser instances, reboot the machine.</p>
<p>-Then go to Control Panel/Internet Options and delete all temporary Internet Files and cookies. If you are using an alternate web browser, open the browser settings to do the same - delete the local cached files and cookies.</p>
<p>-Perform a full scan with MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above steps should prevent the infection from taking hold.</p>

<p>Besides an up to date legitimate antivirus program such as MSE, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:</p>
<p>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at the latest version for your operating system and updated with all patches.</p>
<p>-In Internet Explorer 8, 9, or 10, use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON and not running with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>-<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline"><font>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</font></span></p>

<h2>            Account lockout policy for Office 365 and Azure</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found the following information from this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj943764.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Account Lockout</p>
</td>
<td colspan="2">
<p>After 10 unsuccessful logon attempts (wrong password), the user will need to solve a CAPTCHA dialog as part of logon.</p>
<p>After a further 10 unsuccessful logon attempts (wrong password) and correct solving of the CAPTCHA dialog, the user will be locked out for a time period. Further incorrect passwords will result in an exponential increase in the lockout time period.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I have the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the duration of the lockout? It seems to be around 15 minutes but can you please confirm?
</li><li>What if I don't get the CAPTCHA and get locked out after 10 attempts? </li><li>Can the lockout policy be amended to change the lockout timer and attempts? </li></ol>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Hi RosieHall,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the email was sent a year ago, and the members of that Distribution list may have changed for some time. As far as I know it is not feasible to directly check the email was sent to.&nbsp;

<p>Moreover, if your admin has enable Office 365 litigation hold for all your mailboxes in the organization, your admin can try to run Office 365 Content search to search for the specific email then
 check if he could find the real users that the email was sent to.&nbsp; For your reference

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the suggestion above doesn't work, as we talked before, it may not be able to find the real recipients of that old email, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hello RosieHall,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this problem. As the email was sent a long time ago, if the content search is not suitable for your concern, as we talked before, it is not feasible to check who the emails were
 really sent to now.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>According to your description, you may need to check the real recipients for old emails in your organization, if your office 365 global admin didn't set up Litigation hold for the user mailboxes in your organization,
 it is recommended please try to enable it for all of you ( Assume the feature is availble in your organization). After the feature was enabled for you, your admin could try to use the content search to search specific emails related information in the future,
 and it may more convenient for you to handle similar scenarios in the future, thanks.

<h2>            Zune incompatible with Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    Is the Zune software incompatible with Windows 8.1?<br />
I used the Zune software on Windows 8, but I just completed clean installations of Windows 8.1 on a laptop and a desktop, and now the Zune software fails to install.&nbsp; Now my "media" PC doesn't even recognize my Zune player.<br />
<br />
I made sure that all current patches and fixes were installed, and even tried to run a "Fix It" utility I found on a Zune support page. The Fix-It utility said it was incompatible with my operating system.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this problem? Is there a workaround? Above all, I still love my 80G Zune and dread the day I end up migrating to an IPod.<br />

            <p>Hey there</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunatly, Zune was only designed for Windows 7. This means by upgrading to Windows 8, your PC does not meet the system requirments for it to be installed onto your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, its not the end of the world. You can use Xbox Music which I find better as its all saved online, and not your PC. You do not even need to purchase the music as you have a subscription fee, which is like your Xbox 360 gold subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get Xbox Music please go to: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/music</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When on Xbox Music, you can play it on your Phone, through the website, on your Xbox and even your windows 8 PC!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, I can say it was the best thing I did getting Xbox Music, and hope it is you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>SunkNath</p>

<h2>            Google Maps 4 and Buzz &#40;E72&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>So I understand that Google Maps 4, with the Buzz layer, should be available for Symbian. &nbsp;However, when I try to download it from m.google.com/maps it gives me a strange message that Maps isn't compatible with my 'mini'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else gotten Google Maps 4 installed?</p>

<p>I read your post about the new Google Maps 4 update (previous version was 3.31?) and it installed properly during my first try (I'm using Nokia E72 too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I don't think there's a "Buzz" version for the Symbian Google Maps 4 (it's not indicated in the comparison of features for the various Google Maps for Mobile versions.) &nbsp;It seems that the "Buzz" is only available for Android phones. &nbsp; I could be
 wrong here though.</p>

<p>The Installation from Google Maps 4 on my E72-1 (Euro1) works perfect. It comes with out the Buzz. However, check your language set first. Version 4.0.0 is also a RC candidate in my eyes. I am sure that we will see the Bug Fix from Google soon, with 4.0.1

<p>I downloaded Google Maps via the E72 - no issues to report about. As for the "Buzz" item, if you select options -&gt; layers -&gt; Buzz (is listed). Once activated, the "Buzz" icon appears on the map. Click on the speech bubble icon, and what appears to be twitterish
 shows on the screen.</p>

<p>And the Buzz layer works really well in the new Google Maps. &nbsp;I wasn't at all convinced about Buzz when I saw it in my Gmail account, but posting a geo-tagged Buzz from within Google Maps on my phone, and seeing Buzz(es?) posted by other people on my street,
 that's pretty cool!</p>

            I see. So the Buzz is a Layer which can be enabled in Google Maps 4. Any idea if I can use Buzz if the country selection doesn't list my country?

<strong>Fichier introuvable</strong> (File not found) in PowerShell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s an example</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows PowerShell, I deleted a communication site. The name of the site is simply
<strong>Communication Site </strong>and it was successfully deleted. </p>

<p>Few minutes later, I again followed the same steps to delete the same site and I received the same error which you mentioned in your post.</p>
<p>

<h2>            outlook 2016 - aol sent mail copied to aol inbox in outlook is not syncing</h2>
                    <p>I've been using outlook as a mail client and aol for personal mail for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that entire time, I have had a rule that creates a copy of any outgoing, AOL mail in my outlook aol imbox</p>
<p>It's worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, when I sync Outlook and AOL, those emails in my outlook inbox are not syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the problem is the way I have syncing setup in outlook.</p>
<p>Can someone help me troubleshoot?&nbsp; </p>

            Re: "But now, when I sync Outlook and AOL, those emails in my outlook inbox are not syncing."
<br />
<br />Am not a user of AOL but am curious about the above statement specifically in terms of "...........inbox are not sync'ing" so questions are
<br />
<br />#1 - What protocol (i.e. POP3 / Imap) is the email account configured as. If POP3, the &lt;Inbox&gt; is not sync'd but rather is a one-way download whereas an IMAP account would sync all email folders including the Sent Items folder.
<br />
<br />#2 - What error(s) (if any) are you encountering when trying to download/sync from your AOL account? It is possible that your AOL account has been merged with Yahoo and now uses 2 factor authentication which would require an &lt;App Password&gt; to be used in Outlook in order to connect with the account
<br />
<br />A background article........
<br />
<br />Yahoo and AOL will form new company called ... Oath

<p>Karl,</p>
<p>Using IMAP.</p>
<p>And, new mail on the server is showing up in Outlook;&nbsp; and mail deleted in Outlook is being deleted (I think) on the AOL server;&nbsp; it's only (I think) the sent mail copies in my outlook aol inbox that aren't syncing</p>
<p>No error messages.&nbsp; </p>

            Two things to check
<br />
<br />#1 - Set the &lt;Root&gt; folder to the &lt;Inbox&gt; in the Outlook IMAP settings if it's not already. Go to OL menu --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; highlight the IMAP account --&gt; &lt;Change&gt; --&gt; &lt;more Settings&gt; --&gt; &lt;Advanced&gt; tab
<br />
<br />#2 - Make sure that the checkbox for "Do not save copies of sent items" is not checked

            IS the Root folder set to the &lt;Inbox&gt;? When you view the folder tree via WebMail - to ask this another way - is there a Sent Items folder at the same level as the &lt;Inbox&gt;?

            <p>When emails disappear from the phone inbox, it is typically caused by the email program on a PC, that is set up to download and delete new mail on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows phone only displays what is currently available on the mail server - it does not download and store mail the way a PC often does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To work around this, adjust the mail account settings on the PC to delete mail after some days or weeks, or not at all, if there is plenty of space on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps?</p>

<h2>            Numbering not right in a multilevel list</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am writing chapters to my thesis in seperate documents which I&nbsp;will later combine.&nbsp; I have defined a new numbered list which I&nbsp;use with the section headings of my chapter.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am continuing a previous list and no matter what I do 4.1.1 is the next
 number when it should be 4.2.1.&nbsp; When I open the "set numbering value" box and select continue previous list 4.1.1 is shown in the preview&nbsp; and document.&nbsp; Even when I use the "advance value" selection and set the number to 4.2.1 the preview and document shows
 4.1.1 instead.&nbsp; Please help I need this to be the&nbsp;right value so that my figure numbering&nbsp;will be&nbsp;correct.</p>
