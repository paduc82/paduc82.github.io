<h2>            can not reply to emails in the spam folder</h2>
                    I can not respond to emails in the spam folder. while on the surface this may seem right , it is very stupid .My email is set to exclusive so I can keep my inbox from getting all gunked up . The problem is if you get a email from a ad posted on craigs
 list or any other email that you do not want in the inbox but still need to respond to the only way to do it is to either move it to the inbox(which will not happen ) or create a new folder and take many extra steps to do the same thing we used to be able
 to do. This just totally sucks! I now hate dealing with hotmail! Why is MS trying to be Apple and tell their customers what they want instead of letting us decide for our selves -THE WHOLE REASON WE US MS PRODUCTS TO BEGIN WITH- YOU ARE NOT APPLE ! all of
 this just moves me one step closer to linux. I could not even forward a scam abuse email to ms abuse (one that really needs to be looked into) what is wrong with you guys?

            no matter what you do short of a restart it will not go back to the program , start menu or desktop. I tried ctrl&gt;alt&gt;del&nbsp; - hitting Esc ect ect , but the only way to get the computer back is to restart it. all drivers are up to date and this issue never
 happens except when a xbox connected app is running and the computer goes to sleep.

            well the problem is not running the modern apps it is the black screen if the computer goes to sleep while they are running. I have been trying to report this bug to MS but there is no easy way to do it - changing the power plan is not a fix it is a work
 around , and not a practical one.It would be nice for someone there on the MS side to try to duplicate the issue and maybe come up with a patch. the easy fix for me is to just not let the apps run when I leave the computer , but I thought that MS might like
 to fix something like this.<br />

            congrats you just managed to say the same thing I already said. It is of no help because as I said I do not want to move them to the inbox .the better idea is to create a folder just for them , but they still go to junk and you have to move them there.
 this is a stupid way to do it.Why create more steps to do the same thing that used to be a single click. MS is out of hand with creating more hassle to get thing done - furthermore I can't believe they will not even answer my question! They act like Apple
 - if I wanted apple type service I would buy one! <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apoogize for any inconvenience and are glad to hear that the issue you are experiencing is gone. With regard to replying emails sent to your junk folder, since you suggested to move emails to a specific folder for you to be able to reply to the emails,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your account via web.</li><li>Move to inbox and into options.<br />
<br />
<span>To go to options on your account:</span>
<p><b><span>If you are using Hotmail interface:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Click on <b>Options</b> located at the upper right part of the inbox page and choose
<b>More options</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If you are using Outlook.com interface:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Click on the <b>Gear</b> icon located at the upper right part of the inbox page and choose
<b>More mail settings</b>.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Under <em>Customizing Hotmail/Outlook</em>, click on <strong>Rules for sorting new messages</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click on <strong>New</strong>.</span></p>

            Thank you for the reply Johan ,<br />
While that is a good work around it still is more of a patch then a fix .I guess my problem is I use Microsoft stuff because I like having choices and hate it when a company tries to tell me how I should use my PC. To be honest I have almost always had mac
 until they started getting out of hand with telling me what I want instead of listening to what I want .I am now down to just a older macbook and when it dies or is no longer usable I will not be buying another one. I like windows 8 and now have 2 computers
 that run it(desktop and laptop) and I understand why they chose to sandbox the modern apps - live tiles and apps need a layer of separation for security reasons , but there is no real good reason to block me from responding to mail in the junk folder when
 you consider that you can still click links and open attachments( far more dangerous) by simply clicking unblock in a pop up. I am an adult and perfectly capable of deciding if I want to respond to a email or not .I do not need someone to tell me that I cant
 respond to one because of the folder it lands in. I see no good reason that I should have to set up rules to move these emails to another folder and for the sake of not gunking up my inbox(that is set to exclusive for a reason) I do not want all emails to
 go there. I think it is a huge step in the wrong direction for microsoft to try to dictate how I use the folders in outlook.com . I would just switch back to hotmail but they will roll all accounts over to outlook at some point anyway, so I would rather fight
 this battle now - win or not. In the end I will just stop using outlook for the majority of my email and instead use gmail if it stays that way , meaning that gooogle will get the money from the ads instead of microsoft . I have been a hotmail customer for
 many many years and no matter what will still use it for communication with people in my contact list ,but the downhill slide always starts somewhere and it looks like this may be it for hotmail . you guys should do yourselves a favor and don't make the same
 mistake as apple - listen to your customer base.<br />

            What makes you think it might be a fake virus warning?   Did it come within or as a popup from an open browser window?
<br />
<br />A Fake Virus scam   can emanate from a mistyped URL where it's squatting.  Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the WIndows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps, organize by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.  You can turn off the MB trial version in it's Control Panel.

<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p><span><span>Dear Greg –
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for your very helpful email.&nbsp; We did call the fake help number and ran the command “iexplore support” but then grew suspicious, ended the call and cancelled out of the iexplore
 command windows without taking any action.&nbsp; We were able to close out of the browser (regularly).&nbsp; We then downloaded McAfee, ran a full scan and it said there were no threats.&nbsp; We closed down the computer and in the morning when we rebooted two things happened:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>On opening the Internet Explorer browser a tab appeared that we have not seen before labeled “Start Fresh” with a button asking if we wanted to close all tabs or not.&nbsp; We clicked to close all tabs</span></li><li>
<span>The computer has also been running very slowly, taking far longer than normal to complete any task.&nbsp; We rebooted the computer and when the slowness continued we downloaded and ran first the AdCleaner you recommended and then the premium
 Malwarebytes protection.&nbsp; Neither found any threats on the computer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The computer is still running much slower than normal – do you think it is related, or any thoughts on what might be causing this?&nbsp; (P.S. when we closed down last night there was
 a system update from Microsoft and we selected the “Update and shut down” option in case that might be important)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Nancy</span></span></p>

            Hi again Nancy -  
<br />
<br />The Start Fresh tab in Edge and Internet Explorer is designed to not auto-load tabs after a hard shutdown (holding the power button) unless you want them, so that the fake virus ploy WIndows can be avoided from loading again.  So you can safely choose that.  
<br />
<br />It sounds like you avoided the scam and any infection.  So let's check over the install's performance.
<br />
<br /> I would not run anything from MacAfee as it is one of the worst programs that can be installed to WIndows and often ruins it beyond repair.  So uninstall MacAfee to default to Windows Defender which is from Microsoft who know how to protect Windows best.  Then use Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner on demand for scanning if you're in doubt. 
<br />
<br />You can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstall WIndows but sheds corrupting factory bloatware, saving your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Updated to 9860. None of the built-in or store apps are working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, so I updated WTP to build 9860, and I seem to have run into a major issue. None of the Windows metro apps (PC Settings, Feedback, Mail, Wireless Network, etc) are working. I always get an Explorer.EXE "Element not found" error. I can still search,
 and open the File Explorer without a hitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try reinstalling the build, but without access to PC Settings, I'm kinda dead in the water. I've tried searching for the apps themselves in AppData, but I've had no luck. It's like the installation wiped the apps from my computer entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>IE11 browser settings for Office 365 Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graham d. johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 browser settings for Office 365 Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>Accessing Outlook via IE11, I get a windows which fails to load correctly when adding members to a Distribution Group. The window opens, but stays blank.
</p>
<p>Here is how I get to it:</p>
<p>Gear symbol at top right of Outlook web page (Office 365) &gt; [right hand sidebar] &gt; Your App Settings &gt; Mail</p>
<p>Then [left hand side bar] &gt; General &gt; Distribution Groups</p>
<p>Then under "Distribution Groups I own" I click on a the group I want to add a member to.</p>
<p>Up comes a (pop-up?) dialog titled "Distribution Group - Internet Explorer"</p>
<p>I click on the "membership" tab, and observe there is a list of three members in there that&nbsp;were added a few days ago.</p>
<p>There is a grey "+" sign above the list, to add a new member. </p>
<p>I click on the grey "+" sign, and the (pop-up?) window goes blank, and stays blank.
</p>
<p>It looks like my browser (IE11, fully up to date) is rejecting the content, or else the content is taking forever to load.
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Graham,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, I did a test from my side. The pop-up window shows correctly when I click “+” button to add users to the Distribution Groups in IE 11 (<strong>11.296.15063.0</strong>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix your issue, please try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maximizing the window when you open the Distribution Group and check if the issue persists when you click “+” button to add members.</li><li>Change to another browsers (like Chrome) to see if the issue persists.</li><li>Let the administrators of your organization to add members to the DG.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

            Install the onedrive app on your Android, sign in with your MS account details when prompted and you're done. Why would you want to specifically remove the windows phone ? Are you selling it or giving it to someone else ? If that is the case all you need
 to do is to reset it.<br />

<h2>            How to retrieve the result of F17 from 31 sheets..ufff&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So my boss has given an awful workbook. Awful because the structure is so dreadful that I'm having nightmares. The thing is that the workbook has 31 sheets. Each sheet has the data of each day. For example, Sheet1 is 01January2013, Sheet2 is 02January2013,
 etc. The Book is called "Registry".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have another workbook called "Reports" with a table that has to retrieve the value of cell E16 of each sheet in "Registry". So the formula is something like this: ='[Registry.xlsx]01January13 '!$F$17. How can I copy the formula down on column B of "Reports"
 so that it goes like this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>='[Registry.xlsx]01January13 '!$F$17</div>
<div>='[Registry.xlsx]02January13 '!$F$17</div>
<div>='[Registry.xlsx]03January13 '!$F$17</div>
<div>='[Registry.xlsx]04January13 '!$F$17</div>
<div>='[Registry.xlsx]05January13 '!$F$17</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I could only change the day reference of the sheet's name each time I try to copy down...Any other options are really welcome.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PD. I'm really lost at this one. Really awful.</div>

            You can use INDIRECT() to construct a cell reference (even an external one) but there are drawbacks.
<div><br />
<div>=INDIRECT("'[Registry.xlsx]"&amp;TEXT(DATE(2013,1,ROW(1:1)),"ddmmmmyy")&amp;"'!F17")</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fill down as necessary. If you want to avoid #REF! errors when you run out of days-in-a-month then,</div>
<div><br />
<div>=IFERROR(INDIRECT("'[Registry.xlsx]"&amp;TEXT(DATE(2013,1,ROW(1:1)),"ddmmmmyy")&amp;"'!F17"),"")</div>
<div><br />
<div>INDIRECT() can be used on external workbook references but the external workbooks must be open; preferably in the same application instance that the report workbook is in. INDIRECT() is also considered a
<i>volatile function</i>&nbsp;that will recalculate whenever any value in the workbook changes; not just when a values that affects it changes.</div>

<h2>            &#34;Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request Windows 7 64 bit and office 2010 64bit</h2>
                    <p>I have searched and searched, tried all recommendations.&nbsp; Completely screwed up my system and then Finally got it back to where I started.</p>
<p>We used to use outlook express with a pc of accounting software we have that interfaced perfectly to send invoices/reports etc via email.&nbsp; It simply opened outlook express when you clicked on the link (or whatever your default client was).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have upgraded computers to Windows 7 64bit with Office 2010 64bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;I can't import messages from outlook express, so I followed the information to export and then import into windows mail.&nbsp; Then export from windows mail.&nbsp; I keep getting the message that Outlook is not the default client.</p>
<p>2) We are now unable to send emails from our accounting software.&nbsp; Get the message Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request.&nbsp; Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have followed several instructions to change the registry, delete some dll's &nbsp;and run a repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office.</p>
<p>I have not been successfull in finding a resolution to this issue.&nbsp; All I find is that it is an issue with the 64bit version of outlook.&nbsp; Then it is always recommended to install the 32bit version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Don't have it and I am not purchasing it).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is happening on several systems in our office.&nbsp; One computer has Office 2013 64bit and one has Office 2010 64bit and the other Office 2007 64bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am at a loss as to what to do.&nbsp; Our business relies on email our customers various items from our accounting software.&nbsp; The software company says they have 100's of clients running the environment and think it is an issue with Outlook.&nbsp; But I can't seem
 to find anyone to help me with the issue.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Too many contacts showing up in iPhone that are not in Outlook Contacts folder</h2>
                    After a recent work PC upgrade to Windows 10 and Office 365 (desktop version, not Web-based), I noticed that my iPhone contacts list, which is sync'd to Outlook via iTunes, is now full of contacts from my work email messages that weren't there before.
 &nbsp;When I go to my Contacts in Outlook, I see only one Contacts list/folder that contains about 500 entries which are the contacts that I want in my iPhone. &nbsp;But my iPhone contains MANY names that aren't in this Contacts list, and they are names from email messages
 that I have sent or received. &nbsp;In my iPhone, I see that there are now a number of Groups, including "Companies," "GAL Contacts," "Organizational Contacts," "PeopleCentricConversation Buddies," and "Recipient Cache." &nbsp;I have no idea where these came from. &nbsp;When
 I select them one by one, the only group that has any contacts in it is the "Recipient Cache." &nbsp;I read that extra contacts may have come from a "Suggested Contacts" list in Outlook, but I cannot

            Hi Sonoma03,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since you are using the Office 365 account (service), the contacts should be synced via “Exchange (ActiveSync)” as I said in my previous post. That is to say, you don’t need to use iTunes for synching between the 2 devices (Outlook client and Outlook for iOS).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Moreover, since you said that the contacts come from the Outlook suggested contacts (of emails for sent and received), I suggest you temporarily close the Outlook client and manually remove the contacts from your Outlook for iOS.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<h2>            MS Word - How to change the language for a Table Style</h2>
                    <div>When editing a Table Style, there is no option to change the Language. So my question simply is, how do I change the Language for a Table Style in MS Word?</div>
<div>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ab76e67-fd38-4975-b96f-d07b29d97145?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ab76e67-fd38-4975-b96f-d07b29d97145?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>I am creating a document template, so the answers given to <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/211201/how-to-change-language-in-ms-word-table-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this problem</a> are not an option because it would involve repeating the actions every time a document was created from the template, or relate to the Windows version of Word</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>ALL other styles (including <strong>Normal</strong>) have the correct language. It is only this table style that has the problem.</li><li>I am using MS Word version 19.19 (181109) Office 365 subscription (Mac OS)</li></ul>

<p>Hi RedNectar.Chris,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern in our forum and we are sorry for the inconvenience. However, the language attribute is not included in a Table Style or a List Style.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The workaround can be:<br />
1. Manually select the table then go to Review &gt; Language to change the one you want.
<br />
2. If you don’t want to change the table language manually, you can change the default proofing language to be the same as the one you want to set for the table style, then save the file as a document template. The table style default proofing language will
 follow your template's default proofing language.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If you still have concern, we suggest posting in&nbsp;<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Word UserVoice</a> for the related team to know your demands.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Regards,<br />
Justin</div>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to disagree with your statement that&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<div>
<p>the language attribute is not included in a Table Style or a List Style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because my screen dump shows a Table Stylte that has one!&nbsp; It's just not available to us to edit/change</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm sorry that the workarounds don't work either. Because I'm not trying to change any particular table, I'm trying to build a template. There are no tables in the template itself - it's just a blank document with a set of attached styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course, I already tried suggestion #2 - it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Option #3 (MS User Voice) might be the only option.</p>

<p>Hi Doug,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly thanks - I do appreciate you taking the trouble to reply.&nbsp; And for a brief moment I thought that maybe I didn't need to worry about the stupid language setting for the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I tried by</p>
<ol>
<li>Checking that the default language was set to English (AUS)</li><li>Adding a table and applying my <em>Table Blue</em>&nbsp;Style</li></ol>
<p>I found that the table had taken on the Language of the <em>Table Blue</em>&nbsp;Style - i.e. English (UK) as shown in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exhibit #1: Language Settings for the <strong>Normal</strong>&nbsp;Style:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e43f0a6-9db0-4a27-9a4a-2e715f7a829b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e43f0a6-9db0-4a27-9a4a-2e715f7a829b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Exhibit #2: Language for first cell in Table is <strong>English (UK)</strong>&nbsp;- NOT the "<span>the language with which the Normal style is formatted."</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97c12e9b-****c302857d4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97c12e9b-****c302857d4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>So I'm still stuck with this stupid setting.&nbsp; One day I'll get around to deleting it and re-creating it, but I'm a stubborn person, and believe that if the Language CAN be set, we mere mortals aught to be able to change it!</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Sorry that it doesn't work for you and thank you for pointing that statement out. What we meant was the ability to edit the language in a Table Style.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Also, you're right, as this is currently not available, posting in Microsoft User Voice is the best option for now.</p>

<h2>            Save failed due to out of memory or disk space</h2>
                    I am trying to save a document in Word 2011 on a Mac. I get the error "Save failed due to out of memory or disk space. (Pledge 5-25-12.doc)" I know this isn't the case, as my computer is less than a month old and has plenty of memory. What can I do to
 correct this?<br />
<br />
Also, when I try to save it as a .docx document, Word crashes.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual SIM is indeed a 4G capable device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please ask Airtel to send you their 4G APN Settings, and enter those manually in the Cellular settings on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps,</p>

            <p>The Lumia 640 XL LTE supports the following LTE bands:</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>If Airtel in your area operates on Band 40 (2300MHz), it will not work on your Lumia 640 XL LTE.</span></p>

            <p>Please clarify, is this a single-SIM or a dual-SIM variant? Purchased at a local retailer, or over the Internet? It may also be helpful if you find and post the phone's product code (059xxxx), usually found under the battery or on a sticker near the SIM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing we can do if the operator already confirmed it does not work, but it will be useful to figure out why it fails, for others to avoid the same issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>very oddly, the same presentations will play the videos on my older home computer, as well as (very old) computers at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the answers on this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://blog.fonepaw.com/codec-unavailable-powerpoint.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the first solution, all the files are already *.pptx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"optimize media compatibility" is not offered on any of the presentations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I didn't try the third option, but all the files were *.mp4s when I embedded them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting all the *.tmp files didn't do anything either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The videos don't work in any of the presentations.&nbsp; I've tried using the same presentations off of a USB stick, and they don't play then off that PC, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ensured windows is up to date (though I guess I haven't checked to see if any of the updates failed to install), as well as the HP bios.</p>

<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am current running Powerpoint version 1812, build 11126.20266 in Microsoft Office Professional Plus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the presentations used to work on the affected computer a month ago.&nbsp; Now they are not.&nbsp; So I'm not sure how to answer your first question.&nbsp; It's true of all presentations on that same labtop, *.pptx with inserted *.mp4s will not run, and I get a "codec
 unavailable" message.&nbsp; Conversely, all these same presentations work on my home desktop, as well as older PCs at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you provided is the first to come up when the topic is google searched.&nbsp; Unfortunately, none of the solutions work or make sense.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>for instance, there was apparently an issue with PowerPoint 2010 where flash-embedded videos are no longer supported.&nbsp; But since I have PowerPoint 2016, this should be moot, as it says everything past PowerPoint 2013 made this issue moot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated in the original post, the "optimize compatibility" option doesn't even appear.&nbsp; Superficially, this is supposed to be because PowerPoint does not "see" any incompatibilities, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I could search for the right codec, but how could this be right if the original inserted files were *.mp4 format, which is apparently preferred, and furthermore, all these presentations still work on my desktop, which was a line that HP sold in 2011,
 whereas the computer I am running on is newer?</p>

<p>I contacted the above link, and was disappointed with the assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I was shocked when two of the techs told me I was out of warranty.&nbsp; What does that have to do with this?&nbsp; This is not something with solid parts that I have purchased in the past, whose parts have now worn out.&nbsp; The programs in Office are constantly
 being updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested that I try a quick repair.&nbsp; This did not correct the problem.&nbsp; Next, I tried a more complete repair.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this did not work either!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I understand the problem is therefore above the abilities of the techs I spoke to.&nbsp; The real problem is that, while they suggested I get in touch with the Business Graphics Support group (?), none of them gave me the correct contact information!&nbsp; How
 can that be right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to outline the problem in the faint hope someone out there can be of assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No *.pptx will play media on the problem laptop.&nbsp; Whenever I click on the "play" button, I get a "codec not available," "cannot load media," or some variation thereof.&nbsp; Now, I can take that same presentation, take it to another computer, and that computer
 will play the media just fine, even my older desktop at home.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, if I go to the "file" tab, then "check for issues," then "check compatibility" on the problem computer, it says the media files are not compatible, and it will save them as pictures.&nbsp; This can't be "true."&nbsp; As I said, I can then take the presentation
 and use it on another computer, and the media plays (therefore, it cannot have saved them as a picture).&nbsp; Furthermore, I can right click on the media, and ask powerpoint to save the media as a separate file.&nbsp; I can then exit powerpoint and play the media in
 windows media, and it plays just fine (again, therefore, it cannot have saved them as a picture, and obviously, the media file is still intact in powerpoint!).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, Powerpoint automatically saves said files as an *.mp4.&nbsp; If I create a new slide and attempt to insert the *.mp4 into the presentation, I get an error message requesting that I change the file to a format whose codec is supported by Powerpoint.&nbsp;
 But how can I do that when the *.mp4 is already the preferred format?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even gone here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/powerpoint-cannot-insert-a-video-from-the-selected-file-acd46430-9e0c-4dca-9484-19cf0afdde7c</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reconverted the file to an *.mp4, and selected H264 under the codec for video.&nbsp; Powerpoint still gave me the same error message when I tried to insert the file!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a challenging problem, but so far, the support has been very unsatisfactory.&nbsp; It's stunning that I did all of the above myself without any direction.&nbsp; The above information suggests that there is a very local problem with PowerPoint on that
 specific computer, perhaps an incompatibility or corruption by another app.&nbsp; The techs supervising my chat should have at least suggested these things to help troubleshoot the issue!</p>

    <title>How do I turn off ScreenTips&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colinreynolds  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off ScreenTips&#63;</h2>
                    What can I do to completely, permanently, irreversibly stop all ScreenTips/ToolTips in Office 2010 from coming up for any reason ever again? &nbsp;I've found a multitude of different places where the option can be deactivated for one specific case, but nothing
 that will turn them all off. &nbsp;For example, the "Don't Show ScreenTips" option in the Popular tab, "Label Data with AutoCorrect" under "Smart Tags" in the Proofing tab, "Show Function ScreenTips" under "Display" in the Advanced tab...the list goes on, but there's
 no blanket option.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just to clarify, I'd be thrilled to never EVER <u>
EVER</u>&nbsp;see another ScreenTip again. &nbsp;For anything. &nbsp;What does it take to give MS Office the ScreenTip "chill pill" so it stops cluttering up my documents with incessant help messages? &nbsp;They're not helping at all.</div>

<h2>            How to share files with external partners&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to share a large file with external partners via my one drive for business so that they can access, edit and use the material. They are able to view the file in the web client of .PPT, but are unable to download and edit on their pc client version
 of .ppt. Is it possible to share access to files with others outside of the organization or do I need to use a service like drop box?</p>

<p>thanks,</p>

<p>hi brian,</p>
<p>yes, it is possible to share access to files with others outside of the organization. and we can download and edit on their pc client version of ppt files(i’ve test with an external office 365 account.)</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a4977776-e5ba-4914-8c8e-a1cdeb7ee5f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da4977776-e5ba-4914-8c8e-a1cdeb7ee5f0" /></a></p>

<p>given the situation, would you help clarify the following information for us to narrow down the issue?<br />
1. how do you share the files? would you share us some detailed steps about this? some related screenshots will be appreciated.
<br />
2. is the external partner account an office 365 account or a microsoft account?<br />
3. do you grant the <strong>edit</strong> permission when sharing the file like below?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2e494f84-1c25-477f-a294-2b97cf3f264b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2e494f84-1c25-477f-a294-2b97cf3f264b" /></a></p>
<p>4. for “<em>but are unable to download and edit on their pc client version of .ppt</em>”, is there any error message or symptom for this? if so, could you capture a related screenshot for our reference?</p>
<p><strong>note:&nbsp;</strong> to insert screenshots, please click on <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and select the
<strong>insert image</strong> icon.</p>
<p>please post back to share us the update at your convenience and we will continue to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>hi brian,</p>
<p>could you check if you can see the option <strong>edit presentation &gt; edit in powerpoint</strong> after logging in with a microsoft account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0978724f-a6c7-4abe-86c7-b433865d5bf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0978724f-a6c7-4abe-86c7-b433865d5bf0" /></a></p>
<p>if not, could you provide a screenshot of the view mode as my screenshot above for our reference?</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
