<h2>            Word seems terribly unstable&#8212;what to do&#63;</h2>
                    I worked for 20 years as an editor/writer using Microsoft Word on a PC. The most recent version I have is so unstable that I am ready to throw my computer out the window. The display changes seemingly on its own from one page to two. The font becomes italic
 without prompts. The font size changes. The text zooms in and out on its own. Bullets change style without any rhyme or reason. It is absolutely horrible! It took me 6 hours to edit and format a very simple document that would have taken 45 minutes using an
 older version. What gives? And is there any program left that doesnâ€™t think for you before youâ€™ve had a chance to think for yourself?

<p>Thank a lot. I will give that a try. Iâ€™ve used Word since 1984 (as a technical writer and editor), and Iâ€™ve never been so frustrated. Iâ€™ll post if that fixes my problem.</p>

<h3> davidkamp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ref KB 3169958 or Admin Center message MC78106</h2>
                    <p>My Admin Center Portal gave me a warning MC78106 </p>
<p>"Important notice for Office 365 email customers who have configured connectors"</p>
<p>I need clarification please.</p>
<p>my entire email system is in the cloud. I do have an On Premise SMTP server that accepts messages only from&nbsp;internal servers for Errors or Log reports etc.</p>
<p>The Internal SMTP server relays the messages to Office 365 in the Cloud thru a Connector.</p>
<p>The messages being relayed are from our Domain name to our domain name and sometimes to an External domain address.</p>
<p>My question is do I have to modify anything?</p>
<p>My Connector is </p>
<p>from:"Your organizations email server"</p>
<p>to: "Office 365"</p>
<p>How should Office 365 identify email from your email server? "By verifying that the IP address of the sending server matches one of these addresses that belong to your organization"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to do anything for the expected change of Feb 2017? or am I OK?</p>

<p><span>Sorry for the misunderstanding. According to your description, there is only one Microsoft SMTP server in your organization. So it doesnâ€™t meet the three scenarios mentioned in the article. Given the situation, you donâ€™t need to change anything.</span></p>

<h2>            no sound in java games with N73...&#33;</h2>
                    hello!<br />
<br />
i dont seem to have any sound in any java games i have installed with my N73 phone.<br />
<br />
my friend has tried the same games with his N80 with perfect working sound.<br />
<br />
I have tried this before and after a recent firmware update with the same results.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed any light on this at all?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help! :)

            Is not N73! I have several Java games without problems. Is your phone... or that Java games? Do a PCSuite backup, and try a soft format of phone. Restore and try again.

            thank you for the info. i have actually updated the firmware before and after trying the games again with the same problem.<br />
<br />
After a search online I noticed a thread on another forum with similar problems, but no replies...<br />
<br />
very confusing!

            ok i have found the problem....i had warning tones turned off which stops sound playback in java games. works fine now.<br />
<br />
originally i had this off mainly to turn off the camera shutter sound, which it does not do anyway for some reason!<br />
<br />
cheers :D

<h2>            Shared Mailboxes not appearing in Outlook365 web client</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully an easy fix, but feeling a bit frustrated that I can not sort it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a number of Shared Mailboxes within the Office365 Admin Center, and I have added users to them, so that they are able to use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping that the Shared Mailbox would appear in the left-hand portion of the user's outlook screen, instead, they are hving to log into a new tab as the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway, I can configure the former behaviour, and not have to do the latter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>

            No, the "automapping" feature doesnt work in OWA. You can add the shared mailbox and it will stay on the list though. Or you can simply use the "open another mailbox" functionality by clicking the user profile picture in the top right corner.

<h3> andr&#225;stak&#225;cs b&#243;dis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 820 - Can seemingly connect to WiFi but has no access to Internet</h2>
                    <p>I just received back my Lumia 820 after an USB connector replacement (it was jammed and couldn't charge the phone) after I moved to a new flat.
<br />
<br />
Ever since then I have no wireless internet access on the phone. I can see the wireless router, can even connect to it and it shows as if it would establish a connection to the Wireless network, but I have no Internet connection on the phone itself.<br />
I checked the connection on the phone - I get an IP like 169.254.x.x and a mask with 255.255.0.0</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the router's settings I don't even see the phone listed below the DHCP clients either even though the phone indicates that it is actually connected to the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This IP indicates to me that it is an issue somewhat related to the DHCP service, but I have no useful knowledge regarding this incident.</p>
<p><br />
The situation is further complicated by the fact that there are 3 other devices (a laptop, a desktop PC and my girlfriend's Lumia 640) connected to the same Wireless Router (all wirelessly) and they all work just fine (getting normal IPs from the DHCP), whilest
 my Lumia 820 has no internet connection.<br />
I've tried with my other network at my old flat, got the same issue (IP and mask-wise), no internet either, even though it used to work just fine. I personally did not change anything on the phone, however I do not know what couldd have been changed setttings-wise
 during the USB repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network is not limited by MAC Addresses as those devices connected just automatically and they all work fine. And the number of devices connected are also not limited as I've tried disconnecting a device while connecting with my phone - same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DHCP setting is also enabled as the other devices can connect nomrally - as pointed out earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't installed any updates or apps on the phone itself. I've just recently updated my PC from Win 7 to Win 10, but it has hardly anything to do with the problem itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any feedbacks or possible solutions as it would be vital for me to be able to read emails on my Phone using WiFi connection.</p>
<br />
<p>Thanks in advance for your input! </p>

            <p>Can you check that other devices are using 169.254.x.x&nbsp; IP addresses. 192.168.xxx.xxx is more common for a (home) router. The range you've quoted could be the default range locally allocated when the DHCP server is not/cannot be &nbsp;contacted and a fixed IP
 address has not been assigned. I'd try deleting the entry for your router &nbsp;SSID in the phone and allowing it to rediscover.</p>

I did a hard reset (my backup was not so up to date), which solved the issue.</p>

<p>I don't use either? I have an iPhone&nbsp;and have been using its Mail function with no problems&nbsp;till last week.&nbsp;the problem&nbsp; seems to be with my email account because when I sign into outlook, it will give a Something went wrong message. After multiple attempts,
 Im able to sign in and see my emails, but I cannot open it with the message Error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to write new email, and send, it says " Cannot send as the account does not exist". I can see that I am receiving emails but cannot open it on multiple browsers and computers!</p>

<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />No, they will be removed.
<br />
<br />To transfer your contacts list from a regular account like outlook.com to a business account (Exchange Online O365 Business), you can use the Export/Import feature to achieve that.
<br />
<br />See:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-and-export-outlook-email-contacts-and-calendar-92577192-3881-4502-b79d-c3bbada6c8ef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this information has been useful, please let me know if you still need assistance.

<br />Will Outlook 2016 retain the contacts after the Outlook.com account is deleted?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello Austin
<br />
<br />Short Answer: No
<br />
<br />The .ost data file associated with the Outlook.com account is a mirror of what is located on the server. If the Outlook.com account is removed from Outlook, then the .ost file is also deleted.
<br />
<br />So in answer to your question - two ways to go about things
<br />
<br />#1 - If you don't have the Exchange account configured that's associated with Bus Essentials, then
<br />
<br />a) create a new PST file for the profile
<br />(from Home ribbon --&gt; &lt;New Items&gt; --&gt; More Items --&gt; Outlook Data File
<br />b) create a new contact folder in the newly created PST file
<br />c) "copy" (with emphasis on "Copy" as opposed to "Move") the contacts from the Outlook.com contacts folder to the one just created
<br />
<br />You will now have your contacts available in the PST file and once you configure the Bus Essentials Exchange account , just reverse the step "c" process above to go from PST folder to the Ex account folder
<br />
<br />#2 - If you have both the Outlook.com account and Biz Essentials account configured, simply copy the contacts from the Outlook.com account folder to the corresponding contact folder in the Biz Essentials EX account.

<p>Thanks Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean to copy the .OST file from Outlook.com, then substitute/swap the Office 365's .OST file for my saved Outlook.com .OST file?&nbsp; I found some old .ost files in&nbsp;C:\Users\Austin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook.&nbsp; Some dating back to Oct 2016.</p>

<br />Do you mean to copy the .OST file from Outlook.com, then substitute/swap the Office 365's .OST file for my saved Outlook.com .OST file? Where is thefolderyou mentioned located? These are both web apps.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Going to have to backup a step ...................
<br />
<br />#1 - My previous response was based on you using the Outlook desktop program so not clear about the last sentence "These are both web apps". Outlook.com or the Exchange account you have can be accessed via webmail (your browser) and/or the Outlook desktop program. Was the assumption not correct?
<br />
<br />#2 - OST files apply exclusively to the Outlook desktop program so am assuming you are using the Outlook desktop program - correct?
<br />
<br />#3 - Regardless of your question, you would never copy an ost file from one configuration to another - serves no purpose since an OST file can only be used by the Outlook profile/email account used to create it.
<br />
<br />So to get back to point
<br />
<br />#4 - Are you using the Outlook desktop program? If yes, just need to configure (add) each account (i.e. Outlook.com and Biz Essentials EX acct) in Outlook desktop. As previously mentioned, the OST file is nothing more then a mirror of what is contained on the server for each account.
<br />
<br />#5 - If, on the other hand, you are asking how to migrate the info from one web mail account to another then the answer is (a) first export to a CSV file from Outlook.com and then (b) import to the other account but don't think this scenario applies for your question.

<p>
</p><p>So add both O.com and O365 accounts at once to the Outlook PC app, then two separate .ost files will be created?</p>
<p>One O365 which is empty, the other with my 700+ contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the .ost file includes email messages, contacts, calendar, and tasks.&nbsp; Great!&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, is the .ost file imported into Outlook-pc app, or should I delete original office 365 .ost file and replace it with the .ost file from Outlook.com (with all
 needed data)?</p>

            #1 - For the purposes of this question, OST files do not play any kind of factor. Can't stress this enough, an .OST (offline storage) file is a mirror of what currently exists on the server.
<br />
<br />#2 - When you configure both accounts in Outlook, then you have access to the folders contained in that account, regardless of type
<br />
<br />#3 - Your primary question that I responded to was/is
<br />
<br />"I'm looking at different ways to transfer my Outlook.com contacts to Office 365 Business Essentials."
<br />
<br />If you have both accounts configured in Outlook at the same time, then simply follow the instructions from the original response
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />#2 - If you have both the Outlook.com account and Biz Essentials account configured, simply copy the contacts from the Outlook.com account folder to the corresponding contact folder in the Biz Essentials EX account.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />All you need to do is 
<br />
<br />#4 - click on the contacts folder for the Outlook.com account
<br />#5 - Press CTRL+A to select all the contact items
<br />#6 - Right-click on the selected contact items
<br />#7 - Select &lt;Move&gt; --&gt; select &lt;Copy to folder&gt; --&gt; select the contact folder in the Biz EX account
<br />#8 - When everything is copied, you can safely remove the Outlook.com account if you no longer need it OR copy whatever other data you want from the Outlook.com folders to the corresponding Biz Ess EX folders
<br />
<br />Every Exchange account, whether Outlook.com or a business Exchange account has an OST file associated with it. No OST file gets imported nor can you import from an ost file. Making a backup copy of an OST file is also pointless since as also stated, an ost file can only be opened by the original Outlook profile/email account used to create it or to put it more directly, if you delete an exchange email account from the Outlook profile, it will also delete the OST file. If you add the same account back again, you CANNOT use a previously created OST file.

                    I have problem in displaying Sultan normal font (Arabic) in word 2013. I though it might be windows 8 but my arabic text (written by sultan normal font) is displaying well in windows 8 and office 2010. While in case of windows 8 and office 2013, this font
 is not displaying at all.

            <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It works now.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That what I did:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Clean install of windows 8.1 (64bit)</p>
<p>2. Perform windows update (restart).</p>
<p>3. Install office 2013 (64bit)</p>
<p>4. Perform windows and office update (restart).</p>
<p>5. Install the fonts that I only used (ae_al-Arabiya &amp; sultan normal) in the font folder.</p>
<p>6. Install other softwares (like Adobe, java, etc.)</p>
<p>7. Shutdown my computer, wait a while. Start again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It works. I mean that "sultan normal" font is now displayed properly in word, excel and powerpoint.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It might what I listed above is too picky or completely away from the core solution. And thus, might be the windows 8.1 itself correct the mistake and no need to do as I did. Just install windows 8.1 and have a go. I have no idea whether this will work also
 with windows 8.1 (32 bit) or not.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was willing to upload the fonts that I used but I think there is no facility in this forum to do so.</p>
<p><br />

<p>PMFJI, but perhaps I can help preserve some sanity :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Size</strong> device on the <strong>Layout</strong> tab of the Ribbon has been unreliably buggy since Word 2011. Typically it will make the correct change to the document when a selection is made there but will not correctly reflect the actual
 Paper Size of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to confirm and/or set the correct Paper Size, go to the source rather than the UI control:&nbsp; Format&gt; Document, then click the Page Setup button there. Once you've made you choice click OK to return to the previous dialog window. If the size is to
 be used as the default for new documents, click the Default... button there, then click OK and confirm updating the Normal template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't be surprised if the Size list on the Ribbon indicates something other than what you selected but that, in fact, is immaterial. The correct size will be used for both display &amp; output. Also, Borderless is irrelevant unless the document has content that
 extends outside the Margins (or possibly if the Margins set are smaller than the minimum requirement of the printer). Its primary purpose is for photo printing. Content outside the Margins usually will not Print/PDF unless Borderless is specified. If there
 is no such content it makes no difference whether or not Borderless is indicated.</p>

            <p>Hi Smittychat,</p>
<p>No, I don't have the issue in internet explorer. I don't use IE (who does? - even Microsoft has given up on it). However, I am not looking for IE support, I am asking for Bing support. Bing is the only webpage that shows this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect, I don't believe you know what you are talking about with respect to Iron. Iron is not scamware. It is an open source browser based on the Chromium code base - as is Google's Chrome browser. Google just puts their spyware in Chrome. In fact,
 Microsoft used to offer Iron via BrowserChoice.eu before Microsoft killed off BrowserChoice.eu when the court order expired that forced Microsoft to compete fairly in the browser space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I would think Microsoft would want to improve support for non-google browsers (especially with its non-google search engine), but maybe that is expecting too much.</p>

<p>Hi LIoydJunor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To investigate this issue, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Do you store files in consumer OneDrive (white icon) or OneDrive for Business (blue icon)?</p>
<p>2. By "getting files PDF's in OneDrive", do you mean open PDF files from the synced folder with Adobe Reader?</p>
<p>3. Capture a screenshot of your synced folder. We want to see the status for PDF files and "Word docs". Meanwhile, right-click the sync client icon on the task bar, check if you can see Settings and click View sync problems.
</p>
<p>4. Capture a screenshot for the error message "it says I cannot connect" when "getting files PDF in OneDrive".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>From a quick Bing search, DVZAddin.dll is for Documents to Go I believe.&nbsp; And this is likely the issue.</p>
<p>I would suggest closing Word&nbsp;and renaming the DVZWDAddin.dot to DVZWDAddin.old or move the DVZWDAddin.dot to your desktop and take it out of the folder&nbsp;located here:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application Data\Microsoft\Word\Startup</p>

            <div>That is an add-in for DataViz Documents to Go. There's a lengthy solution posted at

 is to remove the DVZAddin.dot that is calling it. This template/add-in will be in the Word and/or Office Startup folder.</div>

<div>When this question was asked a couple of years ago, Jay Freedman wrote, "An oldie but goodie... ask Google about DVZAddin and you'll get about 2200 hits, most of them asking the same question." The number of Google hits is now up to 3,220, and the answer
 remains the same.</div>

                    <p>&lt;Original title:Help! I cannot sign up for a Microsoft Account (outlook.com)&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to setup a new account and as part of the process obtain a new outlook.com (in my case outlook.co.nz) email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1.</p>
<p>If using any browser other than IE, it won't let me select an outlook.co.nz address (which I want) There seems to be some special region auto-detect that only works with IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2.</p>
<p>In all browsers, if I get the captcha wrong one time, the "create account" button is greyed out forever. All Browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 3.</p>
<p>MS wants to send me a txt to verify that a human requested the account. I received the txt (4 digit) but the form will
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> accept it. If forever says invalid, please try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As such, I cannot sign up to use the service.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The reply that we should be getting .com email addresses is correct, however when siging up with IE, it tries to default to outlook.co.nz (MS should really fix this)</p>

            I did this. The emails from this merchant never went to my junk mail. They were safe. Then one day they stopped. I contacted the merchant (Sierra Trading Post) and the researched it. Their research showed that you had reported it as spam and blocked.

<br />Naturally, the Cox web site is not a Microsoft web site.

<p>I have the same problem getting Outlook to work with COX...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was receiving email OK but could not send, it all of a sudden, two months ago. Either Cox made a change on their end or my Outlook is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for two months now, I have tried all the different port settings, that Cox gave me, to no avail. Now after changing the server from coxmail.com to cox.net, as suggested by cox, I now do not receive any mail now.&nbsp; I change it back and Outlook keeps asking
 me for my password for cox.net even though I made the change back to coxmail.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other computers at work and my I phone receive and send email fine, just not this laptop... I think the Outlook program on this computer needs to be reloaded, start over. I can not find a link to reload Outlook on line. I did try the repair feature on
 the Outlook email settings and on the APP portal. I spend hours migrating this Microsoft site looking for help, no luck, so now I am here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am traveling Europe at the moment, It would be nice to have my email working on this Microsoft laptop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the Cox settings, back and forth, even try to use the settings that work on my phone. No luck. I try to get help, to get a link to reload Outlook on this laptop, but I seem to not get anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is like Microsoft blames Cox and Cox blames Microsoft Outlook!!&nbsp; I am stuck in the middle!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my email not working, I am not sure how I will receive a response or get a repair link here...!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did set up a Outlook.com email to get here... </p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<h2>            All emails lost in forced migration of email account from Office365 to Outlook.com</h2>
                    I hadn't checked my Outlook 365 account in a couple of weeks and was alarmed to find out I couldn't log into it. I have since discovered my email account was migrated to Outlook.com and I have lost
<strong>ALL</strong> my previous emails! This account had a &nbsp;lot of important information i.e., flight purchase details, gig tickets &nbsp;etc, and I would like to know how I go about retrieving all emails that are now lost.

</p><p>AFAIK there is no "forced" migration from office365 to outlook.com.&nbsp; Are you using the same email address and password to log on?&nbsp; Why do you think you were forced from office365 to outlook.com?</p>

            Good Luck with this, I had the same problem after they switched us over.&nbsp;&nbsp;I lost important information, and pictures I had of my late mother, and they are all gone.&nbsp; I sent numerous emails to ask for assistance and but they don't know, as far as I am&nbsp;concerned
 this system is garbage.&nbsp; When I sent my last email in regards to my problem they just ignored me and I haven't heard from them since.

            <p>Yes it is the same email address and password. One week I was using Office 365 login to view my emails as I have always done. The next week my Office 365 login would not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many failed attempts at logging in I decided to check if it worked in the Outlook login in page; which surprisingly &nbsp;it did. However when I got to my inbox, my years of emails and important info were all deleted. I had one email in my inbox - A welcome
 to Outlook email (the one that contains all the new features your new account has).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointed :(</p>

            <p>Same issue for me - had a legacy hotmail.com accessed via live.com with forwarding to my BT account. Kept it linked to keep it live as a back-up e-mail account. Last e-mail forwarded dated 17-Oct-14 does not appear in Outlook.com inbox nor does any of the
 last year's forwarded e-mails. Admittedly have not logged in to the account directly for a while!<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Am now concerned that forwarding will not work, particularly as I cannot find anywhere to check this in the new structure. There are some important contacts who still use the old hotmail address.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Edit/Update</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Have found the forwarding details - box strangely blank so have set it up again. Can only presume my issue is down to the
<strong>NEW</strong> requirement to log-in at least once in 365 days being applied retrospectively where the old Hotmail accounts possibly treated an e-mail being forwarded as account activity and therefore kept the account active. The old Agreement required
 "sign in" once in every 270 days (effective 19-Oct-12). The new agreement, effective 31-Jul-14, requires "sign in" once in every 365 days.<br />

<h2>            Spreadsheet protection is causing Excel 2013 to freeze and not respond</h2>
                    <p>I have a very basic Excel 2013 spreadsheet with multiple tabs that I would like to password protect.&nbsp; However, once I've set it to be protected (close and save it),&nbsp;it freezes when I try to go back into the file, then&nbsp;I have to end the task in Task Manager.&nbsp;
 When I try to re-open it again, it pops up a message "The last time you opened "File Name", it caused a serious error.&nbsp; Do you still want to open it?"&nbsp; Then I choose "Yes", the password screen pops up, I enter the password and the file opens without an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have saved it as a new file - same issue.&nbsp; I've copied the data into a new spreadsheet - same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the password protection, the file opens immediately without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a simple spreadsheet that I track our Christmas and birthday gifts and amounts on (and with 2 curious teenagers I'd like to have this functionality).&nbsp; The only work it does is sum gift totals per person.&nbsp; No macros, no cross referencing to other tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h3> rhaltman60  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise</h2>
                    I recently formatted my drive due to assumed virus, I re-installed Windows 7 and SP1. Then re-installed motherboard drivers, etc. When I try to install Office from the same disc I previously used on this same desktop it gives me an error message. I tried
 going to Office web site and downloaded several different copies for someone who had lost their disc, but had their product key, assuming maybe my disc was corrupted some way. Each time I tried to install one of them it told me my product key was no good.
 I know my product key is good because I installed using it before on this same desktop. Are their some service packs I need to install first? I thought the disc did that on installation. Please help. I need this done and I am disabled, so I can't afford to
 go buy another disc. I shouldn't have to since I have one already that worked fine before. Thanks!

            I got the disc from a teacher I took a class from and like I said I have installed it on this same computer before. I read your reply and I tried it again and it gave the same message,--Setup cannot find InfoPath.en-us/InfLR.cab. Browse to a valid installation
 source, then click OK. So I clicked on every folder on the disc individually and each time it told me - wrong location. One of the folders was even labeled InfoPath.en-us. I don't know what else to do.

            I did as you suggested, but I do have a copy of Office 2007 Home and Student installed that I didn't remove. I don't know if that makes any difference. But when I copied the Enterprise 2007 to my desktop it did fine until it got to a file called Infl R.
 It tells me that is a cabinet file. It looks like that file is about 2/3 of the way through the disc. It gives me the option of re-trying it, which I did several times, but it hangs there. It won't go any further. Any more ideas? I thank you very much for
 your help. It is very much appreciated! P.S. when I say it did fine I mean it was doing fine copying to my desktop. That's where it is hanging up, copying, not installing. I hope I haven't confused you too much. Thanks again!

            <p>Hi Tisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know if the email account you have configured on your phone is an Office 365 account. If it is a non-Office 365 account, then check if you have turned on the two-step verification, you will need a specific app password to sign in again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check the guide below on how to manage and login to your app-specific password based on your email account:</p>

<p>
</p><p>To further troubleshoot, please provide the following information:</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. </span></span><span>Do you mean the issue occurs to both Outlook on your PC and your phone? If yes, please provide the version details of each.</span></p>
<p><span>2. The Outlook app you are using (<strong>Outlook for Android/iOS, OWA for Android/iOS, built-in mail app for Android/iOS</strong>).</span></p>
<p><span>3. The type of account configured on your mobile device and on the PC (POP3, IMAP or Exchanged mode).</span></p>
<p><span>3. The screenshots of the error messages you received.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Check if it also occurs on another mobile device.</span></span></p>

<p>Jumping in this thread because I have same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three connected accounts.&nbsp; Using OWA on multiple computers as part of O365 subscription.&nbsp; One account is email hosted by my ISP (Cox.net) and the other two are ATT.net (now Yahoo Mail).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All three are properly configured, because they work.&nbsp; My OWA Inbox receives mail from all of them, and my primary send account is one of the ATT accounts.&nbsp; Invariably, at least once each day and sometimes more often, I get an error message in my Inbox from
 Microsoft that OWA could not update one of the connected accounts, so I have to edit that account.&nbsp; Usually, that means entering the password - which has to be done two or three times (Edit-Save) before it finally takes effect.&nbsp; Then, I'll get a storm of emails
 which were waiting to be synced from the affected account.&nbsp; At that point, my WP client also gets updated.&nbsp; Since this is a web app, the problem occurs on all my devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no warning until I try to send an email, but it doesn't seem like the sending caused the update to fail, because I'll get emails that are two to three hours old. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for at least two or three months, but I finally found a thread that seemed to be on topic to post to. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>The troubleshooting steps refer to a problem that user was having with her mobile device.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not have a problem with my mobile device (Windows Phone â€“ Microsoft Lumia 950XL, Windows 10 Mobile version 1703, OS build 10.0.15063.414).<span>&nbsp;
</span>On my phone, I am using the built-in Mail and Calendar App with no add-ons, version 17.8241.41126.0.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The primary account is set to download new content as items arrive from the server named eas.outlook.com.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The secondary account is set up exactly the same way.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Again, my phone email client works fine, and properly displays emails from my connected accounts once they are imported to my OWA.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, the troubleshooting steps in this thread (which you asked me to do), do not apply to me.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Mobile is not the problem, as it just reflects what is in my OWA.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The problem is with OWA, which is configured as follows:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My primary account is a Microsoft Account named <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is my basic account, used to log in to all Microsoft services. It is also an email address on the ATT server.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also have <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>, and <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These last two are distinct cox.net accounts, not aliases.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are the OWA connected accounts settings for the two cox.net accounts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note that one is set up as a POP account, and the other as an IMAP account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They both work perfectly, except when OWA tells me that it cannot access one of them and forces me to update the password.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It does not happen that often on the cox.net accounts, but it does happen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2d23332-3e26-4734-8a12-61e1ab33f8b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2d23332-3e26-4734-8a12-61e1ab33f8b9" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Here are the OWA connected account settings for the primary ATT account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It works perfectly until OWA tells me that it is unable to access the account, and tells me to edit the account to update the password.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That happens nearly every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I go to settings to update the password, it takes at least two tries (edit-save) and sometimes three or four before OWA finally shows â€œupdate in progressâ€ for this account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I get the same result whether I do the update on my desktop PC or on my portable PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The behavior is not device dependent.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The desktop PC is an HP Intel i5-6400 CPU 64-bit @ 2.7 GHz with 12 GB RAM running Windows 10 Home, Product ID 00325-80570-88424-AAOEM, version 1703, build 15063.413.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The portable is similarly configured, although it is an i7 Intel processor.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As a test, I sent an individual email through OWA to each of my four accounts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They were all sent from my OWA default send account.<span>&nbsp; </span>The two emails to my cox.net accounts appeared in my Inbox within two minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The att.net email arrived two hours later and the outlook.com email took another half-hour to appear.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They all appeared on my phone after being received by OWA.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What other information can I provide to help you diagnose the problem of OWA constantly prompting me to update my connected accounts?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>As I stated in my first post, the problem occurs on both computers.&nbsp; Office Repair acts only on the device it is run on, but I ran it anyway.&nbsp; Did not fix the problem.&nbsp; No surprise.&nbsp; I was quite clear that my problem is with Outlook Web App (OWA), not Outlook
 2016.&nbsp; I don't use Outlook as part of Office 365 subscription, I am having a problem with OWA, not Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please address the OWA problem. &nbsp; As a start, you might consider both reading and understanding my post before giving me advice that doesn't apply to the product I am writing about.</p>

<p>When plugged into the wall charger, the phone will report that the battery is full and that it can be unplugged to save energy. It shows a full charge on the battery indicator, but after being unplugged for a minute, the low battery indicator alarm sounds.</p>
<p>I've been monitoring the phone at work this morning and found the following:</p>
<p>When it is plugged into the wall, the phone will report that it is fully charged, but will beep that it is charging every 3 minutes. And then, it will only charge for 20 seconds.</p>
<p>The battery charge indicator animation seems to be very fast as well.</p>
<p>It's been doing this for the last 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried a different charger on it at lunch and the same issues are still happening.</p>
<p>Don't know whether to return it to Futureshop for a refund or initiate the Nokia repair process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have it hooked up to PC via USB right now, but doesn't appear to be charging at all.</p>

<p>This is bit of an odd issue for the C3 and is probably a once off so I would suggest bringing it back to the retailer for a replacement. I don't expect you will have the same issue with the replacement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply cjlim.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I had it connected via USB to my desktop at work.</p>
<p>I don't have the OVI suite or any other Nokia programs on this computer, and I just pressed "Cancel" when Windows XP asked me to search for drivers when connecting.</p>
<p>While it was still connected via USB, I removed the battery for a moment and re-inserted.</p>
<p>The phone started up immediately when the battery was inserted and is now showing fully charged - 4 green bars in the battery indicator area on the home screen.</p>
<p>I've been playing music thru the media player as a test, and it now appears to be holding a charge.</p>
<p>I wonder if this extra step with the USB did some sort of reset on the battery?</p>
<p>Bizarre, but I'm glad it's working again.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. My&nbsp;C3 says "completed charge remove" with full green indicator bars then after a few minutes it has a low battery warning. I tried charging with a different charger but same result.&nbsp;I cycled&nbsp;the battery connection a few times with
 no result. The phone&nbsp;by mistake got left in my friends car last night and it was -25 degree C outside. Today the phone seems to be working now. We will see the next time I charge.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue. &nbsp;Plug it in, it says its fully charged. &nbsp;Unplug and within a minute it says "battery low". &nbsp;Grrr. &nbsp;The weird thing is that this first occurred this morning and i had the phone with me all day and its still running. &nbsp;So my guess
 is that the phone <em>is</em> fully charged (otherwise it would have run out of juice today) and there is just some software flag that is not being reset (causing the warning messages). &nbsp;If I reset the device to the factory settings will I lose my purchased
 games?</p>

<p>I think I found the fix. &nbsp;You just have to do a soft' reset. &nbsp;You get to keep all your data (games, notes, messages etc) too. &nbsp;To do a soft reset plug in the power cord and type in "<strong>*#7780#</strong>" and do the password and then let it reboot. &nbsp;I
 just had to restore the stupid stuff like theme and silent mode. &nbsp;Hope this helps. &nbsp;</p>

            hello c3 users,<br />
i ve got a solution, lets c if it works... Ur mobiles r have no problem, so dont worry!!<br />
Just pull out the battery of ur mob, and tight all the jaws of the BATTERY from both sides through which battery holds the mobile plugs... But becarefull these r very sensitive!!!!!!<br />
Tight these jaws through needle coz these r very small,<br />
the problem u guys r telling happens when one of them becomes lose it causes the breakage of the circuit between the battery and mobile and when it happens the mobile sends the low battery signal, mob doesnt turnoff because not all of the circuts r broken,
 the problem might be in one of them,<br />
so try it and lemme know if it solves ur problem!!<br />
:)

            And the long time charging is also due to the problem in jaws when mob dosent supply the correct amount of the current to the battery due to the problem in the battery jaws which r not properly connected to the plug thn how it will be charged in proper
 time, it will take hours and hours to recharge..<br />

<p>I have been having problems with my nokia c3 now for a while, It wasn't charging all the way so I went out and bought a new charger for it and that seemed to be working. It worked for 3 weeks and then a few days ago it started again. I plugged it in 2 days
 ago and it was plugged in for 26 hours before it said it was charged. I unpluged and went to bed. Woke up 5 hours later to it saying low battery. Now when charging it says it is charged then 2 min later charging and sometimes I get low bat in there too.&nbsp; Can
 anyone please tell me what the password is to do a soft reset?</p>
