    <title>Windows 10 and Toshiba Flash Cards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave469  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Toshiba Flash Cards</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba laptop. &nbsp;After the last Windows update (Windows 10) I kept getting the Toshiba "Flash Cards App is preventing shut down" message. &nbsp;It gave me the option to "restart anyways" which I did several times with no problems. &nbsp; The last time I
 tried to restart it, all I got was a black screen. &nbsp;I have gone through the "hard shutdown" process 3 times to get me into the "Repair Loop." &nbsp;Now I am lost. &nbsp;I cannot figure out how to get my computer to boot up regularly again. &nbsp;I have no CD or flash drive.
 &nbsp;Can someone PLEASE help me. &nbsp;I have been working on this problem for several days now.&nbsp;

            Hi Dave, there does seem to be an issue with the latest Windows 10 update and this app . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Controla Panel - Programs and Features 
<br />
<br />Uninstall Toshiba Main Function Keys or Toshiba Flash Cards, whichever one appears in the list of installed applications 
<br />
<br />That's It!

<h2>            Your other xbox is taking a long time to sync to the cloud</h2>
                    
<p>I get this error message EVERY time I try to play a game on my 2nd console.</p>
<p>I understand that this issue generally pops up when Xbox 1 has not finished uploading your cloud save data before you start trying to play the same game on Xbox 2. &nbsp;However, I get this message EVERY time.</p>
<p>For instance, on Xbox 1 I played Shadows of Mordor, then I had Xbox1 on for another ~10 hours without loading up that game again (which should be plenty of time to upload the latest save data for Shadows of Mordor). &nbsp;Yet, when I log on to Xbox 2 I still
 get the error that the other Xbox is taking too long to sync. &nbsp;It's almost as if Xbox1 isn't uploading my cloud data at all (it is connected to Xbox Live).</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm assuming both Xbox Ones are on the same network, connected the same way (wifi versus wired), etc.. Have you tried going to Settings, Network, Network Settings, and select Test network connection to see if either Xbox results in an error. Have you power
 cycled power Xbox Ones by holding the power button for 10 seconds or until the Xbox One turns off, boot them back up, and see if the issue persists.</p>

<p>I have the same issue but with Minecraft. Home Xbox is hardwired in the living room. &nbsp;Xbox 2 is wireless in the bedroom. Of course, same network and games are online so I know the network connection is good. &nbsp;The "Try Again" option is useless as the sync
 either hasn't happened yet or won't happen at all (idk). Both of my Xbox one's are set to Actually turn of after each use (no instant on).</p>

<h2>            Deleted richtx32.ocx. Is there any way to restore it&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was installing Windows 7 Prof. 32 bits and after doing all the installation I had to install an application, which is not compatible in principle. The problem was that when I tried to execute it I got an error from richtx32.ocx.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>then I started to follow an online tutorial to see how could I &nbsp;solve it. One of them said to unregister it, erase it, download a new one and register again. I did so, but the version I found it was for 64 bits. Therefore now I don't have a proper richtx32.ocx</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried to use&nbsp;<span>sfc /scannow but it doesn't solve me anything, and restoring the system would be pretty painful as I have just installed many apps from that point.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Does anybody know if I can restore it with Windows installation CD or if there's any other way to solve it??&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>Hi Niall,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp;appreciate the time and effort that you have invested in to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you perform the methods stated below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>Disable all external devices connected to the PC except keyboard and mouse and check if you are able to upgrade to Windows 10. Also check if you have any pending updates in Windows Updates, if so install them and check</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Update all the hardware drivers from manufacturer's website and then try to upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, place the computer in a Clean Boot and then try to upgrade.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
To help troubleshoot issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

            SARL - This is Skype Technologies SARL was the holding company of Skype which had developed Skype. Later on, Microsoft acquired it and they became a division within Microsoft.
<br />
<br />So, this is perfectly legitimate. You can try to uninstall and reinstall Skype again and see whether it still troubles you.

<h2>            Delay in turning off computer</h2>
                    When I try to either turn off my computer or put it to sleep, there is about a two minute delay from hitting the turn off computer button until the next screen comes up asking me if I want to restart, sleep or shut off the computer.&nbsp; This just started
 recently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions on what the problem might be?

            <span>Shutdown issues are generally caused by a program and/or process that is refusing to exit gracefully. The program and/or process can be from malware or can be legitimate (such as an invasive antivirus like Norton or McAfee).
 If you are using a Norton or McAfee product,&nbsp; uninstall it and replace with a better program such as NOD32, Kasperksy, or Avast (free). The Windows Firewall is adequate for most people. Shutdown issues can also be caused by old/poorly written drivers so make
 sure all drivers are updated.<br />
<br />
A.The first step is always to make sure your computer is virus/malware free.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
B. If the computer is virus/malware-free, drivers are current, and no Norton or McAfee programs are installed, then do clean-boot troubleshooting to see which program/process is the culprit:<br />

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a> <br />
<br />

http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/shtdwnxp.htm</a> <br />
<br />
Standard caveat: If troubleshooting the issue is too difficult - and there is absolutely no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a computer repair shop. This will not be your local BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. Get
 recommendations from family, friends, colleagues.<br />

<h2>            How do I enable HSTI, NX and SMM on Windows 10 Enterprise&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have Windows 10 Enterprise and I'm trying to enable all the security stuff. I enabled Secure Boot, and used the Microsoft Readiness Tool for Credential Guard and Device Guard. Everything works fine. In Powershell, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The following additional qualifications, if present, can enhance the security of Device Guard / Credential Guard on this system:<br />
Incompatible HVCI Kernel Driver Modules found<br />
NX Protector is absent<br />
SMM Mitigation is absent</p>
<p>Secure MOR is absent."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I enable or fix these? I would like to turn on SMM to "Exceed Enhanced Hardware Security." And what is wrong with HVCI? It shows as running in Powershell (Readiness Tool.) Here's a few other errors in DGLogs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incompatible HVCI Kernel Driver Modules found</p>
<p>Module: pwdrvio.sys<br />

Not all services are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried regedit in hklm/…/deviceguard/capabilities and added each value to 1 (a few had 2 already.) So how do I enable these security settings? And attestation and storage show "Ready." Those too. Please reply. Thanks</p>

            Hi Brian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Photos app or Pictures folder isn't supposed to start with WIndows, only be there on demand for when you want them.  Can you tell us more about how this is intruding at Startup?  
<br />
<br />Startup freeloaders do waste resources and can be managed in general from all the locations where they nest by following Step 4 in this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 able to gain access to your information, but in case you don't then I'd suggest to give Linux Live CD a shot and see if it will help you in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
In order to do that just follow these steps:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Download/burn the ISO image to a CD or USB.</li><li>
Change the boot order in BIOS to the media you burned the Linux on.</li><li>
Once it loads, you could try and mount the drive (or if Linux can read it, it will mount by itself) and see if it shows up. In case it is - transfer the data.</li></ul>

<h2>            Help&#58; Network Printer prints automatically</h2>
                    <p>My Epson Multifunction Wifi Network Printer&nbsp;(Epson Photo Stylus TX800TW) has been working fine for pretty long time.&nbsp; It has been always set not to print automatically on incoming &nbsp;fax.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not until recently it is printing automatically, one page after another&nbsp;&nbsp;(even all networked PCs were shutdown except the WiFi router, fax line unplugged), with this content:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>GET http://xx.qq.com/ HTTP/1.1<br />
</li><li>User-Agent:Mozilla/4.0(compatible;MSIE 7.0;Windows NT 6.1;Trident/5.0;..<br />
</li><li>Proxy-Connection:Keep-Alive<br />
</li><li>Accept:*/*<br />
</li><li>Host:xx.qq.com</li></ol>
</div>
<p>One page with these 6 lines and then another page with the same 6 lines.&nbsp; When power-off&nbsp;the printer, it says "Printing Fax on progress, power-off will cancel the printing .......".&nbsp;&nbsp; Scanned the systems, the PCs were not infected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is this xx.qq.com doing on my home network?&nbsp; Please help.</p>

            <p>Thanks, like I have said it was a network printer.&nbsp; I, eventually, found the TCP 9100 in my router's NAT Setting.&nbsp; Disabling it, stopped the annoying printing (every 5 minutes in the last 4-5 days).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favourite&nbsp;browser is IE8.&nbsp; I selfdom used Mozilla Firefox though it was installed.&nbsp; I have never&nbsp; browsed the

<p>Do you think the "GET http://xx.qq.com/ HTTP/1.1" is the syntax of certain network commands?<br />

Wooh, it's been more than a year.&nbsp; A test to my memory now, but it was some port forwarding problem&nbsp;with the router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, mine is a wireless printer the physical orientation is the printer connects&nbsp;to the router by WiFi, and my PC connects to the router through POE power plug.&nbsp; The maker suggests my router to forward TCP 9100 to the wireless printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been working alright for a pretty long time, and all out of a sudden it printed automatically with this threatening&nbsp; "GET http://xx.qq.com/ HTTP/1.1" header.&nbsp; I disabled the port forwarding, the auto-printing stops annoying me but still performs satisfactorily
 so long the printing was limited to the local network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months later, I've got a firmware update.&nbsp; Then, I resumed the port&nbsp;forwarding and I don't experience that annoying auto-printing any more for more than 9 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my suggestion is to look into the port forwarding matters both in your router and your PC if it is also a server.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen errors possible link to running out of GDI objects</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've had a handful of BSOD recently running win7 enterprise 64bit, stop code 3B. I analysed a couple of the memory dumps and found win32k.sys in the stack and it looked like windows was crashing inside of the task switcher code (DrawSwitchWndHilite). A
 few things stood out each time this has happened. My machine had been up for over a week. Shortly before it crashed I have noticed elements of windows being slightly corrupted, bits failing to draw leaving white regions. On a few of the occasions some apps
 have generated errors, Skype "canvas does not allow drawing", and Eclipse IDE "<span>too many handles</span>". Both these are related to graphical element of windows. I came across a related bug in Chrome using up lots of GDI objects. It seems likely the system
 may have exhausted all GDI objects for the current session, resulting in parts of windows failing to render. However right before the BSOD there was severe corruption of window regions (mainly white screen with parts of windows, not a graphic card video type
 of random corruption) followed by what looks like windows trying to popup or change order, it then freezes, the keyboard and mouse look to have stopped responding. I then hit Alt-Tab to switch apps thinking it was something wrong with the current application,
 at which point the BSOD occurred within seconds. On one occasions where I had this window rendering corruption I did not hit Alt-Tab instead Alt-F4 to close the current app and see if that free'd enough resources to continue and it appeared to work as no BSOD
 occurred.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I think i have a solution at least for my working environment, but posting here to see if it can get anyones attention at microsoft for investigating it further for a proper fix. One additional note is that i have the task switcher mode changed to classic
 from the newer flip mode, so I don't know whether that's related to final stages prior to BSOD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

            We do need the DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking STOP<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
Please follow these instructions to collect data from the crashes and upload them here, to your Skydrive or a file sharing service like Rapidshare.<br />

<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the contents of that folder<br />
Please upload them to skydrive or a file sharing service and put a link to them in your next post.<br />
<br />
Please also go to start&gt;search/run&gt;cmd&gt;msinfo32 and include it in the upload<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />

<h2>            Windows Defender unable to set to On and cannot set Services Startup to Auto</h2>
                    <p>Service settings are grayed out. Unable to turn Defender on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an admin on all 3 logons, Administrator, MicrosoftAccount (upgraded from user account for Cortana on upgrade from 8.1 pro) and a normal user account. None seem to have any power over this problem. Searched the forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled all AV items, Webroot &amp; Spybot in Safe mode but still no luck.</p>
<p>Have to start up 2 of the services manually - this gets an icon.</p>
<p>3rd service errors:</p>
<p>"Cannot start the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Service service on the local computer.<br />
Error 13: The data is invalid."</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is greyed out and either Service Account or System Account. Service account password unknown and inaccessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this might seem cool and ok, like some state, as an admin its definitely NOT. Why call it an admin account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a workgroup build of Pro&nbsp;(Insider 14393), I&nbsp; am trying to get back to zero state for impending Anniversary update with no other AV. This is a failure now. All of the installed software will have to be sacrificed for a fresh restore unless I can get this
 going. SFC /SCANNOW shows no missing files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Registry cleaned of old settings for Webroot, WRSA and WRData searches - I know registry. Used Webroot tool in Safe Mode and Spybot uninstall with Revo uninstaller in Advanced registry cleanup. Only worked in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its as if being an admin on my system by username/pw is useless for this device now. Already got the clue the MicrosoftAccount doesn't play on domain shares etc. or in Active Directory so that is why this device remained on workgroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender:</p>
<p>GPO correctly set (local) or unset as you can tell</p>
<p>Registry set correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Services all manual and non functional except one that will start manually to get it to update and run scans. Still will not turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any intelligent steps? I really don't want your own anecdotal experiences with MS and sophomore explanations as they don't help much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really after an expert on this.</p>

    <title>How do I get rid of small Action Center Window&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get rid of small Action Center Window&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How do I get rid of the Action Center window? I have read what action center wants to tell me, and clicked the x in the upper right hand corner of the window that appears when you open action center, but I have a little window in the lower right that is
 on top of any other window and I want to get rid of it. There is not an x or a close button. How do I get rid of this nag?</p>
<p>Before this problem, when I first started Win 7&nbsp;me a choice of normal startup or a "safe mode" start up because it thought I had recently installed a device that caused a problem. Windows tried to fix the problem but said it did not succeed, and then I was
 able to start windows normally. I have not recently (last several days)installed anything, however the PC is about 2 weeks old, and I have installed things such as an external usb drive, a printer, a flash drive, an mp3 player, and a wireless mouse.</p>

<h3> viktorzugor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update&#47;graphic card</h2>
                    Your precious windows update screws my graphic card drivers (ATI) in windows 7 x64, after some of the updates, I cannot determinate which one, but I am sure it happens after some update, I tested that many times, alwas same result, you should deal with
 that, instead of making the worst software ever (Windows 8 or 9 with that idiotic metro interface instead of normal start button, I doubt all people are going on tablet pc and stuff.). When it happens, says that graphic adapter drivers have crashed and recovered,
 it happens very often, fix that. When I work in linux, it never happens, shame for such a "big" company that free OS can be better.<br />

            <p>So why do you use windows update for drivers?</p>
<p>Drivers are obtained from the hardware maker, or PC maker</p>
<p>MS Does not produce drivers, except for a limited number of MS hardware dvices</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't use Linux but I don't believe it has a driver update function</p>

            I didn't update the driver, I only downloaded security updates, in that process, graphic card malfunctioned, it didn't happen just once, I formatted, tried all over again, same stuff happens, I found over forums that it is a common error, people don't
 know what to do, there is no good solution. I said that in linux it doesn't happen, driver there works fine, that's why I am posting this here, I am sure that it's a windos problem, I even called repairman to check my hardware and hardware is fine, no error.
 What happens is that screen gets blurred and static, and I found out that some of windows update does that, because before I download any update after windows installs, that error does not happen, it only happens, if anyone has solution to that or atleast
 advice. My only advice on this people with this error should avoid windows update, or even better windows itself. And microsoft should start making its software atleast a bit better considering the price they put on it.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 -- Intermittent connection on Windows 10 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been using the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard for past 5+ years and am extremely happy with it. Recently I upgraded to Windows 10 and the keyboard loses connectivity intermittently. It gets annoying because you don't realize the connectivity
 is gone and will keep typing. Only to realize that nothing is appearing on the screen! The connectivity comes back up in a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else seen this problem? Please let me know if you have solved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't see any supported drivers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-in/d/natural-ergonomic-desktop-7000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Since all keyboards are plug and play and work with any windows drivers, your KB might be failing after years of service and should be replaced.&nbsp;If there are no windows 10 drivers to use the special functions of the KB, you should replace the old KB.&nbsp;</p>

            I too love my keyboard and am having the same issue and would like it to work as the replacement keyboard for this model by Microsoft sucks. sorry but the keys are too shallow on the new one, I bought it and it didn't meet my expectations. WE need a fix
 for win10 please.

<p>Think I would run the basics from that url.</p>
<p>If it didn't work I certainly would run from Maintenance in the Action Center the windows updates troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite fix all for those tile things ... from a command prompt (admin)</p>
<p>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; takes a while</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see
<br />
if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several
<br />
tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
</strong><br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click Properties<br />
check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure on Lower Left of<br />

            No not physically anyway.<br />
<br />
Uninstall means Right Click on the device and select Uninstall - its all software at this point.<br />
<br />
Reboot = Restart the computer.<br />

            Hi TrudyLawrence,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you, I would suggest you to perform following steps by Jennifer Cha and see if  they helps please.
<br />
<br />1- In the Windows Search bar, type Internet Options.
<br />2- Open the app and got to the Advanced tab.
<br />3- In the Security section, scroll down and add a checkmark to the following:                                                                                                              Use SSL 3.0
<br />Use TLS 1.0
<br />Use TLS 1.1
<br />Use TLS 1.2
<br />4- After adding a checkmark, click on Apply then OK to save changes.
<br />
