<h2>            sent email disappears from sent items or does not arrive at other end</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>for an 'ntlworld' address I'm using outlook from office 365 on iMac, and for an 'outlook.com' address I'm using outlook live through web browser. but both routes have issues on sent email. 1) the "sending message" message line just drops out and then the
 email is lost completely - I think this is because instead of not touching any keys at all, I tend to move on to another task. or 2) the item appears in sent email but the receiver never gets it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is outlook known to be unstable on iMac or should it work well? thanks Steve</p>

            i appreciate your reply. but with my specific issue, i.e. that an email is in my sent items yet has not arrived at the recipient, I am not sure how your reply helps me resolves the issue? nor with the other issue that I often send an email but it disappears
 from screen, does not go to the sent item, nor drafts, nor does it arrive at recipient, but there is no warning message either, it just disappears. finally sorry but I can't find "tools"

            <p>Hi SteveFriend1308,<br />
<br />
It seems that you encountered issues with your account on Outlook.com and Outlook for Mac when sending emails. Firstly, I need to collect the following information to clarify the issues.<br />
1. Please specify the issues, for example, does “sent emails disappear from screen” occur to Outlook for Mac or Outlook.com? Does “an email is in my sent items yet has not arrived at the recipient” occur to Outlook for Mac or Outlook.com?<br />
2. How did you set up your account in Outlook for Mac, via Exchange, POP or IMAP?<br />
3. Have you tried checking Tools &gt; Accounts &gt; Advanced &gt; Folders to see if <strong>
Don’t store a copy of sent messages</strong> was checked if you have an IMAP account in Outlook for Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/140f362b-769e-4990-a276-0e4a93846516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/140f362b-769e-4990-a276-0e4a93846516" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. As you mentioned “<em>an email is in my sent items yet has not arrived at the recipient</em>”, can other recipients receive the email you send? You can have a test by sending emails to others to check if the issue is related to a certain recipient.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Jasmine<br />

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>1 it happens with both outlook on mac and outlook.com that I hit "send" and then the email disappears from screen, never to be found again anywhere.</p>
<p>2 apologies I do not know this answer, it was easily set up on purchase following on screen guidance. hot helpful sorry</p>
<p>3 yes this has always been set as "store copy of messages in sent items folder"</p>
<p>4 the problem of email not arriving has been proven with two recipients, both of whom received subsequent emails later in the day so I know the emails work with them. with recipient "K" my sent email just disappeared so of course I am sure an outsider looking
 in will think I never sent it! I understand that, although I know I did hit "send". But with recipient "D" the item still sits in my sent items today, yet the recipient, whom I know and trust, cannot see it their end, yet subsequent emails have got through
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latter issue with "D" is the first case I have been able to prove for myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the issue where the emails are "sending" on my iMac and then just disappear into the ether have been going on for a while. So, on the iMac, in both outlook, and outlook.con, I send emails, the status bar type thing shows me that the email is "sending",
 and then it disappears, as does the email, never to be seen again in sent items, drafts, deleted, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried talking to microsoft help but they are utterly unhelpful. Indeed they have always been unhelpful on support and that is why I moved over to iMacs and MacBooks. But I have tried to retain MS software - perhaps soon I will ditch MS altogether
 and these issues will go away!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    I'm having a problem with Mail Merge in Word. The Merge Fields inserted in the body of the letter are in the same font and size as the surrounding text, but the Address Block and Greeting LIne keep inserting in small caps.&nbsp; Unchecking Small Caps in the
 Format dialogue box does not work, and&nbsp; the "charform" solution which works with Mail Merge fields inserted in the body of the text does not work with these fields. Has anyone found a solution?

                    I have been receiving emails not for me for ages now but just ignored them but then I try to access my PayPal account that I have also had for many years and I can't log in as someone else now has the same email address I have spoken with PayPal over the
 phone and explained everything that is going on and they said it's because hotmail have let someone else have the same email address as myself which is very concerning. It's getting very annoying now that I can not access my own account and what if the other
 person is receiving emails meant for me. I have read other comments on here and in the replies saying that two people can not have the same email address but it's obvious that they can. I would really appreciate some help on this. Thanks

            Dear Amy,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Technically it is highly unlikely to register 2 identical email addresses. System that is registering and creating inboxes and assigning other attributes can do that for one address only. If someone else will try to register the same account, he will get error. However if you are positive that there is the same account, I would advice to contact relevant department, that can actually check your account and verify if there is another one that has the same address.

<br />
<br />Hi Amy
<br />
<br />It's not possible for two people to have the "identical" email address. The fact that you're getting emails intended for someone else could simply mean that they have entered their email address incorrectly or to be even more specific, mistakenly entered your email address. The other telltale sign of something like that happening would be if the email messages you're getting for the "other person" are coming from commercial websites versus from individuals.
<br />
<br />Regarding PayPal - have you tried going through the process of resetting your PayPal password (as per the attached screenshot steps)? Do you not get any confirmation emails from PayPal?<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf7673c7-bc8d-4d24-980c-8327b6a685c3?upload=true" />

    <title>Embedded Excel does not update in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nsgma365  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded Excel does not update in Word</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently found that you can link an embedded Excel within Word. As I made a first attempt that it seemed to work.
</p>
<p>Now I am using it for the first time seriously but some how it is not behaving as expected.</p>
<p>First of all when I open the linked file from within Word, it opens the Excel file as a Read-Only. That does not make much sense, because the reason you would open a linked file would be to edit it and if you save it with another name, I would assume you
 would lose the link... </p>
<p>However, the expectation that the embedded file would reflect the changes made on the file is also not being fulfilled. If I open the file outside of Word and edit it, the changes are not seen in Word even after updating the link (or closing and reopening
 the Word file). Nevertheless, if I open the linked file from within Word, Excel opens as a Read-Only and the change is there - so it is linked to the correct file. Yet it is still not reflected in the Word File...</p>
<p>I have no idea what is going on. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hello Suzanne,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Yes. "Update automatic links at open" is enabled.</p>
<p>I have narrowed it down a little - still it does not work as expected.</p>
<p>I have inserted the same Excel file in an empty Word file and closed it. I edited the Excel file and closed it. I reopen the Word file and it does not update, although it asks if I want to update links. When I right-click and click Update it finally updates.</p>
<p>Then I inserted the same Excel file in an empty Word file and edited the size and the position, and cropped the image. After editing the Excel file and reopen the Word file, it never updated again. So I think it has something to do with the touching the
 Excel "image" in Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This basically renders the feature useless because you cannot layout your word properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in the process I found that if you save your Excel file in other worksheet, then it will update the Excel "image" in Word to that other worksheet... In fact it never asks which sheet you want to see... but again it renders the feature a little unreliable...</p>

<p>Hi nsgma365,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your query in this community and really appreciate the troubleshoot steps you have performed yourself.</p>
<p>Anyway, I would like to share the test result on my side:
</p>
<p>If I open the Excel and Word at the same time, The linked tables or charts in Word could be update at the real time.</p>
<p>And if I close the Word, and edit my data in Excel &gt; Save &amp; Close Excel,<span>&nbsp;
</span>Open the Word Documents, it will ask me if I would like to update the linked objects. The linked objects in Word will be updated.</p>
<p>But if I keep Word opened and open the linked Excel worksheet, this worksheet will<span>&nbsp;
</span>be opened in Read-Only mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per your description, seems like your data in your Word won't be update even if it's linked to the Excel Worksheet and with<span style="font-weight: bold"> "Update automatic links at open"
</span>Enabled.</p>
<p>Could you provide us a screenshot of your
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>My word version is Version 1901 (Build 11231.20130 Click-to-Run)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To complete the steps and see if you get the same result you should also edit the image, changing the size and position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be curious if you get the same result. However, as I mentioned, the fact that the link is not worksheet related but is simply an image of the last saved Excel view (i.e. if the Excel file is saved on a different worksheet, it will not display the
 originally linked table) makes it unreliable to extensive use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to offset that issue, I started using the Paste with link and formats. However, I am also having problems with that on the format side. I have a long table, which I need to divide per different pages. So I pasted different sections of the table.
 I was careful to always have the same number of columns so that the width would be always the same. However, when I paste it some of the tables they end up with different widths on the Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In addition to the "paste with link" section of my post above. I have found also that after adjusting the width of the tables on the different pages, after updating thy go back to the width when originally pasted. But, remember, the original Excel had always
 the same width to start with so I really am not sure what is guiding the width in word...</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; I'm not sure I understand this question.&nbsp; What two platforms using Outlook.com?&nbsp; I use outlook desktop to access my outlook.com account.&nbsp; In outlook.com, I have two connected accounts, one is my gmail account and the other is my email account from my
 ISP.&nbsp; If those are the two platforms, then yes.&nbsp; I receive emails from both of them, and I retrieve and read them from my outlook.com account.&nbsp; Outlook.com created a category for my gmail account and assigns this category for every email that comes from my
 gmail account.&nbsp; It does not do that from my ISP account.&nbsp; I have deleted the gmail category numerous times, but outlook.com keeps recreating and using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Again, not sure what you mean.&nbsp; Outlook.com creates the category and assigns it to gmail messages whether I'm logged in or not.&nbsp; When I launch outlook desktop, it downloads whatever is in my inbox.&nbsp; Whatever category outlook.com has assigned to the email
 is downloaded along with the email.&nbsp; So the desktop outlook has no influence on this issue since the category is created and assigned when I'm offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Send you a snapshot of what?&nbsp; My email with the category &lt;username&gt;@gmail.com&nbsp;assigned to an email?</p>

            <p>I just received an email asking if my issue has been resolved.&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; I haven't heard from anyone since my last reply.&nbsp; I have also asked a Microsoft Help Tech for assistance.&nbsp; So far, no help for them either.&nbsp; I'm beginning to think that anyone
 associated with Microsoft really doesn't care and doesn't want to hear there are issues with their products.&nbsp; I expect that kind of attitude from companies like Google since they offer their products for free, and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.&nbsp;
 But I don't expect that kind of support from Microsoft when I'm paying the products I'm using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm still waiting for someone to offer a solution and ask redundant and irrelevant questions like what browser I'm using.&nbsp; The problem is with outlook, not my browser.</p>

            <p>I have this problem as well, with all of my non-Outlook.com accounts.&nbsp; In addition to a Gmail category being created and assigned to Gmail messages, I get the same for all of my ATT.net addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "feature" (aka "annoyance" to actual users) was implemented in November-December last year, apparently as part of the Outlook.com/365/EAS upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some tech sites and even Microsoft people have offered the solution of creating a rule to remove categories on receipt in Outlook 365/2016.&nbsp; However this doesn't work, I believe it has something to do with how Outlook.exe communicates with the EAS server
 or that OWA (Outlook.com in a browser) doesn't even support a category-clearing rule.&nbsp; You can create a category-clearing rule in Outlook.exe but it will only run manually - doing that is actually more effort than just manually clearing categories from the
 Inbox window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm speculating Microsoft implemented automatically assigning account categories as part of their yearlong obsession with "Conversations" (you should see some of the stuff they implemented - and subsequently removed - from the Outlook mobile apps as part
 of the "Conversations" campaign).&nbsp; Part of a trend - starting with the implementation of Windows 10, Microsoft has decided that
<em>they</em> know what people want in their programs better than the people who actually use them.&nbsp; Now instead of default options for these "features", there is no way to turn them off or disable them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best bet is to use MS account feedback pages.&nbsp; Perhaps once they reach critical mass Microsoft might think "<em>Maybe we should make account categories an

<p>Hey! I'm sorry you're having trouble!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried performing a soft reset?</p>
<p>(here's how to soft reset: Hold power button for about 10 -15 seconds. When you feel a vibration realese the power button and wait for your device to boot up! Done!)</p>

            Hi Kaimuki,<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; Can I delte them on the website and stop including my Storage Card in the sync process?<br />
<br />
Regarding that question, you can do the following <br />
<br />
1. Open the My Phone application<br />
2. Go to Menu-&gt;Options<br />
3. Please uncheck the 'Sync Storage Card' option<br />
<br />
From your next sync ,&nbsp; the data on your storage card will not be synced.<br />
<br />
Currently there is no way to delte from the website and not delete from the phone&nbsp; if you have chosen to sync the storage card
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            silicone skin case causing interference&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I am curious whether anyone has used one of the custom fit silicone skin cases that are available.&nbsp; I have a Moto Q9h, and bought a skin case that is a great fit, I feel like it gives my phone a nice protective layer, however, it seems that whenever
 I have it on the phone and I am using the phone for talking (imagine!) that there is some sort of interference or reverb or something like that.<br />
Has anyone experienced anything of that sort?<br />
thanks,<br />

<h2>            Trouble syncing more than a dozen items...</h2>
                    
<p>I am having trouble with Active Sync on my Windows Mobile 6.5 phone.</p>
<p>I am using push with an Outlook 2003 server.</p>
<p>Everything works fine, unless I want to sync multiple items. I can update contacts, add calendar items, get my email all flawlesly and instantly, but should I want to import 20 contacts or add a&nbsp; folder to the list it stops.</p>
<p>If will say looking for changes, then it will show "Contacts 0/20", but stops there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Vetack - We've seen some issues with security software and contacts and with contact quantity and potential sync issues. However, you only have 20 contacts so that should work. Please check out these resources to see if these help:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/v6-5/Overview-Contacts-touch.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/v6-5/Overview-Contacts-touch.aspx</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/v6-5/Sync-Microsoft-Outlook-touch.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/v6-5/Sync-Microsoft-Outlook-touch.aspx</a></p>
<p>If those tips don't suffice, try this:</p>
<p>Go into ActiveSync and under The Tools tab, click on options.&nbsp;It should&nbsp;bring up the files that you are syncing. Try removing&nbsp;contacts from the files to sync with the phone and let the phone sync with just the rest. Sync. Then&nbsp;go back into the options and
 add contacts back into the sync cycle and it will hopefully work for you.</p>

<p>Thanks MaryAlice,</p>
<p>I am sorry, but the 0/20 was actually a type. I have 200+ contacts, and it will only sync about 12-17 at a time.</p>
<p>If I remove contacts from the sync list, it will sync everything else, but if I add contacts back to the list, I get stuck at the 0/200 again.</p>
<p>I can get my contacts to sync, only if I remove them all from my outlook on my PC, then add them back a dozen at a time...</p>

            It has to be something running in the background. That symptom was exactly the same as mine. Turn off Wi-Fi if you are not using it (or near it). If it is on and you are not near Wi-Fi then it constantly polls&nbsp; for it .... big battery waste

            I do still have the original file, but I elected to create a new Windows account with the help of some nerve pills. It would be extremely interesting to know where you are headed in case this were to occur again; creating a new account is not an easy task
 to get all the loose ends set up.

    <title>Office 365 login redirecting to outlook live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michelejack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 login redirecting to outlook live</h2>
                    <p>This afternoon I set up an office 365 login with a purchased key and subscription. I set up a new outlook account to be used as</p>
<p>the login at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After an hour or so I logged out, and now can't get back in. The office 365 portal sees the outlook account, and redirects to outlook,</p>
<p>where of course the password fails. I didn't have a chance to fill in any of the profile details, so now I can't fill in the account verification</p>
<p>form enough to get the password reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried clearing the browser cache, incognito sessions and restarting everything. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            <p>For any other than the first sheet in the workbook, you have to specify the Range argument, in the format "SheetName$".</p>
<p>So if you want to import a sheet named Schedule, use</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acImport, , "Schedule", vPath &amp; "\MPL Project Report.xls", True, "Schedule$"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, the name of the imported table does not have to be the same as the name of the sheet, so you could use</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acImport, , "OtherName", vPath &amp; "\MPL Project Report.xls", True, "Schedule$"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will import the sheet named Schedule to a table named OtherName.</p>

<h2>            Excel file from SharePoint crashes on save</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I want to edit an Excel file which&nbsp;is located in SharePoint folder and then save&nbsp;it, crash appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps that I want to do:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Open the file&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42d4340a-e228-4cf5-b513-8ad60af10aed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42d4340a-e228-4cf5-b513-8ad60af10aed" /></a></p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.<strong> Edit some values&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. <strong>And press "Save" (to save it back on SharePoint)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/304c979b-7a27-4c1d-8666-2c5016de504a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/304c979b-7a27-4c1d-8666-2c5016de504a" /></a></p>

<h3> marksicignano  say:</h3>
<h2>            BUG&#58; Audio Settings for the Ringing sound do not stick. Causes me to miss calls. Problem has been around a long time.</h2>
                    <p>The problem I'm having is that the Audio Settings for the "Ringing" does not stick in the setting. It is constantly reset to "Use Selected Device."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a USB headset, and the speaker and microphone settings point to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a display (ASUS) that has built-in speakers. I'm not likely to hear if the ringing through the headphones if I'm not wearing them or away from the desk. I want the ringing sound to come from the display speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I configure the settings as such:&nbsp; https://www.screencast.com/t/EGfLwvNro</p>
<p>
</p><p>It now works... for a while... At some point (I haven't pinpointed when. Maybe on a restart? Maybe after I remotely log in from another place to this computer?), the setting for the ringing sound will be reset to Use selected speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lengthy discussions existed in the old forum about this, and it's gone unfixed for YEARS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A six-pack of beer, a bottle of wine, or favorite beverage for any abstainers, who can permanently solve this problem for me. Otherwise, I hope that Microsoft will get a fix for this in a new release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Desktop Skype on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if this gets read, also please bring back the ability to record a custom voicemail message.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I never said it "is working now" in any permanent ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I said was that after changing the settings, it now works... for a while and then reverts back to sending the ring sound back to the headphones. The setting does not seem to stick for more than a day at most.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the bug exists, I can't find a way to make that setting stick, and need Skype's help to fix this bug. It's very annoying to me.</p>

<p>If you require a device to stay as the ringing device, that device needs to remain present and seen as the same device. A permanently connected device would be ideal. More than likely the device is seen as totally uninstalled or as a new device. For a test,
 in the past month or so, I have kept a USB extermal audio device as the specific ringing device and it has not changed, even through reboots and the recent update to 7.41. My computer is a laptop that is on 24/7 (monitor blanks when idle) but reboots for standard
 updates. This means sleep and hibernate are off and USB ports are not set to save power. The USB device remains connected to the same USB port at all times but I have removed it and had it use any port connected to my system and it has not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main things that may cause the device to be reinstalled/enumerated, forcing the setting to be changed, due to being seen as different hardware:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Major OS updates.</p>
<p>2. USB root hub/external hub driver updates.</p>
<p>3. Audio device driver updates.</p>
<p>4. The inital introduction of new hardware inline like a USB hub.</p>
<p>5. Possibly connecting an inline USB hub to a different port every time.</p>

<p>Thanks Techfreak_,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio device is the physical monitor that is always connected to the desktop computer. This is happening at the office, and it's the weekend, but I believe this is connected via HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just remoted in to the computer using Remote Desktop, and I looked at the settings and of course, those settings are changed to what appears to be appropriate settings to route the sound through remote desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.screencast.com/t/7YtvxVxe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on Monday, when I return to the office and log in directly, what I'm going to see is that the settings for speaker and microphone are going to be reset to the permanently plugged in headset (Sennheiser SC60's). However the ringing will remain at "Use
 selected speaker".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Skype knows to reset the first two audio options, but it does not reset the ringing sound option back to what it was before I remoted in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this is enough information to perhaps go in to the code to find out if it's just an oversight that the ringing option was not saved and restored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, I'm trying to set it to the same hardware, that's always connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had suspected remoting in might be the trigger and now I'm convinced after looking at that scenario and seeing what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep an eye on it and next week, I will pay attention to the settings before I leave the office, and then check the next morning to see if it correlates to the nights I remote back in vs the nights I do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for offering your suggestions.</p>

<p>I tested out my HMDI audio on my connected TV. HDMI audio will not survive a removal of the device, so the settings cannot be restored. Whether the fault is in Skype or a driver limitation/implementation (Nvidia in my case), I do not foresee any future changes
 made to the classic version of Skype (7.x) unless they are security-related. The newer versions of Skype do not offer such a feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to avoid:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Unplugging HDMI</p>
<p>2. Unplugging power or killing inline power to the TV.</p>
<p>3. Updating HDMI drivers which would would probably occur with the install of udpated graphics drivers.</p>
<p>4. A power off that does not place it in a sleep/stand-by mode. This is less-likely due sleep/stand-by being present to accept remote input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appears to survive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. A power off of the TV, placing it in a lower sleep/stand-by mode. Unless the TV or audio system is fully powered, you will not hear the audio. There may be some TVs that keep power applied to the speakers or possibly even wake the TV when audio is transmitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third party workaround would be to create a virtual audio device that duplicates audio to multiple devices. This might allow ringing on a perferred device and lowered audio on the non-peferred device.</p>

<p>So. Skype for desktop is at the end of its life; the new version doesn't have such a feature, game over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll survive. I guess the world is going to everything else on cell phones and I tend to mostly use it as a landline replacement for my home and home-based business. Maybe ridding myself of Skype and the extra phone number will simplify life.</p>

<h2>            To where is the maps license tied&#63; Sim, IMEI, both, somewhere else&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When I go abroad, I many times buy a foreign prepaid sim for my phone in order to avoid the horror stories of 15000€ roaming internet usage bills when I get back home. ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is still unclear to me is the GPS license I buy for Nokia Maps 3.0 usable on e.g. the new sim, if I bought the licence for my current sim alreadt earlier. Is the licence locked to the device itself (IMEI?), or the sim, or both?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last time when I went far away, just in case I first bought the prepaid sim, and after that bought the maps licence for that country, for one month. This worked fine, but&nbsp;I didn't try if it still works if I put back my own sim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;the licence&nbsp;is tied to the sim, I think this could be a problem if I've e.g. bought a one year licence for Europe, and buy a prepaid sim in another European&nbsp;country, and still want to use the GPS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it is locked to the sim, does it mean the licence is right away usable on another similar Nokia phone, if I switch my sim to it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd personally prefer if the licence&nbsp;was locked (only)&nbsp;to the device, IMEI number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right then I think I can clear this one up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia Maps licencing design is such that it is based on what you do first. If you change your phone, but keep your sim, then from that point forward the Maps licence is linked to your sim. If you change your sim and keep your phone, from that poitn forward
 the Maps licence is linked to your phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ammend this link at a later date you have to talk nicely to Nokia Care.</p>
