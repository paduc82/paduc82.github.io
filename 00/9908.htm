<h2>            One worked - One didn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>The installation of 10041 was good news and bad news. It installed wonderfully on the Extreme but the Lenovo W540 laptop is a mess. The Extreme was on 10039 and the lenovo was on 9926 and the lenovo didn't make it. There's good news and bad news for the
 lenovo. The good news is that I do have a version</p>
<p>10 recovery ssd for it which boots. The recovery disk shows that disk X ,presumably normally disk C:, has 4 main directories on it. It does not show a Users directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to have to wait until there is an ISO to fix the Lenovo. But one thing is for sure....Id best backup the Extreme NOW.</p>

<h2>            Is m.hotmail.com &#40;active sync&#41; and e-mail &#40;msn.com&#41; account access down right now&#63;</h2>
                    On my windows 10 phone my outlook sync and account access has a problem.&nbsp; Appears that m.hotmail.com is down right now since it cannot sync information down to the phone.&nbsp; The phone shows 'attention required' when I go to manage accounts.&nbsp; The phone also
 has a cryptic message that doesn't tell you that the phone can't access the endpoint.

            My phone started syncing to eas.outlook.com. I manually set it to that server and it appears to have fixed the syncing issue. I'm not sure whether the manual override from m.hotmail.com fixed the issue or whether the app retrieved the proper server name
 and fixed itself. Problem has been resolved.

    <title>validation rule violation keeps query from updating or appending - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lbiowa  say:</h3>
<h2>            validation rule violation keeps query from updating or appending</h2>
                    
<p>On Nov 11 I posted question about combining two fields in a query to a new single&nbsp;field.&nbsp; The expressions to make it work are as follows.&nbsp; I tried a query using each and found both worked.</p>
<p>phone: Trim(("day "+[dayphone] &amp; " ") &amp; ("eve "+[evephone]))</p>
<p>phone: RTrim$(IIf(IsNull([dayphone]),"","day " &amp; [dayphone] &amp; " ") &amp; IIf(IsNull([evephone]),"","eve " &amp; [evephone]))</p>
<p>Here is the problem. I am importing data from a spreadsheet to a table set up for this.&nbsp; It contains a field for dayphone and one for evephone. I can run a query that concatenates the fields and append all data to a holding&nbsp;table and this works if there
 is or isn't any data in the phone fields.&nbsp; I then run a query on the holding table to update existing records and another query to append the new records in the main table.&nbsp; This all works fine.&nbsp; When I try to run the query to update or append my records in
 the main table directly&nbsp;from the table the data is originally imported to&nbsp;I get a validation rule violation error if no data exists for either phone field.&nbsp; It will work as long as one field has data.&nbsp; I have two other fields that I also concatenate and they
 do not cause&nbsp;an error if both fields are empty.&nbsp; I have been pulling my hair out trying to figure out what is causing the error and&nbsp;why I can't update and append my records directly from the imported data table.&nbsp; I want to eliminate the step of appending the
 data with the concatened fields to a holding table&nbsp;and running the update and append queries from that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two "phone" fields give me the problem.&nbsp; The data is imported as text with phone numbers as nnn-nnn-nnnn.&nbsp; The other two text fields that I concatenate&nbsp;do
 not give me an error.&nbsp; I am ready to try anything.&nbsp; I don't get this error when I&nbsp;append the data with concatenated fields to the holding table and then update and append records to the main table.&nbsp;I even tried to put the phone data into another text field&nbsp;and
 still got the&nbsp;&nbsp;validation rule violation error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I&nbsp;remove "Trim" or "RTRIM' from the code&nbsp;and then I do not get the error, but it leaves a&nbsp;leading space if there is only an evephone.&nbsp; So it appears to be connected to using Trim or Rtrim.&nbsp; So then I checked my table and reset the field to allow zero
 length to YES.&nbsp; Now it works.&nbsp; I don't quite understand it since I can have a blank field if I append the data without concatenating.&nbsp; The concatenating must do something that affects the fields if there isn't any data to append.</p>

    <title>Blank email body - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnworley83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank email body</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Office 2016 for a user, and transferred his email from Live Mail. Most of the email that was transferred is fine, but some of it, and any NEW emails that are received have a blank body. Attachments are there, but nothing in the body.
 Putting it is safe mode does not change anything. I transferred the pst file to another PC, and the body is still blank. If you view the email in Live mail, the body is there. We do not use AVG or NOD32, and email is not scanned by our antivirus. I have created
 a new profile without any change. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2016. Again, no effect. The OS is Windows 7 on a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas. Thanks for any new ones.</p>

There are possible reasons why some of the emails don't show the content after transferring the account to Outlook 2016. Let's isolate the issue and see what is preventing you from showing up email contents. Kindly provide us the following information:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried accessing the account using another computer that has Outlook app?</li><li>Does it happens if you signed in another account in Outlook 2016?</li><li>Have you tried to repair your Office application to scan for corrupted file on it?</li></ul>

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on the description that you provided, we need to determine the cause of this problem. Having said that, kindly perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Repair Office via Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Start </span>menu.</li><li>Go to<span style="font-weight: bold"> Control Panel</span>. </li><li>Click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Programs</span>.</li><li>Under <span style="font-weight: bold">Programs and Features</span>, click on <span style="font-weight: bold">
Uninstall a program</span>.</li><li>Right-click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Office 2016</span>.</li><li>Click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Change</span>.</li><li>Select <span style="font-weight: bold">Online Repair</span>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Run an SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer. Follow the instructions provided by&nbsp;<strong>ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</strong> found on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
link</a>. If SFC doesn't work, we suggest that you perform DISM found on the same link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After completing the steps above, kindly restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the result for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            I have tried both methods, and still have the same problem. (DISM on Win7 does not have the options asked for on the link.) I have tried another uninstall and reinstall of Office 2016, making sure to use a new profile. The email body is still not seen.
 Any other ideas? Thank you.

<h2>            Unstability after update to 3860 build</h2>
                    <p>Hello to everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>have you notice that this build (3860) seems more unstable that the previous one? I have had a problem with VMWare Workstation: after the upgrade to build 3860 I noticed that my virtual machines doesn't ork with network bridged, and in fact I've seen that
 the upgrade cancelled vmnet0 (that related to bridge connection) under Virtual Switch.</p>
<p>Other problem with vpn connection: it goes ok, but when you leave your pc in sleep mode and then return to your operation, I obtain an error if I try a vpn connetion from my pc and I must restart to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>I have also until now that under IE I can't install webex plugin, that insted works well under Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you experienced similar problems.</p>

            I can't get Virtualbox to run what-so-ever now with the update. &nbsp;Before that it ran fine.<br />
<br />
I also have an app that I use crashing while doing some .net marshalling across com objects (or so it appears.... .net direct memory reads.)

<h3> hassan ali ahmad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Insider newsletters language</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The language settings in all my MS accounts are set to English (US) since longtime ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was receiving the Windows Insider newsletters in English, but recently I'm receiving them in Arabic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't modify my settings, I rechecked all the outlook.com options and MS account settings, and they are still English (US).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I choose the newsletters language, as this option doesn't appear anywhere in the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <span>Hi Hassan,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
Are you facing this issue after upgrading to the latest Build 10130?<br />
<br />
If you have not upgraded to the latest Build, then I would suggest you to upgrade to the latest Build 10130 and check if that fixes the issue. Also, I would suggest you to check for the regional settings to see if they are set to English US.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span>

<p>Thanks for the reply but, unfortunately, it hasn't worked.&nbsp; I'll post a screenshot and apologise for having to have a couple of attempts due to my own typing errors.</p>
<p>Just to explain better, so far I've not found a way to create a new folder.&nbsp; If, for example, on the desktop I right click I bring up the menu and if I select any of the options, including New, the little circle goes round for several seconds, then the screen
 goes white and the menu disappears.</p>
<p>I had wondered if this problem started when dark mode was introduced for File Explorer.&nbsp; It's just the same, though, in Light and Dark modes.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88d4333a-0464-4af8-bbc8-27434b03c05f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88d4333a-0464-4af8-bbc8-27434b03c05f?upload=true" /></a></p>

                    After updating this morning (not on any insider version) every action I perform e.g. click a email to preview, type a word in a message basically anything causes a 2 second stall, the spinner appears then I can continue. Running on Macbook Pro, prior to

    <title>Outlook 2013 Send&#47;Receive not working automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashleyktdg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Send&#47;Receive not working automatically</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2013 is not receiving emails properly.&nbsp; We have figured this out because when the webmail from our email provider is receiving emails when they come in but they do not come into the Outlook 2013 inbox.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2013 and the problem was still occurring.</p>
<p>I have set the send/receive settings to check every 5 minutes.&nbsp; There is no error message that comes up that says the send and receive is not working.</p>
<p>I deleted the .srs file because I saw they may get corrupted and may the issue, but the problem is still occurring.</p>
<p>This is starting to really affect our business because clients are looking for responses and it is difficult to respond to a client when you do not receive their emails!</p>
<p>If we cannot get Outlook 2013 to function properly within our office, we are going to have to switch to another email client that can ensure we receive emails when they should be received.</p>
<p>Can someone please help?</p>
<p>

<p>What does opening Outlook in Safe Mode do? &nbsp;Should we pressing CTRL every time we open it?</p>
<p>We cannot tell immediately if it works or not either way because the only way you can tell if it doesn't work is if their is a difference between the webmail inbox and the outlook inbox. &nbsp;Sometimes it works correctly and then it will just stop. &nbsp;It is an
 IMAP account.</p>

reenasan</a>. Are you referring to the speaker of the phone? Have you tried using the wired headset? How about voice call? Make sure that the volume was set all the way up. If still no audio coming out and your phone OS&nbsp;is WP8.1, you may try performing hardware
 reboot. This reboot will not delete any personal data on the phone. To do this while the phone is turned off, press and hold Volume down and Power button keys at the same time until it vibrates and it will restart. If the issue persists, proceed with phone
 reset. This reset will delete everything on the phone. Please do back up all personal data to avoid data loss. To reset the phone go to Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset your phone. Looking forward for the result to further assist you.

            Hi Alex, <br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes, the touch screen is unresponsive because of the screen protector. Just to isolate this, have you tried removing it? If there would be no difference, then this is more of a hardware issue. We advise you contact the
<strong><a href="https://support.b2x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">B2X Support</a></strong> for further assistance.
<br />

<h2>            How to resolve browser Display Issues&#63; - Text is displayed in new fonts and no browser can access the Internet</h2>
                    I was deleting some unwanted programs from my laptop and it seems, I deleted something important by mistake. The web browsers are not functioning properly. While google chrome, doesn't display anything at all, just the message "aw, snap" everytime I try
 to open a webpage.. the internet explorer does open the webpages but I've noticed that some text is displayed in a totally new font or sometimes the text is just gibberish and impossible to decipher while at some places the font size is soo tiny, it is impossible
 to read the text without zooming in.<br />
And when I type password, instead of the usual black dots or stars.. i get thin rectangles!<br />
<br />
I tried to update Java and Framework, but I don't think the problem lies there.<br />

Please help me out!

That&nbsp; "aw, snap"&nbsp; symptom sounds suspiciously like malware is present.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried to see if Chrome provides any diagnostics and if any are being created or added to each time?&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise&nbsp;perhaps you&nbsp;could try&nbsp;uninstalling Chrome?</div>

<p>What you do with the one that is causing the problem will depend upon what it is and how much you need it.</p>

            Sounds like you have a corrupted addin file. The simplest fix is to shut Word (and Outlook) down, then in Windows Explorer navigate to the location described in the error message.&nbsp; Locate a file that has a name based on " **sword.dot" . Move that file
 to another location. Start word, is the problem gone?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You may get a different error, try turning the addin off:<br />
File menu (aka tab) &gt; Options command &gt; Add-ins option, At the bottom of the dialog there is a "Manage" dropdown input box.&nbsp; You can click on the "Go" button to see if you can find the problem&nbsp; addin in the first category. If you do, uncheck it to turn it off.
 If you don't find it, cancel and pick the next category in the "Manage" drop down.&nbsp; Work through the categories until you find and turn off the problem addin.<br />

<p>I tried shutting down IE from the Programs and Features dialogue of the Control Panel, and that doesn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>I also tried reinstalling IE 11.</p>
<p>(I know where the buttons are supposed to be - to the left of the URL address box.)</p>

<h2>            Cannot erase ghost OneDrive entry in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, i have a problem in File Explorer. I have multiple OneDrive accounts connected, as they appear in the image. However, one of them (in blue), no longer exists; I disconnected it and is no longer present in /C:/users/Myname/.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35ba323c-d419-4e2b-a57e-35340090fbd6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35ba323c-d419-4e2b-a57e-35340090fbd6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Somehow, this entry remains and i cannot remove it from within File Explorer. When i click on it, i get the following error.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/335614f6-0496-49fc-89ca-c5c2ddf5f800?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/335614f6-0496-49fc-89ca-c5c2ddf5f800?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to eliminate that OneDrive entry from File Explorer would be welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Simi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you try the following steps to check:</p>
1.Open the Registry Editor by clicking the <strong>Windows + R</strong> button and enter
<strong>regedit </strong>&gt; <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
2.Please navigate to <strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT </strong>&gt; <strong>CLSID</strong>. Inside the folder, please search (<strong>CTRL + F</strong>) for
<strong>OneDrive</strong>.<br />
3.Find next until you find one that has the <strong>OneDrive – Personal </strong>
(The shortcut in the Windows Explorer linked to your personal OneDrive) or <strong>
OneDrive – CompanyName </strong>(Linked to your OneDrive for Business account)&nbsp; as the Default value and looks something like the screenshot below:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cb4b780-71df-4088-89c2-9529b72c0d89?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cb4b780-71df-4088-89c2-9529b72c0d89?upload=true" /></a><br />
4.Modify the <strong>System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree </strong>value to 0 &gt; OK.<br />
5.Restart your computer.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">WARNING</span><span>: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry

<p>I can't use Cortana because it crashes at launch.</p>
<p>When I installed the build 9926, Cortana worked perfectly. After some updates and restarts, nothing happens when i click on the search icon or the search box.</p>
<p>Sometimes appears a white window, but it quickly disappears.</p>
<p>How can I fix it?</p>

    <title>Using multiple email accounts within Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyvolpicello  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using multiple email accounts within Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Have set up three POP email accounts within Outlook 2010.&nbsp; Noticed that if I send an email to one of the other 2 accounts, it appears to send but is never received within outlook (or anywhere else for that matter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a big deal but found it unusual that it would appear to send within outlook but never receive within outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example would be when I forward an email from one of my emails within Outlook to another.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works fine on Ipad</p>

            The only apps which will work fine in Windows phone are the ones downloaded from the store.<br />

            <p>If you have no connection at all, you can't. There is a process by which you download the app package and
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/apps/how-do-i-install-apps-from-an-sd-card" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Install from the SD</a>, but you still need to have an internet connection to validate the install.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do you have no WiFi, or cell data connection?&nbsp; Does the PC have WiFi capability? I ask because you can turn a WiFi capable PC or Laptop into an Access Point that the phone can connect to, and thereby be connected to the internet.&nbsp;
</p>

</p>
<p>Really a disconnected Windows Phone (no data) or any smartphone, is not a very exciting device.</p>
