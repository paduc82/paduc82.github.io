<h2>            Lumia 920 ghost input, spontaniously wakes itself from Glance and makes lock screen bounce</h2>
                    
<p>I have this problem with my Lumia 920 that sometimes it behaves like someone is touching its screen, even though it lies on the desk untouched. If I wake it from Glance sceen, the lock screen starts spontaneously bouncing up and down, like it does when you
 single tap it. Sometimes it will wake itself from Glance screen by registering a double tap, and then start bouncing. In rare cases, the lock screen does not just bounce, but instead it is oscillating maybe 5mm up and down rapidly, like if someone was swiping
 up and down really fast. Touching the sceen seems to fix it temporarily, but sooner or later (from 30 seconds to several hours) the glitch returns. So now I wonder if there is anything I can do that might fix it, or is my only chance sending it in for repair?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read in another thread here about similar problems with the Lumia 1020, where ghost input would make the lock screen bounce, open apps and type text spontaniously, and go completely crazy. But unlike that, my problem seems to be restricted to Glance
 and Look screen glitching only. This makes me unsure whether this is strictly a hardware problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried opening a drawing app to see if it would register any input and draw something somewhere on the screen, but nothing. I tried opening the drawing app and locking the phone, then unlock it to see the lock screen start bouncing. Then tried swiping
 the lock screen away, hoping it would start drawing in the app, which it didn't becuse it seems to stop registering ghost input as soon as I touch the lock screen. Anyway I just haven't been able to notice any glitching anywhere else than on Glance/lock screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done several resets (vol. down+power) and tried cleaning the screen to make sure there is no residue that interferes with the touch registering, but nothing helps. Bought the phone about 10 months ago, I have always used High sensitivity on the touch
 and there has not been any problem until a few days ago. Apart from the mentioned problem, the touch screen works perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screen was changed about 6 months ago at a repair shop under warranty, so screen is newer than the phone. This is also the reason why I do not want to send it in for repair unless necessary (sent it in for flash LED repair -&gt; they were careless and&nbsp;<span>damaged
 the edges of the display when taking it out, but sent it back to me -&gt; I noticed the damage, complained -&gt; sent it in, they fitted a new display).</span></p>

<p>Ok, so today I tried lowering the touch sensitivity to from High to Normal. I've tried waking it up with the power button many times, and not once did I get the bouncing lock screen glitch. However, pretty much immediately after I returned the sensitivity
 to High, the glitch reappeared. It is like if the touch screen is not properly calibrated anymore, like it has become a little too sensitive. I still find it strange it only happens on Glance/lock screen though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone that can offer any advice based on these findings?</p>

<p>Well, from my searching I have not been able to find anyone with the exact same problem either, in the aspect that it only affects Glance and lock screen. It's really a mystery to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone has any thought or idea about what may be the cause, or of a potential fix, please share,</p>

Just for knowledge ... :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Touch Screen (Digitizer) presents involuntary movements, this defect is related to the screen or the digitizer flex cable connector where you can submit "resistance between tracks" high resistance in mega ohms (oxidation causes this problem).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contacts of the flex cable connector should be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol.</p>
<p>It is advisable to complete cleaning the PCB using isopropyl alcohol on an Ultrasonic Cleaner</p>
<p>These repairs must be carried out in technical assists. If your smartphone is under warranty, send it to the Nokia Care repair center.</p>

<p>That was my thought when the problem first appeared, and it may very well be the case. However, wouldn't the phone be doing wierd stuff like opening apps, scrolling, typing and disrupting my own use of the touch screen, if it just a connector issue? Cause
 it never does, it works perfectly except on lock screen...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I even tried downloading an app that highlights any input on the touch screen, and left the phone on my desk with the app running, with lock screen timeout disabled. No matter how long or how many times I left the phone untouched, it would never
 show any input unless I actually touched it. But when I put lock screen on again, it would still wake itself up and bounce the lock screen. As far as I know the input treshold for the touch screen is not lower when the phone is locked, which would explain
 this behaviour. Not sure though.</p>

More specifically the jumping lock screen in the first 4 seconds, and later at about 1 minute. Although on
 my phone it is less intensive, as the lock screen may be still for a second or two between the jumps, and the rapid jerks that happen sometimes are much shorter (more of a vibrating motion). None of the other glitching in the video happens on my phone.</p>

            I have Lumia 730 and at times I can work the screen with a distance between my finger and screen that is without actually even touching it but once I tap the screen it stops . It rarely happens but it's weird.

    <title>Conflicting changes on mobile devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windoula  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conflicting changes on mobile devices</h2>
                    <p>So, I understand where conflicting changes come from. That isn't what bothers me. I can't seem to find a way to solve these conflicts on my tablet or phone. I currently don't have a laptop or desktop that I can use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, I've created a new page and copied everything over and deleted the page that has the conflicts, but the page that I'm using that has the problems has too many text boxes and drawings for that to be efficacious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know of a way to solve the conflicting changes on a mobile device of some kind? Or is it impossible without a desktop version of the program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info: I have a Galaxy S7 Edge and a Galaxy Tab A.</p>

<p>I did try all the reccommended options in that article many times before, but it hasn't worked. From what I've researched about it, the error occurred when I was editing the page and the page was also syncing, leading to a slight discrepancy, most likely
 of a few words or so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens every so often in all my notebooks, but since I use one more frequently than others, it is more noticeable there. Most of the time, like I said, I would just create a new page and move everything over (duplicating the page just duplicates the
 error, unfortunately) but the page I'm working with currently has too many individual parts to facilitate that decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that OneNote gives me is: "PAGE CONFLICTS DETECTED. OneNote couldn't fully sync this page. Try opening it with a computer or with OneNote Online to view and resolve page conflicts." I tried opening OneNote Online in the browser, but it just opened
 the app instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure it's not with Office 365, since I only have OneNote and Word and not any of the other products. The details about it on the Play Store call it "Microsoft One Note: Save Ideas and Organize Notes" by Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mostly, the problem is a nuisance, so if the only solution is to use a desktop computer of some kind, I'll just wait until I can do that, but I was hoping there was another solution more readily availble to me until I get ahold of such a device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any more questions or any advice. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Office 2010 vs Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carl clough  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 vs Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Office for years- latest is Office 2010. Mostly it is fine- except for Outlook. I have three PCs- all windows 10- but all Office 2010 which means different Outlook files and operations, This had become very difficult to manage- especially
 contacts.</p>
<p>For this reason only, I am considering Office 365, but I have questions.</p>
<p>1&nbsp; I guess I would need Home version to access from multiple computers, even if I am the only user?</p>
<p>2 I now have all active files in One drive. Would this be my file source for active files and folders?</p>
<p>3 What software would be on my local computers? </p>
<p>4 Would Office 2010 still be on them?</p>
<p>5 Where is Outlook 365 situated? </p>
<p>6 Would I have unified sources for contacts, calendar and tasks?</p>
<p>7 Where do those files reside?</p>
<p>8 What is the procedure to begin using Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to log into Office from any of up to 5 devices (including Kindle Fire and Android phone and PCs. And work on all office software including Outlook there. Is that what I could achieve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for answers!!</p>

</p><p>To address one major misconception................</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being able to share email account data among different devices has nothing to do with the version of Office installed on a given device but has everything to do with the protocol used to connect to a given email account (where protocol = POP3, Imap, Exchange).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick Overview</p>
<p>
</p><p>POP3 - is a one way one-time download of the account's &lt;Inbox&gt;. There is an option to "Leave messages on server" if you want multiple devices to see the contents of the &lt;Inbox&gt; on another device. Contact/calendar data is local to the computer/device where
 the account is configured</p>
<p>not sync'd with the server).</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMAP - is a bi-directional sync with the server of the email folders. The data file associated with an Outlook account configured using IMAP is a mirror of what's contained on the server. Contact/calendar data is local to the computer/device where the account
 is configured (not sync'd with the server).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exchange - all item types (email, contact/calendar etc are bi-directionally sync'd with the server. Bi-directional sync = what happens on one side gets sync'd with the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just going by the description, you are not using/do not have Exchange accounts. In that scenario, if you want to share your contact/calendar data, one way to go about that is to create a free Outlook.com account (which is an Exchange account), copy the contact/calendar
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For the other part of your question...............</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 is merely a subscription version of the Office suite. No different then Office 2010, just the most current version of the desktop apps which is paid for annually (hence - "subscription"). Office 2019 on the other hand is a one-time perpetual license
 for the Office suite for one-computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Purely in terms of licensing the software, getting an Office 365 subscription would be the most economical way to go but in terms of the software - it's installed on the computer just like Office 2010 is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people make the mistake of referring to an Office 365 email account. It's a mistake since Office, in and of itself, does not include an email account outside of the free Outlook.com account associated with the MS Account used to make a purchase. There
 are different versions of the Office subscription suite which do include an Exchange account but that is a "paid" option or to put it another way, an Office 365 subscription with a hosted Exchange account is more expensive than one without.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 Home or Personal does not include a hosted Exchange account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 Business does</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your reply. You cleared up my confusion. I guess I mistakenly expected far too much from Office 365. I was really hoping for a central place for contacts and calendar that I could get from several devices. I thought programs would be offsite
 and the local computer a slim client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fine with Office 2010. Its Outlook that causes constant problems. I have a POP account from my ISP, a Google IMAP account, and Outlook exchange account- all in Outlook. Adding an android phone recently confused things even more in email! I have great
 difficulty dealing with outlook files- I just don't understand them and how they work so confusion reigns keeping these 3 accounts working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps my best bet would be to find a 3rd party mail program that could coordinate these accounts with a central data base for contacts, and stop fighting Outlook? Do you have an ideas for that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have really appreciated your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Honestly, not sure what you mean by that. No email client stores contacts in a central location - it's all governed by how (POP3, Imap, Exchange) those connect to the email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you have an Outlook.com account, your contact/calendar info contained in the Outlook.com contact/calendar folders would be accessible by all devices when the account is added (configured) to the device including your Android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for data files in Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Outlook '2010 and later (ergo - all Outlook versions)</p>
<p>
</p><p>POP3 accounts are stored in a PST file with contact/calendar data being local to the device where the account is configured</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Outlook '2010</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMAP accounts use 2 PST files - one for email folders which are sync'd with the server and another for contact/calendar folders which like POP3 are local to the device</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Outlook '2013 and later</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMAP accounts use an .OST file which sync's with the server for email folders. Contact/calendar folders have the words "This Computer Only" in the the folder description and local to the computer where the account is configured</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>If configured as an Exchange or IMAP account - it uses an .OST data file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can be configured as either POP3, IMAP or Exchange (the default). If configured as POP3 or IMAP, contact/calendar data is not sync'd with the server. Not a limitation of any email client whether Outlook or otherwise, it's an industry standard definition
 of the protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Store your contact/calendar data in an Outlook.com account folders and the data will be accessible by all devices connecting to the email account as long as Exchange (Exchange ActiveSync) is used as the protocol. The only other thing that you would need
 to ensure is to set the Outlook.com data file as the "default data file" in Outlook desktop (any version). To do that, go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; select the Outlook.com .ost data file and set it as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to start with answering a more basic question given the information above "What problems exactly are you encountering"? (Don't think upgrading to Office 365 is going to resolve anything that you can't deal with in '2010 so first order of business
 would be to address the problem(s))</p>

<p>This link describes a shortcut to capture the FULL and EXACT error message text in a message box. As of Win 2000, &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;C&gt; captures error text from some (most? all?) dialog boxes. Report back here by pasting the text.</p>

<p><span>Solving problems unique to a machine can be an arduous task for both the end-user and the help desk. That’s why Windows 7 introduces the Problem Steps Recorder, a screen-capture tool that allows the end-user
 to record the problems they’re having step-by-step. If the problem is repeatable, the recorder will capture what you do in text form.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s as simple as hitting “record” then adding in comments as needed. A HTML-based file is converted to a .ZIP folder, which is easily passed on to the help desk.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The program is accessible from the Control Panel under “Record steps to reproduce a problem” or run psr.exe from Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>Upload result to a file share site and post the link back here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>Posting Images using IE and Skydrive</b>
<p>(I suggest you use Skydrive so MS is paying for the space rather than some other free site)</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Capture the image using a screen capture tool</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Save to your HD. I know BMP works, I don’t know about other formats</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Upload the image file to a file sharing site, like skydrive: https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=11&amp;ct=1326066082&amp;rver=6.1.6206.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&amp;wreply=https:%2F%2Fskydrive.live.com%2F&amp;lc=4105&amp;id=250206&amp;mkt=en-CA&amp;cbcxt=sky</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In skydrive click on the Public folder</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Add Files” (at top of window)</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Drag the file from Windows Explorer into the target box displayed by Skydrive</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on the check box beside the file name</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “View Original” (on right side of window) to open the image in a new browser window/tab</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In IE, we can right-click on the image and click on Copy<br />
In Firefox,<span>&nbsp; </span>use &lt;ctl&gt;&lt;A&gt; (to select all), then &lt;ctl&gt;&lt;C&gt;<span>&nbsp;
</span>(to copy it&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on the forum input box to make it active</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;V&gt; to paste the image into it</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Give it a few seconds to upload the image</p>
<p><b>(HEY MODERATORS: this process is insanely complex! LET US PASTE images directly into the input fields! Like we could before the app was “improved’ &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt;<span>&nbsp;
</span>last year)</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>File Sharing </b>
<p>It is simple enough. First thing to remember is never post anything on a file share (share being the key word!) site (public or private) that you wouldn't be willing to see posted on a public bill board.</p>
<p>Create a "sanitized" version of the file that does not contain any sensitive personal or corporate information</p>
<p>Pick a file share service: DropBox, Skydrive, Fyels, Ge.tt, Crate, to name a few) and sign up for a FREE account</p>
<p>Follow their instructions to upload the file and to mark is as public shared</p>
<p>Copy the link to the file</p>
<p>Paste it in the post back here.</p>
<p>This link has instructions specific to MS Skydrive: <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><b>NOTE:</b> MS has added file structure validation to Skydrive. If your problem is file corruption, like the “missing XML end tag” problem, you can no longer upload the files to skydrive.

                    I just bought a brand new iMac, and a new software package of Office for Mac Home and Student 2011. I installed it and registered it. Next I Launched Word. Word Document Gallery opens and I double-click Blank word document and a large document opens called

I called tech support and they said they could fix it for $99. The support tech asked if that was ok and I said no so he hung up on me. It’s a brand new machine with a brand new registered piece of software. why would I want to pay $99 for him to fix it. What
 is this weird document and does it need fixing? Thank for your help in advance.

            Hi Deborah:
<div><br />
<div>That's a copy of the "Friday the 13th" Virus, which is very old and quite infamous! &nbsp;Thanks&nbsp;for posting that, it's the first time I have actually seen the code for it!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The aim of that virus is to delete everything from your hard disk. &nbsp;Fortunately, it won't work on your Mac because you have no "C" drive. &nbsp;But that's all that is saving you, so we better get rid of it quickly!</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need a commercial-grade AntiVirus system. &nbsp;Personally, I use this one:</div>
<div>http://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-antivirus-for-mac-home-edition.aspx</div>
<div><br />
<div>That's the "home" version of the industrial-strength protection used by a lot of large corporations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Install it, allow it to update, then run a Full, Deep scan of your entire computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It may find that virus in quite a lot of documents: it tries to scatter itself around your system as much as possible. &nbsp;If it finds it, it will delete it for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You will need to read the instructions slowly and carefully: I believe cleaning that one is a two-step process: Sophos will first move the infected files into Quarantine, then offer to clean them for you. &nbsp;If it succeeds in cleaning the files, it will
 move them back where they were, I think.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>
        </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been unable to sync some OneNote notebooks on my Mac for over a month now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are saying, either the sync goes on forever or an error message appears. It’s also about some specific sections. I have also tried closing and reopening the notebooks, doing a clean reinstall of Office, manually copy-pasting all of my notes, etc.
 Nothing helped. Curiously, the syncing issues started without me installing an update or doing anything out of the ordinary. Even notebooks which haven't been edited since last summer appear to be affected, so I have absolutely ruled out the possibility that
 it's an issue related to the files themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been wasting tons of time with Microsoft Support, but they are unhelpful, if not even rude. They are basically blaming it on me (?) and on the fact that my notebooks are relatively large in file size (e.g. 2,5 GB). I think this is a really bad joke
 on their behalf, and they are lucky I haven’t cancelled my subscription yet with all of their epic fails in the past couple of months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, may I ask what error messages you are getting? For me it’s usually one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>0xE4010640 (most often and most frustrating)</li><li>0xE4010641</li><li>0xE0000790 (I got this when OneDrive was down for some reason)</li></ul>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Jiaxing,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In regards to your questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. This happens to some notebooks, generally those who are larger in file size (e.g. 500 MB, 2.50 GB and so on). I have managed to fixed the issue for one of the problematic groups by manually setting
 up a new notebook and copy-pasting all of the notes; however, I did the same with some of the others and it didn't help. What I find very disturbing is that in most cases, we are talking about notebooks/sections which have not been edited in months and now
 they suddenly can't sync.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>2. All of my notebooks are kept in my personal OneDrive account. You will find details about my subscription in the private message I'm sending you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3. I have tried that with one of the notebooks. I shared it to a test account, then I copied it into that account and I opened it. At first it seemed like it worked, then I got the same error
 message (</span></span>0xE4010640<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>), but eventually the error message disappeared. What I found interesting in this case is that I got the same error message for two different sections of the
 same notebook from the two user accounts:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19bdd81b-61dd-43a5-8ce5-4519bf6cdd5a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19bdd81b-61dd-43a5-8ce5-4519bf6cdd5a" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5144b4a4-c5da-4d33-8e92-6e5b2ab02952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5144b4a4-c5da-4d33-8e92-6e5b2ab02952" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have now closed the notebook from the test account as it seems like it worked in the end. But I can't be 100% sure - this whole thing is very unpredictable.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have, however, issues with another notebook that I wanted to test, as whenever I try to copy it I always get a generic
 error message </span><em>"Something went wrong, please refresh the page"</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I am currently running OneNote 15.32 (170304) on macOS 10.12.4 (16E195). The issue first started when I was still using OneNote 15.31 without me doing anything out of the ordinary.</p>

            <p>Hi Tim</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid that this is already something we tried and it failed. I wasted so much time transferring my data and the settings of all my applications (since the syncing initially seemed to work), only to get the same dreadful error message (0xE4010640). It
 is definitely not the case that my account is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My service request will soon get a closed status as I am tired of troubleshooting.<strong> I have been unable to sync my notebooks for over one month and Microsoft Support has been looking into it and wasting my time for three weeks and we are not any closer
 to resolving this problem than we were on day one.</strong> Not only have they been unhelpful, but they have been somewhat rude as well: first blaming it on me, then on my computer/network, then saying that the files are too large (since when is 2.50 GB a
 large file in 2017), etc. To top it all, they call me mostly at their own convenience and not at my own convenience (when they call, mostly they write me emails saying there is basically no progress and asking for my patience). Worst of all is they don't even
 read my emails thoroughly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attach a screenshot of what they proposed after three weeks of troubleshooting:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75b816df-8be0-4b98-893a-0b29b7877e8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75b816df-8be0-4b98-893a-0b29b7877e8f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the links: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-document-library-errors-when-using-OneNote-with-SharePoint-6245e8ff-ef60-4654-8aa7-f7db4cdaf197" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link #1</a>, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-the-0xE4010641-Network-Disconnected-error-in-OneNote-431c61ce-9f9d-44fe-a517-caefe70df6f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

link #3</a>. The first one is regarding SharePoint - they know from day one that I am NOT using Sharepoint. The second one applies to OneNote 2013 on Windows and not to OneNote 2016 on Mac. The third one is just a generic page about syncing errors in OneNote
 on the Mac, one that I have been able to find long ago before contacting support.
<strong>They are basically making a fool out of me.</strong> After waiting for so long, this is what they come up with? For me it's either they don't know what to do to help me or they don't care anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was promised that the product development team would be contacted and apparently they were. After waiting for an entire week, this is what I got from them:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81bc4cec-3258-4d30-b0cc-e3f7a147a442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81bc4cec-3258-4d30-b0cc-e3f7a147a442" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is my reply to that message (you can notice how angry I was by the tone of my message - I'm not even sorry about that):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e08f1c0b-3373-4030-a4e3-895345829522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e08f1c0b-3373-4030-a4e3-895345829522" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I would like to point out that the way my case has been handled has been very unprofessional. They basically just keep asking for screenshots (nothing new has happened since the issue appeared, so I don't know why) as if that is going to help them
 resolve my issue, by staring at some screenshots. I have shared two of my notebooks with them so they can investigate the issue a bit further - and
<strong>this is something that violates my privacy and that most people probably wouldn't be willing to do</strong> - apparently, to no avail. They keep sending me emails and conveniently don't answer all of my questions when I ask them something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have basically BEGGED them to collect log files, hoping that this may help more than staring at screenshots. They have refused to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As a result, my interest in resolving this issue goes as far as I can export my notes from one of the "problematic" notebooks (I have been able to export everything else) so I can move to a more reliable note-taking application.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, but after all of this I'm afraid I can't trust you with my data anymore. Allow me to remind you that in the last quarter of 2016, I was prompted to continuously sign in a couple of times a day; something that lasted for nearly two months.
 Now this happens... I'm sorry, but my patience only goes this far. OneNote on the Mac is already a severely crippled application when compared to its Windows counterpart, so if it can only do ≈ 5 things, then it better be able to do them right!</p>

            <p>An update as of April 3, 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>With lots of pain, I have been able to download the *.one section files from OneDrive and copy them in my Windows VM. Whenever I try to import these into OneNote on Windows, it (surprise, surprise) crashes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following error messages reads <em>"We are sorry, but we couldn't do what you asked us to since an error occurred"</em> - very helpful and very detailed indeed:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b7bed58-4ce8-43ff-bbdd-0904e492663e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b7bed58-4ce8-43ff-bbdd-0904e492663e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another one that reads <em>"An error occurred while merging. It's possible that some pages weren't merged in the selected section"</em> - I only wanted to open a *.one file, and not merge it with anything, but OK. And guess what - no pages at all
 were loaded:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae8707bd-d793-469c-855a-f5a117968f94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae8707bd-d793-469c-855a-f5a117968f94" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm absolutely sure that either OneNote on Mac or OneDrive (not that I care) has corrupted my notebook. Isn't this wonderful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile: Support is not answering my emails. I'm only slightly going crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I promise you, once I get to export my data, I will never use your services again!</strong></p>

            Hi Kiril,<br />
<br />
I just check the SR number you provided, and found the Escalation Engineer Sher had a communication with you 4 hours ago to follow up on the issue.<br />
<br />
Given the situation, we suggest you keep working with them to get it resolved. If you need further assistance in bridging, or the issue still can’t be moved forward, feel free to let us know.<br />

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Jiaxing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sad to inform you that, despite having talked to them, my problem hasn't been and it's not going to be solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As I said, at this point I am not even interested in fixing the original problem, I only want to export my data (six sections to six PDF files) and leave.</strong> However, even that appears to be impossible. As I described in my previous post, I
 tried to do it myself and it failed. Therefore, during my talk with Microsoft Support yesterday I asked them if they could do it for me and send the PDFs back to me since they mentioned (see one of the screensots above) that syncing "showed good results".
 Today I woke up to the following email:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b569bc5-9ad3-4e0c-9b27-0e858dc85f8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b569bc5-9ad3-4e0c-9b27-0e858dc85f8a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is the epitome of unhelpfulness!</strong> They would appreciate my efforts to make OneNote sync work again. LOL! I would be laughing if I weren't so frustrated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have to go to onedrive.com and manually export ≈ 150 notes. That is going to eat a whole day of my precious time. I am cancelling my Office 365 subscription (this time for real) the moment I am done with exporting :)</p>

                    <p>Office 2010 on Windows 7 Enterprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To monitor the call center status, I have a macro that keeps the screen from timing out by using Sendkeys to press the {home} key once every ten minutes.&nbsp; It seems to be the only way to do it on this computer and it&nbsp;works fine.&nbsp; I "break" the macro if I
 plan on using another Excel spreadsheet there, but most of my active spreadsheet use is on another computer.</p>

<p>However, the Sendkeys macro&nbsp;often, but not always,&nbsp;also turns off the numlock, which is an inconvenience in my frequent use of&nbsp;another (non-Excel) program.&nbsp; Is there a way in the macro that I can either<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. After the {home} execution, check the status of the numlock and if it's off, use Sendkeys to press the {numlock} key, or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Just turn the numlock on after every {home} execution?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it appears to&nbsp;works and sometimes not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pasted the code into its own module.&nbsp; In the "Keystroke" macro (in&nbsp;another module) I added "TurnNumLockOn" to the line after the Sendkeys statement &gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Keystroke()<br />
For cnt = 1 To 10000<br />
SendKeys "{home}"</p>
<p>TurnNumLockOn<br />
Application.Wait (Now + TimeValue("0:10:00"))<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not the focus stays on the Keystroke macro spreadsheet, the computer screen does not time out, so that part is working.&nbsp; But I still have a problem with the numlock sometimes turning off and sometimes turning on.&nbsp; Turning on is good, but why the
 inconsistency?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the Keystroke macro spreadsheet does not always have the focus, since I might be actively using other apps, or might just be monitoring them.&nbsp; Heck, I have even purposely turned off the numlock, then started the macro, and it has sometimes turned
 it back on immediately and sometimes not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try changing this line of code....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SendKeys "{home}"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to this....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SendKeys "{home}", True</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That second optional argument will make the macro wait until the SendKeys operation has completed. I believe the "sometimes it appears to&nbsp;works and sometimes not" is probably due to a timing issue.... if I am right, then making the macro wait until SendKeys
 is done should fix the intermittent problem you are seeing.<br />

            I see the same here. I think it's an error in Word. It is possible that they have had to change the behaviour to comply with the strict .docx file format standard, but I would doubt it in this case.
<div><br />
<div>You can usually replace the SYMBOL field by the character from the Symbol picker (in the Insert tab). It worked here for the small delta character you used, but I'm not sure it will work correctly in all circumstances (e.g. saving as .doc)</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW, I have reported this via the Smile/Frown feature (I hope it still works)</div>

<h2>            Won&#39;t upgrade &#47; update to newest build 14367</h2>
                    <p>Was stuck on prior build. Decided to try new Refresh Tool (big mistake). Refresh Tool installed a buggy version (14342) that would not allow me to use Twitter at all.&nbsp; Checked / Verified account. Changed from SLOW ring to FAST.&nbsp; After 24 hours still no update.&nbsp;
 Installed my most recent ISO (version 14332) which is currently on my system. After 24 hours same thing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Had another PC that was on SLOW ring. Changed it to FAST and it updated within two hours to new build. Both systems are very similar. Rampage IV motherboard vs Rampage V.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can swap SSD to opposite machine and boot same (have to return to original machine
 to keep license on correct machine).&nbsp; Just need to know what Build to install to get further updates. Have been on program since 2014.
</p>
<p>Would be helpful&nbsp; if there was some feedback on these situations where you cannot move forward. My equipment seems to be working fine and I can download and install apps from Store and use internet. So how to test for why updates not coming in?

    <title>Dragging a cell to copy the formula in a series of numbers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dragging a cell to copy the formula in a series of numbers</h2>
                    When I try to drag the fill button for a simple division formula the results end up showing a divide by zero error #DIV/0!.&nbsp; I check the formula in the cell it is correct.&nbsp; For example in column A is the following series 100, 200, 300. In cell B1 is the
 number 2.&nbsp; In C1 a put the following, =A1/B1 and it calculates it correctly at 50.&nbsp; Then I click on C1 grab the fill thing and drag down and that results in the #DIV/0! error.&nbsp; I then check the formula bar and it is correctly saying =A2/B2.&nbsp; What am I missing?

            It simply means that your cells B2 onwards are blank which are treated as 0. If anything is divided by 0, then the result is #DIV/0.
<br />
<br />In case, you want to divide all numbers in the series by 2, you need to put following formula in C1 and drag C1 down
<br />=A1/$B$1

    <title>Problem with receiving emails....... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanparkes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with receiving emails.......</h2>
                    I'm having problems receiving emails.&nbsp;for about 3 months I've had many emails that I've been expecting&nbsp;not hit my account. Sometimes they turn up 2 months late after the original sending or not at all! I've checked my Junk, my settings about blocking,
 about forwarding, filters, rules etc etc and everything in settings&nbsp;looks fine. People ring me up fuming that I haven't replied to 5 emails they've sent that I haven't received. These are the ones that I know about.... Especially as I work&nbsp;freelance, my email
 address is my work. I've changed my password to see if that helps too..... It's strange because there seems to be no consistency to it, as it's indiscriminately effecting my contacts, new senders and god knows what else. Please help!!!

            <p>Hi SusanParkes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me try to assist you further with receiving emails on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sent a test email to your account and there are indications that it was received immediately. We recommend that you check the timezone of your account if it is the same as the one that you have on your computer. We advise this because the time you see
 on your emails might just be incorrect due to the timezone of the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

</p><p>There may be many ways to do this. The way I would do it would be to set up a separate column in Excel for each of your sentences or paragraphs. You merge in your data, doing the formatting in Word.</p>

<h2>            The &#34;s&#34; in &#34;https&#34; keeps dropping&#59; how do I get it to stay on the address&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to work on a secure site. When I enter the address e.g <a href="http://www.site.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.site.com</a> I have access to everything except the secure information I need. To get access, I must go to the address bar and put the "s" at the end of "http". If I try to enter the address as
<a href="https://www.site.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.site.com</a> as soon as I hit "enter" and it brings me the site, it drops the "s" and again I can not gain access to the secure information I am needing. It's only after I&nbsp;get to the site and then put&nbsp;the "s" in the
 addres, hit "enter" again - that I can access my secure information. I have tried to save the address (with the "s") in my favorites and on my&nbsp;desktop, but it keeps&nbsp;defaulting to the&nbsp;unsecure "http" address. &nbsp;I have tried entering this site in my settings
 under "compatibiltiy views" - but the address will not stay listed there and&nbsp;I have delete my browsing history....any other suggestions?</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 - not moving messages manually blocked to Junk folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darma.avalos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 - not moving messages manually blocked  to Junk folder</h2>
                    <p>I have changed hosting account recently, from a Windows server to a Linux server.</p>
<p>Before when I blocked manually a sender, via Junk &gt; Block Sender, Outlook would automatically move that message to the Junk E-mail Folder and display this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"The sender of the selected message has been added to your Blocked Senders List and the message has been moved to the Junk E-mail folder"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>However, now in the Linux server, when I mark the message as Junk &gt; Block Sender, the address gets added correctly to BLocked Senders List, but the message does not move to the Junk E-Mail folder. I then get the following mesage fro Outlook:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"The sender of the selected message has been added to your Blocked Senders List"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I have tried the following steps without success:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have configured on the server side the Junk E-mail folder to be outside the root, inside the root, named Junk or named Junk E-mail</li><li>I have configured Outlook to use Inbox as root folder on the server.</li></ul>
<p>I would be thankful to find out how can I fix this.<br />
<br />
Cheers !</p>

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens on multiple computers. This is for a client of ours. When trying to help this client, I then installed the account on my machine to reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here some detailed information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain was initially hosted on a Windows Server 2008 with Smarter Mail 10 as mail server.</li><li>Then we moved the domain to a Linux server with Exim 4.80.</li><li>It is an IMAP account.</li><li>The problematic mail client is Outlook 2010, on Windows 7.</li></ul>
<p>Initially I thought there could be a problem with the new server, specifically with Root Folder, because on the new server the special folders are listed under Inbox. But this hypothesis is ruled out.
</p>
<ol>
<li>I have tried both configurations (with Root Path on Inbox or not) and;<br />
</li><li>The same account works perfectly on my Outlook 2013 and Mozilla Thunderbird.</li></ol>
<p>I appreciate any help on this issue.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Darma</p>

            Undoubtedly the computer was supplied with a trial version of Office. It appears that trial version has now expired. You should investigate what educational offers are available on the software in your area.<br />

    <title>Office 365 OneNote &#42;.onepkg file will not open for import to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lw333us  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 OneNote &#42;.onepkg file will not open for import to OneNote Office 365 Personal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings fellow tech troubleshooters! After searching the forums and not finding an aligned solution, posting here for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I exported my OneNOte file from my previous Office 365 for Business account as a*onepkg file. I have it saved in ONeDrive (personal) on my new Windows Surface Pro which I recently purchased (and I installed Office 365 Personal). I wanted to import my OneNote
 *.onepkg file to my personal OneNote on this computer, but I have run into the following issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) There is no import feature on OneNote Personal under the "Options" section</p>
<p>2) When I try to open the file direct from my OneDrive Files (in hopes it will link to OneNOte automatically), nothing happens. I do not even get an error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to the Microsoft app store think a bridge app might be needed to link the file into OneNote, but all that is offered when I go to the app store is OneNOte personal (and it only offers a "Launch" button which then leads back to my empty current
 OneNote where I am trying to import my old notebooks into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what I may be doing incorrectly? Many thanks for your assistance!</p>
