<h2>            Sync Failed - Error 0x85010001</h2>
                    I am using the Omina i910 from Verizon. When I first downloaded MyPhone several months back, it worked fine. For the last couple of months I get "Sync Failed" with the error code 0x85010001, could not connect to the service. Check your internet connection.
 My internet connection seams fine, I can surf the web and connect to Windows Live Hotmail and others. I just downloaded the most recent version of the program to my phone, stil receive the same error. I do have a Storage Card and check the box to have it sync.<br />
<br />
Please help!

<p><span>Hi Dennis,<br />
<br />
That's strange if you keep getting this error message but you do have internet connection configured in the device.<br />
<br />
I know it's not the best&nbsp;thing to do in order to solve a problem but&nbsp;can I ask you to full uninstall the application and install it again? This issue could be related to some configuration files that the My Phone application keep in the device that can have
 out-of-date information for some reason. Still it shouldn’t happen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this solves your problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            I have precisely the same problem on my phone, and it started about a week ago. &nbsp;I have uninstalled the version of MyPhone that I had on my phone (HTC TyTNII), installed the latest MyPhone downloaded today from the website, ran the program...it still stalled
 and then failed. &nbsp;I deleted the config.dat and appdata.dat files, ran the program again. &nbsp;Still no luck getting the program to sync successfully.
<div><br />
<div>I was synching automatically everyday up until the most recent non-beta version of MyPhone was released. &nbsp;What gives??</div>

Did you have a storage card besides the internal? I'm having the same issue only just with the internal storage card..<br />

            Same here, I have to close all open apps to get it to sync, most of the time that works. More often than none I have to do a soft reset then sync. This sucks because it doesnt sync during the schedule overnight that I set up. I hope I never lose my phone
 and have to use the premium features to find it etc because it will not sync and give me the last known location : /

<p>Yup ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is very little difference between E72, E5 and X5(-01)...</p>
<p>So by looking at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spotify.com/int/mobile/spotify-and-nokia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.spotify.com/int/mobile/spotify-and-nokia/</a>&nbsp;and seeing E72 with the other similar product, I am ready to conclude that it will work
 for you (unless Spotify has put obstacles on the road - and I doubt that ;-))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go ahead... m.spotify.com for quick setup</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I think that I will uninstall 2010 first and then install 365. I found another article on the internet on at the HowTo-Outlook.com website that seems to suggest the suggest the same thing. I.e. uninstall the old and the new Outlook
 will use settings from the old Outlook during the setup. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still a little confusing to me and I'm a little turned off by the quality of advice that I've gotten from Microsoft's support folks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Actually, as I understand it 365/2016 does not install "alongside" any earlier version of Office.&nbsp; When you start the install process you should see a message saying older versions of Office have been found. You will be given the option to continue the install
 process which will UNINSTALL the older version, or stop the 365/2016 install.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you allow the install to continue, it should pick up your existing PST and NORMAL.DOTM and other existing configuration settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When 365 install works (most of the time) it is great, but if there is a problem, things are not so nice.&nbsp; Before you do the 365 install (or any other "upgrade") you should make an image copy backup of your system so you have a known good point to fall back
 to. </p>

            Make sure you also have your 2010 product key and installation file, for when you have to re-install because 365 has magically disappeared.&nbsp; If you read through the forum you'll see all sorts of magical happenings, and non-happenings, associated with 365
 and 2016. <br />

 by phone update increases in data sense sometimes it suddenly goes to 30% or40%. The problem is in between it suddenly shows an error 8I0188d2 I tried restarting the phone and the ttried soft reset and hard reset nothing worked what may be the problem? My
 mobile is having 8.10.15127.138 installed

<h2>            Exporting Emails from Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to export emails from an old outlook account which we want to close &nbsp;( on latest edition of outlook). &nbsp;I have been totally unable to find an export option on the Mac version of outlook and every 'instruction' advice I get always talks through the
 pathway of going to file, export etc.</p>
<p>Other then reinstalling the email account on a windows machine which I would rather not do, does anyone know how to export from the latest Mac Outlook, or if it is possible to export from sharepoint outlook version?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

                </div>

<p>There is no such thing as an Outlook account, I assume you mean Exchange account (online). If you are using Outlook for Mac, why is there no File/export option? What 'Outlook account' do you mean (or perhaps you mean Outlook.com, formerly hotmail.com?) &nbsp;What
 Outlook version are you using?</p>

<p>Sorry my 'tech' knowledge is not that great. &nbsp;We as a company use office 365 'exchange account', which each employee then links to their individual microsoft office subscription loaded onto their laptops. &nbsp;We need to close an old employee exchange account,
 but before doing so would like to export and save all emails linked to the account -- -and having typed that I think I may have just answered my own question - I think her account may already have been deactivated which will be why the export function is not
 working - being a muppet this morning. Thank you so much for your time. &nbsp;If my thoughts are not right will post again. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>hi rachel,</span></p>
<p><span>i understand you would like to export the data of an office 365 account in the latest outlook 2016 for mac client but there is no such an option. have i got the situation correct? please feel free to correct me
 if not.</span></p>
<p><span>if that’s the case, after my research, you can’t export data from outlook 2016 for mac client now. as is shown in this article:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-za/article/known-issues-in-outlook-2016-for-mac-af547e5c-4310-4d41-9944-08b1e842ebe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-za/article/known-issues-in-outlook-2016-for-mac-af547e5c-4310-4d41-9944-08b1e842ebe4</a></span></p>
<p><span>so it might has nothing to do with whether her account is deactivated or not.</span></p>
<p><span>on the other hand, since you don’t want to perform it on a windows machine, you may install the outlook 2011 for mac client and

export the data in it</a>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>note</strong> that if her account is deactivated actually and you cannot set up her account in the outlook 2011 for mac client, please feel free to post back and we will provide further instructions.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Please write to us with the following details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do you get any error message when the emails fail to open from search?</p>
<p>2) Are you using Outlook application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search emails&nbsp;using Windows Search feature, it will not give you results from Outlook.com account. There is a different search option available&nbsp;for Outlook.com account. Once you open your Outlook.com account you will get an option on the top right
 corner. You can search from there, you also have an option of Advance Search. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Open option available in Windows Explorer is only for Windows, you can open any file or drive using this option. It will not open the email of your Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you, let us know if you need any further help.</p>

            No error messages, it it simply shows the emails and nothing else is allowed to happen, so as you can see these are the emails I can see after I use search within windows. I have outlook 2013 installed and it is set to be indexed thus allowing me to see
 them, however I am not able to open them or do anything else it just shows them. Oddly enough it does work in windows 7.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88ea8d65-39fb-4631-abf1-ce90a7b3c2eb" />

    <title>Storage question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage question</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yesterday I looked at our storage and it was expanded to 490TB.</p>
<p>I have a education license with 1000 students and 250 teachers subscribed to it.</p>
<p>I have setup 2 site collections.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there are more factors besides site collections and users in O365 which explain the large amount of storage available to us?</p>


<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>the storage base per tenant was <strong>10 gb + 0.5 gb per subscribed user + additional storage purchased</strong>(we can purchase an unlimited amount of additional storage). for your reference:<br />

<p>besides the initial 10gb and total user’s storage, we can also buy additional storage. given the situation, would you check whether this is the situation for your scenario?&nbsp;feel free to&nbsp;let us know if anything is misunderstood or you need further assistance,
 we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>

<p>We haven't bought extra storage. With 1250 users x.5GB +10 Gb I should have 635GB available.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>FYI</p>
<p>Microsoft has recently increased default storage to 1 TB plus 0.5 GB per user to use across SharePoint Online, Office 365 Groups and Office 365 Video—up from the previous allocation of 10 GB.

            You'll find an example of a report which does this as Payments.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
Two versions of the database are included, one which returns a single week's data, the other multiple weeks over a date range.&nbsp; The report returns the values in this format by including two multi-column subreports, one which returns the dates per week as the
 'column headings', the other the values per date.&nbsp; The customers in my file are analogous to your sales categories.<br />

            <p>Hi Ken, Thank you for the link. I was able to go thru and figure out how this works, but I just can't figure out how you got the data to fill left to right instead of top to bottom. I have compared all parameters in both properties and I don't see any differences.
 I must be missing something. Thanks, Darren</p>

            Hi Tom, I just tried the Crosstab Query Wizard. I don't think this will work. I have 40 columns I am trying to show and this is only allowing me to select three columns to show in rows. I think the custom report that Ken suggested below is my better option.
 Thanks for the suggestion though, Darren

            <p>It's done by giving each subform a multi-column layout of 7 columns in the columns dialogue opened from the Page Setup ribbon with the subreport in design view.&nbsp; The column layout is across-then-down so that the rows returned by the subform's recordset flow
 across the page.&nbsp; See image below:</p>

            <p>H Ken, I should have thought of that. Thanks for the help.&nbsp; This is going to be one of those dumb questions that I should know the answer to, but why can I not select a query in the Design ribbon when I go to "Add Existing Fields"? I am use to 2003 where
 you just select table or query when designing a form. Here all I see are the tables.</p>

            With the report in design view select the <em>RecordSource </em>property in its properties sheet.&nbsp; When you drop down the list you'll see both tables and queries listed.&nbsp; Select a query and its fields will be listed when you go to&nbsp;

            It sounds like the second subform's recordset in your case is a query which returns multiple rows per sale category per date.&nbsp; It should return only one row per sale category per date.&nbsp; Study the queries used as the RecordSource properties for my parent
 report and each subreport.&nbsp; If we take the single week report as an example they return rows as follows:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; The parent report's query returns one row per customer who has made a payment within the week determined by the parameter.&nbsp; This equates in your case to one row per sale category.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The first subreport returns one row per date from the Calendar table where the dates are within the week determined by the parameter. Yours would be exactly the same.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; The second subreport's query returns one row per date per customer.&nbsp; This equates in your case to one row per date per sale category.<br />
<br />
The first subform, that returning the dates as the 'column headings' is unlinked to the parent form.&nbsp; Yours would be the same.&nbsp; The second subform is linked to the parent form on Customer; yours would be linked on SaleCategory (or whatever the relevant primary/foreign
 columns are called).<br />

            <p>Hi Ken, Sorry, just been a crazy week and haven't had time to deal with this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally took a look and the only differences I see are in the parent form record source and in your frmSelectWeek record source. Below are copies of mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Parent Form</p>
<p>PARAMETERS [Forms]![frmCalendar_Wkly]![Combo0] DateTime; SELECT DISTINCT tblDaily_Sales.Sales FROM tblDaily_Sales WHERE (((tblDaily_Sales.Sales) Between [Forms]![frmCalendar_Wkly]![Combo0] And [Forms]![frmCalendar_Wkly]![Combo0]-6));
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the record source for your frmSelectWeek, you have it blank. When I try to do that I get an error from Access stating "The action or method is invalid because the form or report isn't bound to a table or query"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>We cannot use PowerShell to move a top level site collection to another top level site collection for SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>As a workaround, we can use <strong>Save as a template</strong> feature. Here I’d like to share with you the following steps:<br />
1. Navigate to the top-level site of your site collection which you’d like to move, then go to<strong> Settings &gt; Site Settings &gt;</strong> Under
<strong>Site Actions</strong> &gt; Click <strong>Save site as template</strong>&gt; Specify a template name&gt; Select the<strong> Include Content</strong> box.<br />
<br />
2. Go to this top-level site&gt; <strong>Settings &gt; Site Settings</strong>&gt; In the <strong>
Web Designer Galleries</strong> section&gt; <strong>Solutions,</strong> select the template and
<strong>activate</strong> it if necessary, then click its name to save it to the local.<br />
<br />
3. Navigate to another top-level site, click <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Site Settings</strong>&gt; In the
<strong>Web Designer Galleries</strong> section&gt; <strong>Solutions</strong>, upload the specific template in the local, then activate it.<br />
<br />
4. After that, you will be able to create a new sub-site under this site collection with this template in the Custom tab during the creation process.</p>
<p>For your reference:<br />

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As <strong>Save site as template</strong> feature cannot save all the contents in the original top-level site collection, about the content, you may need to migrate the data manually.

You are welcome to share some related experiences on how to move one top-level site collection to another top-level site collection.</p>

<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.

<p>This is not a single domain, Awardspace is the shared hosting service. The problem affects several domain emails, sent to any Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sent emails arrive perfectly well when sent to Gmail or any other receiving server other than Hotmail. There are no error messages received, the emails just do not arrive.</p>

            Dear MCWorldEnt , 
<br />
<br />Also those emails arrive to Gmail, they are seemed to be blocked for Hotmail users. There is a possibility that some users marked those emails as spam, reported abuse and deleted them without reading which lead to those emails/domains being blocked. If this is the case, they are blocked from the main filter, so all emails are blocked and cannot reach Hotmail users. So the owners of domain ( or their IT department ) should fill the form, if they want to send emails to Hotmail ( Microsoft ) users.

<p>Thanks, I arrived at a similar conclusion, and the matter has been reported to Outlook Sender Support by both myself and by Awardspace, my hosting provider. We now await a response, I hope it is soon. This problem is affecting a number of client's domains
 and is a real concern, there should be a quicker way of dealing with it since it affects people's businesses and livelihood.<br />
<br />
I guess the answer is to avoid anything connected with Microsoft if at all possible :)

            Dear MCWorldEnt , 
<br />
<br />Hmm, that is really odd. 
<br />
<br />You have mentioned that "There are no problems with the hosting SMPT servers and the emails are being received by all other servers, just NOT Hotmail." do you have other accounts from another email provider where you can ask/request Awardspace to send an email so you could test if you will receive it on non Microsoft domain ? If you can test it, I would advise you to get back to Faisal from Outlook.com Sender Support Team explaining the situation again and asking what to do next.

<p>Yes, is is very odd.</p>

</p><p>I have already done exactly as you have suggested and the emails are received by every other non Microsoft domain we can try. The quoted response from Faisal was after these results were reported to outlook.com support. Fortunately Awardspace seem to have
 a little more influence (and knowledge) than myself, and they are now trying to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Groove music sync takes long time, how can i solve this&#63;</h2>
                    Groove music on my Nokia Lumia 930 takes a long time to sync. Actually the syncing never ends. One time I left my phone near my router to get the best connection as possible and I turned off everything that uses internet so my phone have the best speed
 I get from my provider around 1-2 MB/s. After 5 hours Groove music was still syncing the changes that I did to my music collection on the Groove music app on my pc. But the Groove music app on my pc works fine it takes only 2 sec and I got the changes that
 I did on my phone or on other devices. This was not a problem before because it synced with lightning speed and I have tried with other internet connections like at my friends and other places but&nbsp;those didn't work either. And I just wonder if there is a solution
 to this and I have not tried to set my phone back to factory settings because I don't want to lose stuff on my phone and by that I mean not pictures and videos but the theme I have chosen for the start screen and the layou

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>If it worked before with the previous Groove release I would advise to wait until corrected into the next one.</p>
<p>otherwise:</p>
<p>- Try sync on a USB connection, see what happens.</p>
<p>- If unsuccessful use the MS "Files" app or the "Files&amp;Folders" one to delete everything in your Music rep. on the 930.</p>
<p>- try to sync from scratch again a) on Wifi b) if a does not work on USB.</p>
<p>In the worst scenario after deleting, if none of the above works you can still copy/paste from you Pc to your 930 (if you do have you music files locally.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just like you I feel if you do a hard reset it's proof Groove has some flaws.</p>
<p>But you can try a soft reset before all.</p>

<h3> jordan66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using vlookup to find values using the prefix in a data set with populated and unpopulated cells in the lookup value column.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently using this formula: =IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP(LEFT(Y2,3)&amp;"*",THIRD_PARTY,1,FALSE)),0,L2) in an attempt to return either a dollar value or a 0 for values in column Y based on whether or not their prefixes&nbsp;match the data in "THIRD_PARTY." This formula
 works great for populated cells in column Y, but not every cell has a value. I would enter them in but I am creating a template for others to pull data from the web and paste directly into so it needs to account for blank cells. I know that &amp;"*" is where I
 am running into issues as blank cells then match everything. Is there another way to ensure that my prefixes are matched exactly while excluding blank cells?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Okay, I think I have a better grasp of the situation. You only want to determine if the first three letter prefix in Y2 is found within THIRD_PARTY so MATCH() might be more efficient but COUNTIF() would definately improve things.
<div><br />
<div>Since COUNTIF() will return a <i>0</i>&nbsp;if not found, then you can do away with the IF() function as well since
<i>0 × L2</i>&nbsp;will equal <i>0</i>. It sounds link you will only return a <i>1</i>&nbsp;or a
<i>0</i>&nbsp;with COUNTIF() but for future expansion, it may be best to wrap it in SIGN() which will return a
<i>0</i>&nbsp;if the COUNTIF() ifs <i>0</i>&nbsp;and a <i>1</i>&nbsp;if the COUNTIF() is anything else.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So the possibility of a blank Y2 still remains. SIGN(LEN(Y2)) will accomplish the same as SIGN(COUNTIF()). If Y2 is blank, then L2 would be multiplied by
<i>0</i>&nbsp;resulting in <i>0</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>=SIGN(COUNTIF(THIRD_PARTY,LEFT(Y2,3)&amp;"*"))*SIGN(LEN(Y2))*L2</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not found non-blank value in Y2:</div>
<div>0 × 1 × L2 = 0</div>
<div>
<div>Found non-blank value in Y2:</div>
<div>1 × 1 × L2 = L2</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Found blank value in Y2:</div>
<div>1 × 0 × L2 = 0</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>Addendum:</i>&nbsp;it may be of worth to note that while SIGN() <i>can</i>&nbsp;return a -1, nether COUNTIF() or LEN() will ever return a negative number so the point become moot.</div>

    <title>Excel 2010 - Won&#39;t Open Any Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard d barnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010  - Won&#39;t Open Any Files</h2>
                    <p>As of yesterday, Excel won't open anything.&nbsp; Any file opening just results in a "Microsoft Excel has stopped working" and a fruitless search for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Excel 2010 with Windows 7.&nbsp; I work as an analyst, and use Excel most days, so I am familiar with some odd stuff, but this has stumped me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- No add-ons running</p>
<p>- Excel opens, and lets me work on a brand new file, but won't open any existing file, from any folder</p>
<p>- I have both:</p>
<p>a) Removed Excel and reinstalled</p>
<p>b) Removed all of Office and reinstalled</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and neither fixes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a crash-prone PC (suspect bad RAM), and I am sort of guessing maybe something within Windows has corrupted, or some straggler file in Excel is corrupted and has evaded both my attempts to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please, slightly desperate.</p>
<p />

            <p><span>Hi Richard,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting you question in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Does the files open when you try to open the saved files within the Excel program?
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open Excel, click on File, Open, locate the file which is saved on the computer and then try to access it.</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the above step fails, change the default printer and check if the files open. If yes, then you need to update the printer driver, or contact your printer manufacturer to uninstall and reinstall the printer driver as there
 might be some corruption in the printer driver.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to restart the computer to normal mode (Step 3 in the above link) once the troubleshooting is complete.</span></span></p>
<p>

            <p>Tried all of that, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Tried to open the files both within excel and from explorer.&nbsp; No difference. </li><li>I'd already checked the printer.&nbsp; I don't have a printer installed, so my two options are XPS Documenter Writer or Fax.&nbsp; Error exists with both.</li><li>Did the clean boot mode, made no difference.</li></ul>
<p>As I said, I've done two reinstalls of Excel, and it did not help, so it feels like the error is in Windows somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only other thing to add, is Excel is acting weird also in sometimes if I just open it (without opening a file) it refuses to open.&nbsp; Other times it will open, and allow me to work until I try and save or open a file, when it then crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed (non-Microsoft) spreadsheet software just to check the .xlsx files are not mass-corrupted.&nbsp; This seemed unlikely, and every file I have checked works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Word works and allows me to open files, so the problem isn't with all of Office.</p>

            <p>New user didn't fix it.&nbsp; The problem actually started on a family member's user account, not the main one that I use, so it's definitely affecting more than just the main User profile.</p>

<h2>            Send Receive Error and Updating Cached messages</h2>
                    <p>When I open my outlook 2010, upon start-up I'll get a send/receive error that says "cannot synchronize folders. Error TCP/IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm able to get passed that, it will randomly bring a message like the one in the attached picture saying updating cached messages in the toolbar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone suggested emptying my deleted items folder. That didn't work. And this only started happening recently. What does it all mean and what should I do. Sometimes all of this will happen and will cause outlook to timeout(not responding) so I have to close
 it and start over again.</p>

<h2>            Attachments stripped of file extension with bigfish.com</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm contracting for a company who use bigfish.com (or at least&nbsp;their&nbsp;emails come through there before hitting my company's server). All attachments I receive are stripped of their file extension, renamed to a single letter and appear as a grey 'lock' type
 icon. How can I enable attachments to show in their original format?</p>
<p>I'm using Outlook 2007, company in question uses Outlook 2003.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            Bigfish (used by office&nbsp;365)&nbsp;doesn't do that, unless they it enabled to strip the file exxtension - you need to talk to their admin about it.

<h2>            Changing my sender&#39;s address in Mac MS Office Outlook 2011</h2>
                    I have MS Office 2011 for MAC. &nbsp;I have a business account that has been directly sync'd to a personal account that I created with hotmail. &nbsp;My personal account is an @live.com address and the business account that dumps into that is my name@ my business
 handle.com. &nbsp;When I send messages from Outlook, it shows my personal email address in the sender's field. &nbsp;How I do I get it so I can change the sender's address to the business address for those emails that I need it to?
