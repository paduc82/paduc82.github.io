<h2>            Lumia 630 Win10 Upgrade path</h2>
                    <p>I'm being a&nbsp;pride owner of Lumia 630 and still feel pride on win 10 too with pretty decent performance as what it was on 8.1 (denim). though Microsoft offered win 10 initially for my phone, many like me would also been enrolled to insider and would have
 added value to win 10 mobile build. But I feel Microsoft deceived us by removing our device from win10 upgrade path with no notice or discussion? shouldn't be it left to the respective users choice&nbsp;whether to go for an update or live with 8.1? many of us (i.e.
 `512 RAM) users are happy&nbsp;with&nbsp;win 10,&nbsp;why to steal our happiness for someone who reported negative running&nbsp;hi-fi games, applications&nbsp; multithreads on our devices which no one usually does in daily chores?</p>
<p>So what's our next option for those are in win 10 1511 (build 10586). we definitely wont be rollback to 8.1, what's MS Plan? what people around here thinks?</p>

    <title>OneNote Shared Templates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Shared Templates</h2>
                    <p>Concern #1: When I create a template, it appears in my template. When I share the notebook, others cannot view the template I created because it appears only in "my templates." Is there a way templates can be shared along with the notebook w/o users having
 to go and click save current page as a template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, even when I check save template as default which allows the template to be used when "add page" is clicked, does this work for other people who the notebook is shared to? For example, I created a notebook and made a quick note. I saved it as a template
 and checked "set as a default template for new pages in the current section," then I share it with another user. When they click add page, will the template I set as default be used as a new page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concern #2: I cannot delete previous "my templates." After right clicking, the default selection is grayed out. My office 2016 is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know. This would help our workflow so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, there really is not a way to easily share templates across users. To resolve your concern what you could do is follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create the notebook with the sections and pages which you want everyone to use as templates.</li><li>Share the notebook with them.</li><li>The log in and go to each page they want to use as a template.</li><li>Then they can save the current page as a template and then use it from here on out.</li></ol>

<h3> sarahnelson-bihm  say:</h3>
<h2>            I do daily reports using Excel 2010, so how can I combine them all for my monthly report as a workbook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I work for a oil and gas refinery and keep track of all trucks that bring in product and pick up product.&nbsp; I also keep track of our barges that bring in crude or sometimes product and ship out the same.&nbsp; My job is to everyday enter into my Excel spreadsheet
 each truck ticket of what was picked up or brought in, and also enter in what was brought in or taken out by our barges.&nbsp; This gives me a total of how much crude we have to run the plant, and how much we have of all the different products as well.&nbsp; At the
 end of the month, I am to do a monthly report for my boss and would like to be able to have every daily report link together to make my monthly report.&nbsp; I have tried this a few times, but it just has not come out right.&nbsp; I can do workbooks when they are only
 2 or 3 worksheets, but for some reason have not been able to do one this big.&nbsp; Does anyone have any advice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am desperate to save time!! S.N.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Sarah,
<div><br />
<div>Try this:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Set up an Excel Table with columns that describe each ticket. (That is, use Insert, Tables, Table.) Include date, additions to inventory (as plus values), reductions from inventory (as negative values), and so on. (Alternatively, maintain one column for
 additions and another column for reductions.) Make sure all relevant data is in the Table.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then, in separate workbooks, create all your reports (daily, weekly and monthly) to summarize the data from that Table in your database workbook. That is, don't add up daily or weekly reports to create monthly reports; instead, reference your original
<div><br />
<div>To summarize the values, you'll probably use SUMPRODUCT and/or SUMIFS. SUMPRODUCT usually is more powerful, but SUMIFS typically calculates more quickly. You might also use array formulas, but I'd start with SUMPRODUCT instead.</div>
<div><br />
<div>(See:&nbsp;<a href="http://exceluser.com/blog/1272/the-two-functions-you-must-know-to-return-values-from-excel-tables-and-databases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://exceluser.com/blog/1272/the-two-functions-you-must-know-to-return-values-from-excel-tables-and-databases.html</a>)</div>
<div><br />
<div>To return labels or other unique values, you'll probably use INDEX-MATCH. (See:&nbsp;<a href="http://exceluser.com/blog/465/excels-best-lookup-method-index-match.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://exceluser.com/blog/465/excels-best-lookup-method-index-match.html</a>)</div>
<div><br />
<div>And you never would use VLOOKUP here, in spite of its popularity. Instead, INDEX-MATCH is much more flexible and powerful. (See:<a href="http://exceluser.com/blog/1107/why-index-match-is-far-better-than-vlookup-or-hlookup-in-excel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://exceluser.com/blog/1107/why-index-match-is-far-better-than-vlookup-or-hlookup-in-excel.html</a>)</div>
<div><br />
<div>In your reports, set up cells to specify beginning and ending dates. That way, you can reuse your reports period after period. You just add new data to your Table, change the dates, and then recalculate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, if you want to report activity for specific barges, trucks, or other entities, you can do it easily with this setup. You just add cells to contain that filter information and then you expand your SUMPRODUCT or SUMIFS formulas to include that criteria.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After you meet your immediate reporting needs, you might find other useful ways to report this data. For example, it might be useful to summarize the total number of shipments by hour in the day, which might identify scheduling issues. Or if you include
 prices for the deliveries in your Table, you might be able to value your inventory under either LIFO or FIFO.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope that helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Charley</div>

                    <p>My Nvidia Graphics card stopped working and was not detected by device manager about a week after I installed the latest Nvidia driver 347.25. This is definitely not a hardware issue as rolling back to the previous build has resolved the issue. I have no
 idea what happened, my graphics card worked fine one moment and then wasn't working at all&nbsp;the next. I'm attempting to reinstall build 9926 and will see how it goes from there</p>

            <p>I'm on an Asus Q550lf with a Nvidia GeForce 745m. I was running windows 8.1 before the preview build. I'm going to try running it in compatibility mode and see if that helps. When I rolled back to build 9879 my driver got put back a version. I updated it
 again, however, and it is still running fine. I've been playing games on it for a while.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And like I said the driver worked fine for a week before it suddenly stopped working. It happened after I changed the resolution for a particular game. I guess that could've caused it to crash so I'm going to refrain from doing that again until they put
 out fully compatible drivers.</p>

            I contacted Geed Squad, which is a trouble-shooting service for Best Buy products. They are already aware of the problem and are already working to resolve it. It does not seem to be any infection, but a problem of how the email is processed by the servers
 or some such. Hopefully they will have it fixed soon.

<p>and no it is not to do with size of my display icons as they are already on the lowest &nbsp;that icons could be as you can see from the second screenshot and I have restarted my computer a load of times just be sure that it is update&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the security setting is to warn you about suspicious activity, you should get the "A program is trying to send an email message on your behalf" dialog when Send is called. If you click Deny on that dialog, the code will raise the mentioned error.</p>

            I did some experimenting.&nbsp; The option to go from Fast Ring to Slow is always there.&nbsp; First, you change from Skip Ahead to Active Development in the middle drop down and then the choice between Fast and Slow goes live in the bottom drop down. &nbsp;

            2.75hrs on fast connection for 17025. At this point the team involved with these deployments obviously can't get it right and should be re-assigned and bring in a team who&nbsp;<em>can</em> get it done. Doesn't matter, fast/slow ring or RTM all still take an
 insane amount of time. It sat for 15mins @ 64% trying to figure out how to install Adobe Flash update for 1709 and come up with it's generic fail code... Anyways...

            Yeah, not usually the case here in the NE U.S.. I gave a bunch of details in FH, created and uploaded the UpdateLog for them to review. Seems it had several Fails with Service Authentication so asked them to just search "Fail" to save time looking. (huge
 file). The OS itself is actually running quite well which I reported....

</p><p><span>From the description of your issue you were saying that<span>&nbsp; </span>you have issues using skype, viber in speaker mode in your nokia Lumia 930.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try <span>&nbsp;</span>phone soft reset.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press and hold the Volume Down - and power buttons at the same time until feel a vibration ( about 10-15 seconds) your phone will restart automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persist,You can reset&nbsp; your phone to the same state it was in the first time you turn it on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Be careful , resetting your phone will erase your personal content, including text messages and apps you’ve downloaded, and yout phone will be restored to its factory settings.</span></p>

                    I have nokia 5300 soft. ver. 3.92<br />
When I convert any file in 3gp and try to watch it on the phone, it crashes. It's all right in normal mode. I tried some different settings of the converting software, but the result is the same. Any ideas? Does someone has the same problem?

            I also have the same problem.When i set the video to fullscreen mode,sometimes it crashes,sometimes not.It must be a firmware bug..let's just wait for the new firmware and see the improvements.<br />
<br />
BTW : FW v3.93<br />

            Yes but it's annoying to buy a brand new phone and fave bugs in your firmware. I think shoud pay more attention in testing products before release them on the market. Dissapointing.

            I got the problem! When the video file is 64kbps or lower, the phone plays it in fullscreen, otherwise ( the video is 96kbps or higher) the phone crashes. I'm not sure wether this is caused by the firmware ot the phone just dont support these kbps... I
 hope it'll be fixed

            I am using ImToo 3g converter, and it works fine.<br />
I was converting bleach japanese animation (avi format) using standard convertion (i did not change convert configuration on the ImToo).<br />
<br />
It converts the file from 200 mb to 20 something mb.<br />
The 3g animation format runs fine without any crash, although the movie and sounds moves pretty fast, but it is watchable. Sometimes the sounds becomes unsync with the video but i can resolve that by clicking the forward or backward button.<br />
<br />
I need to configure the convertion on ImToo to fit on my 5300. I've just got no time to do so.<br />
<br />
If anyone has perfect configuration please let us know<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<h2>            Get &#38; Transform Not Working in Excel 2016 &#40;Office 365 Pro Plus&#41;</h2>
                    Over the last few days whenever I click on&nbsp;any of the "Get &amp; Transform" icons nothing happens. The icons are not grayed out or anything like that and worked fine before. It's like something needed to use the&nbsp;Power Query tools is not loading but I have
 no idea what.&nbsp;Even clicking on "New Query" and then "Query Options" results in nothing instead of a dialog box opening up.&nbsp;My current version is 16.0.6741.20163 (Deferred Channel) but&nbsp;I don't think that's&nbsp;the problem as I believe that's been the "current"
 version for a few months now. Any ideas what is wrong and what I can do to get&nbsp;this functionality back? TIA.&nbsp;

            This question is a bit vague. So if the answer is not helping you please specify more clearly what you want.<br />
<br />
What I understand from your question is when you receive an email message on your yahoo account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) you would like to reply with your domain email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
<br />
<br />
I belive this is not possible by the standard Windows Mobile email client. The third party application "FlexMail" has this possibility.<br />

    <title>Workflows Stopped Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Workflows Stopped Working</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to send a reply email through a workflow to the form's submitter. I keep running into a wall with this error that I have no way of diagnosing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suspend this workflow&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Activity in progress&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Retrying last request. Next attempt scheduled in less than one minute. Details of last request: HTTP NotFound to https://****.sharepoint.com/sites/efficiency/_api/web/lists(guid'646340df-e676-4906-9296-e9bfd420b1ad')/Items(25)

<p>
</p><p>Here's the setup to get the email address:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35b6d9a4-45ac-443e-9852-eb18e40fc1ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35b6d9a4-45ac-443e-9852-eb18e40fc1ac" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And, this is the only task in the workflow. It will work if I am the submitter (owner rights), but if I try to kick off the workflow from one who has editor rights, it fails with the above message. It did work fine when I put my email address into the "TO"
 field. But, once I switched it out for the current item.created by - it stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it feels permission related as my logic works on forms I created, yet not on forms editor-rights users created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks, Kevin</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try using "User who created current item" instead of "Current Item:Created By" in the To field and see the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, please let us know the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you input a user's(edit right) email address into the "TO" filed, can he receive the email properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Check a problematic user's permission in this list and capture a screenshot for us.</p>
<p>Access list settings&gt; Permissions for this list, click Check Permissions and input the user's account to check.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/faaf15d2-51d4-45c8-a3b3-d389868f6d85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/faaf15d2-51d4-45c8-a3b3-d389868f6d85" height="343" width="683" /></a></p>
<p>3. To check if the issue is related to Title column, please delete the "<span>[%Current Item:Title%]</span>" part in the email content, publish the workflow and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

            <p>Hi Frank!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did exactly as you described, and the outcome is in my screenshot. I was a little taken back that it translated it back to the created by, but it does boil down to the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a happier note, it started working today - I changed NOTHING! We released the form with the reply not working, so I thought. Since then we've had 2 submissions and the workflows confirmed emails went out. I even emailed one of the submitters to confirm,
 and it was confirmed. Maybe O365 was having issues on Friday??</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            Media Streaming keeps turning off</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I was trying to stream a video from my PC to my Xbox 360 and the media streaming was turned off. I turned it on set my xbox to allowed,went to my xbox in the app section for the system video player app. I see my pc there and click on it I get a "message
 Can't connect. Make sure you have activated this console on your computer" &nbsp;I then right click on the video on my PC and click cast to and my xbox is there but nothing happens. Not sure what to do know. I found an older post for media streaming for win 7&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check and make sure that the Windows media player network sharing service is running on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Click&nbsp;<span><strong>Start</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>, type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Open</strong>&nbsp;text box, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>b) In the&nbsp;<span><strong>Services (Local)</strong>&nbsp;list, right-click&nbsp;<strong>Windows media player network sharing</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>c) Make sure that the service is&nbsp;<span><strong>started</strong>&nbsp;and startup type is set to&nbsp;<strong>Automatic.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>When I check this my&nbsp;</span></span>Windows media player network sharing was on Automatic (Delayed Start). I changed it to Automatic and it keeps changing back. Then when I check media streaming it is turned off again. I start it and it keeps
 turning off.</p>

            <p>I am 100 percent sure this is a Windows 10 build 10586.14 version 1511 Problem not Xbox. I have my PC set up as a dual boot PC with the preview on one Hard-drive and Windows 10 the first public release on the other. I don't use that one much. but with this
 problem I booted into the other drive and my Xbox had no problem connecting to the PC. And media sharing was on. So I boot back into version 1511 and my Xbox will not connect to my PC and media streaming is turn off. I turn it on does not matter still no connection
 WHY IS MEDIA STREAMING TURNING OFF. That is the problem. We fix this I think we fix why the Xbox will not connect.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Just a long shot, open Media player, click on Stream, make sure its enabled, by default its OFF ( just&nbsp; looked on this W10) Once turned on, all the firewalls&nbsp; ( Eset Smart Security) on all the LAN computers went nuts with this PC asking to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its off, once on you get a few options including devices / computers on your LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Players set to Off, then turning on all the services in the world wont make any difference.</p>

            Thank you for the the reply. I have already done this. Turning on media streaming either way, from media player.or from with in network and connections the result is the same. Media streaming turns off. The PC acts like streaming was never turned on even
 when on. Xbox see's the PC on network but something is stopping it from connecting.

            <p>OK a little more info. I signed into a different account on my PC media streaming was enabled. So I went on Xbox found my PC in the system video viewer. Clicked on it and it connected to the PC. I signed out of that account signed back into main account.
 Media streaming was on this time but Xbox cant connect same as before, so I open media player right click on a few songs and select cast to device, my Xbox is there I cast it and it starts playing, so I try a video and it starts to play on my Xbox from the
 PC. I stop the video and try to connect cant connect. There is something in my account on the PC that is not right. Not sure when this problem started. But i am going to do a system restore from a few weeks ago and see if it works. If not I don't know what
 to do. I don't want to delete the account again and start over, it messes up the insider preview ( getting the updates) and is a pain.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update Restored to later date. Did not change a thing</p>

            As this is the forum for testing newer builds of windows 10 before being released to the Public, It helps to post some details such as which build/version of Preview that you are having issues with, info about your system such as make/model, CPU, 3rd party
 programs that are installed. More info = better answers&nbsp;

<p>Hi Carla,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to receive emails could be due to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your senders are listed on your <strong>Blocked senders list</strong>.</li><li>The emails are going straight to junk mail folder because of email <strong>filters and rules</strong>.</li><li>Your senders are not listed on your <strong>Safe senders list</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask some additional information to better isolate the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you get any error messages?</li><li>Have you done any changes on your Outlook account prior to the issue?</li><li>Are you not able to receive emails from specific senders only or are you not receiving any emails at all?</li><li>Have you already checked your junk mail folder if new emails are there?</li><li>Are your senders listed on your Blocked senders list? Open your Outlook.com account &gt; Click gear icon &gt; select Options &gt; on the left side, open Blocked senders list.</li></ul>

 the app after that. App doesn’t match to the same app what I have used to these mentioned platforms.</span></p>

<h3> manuel.ms.scholz.infracor.de  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint&#58; &#34;new document&#34; option missing in folder with custom permissions</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>first I want to refer to this thread, where the same problem is described and the suggested answer describes the technical background of the bug and gives a workaround. However, this workaround doesn't
 work for me.</p>
<p>I have a document library with folders for years and in this folders I have folders for the months. Every month represents a whole-day-meeting where several presentations are stored by their authors for this meeting.</p>
<p>The basis permission for the document library is everyone read and only for the upcoming meetings the permission is not inherited and everyone has contribute permissions. After a meeting is held, the rights are inherited again with "Delete unique permissions".</p>
<p>This way you can see the few deviating folders from meetings in the future and check if there is still an older folder with contribute rights.</p>
<p>If I would give contribute rights on the document library and for folders of older meetings read permissions, I have many folders (50++) with deviating permissions and there is no more chance to check this deviating permissions.</p>
<p>Is there another workaround on how to get this "new document" option back without changing the permission concept? Is this bug already tracked and worked on?</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help!</p>

<p>hi mansch,<br />
<br />
according to your description, i tried to reproduce the issue. but i can still see the new document option in the ribbon.<br />
<br />
here my detailed steps:<br />
1. create a new sub-site for the test.<br />
2. open the default document library, then invite <strong>everyone except external users</strong> and grant them view permission.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2f7b1eb2-78a8-4695-a8f4-71b70334b724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2f7b1eb2-78a8-4695-a8f4-71b70334b724" /></a><br />
3. create a folder “meeting” in the library, then invite <strong>everyone except external users</strong> and grant them edit permission.<br />
4. sign in with a new user, go to the “meeting” folder, and the <strong>new document</strong> option is still there.<br />
<br />
kindly let me know if i didn’t follow your steps.<br />
meanwhile i’d like to confirm some information:<br />
1. the screenshot of the situation.<br />
to upload a screenshot, click use rich formatting, then click this icon<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=35c307d4-619d-494b-8a95-305049c8ddbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d35c307d4-619d-494b-8a95-305049c8ddbd" /></a>
 to insert images.<br />
2. check the permission of your user to the library and folder. on the sharing window, click
<strong>shared with &gt; advanced</strong>. then click <strong>check permission</strong>.<br />
3. try to test with another sub-folder.<br />
<br />
in addition, this forum focuses on online services of office 365 for business. if you have your own sharepoint server, i would suggest you post in the dedicated
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/en-us/home?category=sharepoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sharepoint forum</a>.<br />

<p>Hi Jiaxing,</p>
<p>one difference to me is, that I have one more subfolder. Don't know if this makes a difference.</p>
<p>Another difference is, that I am working with the "Visitors" group of the SharePoint site. This group has "everyone" as member and itself has read permission on the library and then in 2015\15-10-20 this group has "Contribute" permission.</p>
<p>1 Screenshot comes later, I have to ask a user first. But it is like the standard view, just without the option "new document"</p>
<p>2 Permission is as expected when checked, and beside the missing "new document" option the other way to create a document works.</p>
<p>3 The problem exists also for other sub folders with identical permissions.</p>
        </p>

<p>hi mansch,</p>
<p>to look into the problem, we need to collect the information below:<br />
1.&nbsp; can those affected user with the “contribute” permission create or upload documents by navigating to<b> files</b> &gt;<b> new document</b> or
<b>upload document</b>?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5982bbe5-129f-4320-a2b4-2db77bb5330e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5982bbe5-129f-4320-a2b4-2db77bb5330e" /></a></p>
<p>2. can the affected users directly drag and drop documents to the folder?<br />
<br />
<span>3. can users upload or create new documents on the library level when you grant users the “contribute” permission for the library?<br />
<br />
</span><span>4. screenshots of the affected user’s permission check results for the library and folders.<br />
</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; for the folder, on the sharing window, click&nbsp;</span><b>shared with &gt; advanced</b><span>. then click&nbsp;</span><b>check permission</b><span>.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ef111afa-b9e7-49ab-8a97-2bdbf7b89fd4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3def111afa-b9e7-49ab-8a97-2bdbf7b89fd4" /></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for the library, go to the<b> library</b> ribbon &gt;<b> library settings</b> &gt;
<b>permissions for this document library<br />
</b></p>
<p>we need to get a user’s specific permission information on the library and folder as the screenshot below.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=3727158e-e7ee-4210-bb4b-49f824feb9b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d3727158e-e7ee-4210-bb4b-49f824feb9b1" /></a></p>

<p>hi jerry,</p>
<p>1. this is the way it works</p>
<p>2. should also work, but would be a different issue, if not</p>
<p>3. if granted on library level all is fine</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a2ba7bd7-9033-47a4-9ac3-041965d30c00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>the structure is:</p>
<p>1. document library =&gt; read</p>
<p>2. 2015 =&gt; inherited</p>
<p>3. 15-10-14 =&gt; contribute</p>
<p>so to be clear and as already described in the other thread, it seems to be just a wrong if clause which doesn't check on folder level.</p>
<p>maybe it is also dependent on the sharepoint version running?</p>

<p>hi mansch,</p>
<p>regarding #1 “this is the way it works”, can you double confirm if users can create documents or upload documents in the affected folder by navigating to the<b> file
</b>ribbon? if users can upload or create document in this way, then the problem may not be related to the permission. are there any customizations on the library view? can you let us know the settings of the current view?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0a2538be-a206-4429-ac1e-7ba921b024e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0a2538be-a206-4429-ac1e-7ba921b024e3" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;what if you change the view style to “default”? (click “modify view” to adjust the view settings)<br />

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>yes, other users can indeed upload documents, despite the missing option. As already stated, it is just a bug in the "if clause" of the programming code when to display this option (have a look in the other thread for ErnstWolthaus statement).</p>
<p>My only question I have is if this bug is already known and documented and if there is a patch or if an upgrade to a newer version would help. Then I could pass this information to our company IT or just wait for the migration to cloud, which is already
 going on.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp; ManSch,<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding "…upgrade to a newer version…" and "…wait for the migration to cloud…", I'd like to confirm whether your environment is SharePoint server, not Office 365 with SharePoint Online?<br />
<br />
If this is the case, since our forum focus on Office 365 Online services, for SharePoint server related issue, please contact<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-us/home?category=sharepoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> SharePoint server forum</a> for more advanced
 help.<br />
<br />
If not, I'd like to explain that this is not a bug&nbsp; in SharePoint Online within Office 365 as we can achieve your goal that the "New document" options are displayed as expected.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Mills</p>

<p>Hi Mills,</p>
<p>the SharePoint is hosted on premise inside our datacenter right now. If I am in the wrong forum, sorry for that, I really was not aware of.</p>
<p>Can you also move the thread to the correct forum, please?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
