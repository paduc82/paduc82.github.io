    <title>Office 365 is not recognizing files from Office Professional 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itsupport5323  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 is not recognizing files from Office Professional 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed office 365 2016 on a user's windows 10 laptop. She has several excel docs on her desktop that were generated with Excel 2010. When she tries to open one by clicking on it, excel opens, but in the area where the file should be displayed the
 screen is completely blank.</p>
<p>If we try using the file menu to navigate to it, she has use browse to get to the desktop, but the file is not recognized as an excel file. She can only see it and open it if she chooses the "all files" option from the file type drop down menu in the browse
 screen. If I look at the properties of the file, they clearly indicate the file is an excel file and opens with excel 2016. So there is a disconnect somewhere.</p>
<p>We tried creating a file in the new excel, saving it to the desktop, exiting excel, then opening it by clicking on it, and that appears to work fine.</p>
<p>What's the issue with the older excel 2010 files? This is a serious annoyance. This user works in excel all day every day, and has hundreds of files that were generated on older versions of excel that she needs to access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help that you can offer</p>

<p>ITSupport5323, I have the same exact problem, I just upgraded from Office 2007 to Office 365 to my Windows 7 desktop. &nbsp;I'm told by MS that the only way to open the files is to Open Excel 2016, Browse to the file you want, click it and open it only thru and
 after opening the Excel program itself. Like normal, you can't simply, find the file that you need and click on it to open, unless it was actually made in Ofc2016 originally. This compatibility problem has just rendered my database of Excel files useless with
 the "NEW O2016". I'm going back to my to my old 2007 version, at least it worked.</p>

            <p>Hi Kcklilly13,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if the problem occurs on the Outlook client or on Outlook on the Web (OWA).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this problem occurs on the Outlook client, the recently used addresses from email messages are
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2768735/how-the-recent-addresses-feature-works-in-outlook-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
stored in the user's identity</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To manually delete an entry from Recent Addresses, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open a new email window.</p>
<p>2. Begin typing a recipient's name or email address in the&nbsp;<strong>To</strong>&nbsp;field. The&nbsp;Recent Addresses list appears.</p>
<p>3. Click the <strong>X</strong>&nbsp;at the right side of the recent address whose entry you want to delete from Recent Addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no X option beside the email address on the autocomplete list, and the correct email is included in Contacts. Please follow these steps to remove:</p>
<p>1. Go to People.<br />
2. In the far left pane, make certain your "Suggested Contacts" are checked on.<br />
3. Search for the e-mail address you want to remove.<br />
4. Delete it from your Contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use Outlook on the Web (OWA), follow the steps in this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Remove-suggested-name-or-email-address-from-the-Auto-Complete-List-in-Outlook-Web-App-9E1419D9-E88F-445B-B07F-F558B8A37C58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>

<h2>            Sharepoint Design 2013 with Office365 Sharepoint not opening sites</h2>
                    
<p>I tried this and the problem persists</p>
<p>1.Does the problem happen to all the site collections or just one specific site collection?</p>
<p>2.Can you check if the current account in your SharePoint Designer is the Office 365 account? If not, please switch to the correct Office 365 account and try again.</p>
<p>3.If the account is correct and the problem persists, could you try the following method to reinstall the SharePoint Designer and check the result?</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b>&nbsp;Uninstall all versions of SharePoint Designer on workstation.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b>&nbsp;Clear cache (This is only applicable if the SharePoint Desinger is not a fresh install)</p>
<p>a) On the local computer, browse to the following folder:</p>
<p><b>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WebsiteCache</b></p>
<p>b) Delete all the files and folders that are present.</p>
<p>c) On the local computer, browse to the following folder:</p>
<p><b>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SharePoint Designer\ProxyAssemblyCache</b></p>
<p>d) Delete all the files and folders that are present.</p>
<p>e) On the local computer, browse to the following folder:</p>
<p><b>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Web Server Extensions\Cache</b></p>
<p>f) Delete all the files and folders that are present.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b>&nbsp;Reinstall Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2013</p>
<p>By the way, we have no option in Office 365 to enable the SharePoint Designer permissions, there is only an option in Office 365 to choose install or not install SharePoint Designer from Office 365 Software page.</p>
<p>Please feel free to post back with any results.</p>

<p>I set full control for my account too in the site settings.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel Has Gone from Opening in Read-Only to Opening in Protected View - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garybrazzell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Has Gone from Opening in Read-Only to Opening in Protected View</h2>
                    <p>We have a few Excel files that are often read by everyone but infrequently edited by a few, so we used the "Read-Only" recommended option in the Save As tools. This worked great for years as it allowed most people to answer "Yes" on opening to get a Read-Only
 copy, leaving the file available for editing for that one person - even if two other people were already reading the file.<br />
<br />
After upgrading to Windows 10 and some of our desks upgrading to Office 365, we are finding that those "Recommend Read-Only" files are now opening in Protected View with an alert that there is a problem with the file that could hurt the computer. I tried copying
 all the data as text only and pasting in to a new book, and the Protected View alert goes away and stays gone. That is, unfortunately, until I save as "Recommend Read-Only" again. Then the Protected View pops up again on opening. Two problems of course are
 that it's alarming to staff and you have to essentially open the file twice now to edit it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
QUESTION: Is there a way to go back to the old, soothing, and more efficient open as read only without triggering the alarming protected view?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Here are the conditions that lead to the issue we know about:</p>
<p><span><span><span>1)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Start with a file in the old .XLS file format</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The file contains a hyperlink inside it</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open and then save that file, still as XLS, on a Windows 10 machine</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>This leads to the workbook being flagged as potentially harmful and when it is opened again on any machine it will be in “Protected View” state.</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure Office is up to date:</p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open any Office application</span></li><li><span>Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></li><li><span>Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></li><li><span>Restart your Mac</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any add-ins such as WebEx, Mendelay, EndNote, Zotero, TypeIt4me, etc it is essential that you install the latest updates for your add-ins.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Microsoft Word</li><li>Go to the Word Templates Gallery (File &gt; New from Template if it doesn't display by default)</li><li>Click the circle in the upper left corner</li><li>Sign out</li><li>Restart your Mac</li><li>Go back to the circle and sign in</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't correct the problem, please see this</p>

            Hi Sue,<br />
<br />
Which Skype for Business for Mac client version are he using? Please provide us with the detailed information about this.<br />
<br />
May I know whether you have set up multi-factor authentication for the user? If so, use the app password to check this issue.<br />
<br />
You may also try to check this issue via using different PC <em>(e.g. any non-problematic colleague’s Mac/Windows PC)
</em>to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Moreover, use the <a href="https://www.testconnectivity.microsoft.com/?testid=O365LyncDns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lync Connectivity Analyzer</a> and select <strong>Office 365</strong> under the<strong> Office 365 Lync Domain Name Server (DNS) Connectivity Test</strong>. Enter the sign-in address that user using when try to sign in to Skype for Business Online
<em>(for example, user@contoso.com)</em>, start the test and provide us detailed screenshot result without editing via the private message for further analysis.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<h2>            Use of micro sd card</h2>
                    Per the url -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/basics/use-an-sd-card-to-add-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/basics/use-an-sd-card-to-add-space</a>
<div>It explains what that space can be used for, like pictures, videos... but what about apps &amp; games?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did read somewhere recently that wp8 will allow to merge the card capacity with the internal memory capacity into one piece of storage (in its own way like the mac's fusion drive) &amp; then it'll not be biased on what is stored on it &amp; what is not, it will
 have some drawbacks such as the card not getting detected without it being in the phone &amp; the phone will be reset to factory if the card is removed due to corruption / any other reason, also this is an update in the works which will be out soon, what out of
 all this did I get right?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am planning to get a Lumia 820 due to the expansion slot, especially when windows phone 8 can manage direct x 11 games, it'll be sooner or later we are going to get bulky games &amp; I don't wanna be stuck with a 32gb memory on the Lumia 920's internal memory.</div>

            Whatever the maximum speed your network supports.<br />
<br />
Fastest 3.5g speed i've had is 3mb, I know someone else that has had 5mb.<br />
<br />
I seem to think that 7.2mb is the maximum at the moment but not many networks support it.

            Psychomania, how did you test your speed? In sweden we have a good site that measures your broadband connection, however i cant get it to work with the nokia browser in my N82, it just wont load correctly... Is there any other webpage or program that makes
 it easy to measure the speed on my cellphone?<br />

    <title>Windows Defender hangs and ends with an error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas olsson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender hangs and ends with an error</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 with everything from Windows Installer (14 dec 2016). It was updated from Win 8.1. Windows Defender has worked since the upgrade but since a couple of weeks back, Windows Defender fails doing a quick scan of my system.</p>
<p>There is an error 5008 in the Windows Defender event log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender engine has been terminated due to an unexpected error.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure Type: Hang</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of the message varies a bit from time to time. For example sometimes it is</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resource: boot:\\.\D:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>and sometimes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resource: ntappdll:HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS NT\CURRENTVERSION\DRIVERS32\\mixer6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also seen other variations. My suspicion is that the "resource" part of the error does not really give any clues about the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that the WD works hard and processes about 140000 "items". Then the counter stops increasing. I can see that the process&nbsp;still consumes around 20% CPU. After a minut of no apparent progress, I get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do a custom scan on either C or D without any issues. My computer is quite clean and I have not any other anti virus programs installed. (I did run Antimalwarebytes once after these problems started just to see if another program had similar issues.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no other errors reported in the event log during the scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that Custom scan will just look at all the files on the disk, but that Quick scan will look at a subset based on the registry. Could there be any issues with the registry?</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is designed to turn itself off if it detects any other third-party antivirus software. Windows is designed to detect any installed antivirus software, and certain issues can occur if you have two or more antivirus software installed. These
 issues include conflicts between antivirus software that can manifest as frequent freezing, crashing to applications, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, if this security software has a Firewall, Windows Firewall will also turn itself off. This means that if you want Windows Defender to work, you’ll have to choose between it and the third party antivirus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another cause for Windows Defender to not work properly is incorrect time and date on Windows 8. In order to fix this, you need to check your time and date, and set it to correct value before trying to turn Windows Defender back on. We know that this might
 sound strange, but most of the Windows system functions are dependent on time and date, therefore an incorrect date or time could trigger abnormal behavior in your Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Place the computer in clean boot state: </strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This
 kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;(information
 holds good for Windows 10 as well)</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>: Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after
 clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>These three are most common scenarios that can cause problems with Windows Defender, but there are some other not so common scenarios that can cause problems as well. For example, incorrect Zone settings in Internet Explorer can cause problems, but you can
 easily fix this by resetting Internet Explorer to factory settings. Bear in mind that if you are using a Proxy server, Windows Defender will not be able to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that’s the case, you can use the following command to your Proxy server.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>X</strong> on your keyboard and select<strong> Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></li><li>Type in <strong>NETSH WINHTTP SET PROXY 1.1.1.1:8080</strong> or <strong>NETSH WINHTTP SET PROXY MYPROXY.NET:8080</strong></li><li>Now reboot the System and see if it works.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Important: </strong><em><span>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites.
 The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings
 are lost after reset.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, your computer could be infected with malware that stops Windows Defender from working properly. To fix this you can download and use Windows Defender Offline Tool or any other third-party antivirus software to perform a full system scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, refer to suggestions provided by <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/event-error-10010/69540cfb-a90c-47e1-b8a5-0b51eb0302d5">Ronnie Vernon replied on November 6,

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>Just for your information, I am an experienced IT professional with a very good knowledge of Windows. I am very restrictive with what software I download and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) As I wrote before, I have no other anti-virus programs installed.</p>
<p>2) Running in clean boot state makes no difference</p>
<p>3) There are no proxy servers</p>
<p>4) I have scanned the computer with several other malware and virus scanners.</p>
<p>5) Please note that Windows defender works fine when I scan each of my two drive separately. I get this error when doing a Quick scan.</p>

            Seems like this is yet another Microsoft issue. &nbsp;This same thing has been happening every month or so. &nbsp;Its unlikely to be caused by the users, since so many are having the EXACT same issue.

            <p>I think that several of these DLLs are not intended to be registered&nbsp;using "self registration"&nbsp;on Win10. (They do not expose the DllRegisterServer server).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, none of this helps. The issue with Defender still remains.</p>
<p>I doubt that this has anything to do with Windows Update. The updates are installed correctly without issues. I can also see in the event log that additional "signatures" are downloaded without problem with I do a "custom scan":</p>

<p>
</p><p>Dates are stored as serial numbers in Excel and displayed as per their cell format as Dates. Excel stores dates as sequential serial numbers so that they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1, and January 1, 2008 is
 serial number 39448 because it is 39,447 days after January 1, 1900.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enter a date of 12th feb 1956 you will need to type the serial number 20497 and format the cell as a date format. Instead it would be easier to type in 12 Feb 1956 in a cell which is formatted as a date or type in 2/12/1956 if the date format is yy/mm/yyyy.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Quotation marks problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michalai3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quotation marks problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am really new to Access as I've been using Excel so far (very, very heavily), but since I already reached over 1,000,000 rows in Excel, I had to switch to Access, so please excuse my ignorance and lack of knowledge regarding basic concepts. I
 have my database loaded and I've been trying to run several queries. In the queries, I applied the Total and I selected the option Where By, trying to identify certain records. However, all the items in my database are already in quotation marks, and therefore
 the Where By option cannot pick up anything when I run the query. I tried to insert double quotation marks in my query design (e.g. Where By ""green""), but it won't let me. I've been struggling to find an answer online, so maybe someone could help. Ideally,
 I would like to remove all the quotation marks from my database table where all the records look like this: "green" (tried the Replace option, but didn't help). I hope I explained myself explicitly enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truly appreciate all the help, hoping I will pick my Access game up one day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            Michael,
<div><br />
<div>First issue, is Access is not Excel. And you should not be simply porting your Excel tables to Access. They need to be redesigned and normalized.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second issue, are you saying that your data is stored with quotation marks around each text string? If so, you can use Search and Replace, to remove them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for your queries, if you have a problem with a query, please post the SQL statement for that query. To do so, Open your query in Design Mode, and select SQL View. You can then copy and paste the SQL statement into a post here.</div>

<p>I tried to use Search and Replace, but I got the "Updating data in a linked table is not supported by this ISAM" error. The data is not simply pulled from Excel, it's the .csv file provided to me by some other department at my work.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You can remove all the quotes characters with an 'update' query like this:<br />
<br />
UPDATE [YourTable]<br />
SET [Field1] = REPLACE([Field1],"""",""),<br />
[Field2] = REPLACE([Field2],"""","");<br />
<br />
Changing the table and column (field) names to your own and adding further rows for each column as necessary.<br />
<br />
In query design view you'd enter <i>Replace([Field1],"""","")</i> etc in the 'update to row of each column, changing the column name in each case.<br />
<br />
The point Scott is making is not merely that the table is imported from Excel, but that a relational database is, ....well,
<i>relational</i>, i.e. it models the underlying reality in terms of its entity types and the relationships between them, with each entity type being modelled by a table and the attributes of the entity type in question being modelled by the columns in the
 table.&nbsp; There are formal rules which govern this to ensure that, as far as is possible, the database contains no redundancies which can undermine the integrity of the database by allowing update anomalies, i.e. each fact is stated once and once only.&nbsp; At only
 one place in a database for instance would the fact that London is in England be stated.&nbsp; If it were not, then there would be nothing to stop London being placed correctly in London in one row and erroneously in France in another. We know which is correct
 and which not, but a visitor from Mars would not.<br />
<br />
The process by which redundancies are eliminated is known as <i>'normalization' </i>
and is achieved by decomposing a table into two or more related tables.&nbsp; You'll find an example as DecomposerDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo takes data from a simple Excel worksheet and decomposes it into correctly normalized related tables by executing a series of 'append' queries in a specific order.&nbsp; The rule of thumb is that rows must be inserted into a referenced table (on
 the 'one' side of a one-to-many relationship type) before rows are inserted into a referencing table (on the 'many' side of the relationship type).<br />

<h2>            Windows Phone 7 - doesn&#39;t support TLS on IMAP email account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>few weeks ago my Windows Phone 7 mobile stopped to sending and receiving emails from one of the biggest email provider in Czech Republic, seznam.cz. Their administrator told me they switch off support for old SSL protocol versions because of POODLE vulnerability:&nbsp;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE.
 And that Windows Phone 7.x doesn't support TLS, so I can use either unsecure connection or contact Microsoft tech support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, please?</p>

            <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having sending and receiving email with your Windows Phone.&nbsp; It does seem true that the Windows Phone platform does not support TLS but instead uses SSL for email security and authentication.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no option to have change how the mail is delivered there may be little options when it comes to getting this mail on your phone.&nbsp; I have found a few discussions about this and there have been some discussions with possible work arounds.&nbsp; Consider
 these when trying to resolve this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try adding the account to your phone as a POP3 or IMAP&nbsp;email following the advanced steps outlined here,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/email-and-calendar/set-up-or-delete-an-email-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/email-and-calendar/set-up-or-delete-an-email-account</a> .&nbsp; You may want to discuss with your email provider alternate port and proxy numbers to try.</li><li>This discussion seems to indicate there was some success when enabling LOGIN authenticatkion on the mail server side,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wppeople/outgoing-email-tls/f4c3eafa-7969-4dac-a35b-5c2da94b877e">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wppeople/outgoing-email-tls/f4c3eafa-7969-4dac-a35b-5c2da94b877e</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>If no progress is made the final thing I can suggest at this time is to post your feature suggest here,

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I hope you have enabled extra repository in order to download extra softwares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download "Leafpad" application it is a text editor. Once downloaded and installed then do the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. open Terminal.</p>
<p>2. Sudo Gainroot &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " Hope you have installed rootsh"</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;cd /etc/mce/</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;leafpad mce.ini</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;This will open up the leafpad text editor with the contents of this file. Now scroll down the file till you reach a section of the file which starts with&nbsp;<strong>[LEDPatternLystiRX51]</strong>. This is the section which handles the LED Notifications.
 Scroll a bit further till you see these sets of lines:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><span>PatternCommunicationCall</span>=<span>30</span>;<span>1</span>;<span>0</span>;b;9d80400002ff03ff02ff03ff71080000;9d800000
<span>PatternCommunicationIM</span>=<span>30</span>;<span>1</span>;<span>0</span>;b;9d80400002ff03ff02ff03ff71080000;9d800000
<span>PatternCommunicationSMS</span>=<span>30</span>;<span>1</span>;<span>0</span>;b;9d80400002ff03ff02ff03ff71080000;9d800000
<span>PatternCommunicationEmail</span>=<span>30</span>;<span>1</span>;<span>0</span>;b;9d80400002ff03ff02ff03ff71080000;9d800000
<span>PatternCommonNotification</span>=<span>30</span>;<span>1</span>;<span>0</span>;b;9d80400002ff03ff02ff03ff71080000;9d800000</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See it is very important you only and only edit the lines below&nbsp;<strong>[LEDPatternLystiRX51].</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The b (marked in red) in the setting above means that the notification will blink in blue. You can use r (<span>red</span>),g (<span>green</span>),b (<span>blue</span>) or a combination of that to get a new notification color.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let me know if it worked. Hope it does. Don't brick your phone. Enjoy and Happy tweaking.</strong></p>

<p>Been playing with mine too! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed so far</p>
<p>1) if you use R, G or B and don't put anything in the control set for it all the lights don't work</p>
<p>2) if you change something, like the charging light, that only comes on when the device is asleep, wait for the device to go to sleep before thinking you've stuffed it. :smileywink:</p>
<p>3) setting r and G to flash at different rates when charging is odd! :smileysurprised:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know why you should not call R and r at the same time? This seems to limit what you can do colour/fade wise - I think!</p>

            Hi Jason,<br />
<br />
The summary scan alerts will still be the same as before in the action center. This change is by design and have updated the antimalware client version of Windows Defender. For more information about the update for Windows Defender antimalware platform, you
 can check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4052623/update-for-windows-defender-antimalware-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Yammer REST API - Group endpoints - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Yammer REST API - Group endpoints</h2>
                    <p>I've been using the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.yammer.com/docs/rest-api-rate-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://developer.yammer.com/docs/rest-api-rate-limits</a>&nbsp;to query messages and users of my group. I discovered that there are undocumented
 'group' endpoints</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/groups/xxx.json</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/groups/10435172/members.json</span></li></ol>
<p>In my case, the group request says that I have 60 members in the group, but when I query the 'group_members' endpoint, I only get a list of 50 users. I appreciate this is an attempt by yammer to control the amount of data returned, but is there a recommended
 workaround that will allow me to retrieve all 60 users via multiple calls?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p>You can try doing shorter videos, but no option to lower resolution in the built in camera app.</p>

<h3> spydy2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export Excel Charts</h2>
                    
<p>I have a chart created in excel 2007 that has around 13 charts. I need to export all these charts as a gif in one file. I did find code to export one chart.</p>
<p>I want to know what is the syntax to select multiple chart objects to export.</p>
<p>Sub Export()<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim mychart As Chart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Set mychart = ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(1).Chart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set mychart = Sheets("Sheet2").ChartObjects(5).Chart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mychart.Export Filename:="c:\Temp\Mychart.gif", FilterName:="GIF"</p>
<p><br />
End Sub</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>I found how to export more than one image at a time. For those who need it:</p>
<p>Sub Export()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim objCht As ChartObject<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strPath As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strPath = "C:\Temp\"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each objCht In Sheets("Sheet2").ChartObjects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objCht.Chart.Export strPath &amp; objCht.Name &amp; ".gif", filtername:="gif"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my issue is I want it all&nbsp; the charts in one&nbsp; image file e.g test.gif</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I believe that you are going to have to export them individually to some other application in which you arrange them the way that you want them in the single image and the you could use a screen capture program such as Snagit (www.techsmith.com) to capture
 them and save them as a single file.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I have a chart created in excel 2007 that has around 13 charts. I need to export all these charts as a gif in one file. I did find code to export one chart.<br />
<br />
I want to know what is the syntax to select multiple chart objects to export.<br />
<br />
Sub Export()<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim mychart As Chart<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Set mychart = ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(1).Chart<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set mychart = Sheets("Sheet2").ChartObjects(5).Chart<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mychart.Export Filename:="c:\Temp\Mychart.gif", FilterName:="GIF"<br />
<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
I found how to export more than one image at a time. For those who need it:<br />
<br />
Sub Export()<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim objCht As ChartObject<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strPath As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; strPath = "C:\Temp\"<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each objCht In Sheets("Sheet2").ChartObjects<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; objCht.Chart.Export strPath &amp; objCht.Name &amp; ".gif", filtername:="gif"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But my issue is I want it all&nbsp; the charts in one&nbsp; image file e.g test.gif<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>If your charts are not too large and you can arrange them on the same sheet, you could export a picture of the range containing them:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codeforexcelandoutlook.com/blog/2009/04/export-excel-range-to-a-picture-file-redux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.codeforexcelandoutlook.com/blog/2009/04/export-excel-range-to-a-picture-file-redux/</a></p>
<p>There's an upper limit to the size of the range you can take a snapshot of, but i couldn't tell you off the top of my head what that limit is...</p>

<p>Well I guess I should have tested that first...</p>
<p>There's a part of that code which resizes the passed-in range (using CurrentRegion) before it&nbsp;copies the image.&nbsp; You'll need to rework that part (just under the comment "check for a valid range")</p>
