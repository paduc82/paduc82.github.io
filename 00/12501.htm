<p>Saturday the 17th of march i got a sms&nbsp;from a friend that she got some weird link sent to her from my account, and i did not send it because i was in sleep. So i looked on skype right when i saw the SMS, and yepp&nbsp;somebody had send a weird link to nearly
 everyone of my skype friends and every link was ending with theirs skype account username and i do not know why that happend&nbsp;or how..&nbsp;and now on monday&nbsp;19th of march i can't log in on any device i got.. I was like kicked out from my account on my computer
 and on my mobile and it's stands that someone has been on my account..&nbsp;so i did send in one like verification that it is my account, but with the microsoft&nbsp;check thing it's says right away that it's not my account and it does not belong to me but it does..
 I have had that account for like 5 years or something, and many of my skype ''friends'' i have there is from that time i played minecraft lol..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope anyway i can get some sort of help, and some like helper can get in and check something or like that..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be so so soooo&nbsp;thankful if anyone in the microsoft&nbsp;community can help me out, because yeah it's some friends i just have contact with over skype..</p>

<h2>            Inflated battery</h2>
                    
<p>This question is meant for the Nokia staff...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a BL-5C battery (Serial nr.&nbsp;<span>0670400417535M414H20273895</span>) which is now kind of inflated and does not fit in the phone properly.</p>
<p>Nokia is changing some of this type batteries which have a risk for overheating etc., but this one (according to the serial number) is not included in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what shall I do then? Should I just carry it in my pocket and wait until it pops out and opens/explodes? Or is it possible to change it? Who should i contact then? The seller, the repair center, any Nokia shop or smth else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that batteries have a limited lifetime and then they last shorter when charged etc. but there is nothing mentioned about such inflation in the users manual, so&nbsp;I am not going to pay for a new one because Nokia sold me a bad product...</p>

Stop right there.<br />
<br />
This is a user-to-user forum populated by other users of Nokia products like yourself. There are, however, a few members of Nokia staff among us and, if you're lucky, one might see this question.<br />
<br />
However, if you want the best chances of obtaining a response from Nokia then you should click on the "Contact us" link on all forum pages and follow instructions.<br />
<br />
Do berar in mind that the warranty on batteries is 6 months, I believe.

<p>You should get your battery replaced as soon as possible. It is not safe to continue using the bulging battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bulging battery could be due to other things such as improper charging and is not always due to a manufacturing defect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Batteries normally carry a 6 month warranty but could vary from region to region. In order to find out the exact warranty in your region, you should contact Nokia Care in your region by using the "Contact us" tab at the top right of this screen.

            I've been having the same problem with my BL-4C battery. the battery was badly swollen. i cant properly close the back cover. I've changed the battery twice and the problem prolonged. Initially, I thought it was my charger, however a friend who constantly
 use my charger, doesnt have any kind of this problem. I feel bad about this, and perhaps in this kind of situation, i simply wanna blame the phone unit itself. How do u expect to connect people when even the battery cannot be properly connected?

    <title>Creating and recording daily work tasks in Access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pinkfloydfan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating and recording daily work tasks in Access 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to use Access 2010 to build a daily task tracker to highlight tasks that need doing on the day or that are left over from&nbsp;the previous day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for design tips how to do this.&nbsp; I have various tables set up with the task name, frequency, task owner etc. and whilst I can create a query to determine what is due to do today I don't know how to store this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this sounds like a basic workflow management tool: I'd like to be able to open the database in the morning, see what jobs need doing, record by the end of the day whether they were completed or not then repeat tomorrow.&nbsp; Tomorrow's task list should
 include tasks that were not completed the previous day (if not a daily task) and allow you to see the previous days' commentary (or the commentary the previous time the task was due).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please advise me or point me in the direction of a working example I can use as a basis for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much</p>

            <p>In its simplest incarnation you would have only one table:</p>
<p>tblTasks</p>
<p>TaskID autonumber PK</p>
<p>TaskDescription text(255) required</p>
<p>TaskDueDate datetime required?</p>
<p>TaskCompletedDate datetime</p>
<p>Comments memo</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then create a query to show the non-completed ones:</p>
<p>select * from tblTasks <br />
where TaskCompleteDate is null or TaskCompleteDate=dateadd("d", -1, Date())<br />
order by TaskDueDate</p>
<p>You can use this query as the basis for a datasheet form showing the records just completed, and to be completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm leaving recurring tasks as an exercise for you.</p>

            <p>Hi Tom</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the fact that all tasks have some recurring frequency that is stumping me.&nbsp; Having set the recurrence I can query the base data so it pulls out the tasks due today from that core data, but what I don't know is how to store that data at the end of each
 day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately I want to create an audit trail to prove that work was completed on the day (and allow people to attach evidence of that); I can then run reports off that to measure performance over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if I'm not making this clear but although I consider myself an Excel expert, I'm a total newbie with databases.</p>

</p><p>Outlook's task manager wouldn't suffice for me for a number of reasons: I've only put the very basics of what I want to do on here, once I get the recurrence and recording / reporting sorted out there is a lot more that I will add, use and query that data

            <p>There are many ways to do recurring tasks; I'm trying to find a very simple one for you.</p>
<p>tblRecurringTasks</p>
<p>RecurringTaskID autonumber pk</p>
<p>RecurringTaskDescription text(255) required</p>
<p>StartDate datetime required</p>
<p>EndDate datetime</p>
<p>Frequency text(10) required&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'daily, weekly, monthly</p>
<p>DayNumber integer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'vbSunday etc, or day of month</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then every first day of the week you run one or more append queries that copy data from this table into tblTasks, for the current week. You can call the same function when you select a future date.</p>

            <p>So, my problem has been in determining what tasks are due today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to write a suite of date functions, one of which generates an array of all dates in a range with a given frequency.&nbsp; Then, I have another function that checks if an item is in an array.&nbsp; Together they should allow me to determine if on any particular
 date whether a task was due or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two functions work perfectly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i) DateGenerateStrip (startdate, enddate, frequency, rollconvention)&nbsp;: <em>creates an array of type Date</em></p>
<p>ii) IsInArray (item As Var, arr As Var) As Boolean : <em>returns True if item is in arr</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked each function independently and as nested functions in both&nbsp;Excel and in the Access VBA editor and they work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to test this Expression for the Condition "True" in order that a query would only return tasks due on that date:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IsDueOnTestDate: IsInArray(Date(),DateGenerateStrip([tblTasks]![TaskStartDate],[tblTasks]![TaskEndDate],[tblTasks]![TaskFrequency]))</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it's returning the following error:&nbsp; "Data type mismatch in criteria expression".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this odd since I can run the expression in the Immediate window and I don't get this error.&nbsp; If I put breakpoints in then&nbsp;the DateGenerateStrip function works (by returning an array of dates) but as soon as it passes to the IsInArray function this
 error crops up.&nbsp; Like I said, it's weird because the nested functions work perfectly in the immediate window and this error only occurs when I run the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, as I'm a complete newbie to Access I may well be doing something fundamentally wrong in my query but if anyone can suggest why this happening I'd really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much</p>

            <p>DateGenerateStrip must be a public function in a standard module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your first description of it, it takes 4 arguments. You're passing only 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add to possible confusion, VBA has two types of arrays: ones with declared data types, and a Variant Array. This may have effect on how to process arr in IsInArray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not totally convinced VBA is needed here. Can you post a Relationships diagram with the relevant tables? Or better: a database, stripped down to the essentials and without any PII, for us to download and experiment with?</p>

            <p>Thanks Tom</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Are they public functions in a standard module? Yes, all functions are public in standard modules</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Why only 3 arguments? The 4th (in fact there are 5) is optional</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; At present there is only one table that I'm running the query on, so no relationships to worry about and there's not much point in posting this</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I found a solution although I don't understand why it works:&nbsp; if instead of using a combination of these two UDFs in my expression, I create a new function that has all the required arguments for both the IsInArray and DateGenerateStrip functions
 in one and&nbsp;calls each of those&nbsp;it returns a Bool&nbsp;and works for me!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems awfully strange (and inefficient)&nbsp;that either using more than one UDF or nested UDFs in an expression will return #Error, but creating a single UDF that does the whole job for you will&nbsp;produce the desired outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why that is the case?</p>

            Generally when you experience the "slowness" in the viewing of the Windows folder it is because you have the SHOW ALL FILES checked.&nbsp; IF you uncheck that option then it will not show the system and hidden files and you will see a vast improvement in the
 loading of that folder.

<h2>            Excel &#34;IF&#34; Function Help</h2>
                    
<p>I have two tabs in my excel spreadsheet. One collects data from a list of names that appear as people respond to a separate google form, while the second tab collects whether those names are present on the first tab.</p>
<p>My formula in Sheet 2 is:</p>
<p>=IF('Sheet 1'!B:B="Doe, Jane", "YES", "NO")</p>
<p>It keeps giving me the FALSE value even if the name is on the first tab in the B column. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>we have our company network, but it seems first user that created it (signed up first), no longer in the company so we don't have admin capabilities for our network.</p>

<p>Is there any way we can transfer admin rights to someone else in our network?</p>

    <title>Windows Security Center Reports Windows Defender And Mcafee Endpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Security Center Reports Windows Defender And Mcafee Endpoint are both turned off</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 on a&nbsp;HP Pro-desk 600 the OS was Built VIA MDT &nbsp;with a Volume License .&nbsp; The windows version is 1607 OS build 14393.0 We&nbsp;use Mcafee. The Current Mcafee product is ENS 10.5.1.</p>
<p>The Windows Security Center Reports Windows Defender And Mcafee Endpoint are both turned off. By design Installing Mcafee turns off windows Defender so I'm not too worried about this but the fact that it pops up every day is a concern . The Mcafee product
 is updating and working as expected. I Opened up a ticket with Mcafee and they tell me as long as the WMI service is working and it is that the issue is a Microsoft Issue . Having experience with Mcafee I am unlikely to believe this , but I thought I would
 ask if Any one else has run into this issue and possibly have a resolution or an idea of how the check . The settings in the Security center do not allow any granular customization per product installed so I'm at a loss</p>

<p>In the discussions during Microsoft Ignite Event I came across several sessions on Sway and Infopedia. I can see Sway is available now with E3 licence but Infopedia is still not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So could you please let me know that whether it has been released already for use or its still on the Road Map. And if its released how can we use Infopedia.</p>

<p>It also depends on which ISO standard. While adherence is not mandatory, from a practical standpoint it might as well be. For example my company makes items that are used in medical applications. We have been certified as complying with the ISO standard
 for medical parts (I think its 13485). The thing is no manufacturer of medical equipment is going to buy parts from a manufacturer that isn't certified. So while it isn't required, from a practical standpoint, in order to do business, it is.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 crashes when deleting emails from &#34;deleted items&#34; folder</h2>
                    Outlook 2011 for Mac (OS X 10.5.8) crashes when deleting Deleted Items from Exchange 2010. Recently migrated users from Exchange 2003 and Entourage 2004. Latest Office 2011 SP2 update had no effect. Users with problem were migrated from Entourage 2004,
 and had quite a bit of data &nbsp;"on my computer". Virgins to Outlook 2011 (no data migrated from Entourage 2004) have not had the problem, nor have other users migrated from Entourage 2004 with little or no data to move.
<div>Main user complains she can delete "up to 7 emails at a time" from Outlook's Deleted Items.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Friday morning updated her to Office 14.2.0, user called 2 hours later reporting Outlook crashed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This weekend moved all her "on my computer" emails up to the server, created her a brand new profile for Outlook, then moved all her data back to "on my computer", even rebooted, repaired preferences on her iMac and cleared caches, including fonts, with
 Onyx.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was able to delete 7, then 10 emails from Deleted Items, but at 12 items Outlook Crashes. Let it send report to Microsoft.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then was able to delete groups of 20+ emails at a time from Deleted Items with no issues, User has not crashed so far today.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another user has the same issue but is able to get by deleting a few emails at a time. We have more users with lots of baggage (large amount of data "on my computer") that will be migrating to Outlook 2011 / Exchange 2010 soon, and need to get this bug
 squashed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Have deleted preferences, cleared caches, repaired permissions, rebuilt databases discussed here.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any assistance here is appreciated.</div>
                </div>

</span>Export from Entourage is .rge file. Do you get "Done" at the end or do you get "one or more items failed to export"? If you do not get "Done", this indicates corruption. It certainly sounds like corruption to me in Entourage 2004.<br />
<br />
You can download and run this script on the Entourage 2004 Identity. <br />
<a href="http://www.office.mvps.org/downloads/scripts/jolly/Make_MBOX.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Export folders as MBOX files (includes subfolders)
<br />
</a><br />
The script will fail on a folder with corruption. If there is no corruption the script will export all folders. Once you find corrupted folder, rename it with z in front of the name so it sorts at the bottom then run the script again. Keep repeating until you
 have identified all corrupt folders. Once you have identified corruption, you can subdivide folders and keep running script until you get down to 25 messages. Then you drag individual messages to the Desktop. A corrupt message will crash Entourage. After you
 clean all folders and reduce the size of the Inbox and Sent folders, do the File &gt; Export as .rge file and you should get "Done". You can use this file to import into Outlook.<br />
<br />
Note: any data stored in Outlook's "On My Computer" folders are subject to loss. Currently the Outlook database is not as stable as we would like. Any data not on the server can be lost. Your idea of uploading those messages to a Gmail IMAP account might be
 a better option.<br />
<br />
One of the frequent causes of crashes is a folder with too many messages. No folder should contain more than 2GB of data. Since only Exchange has the option to show size the only way you can know size is to drag a folder to the Desktop as .mbox file. If it's
 2GB most likely there are too many messages. I generally find between 6-10,000 messages per folder will be 2GB. (Depends on how many attachments and message size.)<br />
<br />
Read over the Exchange help below and clean up her Inbox and make sure there are no subfolders under the Inbox. Then I would do one last new Identity. Rather then "just renaming" her Identity, add a new Identity using the Database Utility.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/outlook/faqs/#faq20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create a new Identity or switch to a new Identity in Outlook 2011</a><br />
<br />
<br />
The Inbox syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible. (this is the number one cause of problems with sync). Do NOT make subfolders under the Inbox.<br />
<br />
Any folder with more than a few thousand messages is going to take some time to fully come down when you first sync your account. Due to the design of Outlook's sync engine (and how exchange works), you will see the 512 newest messages in a folder at the initial
 start of sync then the rest of the folder's contents will be back filled before you see any mail that arrives after this point. This is why it will look like you are not getting new mail when a folder is still going through initial sync. This is also further
 exacerbated by an Exchange issue where it gets unnecessary change events before the newer mail arrives. If you carefully watch the progress during the sync of a folder with greater than a couple thousand messages, you will see "Updating local..." a lot before
 the newer mail starts arriving (newer than the initial 512 that come down).<br />
<br />
Outlook checks the server for updates every minute, any folder that has updates will subsequently be synced. Since Outlook has a limit on how many folders can be synced at a time, there can be a queue of folders waiting. The Inbox does get high priority so
 it will generally sync before other folders that also need to sync.<br />

Make sure that you have at least three times as much hard disk space available as the current size of your Outlook identity PLUS 10% free for virtual memory.</li><li>Rebuilding does not fix all issues. It can make some problems worse. Even though the Database Utility will make a backup, I advise making a copy in the Finder first.</li><li>You can delete the rebuild version after you are satisfied with the results.

<h2>            No navigation pane in Read-Only mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>This is more of a suggestion than a&nbsp;<em>real </em>issue. However this is bugging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm writing a document that I need to share with other people. The document is in OneDrive and I'm using word 2013. Because the document is pretty long it has a summary and a lot of titles that can be reached from this summary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my word 2013 there is a very practical thing called the Navigation pane, which always displays the summary in a pane, and allows to navigate to the document by going directly to one section or another with a single click. This pane is also present in
 Word Online, however, when I create a "Read-Only" link with oneDrive, this creates a Word Online link that is perfectly viewable but misses the navigation pane.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my clients it is very hard to quickly navigate through this document by only scrolling, so displaying this Navigation pane on a side of the screen (like it does on writeable shared links or through Word 2013) would be very appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I keep hoping one day you'll update and add it.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rackover</p>

    <title>how to let everyone use my macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hungledink  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to let everyone use my macro</h2>
                    At work, I have created a macro that opens a file from my personal folder, performs some actions to the data in the workbook, and alters the layout. I now want to share this macro with other people.<br />
<br />
The problem is the file will not be saved in a central location, and each individual will have to open the file from there own personal folder.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of saving a workbook centrally.This workbook when opened, asks the user to open the file themselves, and then do the formatting etc.<br />
<br />
Is this the best way to do this? <br />
<br />
I was thinking there may be a way to save the macro to each indivduals personal.xls but I wouldnt know where to start with that.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

<p>You shouldn't manipulate other users' Personal.xls - it's, er, personal.</p>
<p>If you want to make macros available to others, you can include the macros in the workbook that the users will need to open anyway, or you could store them in a workbook that you save in a shared folder as an Excel add-in (.xla). The users can then install
 the add-in through Tools | Add-Ins...</p>

<p>You could use a fileopen dialog in your macro to have the user select the desired file - they open your file with the macro, press a button, and are asked to select the file(s) to fix.</p>
<p>Post your code if you would like&nbsp;help modifying it to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Search can't be used when you are using Outlook with elevated permissions (Run as administrator).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sage should be able to run without elevated permissions as well. If it doesn't, something is wrong with your installation or configuration of Sage. Contact Sage support if you don't know how to correct this.</p>

    <title>Excel macro crashes if file is on network location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulvv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel macro crashes if file is on network location</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>A professional has developed a comprehensive Excel macro file for me which works perfectly if the file is located on the local drive.&nbsp; If the file resides on a network location (or selects another file from a network location as part of the macro function
 i.e. open/copy), then the file will crash (Excel has stopped working) part way through execution.&nbsp; It crashes during safe mode and it occurs on multiple computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Googling the issue suggests there could be 1000 reasons for this but I would be interested in ideas as to where I should start to identify the cause. The professional advises it is not a coding issue because it works fine on the local drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do notice in the&nbsp;C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\Temp file that a JETA*.tmp file appears in instances when the file is accessed from a network location whereas it doesn't occur when it is used from the local drive. I understand that this is a database file
 but I don't know whether this would impact the running of the macro or cause a conflict.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macros in workbooks can't work in Excel online. And that may also the reason you can't choose a file as part of the macro function. For your reference:

<p>Hi Pual,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean that the workbook with professional macros works well only when handling files from local location? If so, please create a new workbook with simple macro in it to check if it works well when handling files from network location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please share with me more info to let give you a further support:</p>

                    My start menu doesnt work, and none of the suggestions the experts are posting work. &nbsp;One of the suggestions i keep getting says to type in "ms-settings" in the "run" box. &nbsp;Only problem, my computer says that ms-settings cannot be found. &nbsp;Another suggestion
 i get is to go to the control panel and make sure i have administrator privleges (on my own computer at home, i wouldnt see why i wouldn'dt!), but how do i get to the control panel if i can't use the start button?!? &nbsp;Everything suggestion seems to be full
 of circular catch-22 logic! &nbsp;Also, when i am on the MS Community webpage, the "reply" button turns into a red circle with a slash across it, not allowing me to reply! &nbsp;This has all reached the point of absolute absurdity!!! &nbsp;Why doesnt Microsoft just make
 an operating system the works on the most basic level?!? &nbsp;<br />

<p>Sorry, but the answer is no you cannot convert a .pdf file to a .pub file.</p>
<p>You probably can copy and paste some of the text and/or images&nbsp;to a new Pub file but the formatting and layout will have to be recreated.</p>

    <title>Hybrid Deployment - Route internal message through on-prem transport - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ang kee wee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hybrid Deployment - Route internal message through on-prem transport rules</h2>
                    <p>Currently we have on our on-prem we have Exchange 2010 Servers. We rely on a few transport rules on our on-prem Exchange 2010 for disclaimers and routing of messages to various distribution groups.</p>
<p>For POC, we managed to configure hybrid between our on-prem Exchange and Office 365. We managed to migrate a few test mailboxes to office 365 (eg poc1 and poc2). During Hybrid configuration wizard, we opted for centralized mail transport. Mail flow between
 on-prem mailbox and migrated test mailboxes in Office 365 worked (eg. on-prem1 able to send mail to poc1 and poc2 and vice versa). Migrated mailbox in Office 365 also able to send external emails (eg. poc1 able to send to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***). Mails are routed
 via on-prem Exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However we noticed mails between migrated mailboxes in Office 365 are routed locally in Office 365 (eg. poc1 send mail to poc2). Which means our existing transport rules dont work for those migrated mailboxes if they are sending mails within Office 365.</p>
<p>Is there a way to force all mails to route via our on-prem Exchange so that all mails will go through our existing transport rules? (eg. when poc1 sends a mail to poc2, the mail will be routed back to on-prem first and then back to office 365 to reach poc2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Kee Wee,<br />
<br />
Based on my knowledge and research, this is not feasible. As you know, the centralized mail transport is the official solution to route emails to the on-premises Exchange environment, but it cannot affect the internal mail flow between two Office 365 mailbox
 users. Please consider if you can create Exchange Online rules as a workaround.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I will help you monitor this thread to see if our community members can share any 3rd-party solution. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Allen

<p>There hasn't been a version of Internet Explorer that could be installed on a MAC since about 2005.</p>
<p>

<p>At the moment, there is no browser from Microsoft which is able to run on MacOS and you may refer to Apple website for more help about getting started with MacOS and websites.</p>
<p>However, soon you would be able to install Microsoft Edge on MacOS:</p>
