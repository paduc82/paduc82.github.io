<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8e1f9805-dcd4-47b3-881e-53b87db0f301">
Milosha22</a>&nbsp;and welcome to the new home of the Skype Community!<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately creating and changing one's Skype name is not possible. Users are given only two options to create an account, either by use of a phone number or an email address. Once the user registers his/her account, the system will automatically generate
 a Skype name for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to have a Skype ID closer to a username that doesn't have random letters and numbers, I suggest that you use an email address to create your new account.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hope this clarifies things. </p>

<p>same problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>came across below fake skype website and contact and when i called they claim to reactivate my account only if i pay them and when i question them they hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
https://skype.supportnumberaustralia.com/ - this doesnt open up anymore.<br />
+61 28317 3538<br />
</p>
<p>can some one check the history and see why this live: changes are being applied and why existing ids are getting disaapeared..<br />
<br />
its very convinient to look into FAQ and say that a user has forgotten the id but in reality it has been changed to live:</p>
<p>
</p><p>please check the database to come to any conclusion.</p>

            If you didn't back up your encryption certificates, the data is probably inaccessible forever. You can try contacting the Elcomsoft folks to see if they can help you. If they can't, you've just learned a hard and sad lesson about not encrypting things
 unless you really know what you're doing. I'm sorry for your loss.<br />

            Hi GDIXIT,<br />
<br />
I'm no expert, but I'd like to share what worked for me when I had to repair/reinstall Windows XP.<br />
<br />
I was completely locked out of XP because by hitting the keyboard with my elbow, as I was logging into Windows I managed to delete all of my user accounts, while logged in as the administrator, shutting down my computer in the process.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When XP came back up I had absolutely no way of logging in, there were no user accounts to type a password, and nothing worked, CTRL+ALT+ DEL would not accept my password, I couldn't even logon under Safe Mode, somehow the Administrator account was erased there
 as well, I had no choice but to use my Dell CD boot disk to attempt&nbsp; Repair/Reinstall of Windows XP.<br />
<br />
After doing so I was horrified to find I had to reinstall all the Service Packs, reinstall Internet Explorer, and all of my password-protected files, music, photos were gone.<br />
<br />
I did find my user folder however, and discovered my files were still there only by doing a virus scan, thank the Lord!&nbsp; But received the error message, "Access is denied."<br />
<br />
I learned through another forum that I could take ownership of the folder that contained my files by doing the following:<br />
<br />
1. Boot into Safe Mode, logon as the Administrator.<br />
2. Right -click folder you are trying to access and select "Security".<br />
3. Edit the user permissions to your preference, click the "Advanced" button.<br />
<br />
A dialog box should pop up telling you that you don't have rights, permissions, etc., hit "Ok".
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Click the "Owner" tab.&nbsp; Users will be listed, select yourself as the owner and check the box regarding taking ownership/permissions of all subfolders/files etc. Hit "Ok".<br />
<br />
A dialog box will appear asking you to confirm that you want to take ownership of everything, hit "Yes/Ok."<br />
<br />
5. Repeat for every folder you are denied access to. Restart your computer.<br />
<br />
After logging in, confirm you have access to all your files, if you have any problems, please reply back, I might be able to search for the forum answer and post it in a reply, but please try this first.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It took me 4 days of research to get my computer back to almost normal and all my original files back, but I got it done for free.&nbsp; Hope this helps.<br />

            Taking the time to post all that was very kind and thoughtful. Unfortunately, it will not help the original poster at all because his issue is that he apparently used XP Pro's native EFS encryption to encrypt his files. He then neglected to back up his
 encryption certificates. Taking ownership will not help him decrypt these files. Probably nothing will. This happens to people all the time; they see the encryption feature and think "Cool! I'll hide all my Secret Stuff". But they don't understand how encryption
 works and don't take the time to learn about it. Therefore they don't think about decrypting their Secret Stuff until after it's too late and then you see posts like GDIXIT's.

            I find myself in a similar situation.&nbsp; Several weeks ago my computer would not boot - the message said I had an invalid or corrupt hal.dll file.&nbsp; I ended up reinstalling the OS after trying everything the "experts" said to try.<br />
<br />
Luckily most of my files are on a backup drive.&nbsp; However there are several encrypted files on that drive that I cannot access and from what I have been reading may be lost forever.<br />
<br />
Malkeleah - I take exception to the comment about those who think <em>'"Cool! I'll hide all my Secret Stuff". But they don't understand how encryption works and don't take the time to learn about it.'</em>&nbsp; Many of us are not IT professionals.&nbsp; We are average
 home users who feel we need&nbsp;some level of protection against the hackers who want to steal our identities.&nbsp; I have the Norton Security Suite including their Smart Firewall.&nbsp; I download and install the numerous security fixes from Microsoft - after the OS install
 I had to download 109 high priority patches for SP2, most of them to fix security issues.&nbsp; Is it no wonder that many of us feel that&nbsp;our files are not secure.<br />
<br />
I think that Microsoft is at fault for making it so easy to encrypt a file without any warning of the consequences and not having any solution for those of us who have fallen into the encryption abyss.&nbsp; A better approach&nbsp;may have been to provide the ability
 to password protect&nbsp;a&nbsp;file or folder.

            I certainly didn't mean to ruffle your feathers, but your post is a perfect illustration about what happens when people who don't know what they are doing use advanced tools without taking the time to RTFM. Possibly MS
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is</span> </em>at fault for offering EFS encryption in their professional/business operating systems. Of course if they
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">didn't</span> </em>offer it, users would complain that it was missing. And frankly, without meaning to further offend you, even if MS had included Big Red Warning Signs during the encryption process my experience
 as a professional tech for many years tells me that many people would still go forward without paying any attention. So possibly the
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">user</span> </em>is at fault for not taking the time to learn about EFS before plunging in. Personally, if I'm thinking about trying something new - even as a professional tech - I take the time to learn about it
 first. How about reading the instruction manual before turning on that chain saw?<br />
<br />
As for the protection against "hackers", encryption will do nothing to help you in the way that you mean this. And password-protecting a file or folder can be done with third-party encryption like TrueCrypt. But you have to take the time to learn about how
 to use TrueCrypt, too. And Norton is possibly one of the worst choices you could make for security protection with only McAfee beating them out of first place in awfulness.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but whinging that Microsoft isn't a caring parent and didn't stop you from riding your bike in traffic doesn't work for me. A safe user is an educated user. And there is a ton of information on the Internet available for free for users to educate themselves
 without having to become technically expert. Below are some links to make it easy for you regarding general Internet safety. The sites are written for the average user, not for techs - not talking down to anyone but making things clear. Included are articles
 I wrote for my clients which you can download if you like. And I'm sorry for your data loss.<br />

    <title>Change Windows 10 devices to use another Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave-arkley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Windows 10 devices to use another Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 devices each with Windows 10 installed. They were initially set up using media downloaded under my current Microsoft account which is associated with an e-mail address, lets call that *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will no longer have access to that e-mail domain in a few months and so am considering setting up a new Microsoft account which I'll associate with a different e-mail address, lets call that *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attempt this will my Windows 10 licenses still remain active? Do I need to re-install or would adding the new account to the device and then removing the old one work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate posting your query. You can link your Microsoft account to the Windows 10 digital license on your device. If you have two Microsoft account verified on a PC and you use one to go through the reactivation process to transfer the digital license,
 then if you try it with the other account you will get told it's no longer possible. We would like to ask additional information to further investigate the issue, can you confirm if you are suing Windows 10 Home or Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<br />
<br />None
<br />
<br />Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point
<br />
<br />2. Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

<p>The .DMP file it generated called MEMORY.DMP is over 16GB big so i'm not sure if it did the driver verifier correctly or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Should i change the debugging information to small memory dumps instead of complete?</p>

            Leave this file. If needed, you can delete it. No use taking so much space. 
<br />3B in general is due to memory issues.
<br />
<br />You should run Memtest for at least 8 passes to determine whether memory is really a problem or not. You should run it during night before retiring for bed as it will take many hours to run.

<p>1) To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
2) Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3813-language-add-remove-change-windows-10-a.html<br />
<br />
<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
3) Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive or drop box to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />

 export "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components" "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\installed.txt"&amp;net start &gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\services.txt"&amp;REM wmic startup list full /format:htable &gt;"%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\startup.html"&amp;wmic STARTUP
 GET Caption, Command, User &gt;"%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\startup.txt"<br />
<br />
5) There are two files for you to find manually:<br />
<br />
a) C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP<br />
<br />
Use file explorer &gt; this PC &gt; local C: drive &gt; right upper corner search enter the above to find results.<br />
<br />
b) dxdiag: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the left lower corner search type:&nbsp; dxdiag &gt; When the DirectX Diagnostic Tool opens click on the next page button so that each tab is opened &gt; click on save all information &gt; save to desktop &gt; post one drive or drop box share link into the thread<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Open administrative command prompt and type or copy and paste:<br />
7) sfc /scannow<br />
8) dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
9) chkdsk /scan<br />
10) When these have completed &gt; right click on the top bar or title bar of the administrative command prompt box &gt; left click on edit then select all &gt; right click on the top bar again &gt; left click on edit then copy &gt; paste into the thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>11) Make sure that there is no over clocking while troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12) In the left lower corner search type: system or system control &gt; open system control panel &gt; on the left pane click advanced system settings</p>
<p><br />
a) &gt; on the advanced tab under startup and recovery &gt; click settings &gt; post an image of the startup and recovery into the thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) &gt; on the advanced tab under performance &gt; click on settings &gt; under performance options &gt; click on the advanced tab &gt; under virtual memory &gt; click on change &gt; post an image of the virtual memory tab into the thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>13) If the computer has Ccleaner (do not install the software if it is not already installed) &gt; click windows tab &gt; scroll down to system and advanced &gt; post an image into the thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>14) Please post two share links:</p>

<p><span>This article will help you back up all of your files like videos, music and documents. You will have to go through all of the steps, provided in this article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>CAUSES OF NON-BOOTABLE WINDOWS PC.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><strong>Windows Operating not found.</strong> This error message show up when you have made changes on your BIOS Boot Option. And it can be resolved by changing back to its default settings. However if your Windows Operating has totally messed
 up, reinstallation is needed.</span></span></li><li><span><span><strong>Extending or Shrinking C driver or where the operating system was installed.</strong> Some Windows PC users would like to extend or shrink the drive where the operating system was installed either by using a third party application or
 using the Disk Management or Through and installation media. However extending or shrinking C drive will totally messed up your PC.</span></span></li><li><span><span><strong>Viruses/Malwares.</strong> This is a known cause of Windows Problem. Some Windows PC users believed that using multiple Security Software will protect their pc even better  But its not. You are just making it worst.</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>METHODOLOGIES:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are the steps that you need to perform to fully backup your files. Follow the instruction carefully.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NOTES:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Make sure that you are logged in to an Administrator Account.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that your internet connection is stable.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>STEP 1. CREATE A BOOTABLE MEDIA</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>1.</strong> Turn on the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">other Windows PC.</span></strong> Insert the USB Flash Drive.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>2</strong>. Press Windows Key on your keyboard to pull up your
<strong>Search Box. </strong>Type <strong>CMD or Command Prompt. </strong>Then <strong>
right click it and choose Run as Administrator</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>3. Now </strong>that we have the command prompt open, we are going to type a series of Commands and each commands. Press
<strong>Enter</strong> Key to execute each commands.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Type <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">diskpart </span></strong>and hit enter. This command will let your command prompt enter into a disk management mode.</span></li><li><span><span>Now, type <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">list disk</span></strong> and hit enter. This command will list the current drives or external hard drive or USB connected to your PC. Please make you know the size of your USB Flash
 Drive. You will see six Columns. First column list Disk number starting from 0. In the image below USB Flash Drive is currently at
<strong>7488 MB</strong> or usually <strong>8 GB</strong>.<br />
</span></span></li><li><span>Now, type <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">select disk 1</span>.
</strong>Disk 1 represents the USB Flash Drive. If you have multiple devices connected to your PC, you might be seeing not just Disk 0 or Disk 1, you can also see disk 2 or disk 3.</span></li><li><span>Then, we need to empty the Flash Drive by typing <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">clean</span></strong> and hitting enter.</span></li><li><span>Now, lets create a partition by typing <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">create part pri</span>
</strong>and hit enter. Next is to select the partition by typing <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">select part 1</span>
</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>hit enter.</span></li><li><span>Next is to format it to an NTFS file formatting. NTFS (</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>New Technology Files System</span></span></strong><span>) is the newer drive format. Microsoft introduced NTFS in 1993, as a component
 of the corporate-oriented Windows NT 3.1 and then <strong><span>Windows 2000</span></strong>, though it didn't become common on consumer PCs until Windows XP in 2001. Windows 7 and 8 default to NTFS format on new PCs. To do so type
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">format fs=ntfs quick</span></strong> and then hit enter. The command
<strong>quick </strong><span>&nbsp;</span>will enable the default formatting time per second to faster bytes per seconds.</span></li><li><span>Now we need to type <strong>active </strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and then hit enter. Once done you can type
<strong>exit</strong> and hit enter to exit Diskpart. And type <strong>exit </strong>
again to exit the command prompt.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>STEP 2. DOWNLOAD THE WINDOWS 10 DIRECTLY TO YOUR USB.</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>

<p>If a computer can't boot, and you want to recover your personal files, boot the computer from any kind of rescue or recovery media (USB drive or disk) built from Windows PE or Linux because it will have a file manager like File Explorer. That could be, for
 example, the rescue media&nbsp; from an antivirus program or a disk partitioning program. You can also use a 'live' Linux distribution, i.e., one that runs entirely in RAM. Boot the computer from the media and then use its file manager to copy your folders and
 files to an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many third-party image backup applications can overwrite the damaged boot sector of a hard drive with fresh, bootable code.&nbsp;If you're using third-party image backup software just boot from the software's recovery environment and follow the steps to recover
 the boot sector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, if you're using image backup software you already have a known good bootable image that you can easily restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these solutions presume that the reason for not booting is software-related, e.g., the boot sector is damaged. If the reason is hardware-related, e.g., the hard drive or motherboard is physically damaged then you have a more serious situation on your
 hands.</p>

<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select Run as Administrator.
<br />	3. Type sfc /scannow without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />If issue persist I suggest that you try performing a repair upgrade by following Andre Da Costa's instructions in his article to resolve the issue.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

            <p>I also tried this however it does not work. The HomeGroup Listener and the HomeGroup Provider both say they are manual startup however when i try to run them i get.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows could not start the HomeGroup listener on local compter. and then that error code -2147023817.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for HomeGroup Provider i get Error 1079 the account specified for this service is different from the account specified for other services running in the same process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HomeGroup Troubleshooter says it is not a homegroup problem but a network problem and the network troubleshooter says it cannot find any problem.

<p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Were there any changes you made before this issue came up? <span>Windows may have disabled your mouse during the update from a previous version or while your computer was in sleep mode.<span> In line with this, I've got a few handy solutions that you can
 try:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Re-enable your mouse in order to restore its cursor.</span><span> <span>
<br />
</span></span>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><span>Press the&nbsp;</span><strong>Win&nbsp;</strong><span>key on your keyboard, then type </span><em><strong>mouse</strong></em><span>. When you see </span><strong>Mouse settings</strong><span></span><span>appear in the menu above, press&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><strong>up
 or down&nbsp;arrow&nbsp;</strong><span>on your keyboard&nbsp;to highlight&nbsp;it, then press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>In Mouse settings, press&nbsp;</span><strong>Tab</strong><span>&nbsp;on your keyboard until&nbsp;</span><strong>Additional mouse options</strong><span>&nbsp;(under&nbsp;</span><strong>Related Settings</strong><span>) is highlighted. Press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter&nbsp;</strong><span>on
 your keyboard to select it.</span></li><li><span>In the&nbsp;</span><strong>Mouse Properties&nbsp;</strong><span>window, press&nbsp;</span><strong>Tab&nbsp;</strong><span>on your&nbsp;keyboard until the&nbsp;</span><strong>Buttons&nbsp;</strong><span>tab in the window is highlighted</span></li><li><span>If your device is disabled, press&nbsp;</span><strong>Tab</strong><span>&nbsp;on your keyboard until the&nbsp;</span><strong>Enable</strong><span>&nbsp;button is high lighted, and press&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>&nbsp;to enable the device.</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Update your mouse driver<br />
<ul>
<li><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>button, type "device manager" in the search box, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></li><li><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Driver</strong>&nbsp;tab, click&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions.</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>

<h2>            Network adapter error code 39 and hotfix not installing</h2>
                    <p><b><span>Network adapter error 39</span></b></p>
<p><span>I have a Lenovo Laptop with 64 bit operating system running Windows 7 Home Premium. I use a Huawei EC167 dongle to access the internet and until this morning&nbsp;I've&nbsp;never had a problem with it. This is my second laptop and&nbsp;I've&nbsp;not used it for a while
 until yesterday. Yesterday, it was working fine and I ran windows update and shut the computer down. This morning the laptop&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;open windows, flashing up a blue screen while displaying the swirling windows icon then going to the helper. I restored the
 computer to a previous image and it is at least now starting but now I cannot connect to the internet. (I am typing this on my laptop, which is using the same dongle has&nbsp;no problem connecting.)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Although the dongle software shows there is a 3G network available, the network and sharing center basic network information doesn't list any available connections saying my status is 'Unknown' and 'The&nbsp;dependency&nbsp;service or group failed to start'.
 Running the Internet Connections Troubleshooter, I get an error saying that 'Windows&nbsp;could&nbsp;not automatically detect this network's proxy settings'.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Checking the device manager, I&nbsp;saw an Error Code 39 for five Network Adapters that I didn't even know I had (6to4 Adapter #2, ISATAP Adapter, ISATAP Adapter #2, Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface &amp; WAN Miniport (IKEv2)).&nbsp;This said that they were corrupted.
 I tried to update them from the PC but they were unable to&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;correctly and I just got the same error&nbsp;code. The option to roll back the drivers is ghosted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I repeated my restore to roll back Windows to an even earlier version but this made no difference. I then uninstalled five of the&nbsp;drivers under Device Manager Network Adapters. However WAN Miniport IKEv2 refuses to uninstall and Im no further forwarding
 to connecting to the internet from my desktop </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ive done a search for this problem using window community support and found that at this address theres a hotfix available.
</span><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/network-adapter-error-39-please-help-urgently/22b06f1b-42cc-4a10-99bf-6671c168c635?msgId=1796657b-091e-4c18-82f8-afac0bfcb064">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/network-adapter-error-39-please-help-urgently/22b06f1b-42cc-4a10-99bf-6671c168c635?msgId=1796657b-091e-4c18-82f8-afac0bfcb064</a></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Ive downloaded the hotfix and transferred it by pen drive to the non-working laptop but when I try to run the hotfix, it wont install showing this error message: Installer encountered an error: 0x80008005 Server execution failed.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Please help, thank you!</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community and thanks for posting the question.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description provided, it looks like you are facing an issue with network after installing windows update.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following methods and then try to run the hotfix and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Check the Windows Installer Service.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, in the start search box, type Services and press Enter.<br />
b. Scroll down and find the Windows Installer.&nbsp; Double-click Windows Installer in the Services list.<br />
c. On the General tab, make sure the service is started under Service status.<br />
d. If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Place the computer in clean boot state and disable if there is any security software installed on your computer and then try to run the hotfix and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<u>Clean boot</u></span><span> will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating
 software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

<span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps from Step 3: to reset computer as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><u><span>Disable security software:</span></u></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Disable security software: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a>
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Note: If you have to temporarily disable security software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Note: If the issue still persists then I would recommend you to uninstall and re-install the Network drives and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Yeah, these forums are absolutely laughable and pathetic. The solution which was suggested to me is to go to Internet Options and delete your cookies. So far it has remedied the situation, but I'm sure the website programmers will tweak something else soon
 enough which will as well be a hassle to overcome.</p>

<p>There are no obvious benefits for you upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit to be honest. You are better off sticking with 32 bit Windows 7 based on your specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of
 RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things
 like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit
 Windows 7.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem
 in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if you decide to move to Windows 7 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>If you still decide to switch, at least backup your installation before attempting the migration:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can download the corresponding 64 bit edition using the Heidoc instructions then use the same product key used to install and activate 32 bit Windows 7 on your system.</p>

<p>Hello Emanuel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. We understand you purchased the game pass for PC but it is not showing on your account. In this regard it would be best to request a call from support. As they will be able to look into the account and see what subscriptions
 are active. As the game pass for PC is a totally separate subscription than game pass for console or Xbox live. Ultimate game pass combines all three subscriptions into one.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>When you go to
</span></span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Contact
 Us,</span></span></a><span><span>follow these steps to request a call from support:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Step 2 ----select see other options then subscription changes</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Step 3-----select show contact options</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>Step
 4 ----select request call from support</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to help
 you. Note that these options regularly change so just keep selecting something that gives request a call from support as a contact option.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi George Helmer<br />
<br />
I do not know of a way to get the comments of a File or Folder, however you can do the following.&nbsp; If my suggestions do not help you resolve this issue/question, you may want to Visit the links below for XP Support. This Forum provides support for Windows Vista
 - thank you.<br />
<br />
Open up a Command Prompt<br />
issue the command <strong>cd\</strong> and press the Enter key<br />
This should take you to the <strong>c:\</strong> prompt<br />
Now type in the command <strong>dir *.* /s&nbsp; &gt; filefolders.txt<br />
<br />
</strong>The above command should create a Text File named filefolders.txt <br />
The contents will look something like this: (<strong>this is just an example</strong>)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Volume in drive C has no label.<br />
&nbsp;Volume Serial Number is A842-4A3E</p>
<p>&nbsp;Directory of C:\</p>

    <title>Surface Book keyboard broke after the latest firmware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jannesalovaara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book keyboard broke after the latest firmware update&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I'm rocking the first gen Surface Book (i7, with GPU) which.. well as a hardware has always performed well.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The latest in the line of random hickups seems even more mindboggling than anything before. Aftre the latest firmware updates (System UEFI now on 91.1926.768) three keys of my keyboard have stopped registering.
 For a while MS told me that this was an hardware issue and asked me to submit it to the 700+  repair service, which I wasn't so sure about.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I google the issue a bit and found only two cases with similar symptoms. The left shift, number four key and enter have stopped registering... though not completely. If I keep pressing them for seconds to minutes
 the strokes will slowly start dripping in, like opening a faucet. As if I keep punching them, they all slowly start to function like normally, but as soon as I stop, they completely die down again.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">What's even more random with this, clearly a software flaw is, that when I press both shifts, right and left down, I can bang out exclamacion marks out of the number four key like no worries, and two shifts
 down the enter key gives me capital X's. Having both shifts down, every key stroke registers, so I'm still quite not convinced this is a hardware problem.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Also: pressing left shift four and five = 50, they drop in at the same time, like 50 had it's own button. Pressing left shift, four and 6 seems to be up-arrow,
 8 key gives 8+ when holding left shift + four down.. Cant seem to reason out the logic here.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">MS support suggested I do a downgrade, which I did by downloading the original firmware from MS site and restored the system to. Unfortunately this method did not downgrade the BIOS/UEFI, from which this error
 seems to stem. I've booted the SB to UEFI and even there the error repeats, I can get fours out of my four-key but I can get !'s with no problems with the two-shift-method. According to MS support the downgrade should have also downgraded the BIOS, which it
 didn't, as even with the oldest available firmware the System UEFI remained the same December 17 version.</p>

<p>I've found the same problem -- the entire device is effectively useless now except in an incomprehensible "tablet mode."&nbsp; The keyboard in device manager has an orange triangle and no matter what I do I can't force it to use any drivers.&nbsp; It reports that
 it found a USB driver for the keyboard but errors out (that message in the next paragraph).&nbsp; &nbsp; There are several other HID "vendor defined devices" that are showing up under "Other devices" with the painfully-clearly-named "Surface Keyboard."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find an event for it back in November for some reason that lists the driver as input.inf -- some generic device driver that lives in about 400 places due to the way Microsoft scatters files everywhere.&nbsp; Navigating the driver
 update to c:\windows\inf, c:\windows\system32\driverstore and even finding everything from c:\ down still errors out saying "Windows encountered a problem installing the drivers for your device. USB Input Device.&nbsp; The system cannot find the file specified."&nbsp;
 It's as if it's finding the proper files but can't install them for the device after they're located for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the latest insanely large 870 MB set of drivers from the support page and installed ... still nothing.&nbsp; I'm thinking they've enumerated the device incorrectly in the firmware update and now it doesn't match what the driver thinks it should see.&nbsp;
 My guess is that it only affects some of the early hardware with a specific device ID and no one at Microsoft cares because the aren't thousands of people screaming about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm seeing in way of events is (open device manager, navigate to other devices, surface keyboard, right+click then properties, events tab)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_07CD\6&amp;3a757ee&amp;0&amp;4 was configured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver Name:&nbsp; null</p>
<p>Class Guid: {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}</p>
<p>
</p><p>while the events dating back to November 2017 shows this:<br />
</p>
<p>Device USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_07CD\6&amp;3a757ee&amp;0&amp;4 was started.&nbsp;<br />
Driver Name: input.inf<br />
Class Guid:&nbsp; {745A17A0-74D3-11D0-B6FE-00A0C90F57DA}<br />
Service: HidUsb<br />
</p>
<p>I would really love to see someone actually respond to this.&nbsp; It's looking like someone really mangled the update.<br />

<p>Unofrtunately this did not work for me. I've done a clean isntall of my system, both from the MS boot-files and per one of the latest suggestions as a "Fresh start" under the System Health options. So all I get is an errror message with the rollback, as
 there seems to be no file nor driver to roll back to and I have no idea how to downgrade the UEFI files. This is specifically something I asked Microsoft to assist me with but seems like none of them even knew how to do it. That it how to downgrade UEFI system
 versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion still! I'll keep fighting with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was able to uninstall the Security Update KB4074588 using the solution provided at the link above, which seems to have solved the issue for me. Thanks for this info SkyMaestro. I did have to preform the uninstall twice to get it to work however?</p>

I have just experienced the same problem and decided to "repair" Windows Live Essentials and discovered this overcame the problem but only for a short time. After doing this 3 days running I got fed up and started looking at other software. Then, by chance,
 I discovered that when I had the problem, I would close WLM and after restarting it would work for a short while. So long as I keep closing and opening the program I can acheive the changes or deletions to the contacts list. Appalling but possibly easier than
 moving everything to another program.

            <p>I have this problem too, but often even when I'm trying to save .com and .edu addresses. &nbsp;Very frustrating. &nbsp;My contacts go back several generations of Live Mail but it's only a couple of hundred contacts. &nbsp;I'm now using Windows 10 and did not previously
 have the problem. &nbsp;Now it's intermittent.. &nbsp;Hope you can help.</p>

            <em>I've hightlighted areas of concerns&nbsp;to perform reinstallation of windows XP.</em>
System Restore
If you reinstall Windows XP, all existing restore points are removed and a new system checkpoint restore point is created after the reinstallation is completed.
<strong>Do not perform a reinstallation if you may have to use System Restore to restore your computer to a previous state.</strong> For more information, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/301224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">301224</a>&nbsp;
<span>(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/301224/ ) </span>System Restore "restore points" are missing or deleted
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Prerequisites
Before you start, have your Windows installation CD and the product key available. Without these, you cannot reinstall Windows.
<strong>If Windows was preinstalled on your computer, contact the computer manufacturer for help in obtaining the Windows installation files and product key.
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
If Windows XP was preinstalled on your computer, view the following article before you continue with reinstallation:

<span>(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/312369/ ) </span><strong>You may lose data or program settings after reinstalling, repairing, or upgrading Windows XP
</strong></div>
<strong>Note</strong> If Windows XP was preinstalled on your computer, you may not have the Repair option that you may require during the reinstallation process.
<strong>Contact your computer manufacturer to make sure that you have the installation CD for a repair install.</strong></div>

<h2>            error code&#58; 0xc00000e9 upgrading from WIndows 8.1 to 10</h2>
                    <p>Firstly the background...<br />
<br />
years ago I was running windows 7 32bit on a sata 3.5" drive. A while later I added an SSD, new RAM and installed Windows 8 64 bit ont the SSD from DVD. I can't remember all the specifics but since then it always gave me the dual boot option. I may or may not
 have deleted some Windows 7 OS files to gain HDD space on the 3.5" drive, not sure.<br />
<br />
When 8.1 came out, I upgraded to 8.1 with no issues.<br />
<br />
Today I wanted to upgrade to Windows 10. I went to the microsoft site page for upgrading to Windows 10. It downloaded a small file and I executed it. It brought up a little pop up about windows update with a button to "restart" so I did so. At the time I also
 had a USB 320GB HDD plugged into one of the USB ports. After the BIOS did it's startup routine, the USB HDD started beeping and flashing it's green LED instead of a solid green it normally gets when powered by USB. The monitor was also black. I left it for
 a few minutes but it continued to beep with the monitor still black. So I unplugged the USB drive and then left the computer. A few minutes later, I got the error message<br />
<br />
Recovery<br />
<br />
Your PC couldn't start properly<br />
<br />
An unexepected I/O error has occurred.<br />
<br />
Error Code: 0xc00000e9<br />
<br />
The problem can happen when a removable storage advice is removed while it's in use or is failing. Properly connecting any removable storage and restarting your PC may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
I tried plugging the USB HDD back in again and pressing 'Enter to try again' and then got this error<br />
<br />
Recovery<br />
<br />
Your PC needs to be repaired<br />
<br />
The operating system couldn't be loaded because the kernel is missing or contains errors.<br />
File: \Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe<br />
Error Code: 0xc00000e9<br />
<br />
Whilst the error was on screen, I tried "Enter to try again" and got the same error. I then tried 'F8 Startup settings' then got the same error again. I tried the 'F9 to use a different operating system' but got the same error again.<br />
<br />
I used my Windows 8.1 Laptop to create a USB recovery disk. I booted from that disk and tried to boot into Safe mode. It wouldn't do it. I then tried the 'Automatic Repair' option but that failed as well. After that I tried following this technote<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/windows-81-wont-load-error-code-0xc0000221/a3941270-86bd-49a5-809e-7916687d730e<br />
<br />
and after following method 2 I had something strange - as I was following the four commands -
</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Bootrec /fixmbr</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Bootrec /fixboot</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Bootrec /scanos</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Bootrec /rebuildbcd<br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">During the "Bootrec /scanos" command it said 1 installation of Windows detected so I applied it to that, but that drive letter was a bit funny ie was listed as drive letter "I" (for India - not lower case l for lima)
 - I don't have a drive "I" on my pc. The same thing happened for "/rebuildbcd" as well, but both completed successfully. After that finished, I changed to drive "I" and ran DIR to see what drive it was</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">,
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">upon which I found that it was my older 3.5" drive with the Windows 7 installation on it. I tried changing drive letters in order from A: through to J: but my SSD with windows 8.1 didn't show up</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I tried rebooting again and got the same ntoskrnl kernel error above. After trying 'F8' I got this error below.<br />
<br />
</span><strong>Recovery</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>An unexepected I/O error has occurred.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>File: \WINDOWS\system32\winload.exe</strong><br />
<strong>Error Code: 0xc00000e9</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The problem can happen when a removable storage advice is removed while it's in use or is failing. Properly connecting any removable storage and restarting your PC may fix this problem.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried 'Enter' 'F8' and 'F9' with no results. Upon rebooting during startup, the BIOS detects the SSD. I'd prefer not do a "refresh" if possible as downloading all my installed programs again will take a signficantly long time. What do you recommend?<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Shuts Down Unexpectedly Showing Low Battery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Shuts Down Unexpectedly Showing Low Battery</h2>
                    <p>It has been less than a month since I got my new Surface Pro 3. However, I am currently going through the nagging doubts: "Should I return this device" due to this issue. It appears that when I open up my surface, the battery will show about 51% remaining.
 Assured by this fact, I continue to do my work until- without notice of low battery- the surface shuts down after 15 minutes of usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's going on? Is the battery notification not functioning properly? And is anyone having this same issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra details:</p>
<p>I charge my device 100% and turn it off to use it again within 12 hours. This problem hasn't happened before but it seems like the power is being drained, or the surface isn't aware of the percentage of battery it has left.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Joey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your contribution to the Surface Community, I really appreciate it! I'm very sorry to hear that your Surface Pro 3 shuts down although the display shows 51% of battery left. That must be extremely inconvenient and I'd love to work
 with you to resolve the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, do you have all Windows updates?</li><li>Please look at the icon list in this website: do you see the one that shows "The battery is critically low"?</li><li>What is your Surface usage pattern like? Do you have a lot of processor heavy apps running?</li><li>Does the number of percentage actually drop, or does it stay at the same number?</li></ul>
<p>I'd suggest trying a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-pro-wont-turn-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>:&nbsp; Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:&nbsp; Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button on your Surface at the same time for at least 15 seconds, and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>:&nbsp;After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>:&nbsp;Press and release the power button on your Surface to turn it back on.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Does NOT Recognize My Integrated NVIDIA Graphics Card</h2>
                    <p>Computer: Alienware M17X</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 Ultimate 64-bit</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.80GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 6Gb</p>
<p>GPU: Integrated NVIDIA GeForce 9400M GT</p>
<p>HDD: DDR3 SS 1Tb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried installing drivers, none that support the card recognize it. It's not displayed under Display Adapters in Device Manager, nor BIOS. The PC is very very slow when playing any HD video and is only getting an average of 5FPS during games which is extremely
 frustrating. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you download the drivers from Nvidia website or from the Alienware website?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur due to driver incompatibility or missing updates. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>

enter</strong>.<br />

- Follow the On screen instructions. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</span></p>

</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Uninstall and Reinstall the Graphics card Drivers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press Windows Logo + X keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Device Manager from that list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Expand Display Adaptor, right click on the driver it and then select Uninstall. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: Delete the driver software for this device you may select that and then remove the incompatible/corrupted

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning to change the whole system in the church I attend.</p>
<p>Does anyone know is there any discount or free windows licence for church usage?</p>
<p>

            A church would be recognized as a non-profit which would at least entitle you to a significant discount. See for more details how that might be available to you:
