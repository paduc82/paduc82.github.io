    <title>Updated ACEEXCL.DLL causing Word&#47;Excel 2010 Merge - Error has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silentmonkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updated ACEEXCL.DLL causing Word&#47;Excel 2010 Merge - Error has occurred&#58; External table is not in the expected format.</h2>
                    <p>I have a customer who is having issues with Word/Excel 2010 Mail Merge.&nbsp;They have an Excel sheet containing a table and a word template (dotx) referring to the table. Both of these files are in the same network share. The merge works fine until two users&nbsp;create
 a document&nbsp;using&nbsp;the template at the same time. When this happens, the last user to open the file receives the message box "Error has&nbsp;occurred: External table is not in the expected format". If the file is closed on the first client then the second can successfully
 open it. The client is running Windows 7 X64 with 32bit versions of&nbsp;Office Home and Business. The users only have read access to the shared folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to diagnose this problem I've created a simple virtual environment with a 2008 Domain controller and two X64 Win 7 pro machines with 32bit office. I then copied their files onto a network share on the DC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially everything worked and I was <strong>not</strong> able to reproduce the problem. I then applied the Office updates. Following that I could reliably reproduce the problem. With the template document open on one machine the error occurred as soon
 as I open the document on the other. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually trace the problem to KB2687423. With One machine running with all patches applied and the other with none. Open the document on the patched machine and then try and open the document on the unpatched machine and it will open and merge successfully.
 However, If I repeat the test with just KB2687423 applied to the second machine the error occurs.&nbsp;I've eventually traced the problem to the ACEEXCL.DLL in the c:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Office14 folder. If I apply all patches to both machines
 and then replace the ACEEXCL.DLL with the original version 14.0.6015.100 all works as expected. Any later version and we get the error when two people open&nbsp;the&nbsp;document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously replacing the file with an earlier version is not recommended. Does any one know of another, supportable, workaround? Am I missing something? Is there anything else I need to configure for sharing?</p>

            <p>Hi Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you appreciate it takes time to test these things so marking the question as answered is a bit premature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to you first two questions was actually in my first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No. In my test environment the only software installed is Windows 7 SP1 with Office 2010 Pro SP1 from MSDN media. That is the only software installed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Yes.&nbsp; As per my question "In order to diagnose this problem I've created a simple virtual environment with a 2008 Domain controller and two X64 Win 7 pro machines with 32bit office. I then copied their files onto a network share on the DC."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that with KB2687423 installed The&nbsp;error occurs when the second machine opens the template document while the first still has it open. I can also confirm that replacing the ACEEXCL.DLL with the original SP1 version&nbsp;14.0.6015.100 version fixes
 the problem. I conclude therefore, that the problem was introduced with KB268723. I can provide a simple set of test files if needed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now read the other thread&nbsp;referenced above and can confirm that the DDE method works without this error. However, this is not a suitable workaround as using DDE causes Excel to launch locally and opens the merged spreadsheet in its own window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please unmark this as answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            What type of email account(s) do you have configured in Outlook?  IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  
<br />
<br />Does the status bar always say offline? It can take a few seconds or so  for it to go back online - on occasion, i need to switch folders for it to switch - but as long as the icon is not highlighted, its online or going into online ode. 
<br />
<br />The icon won't change - its either highlighted or not, the red X is always present (it's a common misconception that the red x means its still offline - which tells me it was  poor icon choice.)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94e704c9-723f-4bc4-86fe-aa029f8a9ac2?upload=true" />

<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Lumia 1520 on developer preview of 8.1 update 1. </p>
<p>I got a message saying I hadn't backed up for a long time and noticed my backups were not finishing. I got the message "There was a problem backing up your settings. Try again later." I tried again and see it gets stuck at 97% before showing the message.
 I deleted my last backup per Windows Phone twitter support and tried again. Same thing. I tried on two different wifi networks and my cellular carriers 4G signal, but same result. I was then directed to this forum and read to try with text backups turned off.
 Tried that, no change. </p>
<p>Any thoughts? I'm a bit nervous now that I don't have a backup at all.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also notice that this happen when you have Simple Calendar as your live tile as well. From my deduction, I believe that any app that allows you to backup &amp; restore settings will prevent you from successfully backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i did this time around was to uninstall Simple Calendar &amp; install it back. After that, I was successful in backing up my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Official answer: Nothing can be done about it. The first guy at Microsoft made a suggestion that didn't end up working. The second guy kept me on the phone for 40 minutes before letting me know that someone will be calling me in two days to help me resolve
 the issue. The third guy called and said nothing can be done.</p>
<p>So there is your official answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution: buy keynote. It works great and is only $20.</p>

    <title>mouse-over in MSProject 2016 gantt chart graphics - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alonbendavid  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse-over in MSProject 2016 gantt chart graphics</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>I'm missing the mouse-over information in my project plan (MSP 2016 professional) when I hover over the task bar or the predecessor arrow in the graphical area of the Gantt chart view.</p>
<p>I was used to see the main information of the task or dependencies here in my old MSP version and it's really important to see those instead of scrolling through the whole plan to find the start and end of a dependency.</p>
<p>Is there any new hidden setting for this?</p>
<p>thanks for any suggestion</p>
<p>best</p>

            The question on the link you gave does not match with mine.. He seems to have a systematic problem with the software.. But for me most of the album art is there and its correct.. But some tracks (like my own songs that I record) need album art.. A few
 have incorrect album art.. It was pretty easy with Windows Media Player, so I just wanted to know if there is a similarly easy way in Groove..

Make sure your ribbon isn't collapsed.&nbsp; We've seen this occur when the ribbon is collapsed.

            there is always a chance that&nbsp;things&nbsp;can go wrong. it is always recommended to update to the latest firmware update released for your phone. i have done dozens of updates via NSU and FOTA on my various phones and they have been just fine with one exception.
 so chances are pretty good that you will be fine while updating. make sure that your components nokia&nbsp;software&nbsp;updater and nokia pc suite are the most recent releases and that you are not doing anything else on your computer while updating.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>depending on the firmware already installed I would recommend a thorough forum search if you will benefit from the new firmware or if there are new bugs introduced. The FW 31.0.0.15 e.g. has 2 nasty bugs (snooze-bug, date-forward-bug).</p>

            <p>After installing win 10, the pin sign in option disappeared even on a local account (regular sign in). Neither the pin sign-in option nor picture password works. Lots of glitches in windows 10. Non-insiders shouldn't be obliged to provide a feedback to alert
 Microsoft to fix the glitch. They should already have figured this out before they released it in final build.</p>

    <title>Security code and software update Nokia 3210 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don123---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Security code and software update Nokia 3210</h2>
                    I have a Nokia 3210 for which I lost the security code and entered too many wrong attempts. Thus I gather the ph must be reset/reflashed or something at a Nokia service centre.<br />
<br />
I read on this site about Do It Yourself software upgrade and see that restores security code to 12345. That should solve my problem.<br />
<br />
However I'd appreciate help with 3 problems:<br />
1. How do I identify which Nokia cable I need to connect my PC to the 3210? Or can I get a non-Nokia one or make my own?<br />
2. It seems I need to know the software version in my 3210. But I can't enter *#0000# in the ph because it is asking for the security code. Any workaround for that?<br />
3. I checked the site for available software upgrade for 3210 (model ID is 0504711). Site then replied "Enter valid product code". Does this mean there is no software available? I actually don't want updated software, what is in the ph now is fine. Any solution
 to that?<br />
<br />
I actually have three 3210s and a heap of batteries, accessories etc so it is worth my while to try to solve this (cheaply). Though new to flashing ph software, I am ok on PC use and soldering circuits, so I'd like to fix this DIY.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.

            Im afraid to say, there is no easy cheap way of getting these rest.<br />
Yes the NSU is good for resetting phones, but they have to be in a working mode to begin with, and with the sec code in place that will halt the process pretty fast.<br />
You need a Nokia Care Point to do these for you as they use different equipment that normal people cant get hold of.<br />
You can find your nearest NCP at the <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4228006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Store Locator</a><br />
<br />
You might have further problems as you will probably need proof of purchase to prove they are not stolen(hence the need for security codes) and once you have got those, they will charge you a pretty penny for it too.

            UPDATE: I've solved my own problem. With further research I heard about the Nokia Mastercode - derived from IMEI. I got the Mastercode for each 3210 from the calculator on
<a href="http://www.lur.nu." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.lur.nu.</a> The Mastercode works and I've reset security code to 12345. I'm amazed at such a simple solution, after hearing about special cables etc.

<p>Hi, I'm using Windows CE 6.0 on a portable scanner. I ran IE to enter my website but it can't save my login and password. I wonder if anyone could tell me if there's another version of IE or if I can use other browsers which support memorizing password information?</p>

<h2>            Picture Format Tools Not Appearing after Windows Update</h2>
                    I have Microsoft Office 2010 for Home &amp; Business. After the recent Windows 8.1 update, some of my picture format tools are not appearing. Crop to Shape and Remove Background. These are tools I have used regularly in Word before the update.&nbsp;

</div>
<div>As far as I can tell, Word is not running in Compatibility Mode. All new documents are saved as .docx</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried running a repair on Microsoft Office but it did not fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried .jpg and .png images and the formatting tools I need still don't show up.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Any ideas?</div>

    <title>How can I have Excel copy rows from multiple workbook worksheets into - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derrek davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I have Excel copy rows from multiple workbook worksheets into a single management worksheet report&#63;</h2>
                    I have a file folder with several buyer workbooks where they enter data about the projects they are working on into Sheet 1. &nbsp;All of the worksheets have the same column structure. &nbsp;What I need help with is to have Excel go to each of these workbooks, to
 Sheet 1 and copy the row information in them (up to the first empty row) into a single worksheet in another workbook for a management report. &nbsp;The management report worksheet has the same column structure as well. &nbsp;For example:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Buyer 1 Workbook</div>
<div>Sheet 1</div>
<div>Row 1</div>
<div>Row 2</div>
<div>Row 3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Buyer 2 Workbook</div>
<div>Sheet 1</div>
<div>Row 1</div>
<div>Row 2</div>
<div>Row 3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>End Product:</div>
<div>Management Report Workbook</div>
<div>Sheet 1</div>
<div>Buyer 1, Row 1</div>
<div>Buyer 1, Row 2</div>
<div>Buyer 1, Row 3</div>
<div>
<div>Buyer 2, Row 1</div>
<div>Buyer 2, Row 2</div>
<div>Buyer 2, Row 3</div>
</div>
<div>etc...</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the number of workbooks to consolidate from is not very large, then you may refer to my solution at this link -

<h2>            Revert to WP8.1 from Windows mobile 10</h2>
                    <p>I've tested wm10 on my 1520 (RM-937, product code 059V309) and want to return back to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I installed Windows Phone Recovery Tool, but it failed to download latest 8.1 firmware: it stops&nbsp;in the middle of download (approx. 900 MB done), with no progress&nbsp;after&nbsp;a few dozens retries. Internet connection was fine.</p>
<p>This what I get while downloading on every retry.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/125d0fbb-ba79-4f2b-8cb1-8b56f079e059" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I installed Lumia Software Recovery Tool, it failed to download firmware&nbsp;likewise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I managed to download older firmware, put it in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Packages\Products\RM-937 folder and disconnected from internet, to make LSRT flush this older firmware. Failed again - LSRT cannot flush my 1520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the problem is to download <strong>RM937_02540.00019.15053.26005_RETAIL_prod_signed_205_01BA16_000-RU.ffu</strong> file, WPRT &amp; LSRT can download only half of it. Can anybody provide me a link for this file, so I can use a download manager to get it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here, this file fails do download completely:</p>

            First, make sure you run the latest version of the tool, then clear out any older files form the tmp folder. The suggestion to try the
<a href="http://download.fds-ncom.nokia.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/NokiaSoftwareRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Recovery Tool</a>&nbsp;is not unreasonable, it could be that the latest version of the Lumia tool somehow does not work for you, it certainly would not hurt to try and it beats spending money on a repair, if you can get that done under warranty (ie., get lucky
 there) as you obviously did void your warranty.

                    How do I change the time for the Skype app on my laptop? It shows a different timezone different from where I am. My phone has the Skype app as well but it has the correct time. Thank you.

            Hi  QueenKara
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows are you running Skype on?
<br />
<br />The timezone is ultimate dependent on the system wide time zone if you are running Windows 10.
<br />
<br />If its correct in Windows, you might need to reinstall Skype. 
<br />
<br />Try uninstall then reinstall Skype to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 8 or earlier, open Control Panel &gt; Programs and features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

<h2>            Firefox 33&#43;</h2>
                    <p>Windows Tech Preview keeps hanging when I run versions of Firefox greater that v32, After a while I get a script not responding error then Windows just hangs and I have to force power down to get things working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried the 64bit Nightly version of Firefox, but Windows still hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the current ESR of Firefox (31.2.0) seems to work without the hanging.</p>

            <p>I was using Firefox 36 (64bit) Nightly yesterday with no issue, but this morning from a fresh power on I used it for about 17 minutes the went away for a while, when I came back I had the script no responding error and had to force power off again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now gone back to Firefox 31.2.0 (32bit) ESR and the script error has not surfaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not related to 32/64bit as the 32bit beta also hung Windows 10 solid.</p>

            <p>It's not any site in particular as I have the same pinned tabs on all versions of FF I have tried and it does&nbsp; not lock up when launching FF or opening a new tab, it seem to be either a timed event or when FF is idle for a while.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That&nbsp;option is not available on&nbsp;Skype for Windows 10. But if you are using new Skype for Android, you should be able to send a message to someone who added you on Skype. Kindly check if there is an available update for your Skype app on your android. Also,
 please provide the version of your android and your Skype app. I will wait for your updates.</p>

<p>Hi @Kenneth_F, thanks for your reply. The version of my Skype app on Android is:&nbsp;8.28.0.41. There are no updates available at this time.</p>
<p>As for being able to send a message, there are no options either from the Android app or from the Windows 10 version. I received a request to connect from an individual I don't know, and we have no connections in common. The options I have are: add to favourites,
 block contact, call contact, delete conversation, mark unread, view profile. The view profile has an option to send a message, but when I tap on it, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Default signatures are being overridden by exchange account signature</h2>
                    I use outlook 2011 and have an exchange address plus one through a separate provider and linked into entourage through a POP.....I have set up different signatures for each account and also ensured that the correct signature is the default for each account.

<div>Unfortunately it keeps defaulting to the exchange server signature for both accounts...how can i overcome this?</div>

<h2>            Windows Mobile Hack</h2>

<p>I installed Hotspot Shield on my Lumia 930+Windows Mobile 10. Now my question is how this program works? Because when I open VPN settings page the VPN was None and a lock icon appear on WiFi icon.</p>
<p>Do this means Windows Mobile Apps can inject into or hack the OS?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am a onenote 2007 user. Is there any way to enable macro in onenote, just as there are developer bar in the ribbon interface of Word/Excel/Powerpoint, so that I can automate<strong>repetive</strong> tasks?</p>

<p>AFAIK no help for repetitive tasks within ON. But you may look at a tool like AutoHotkey.</p>
<p>For keyboard shortcuts look at:</p>
