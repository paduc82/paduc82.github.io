<h2>            Computer crashes shuts itself off intermittently</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone and thanks for reading this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer shows a VERY quick blue screen and shuts itself off. &nbsp;It happens almost once a day but some days it has happened 4 or 5 times. &nbsp;I leave it on at night now and almost every morning, it's off. &nbsp;It displays the "start Windows normally" screen when
 you turn it on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run memtests, processor tests, and drive tests with no problems detected. &nbsp;I changed my keyboard and updated all my drivers. &nbsp;Here's the WhoCrashed report, the BlueScreenView report, and the minidump files.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me with advice to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ken</p>

</p><p><span>Please post copies of your dump files as shared files (excluding any more than one month old) to your OneDrive with a link here.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The dump file will be created at c:\windows\minidump. You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View,
 Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide
 extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is your computer make and model? If not a branded computer what is your motherboard make and model?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please download and run Driver View and upload a copy of the report it produces to your OneDrive. To get a report on all drivers select Edit, Select All followed by File, Save Selected Items.<br />
</span><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please provide a copy of your System Information file. Type System Information in the Search Box above the start Button and press the ENTER key (alternative is Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, System Information).
 Select File, Export and give the file a name noting where it is located. Do not place the cursor within the body of the report before exporting the file. The system creates a new System Information file each time system information is accessed. You need to
 allow a minute or two for the file to be fully populated before exporting a copy. Please upload to your OneDrive, share with everyone and post a link here. Please say if the report has been obtained in safe mode. The request for a copy of this file is additional
 to answering the question about make and model. </span></p>

            <p>Thank you so much, Gerry (from across the pond!). &nbsp;I really appreciate your time. &nbsp;I hope I did this right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the link to the files:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried it on another computer and it seems that it's open for viewing by anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generated the System Information File and uploaded it. &nbsp;I was not in safe mode. &nbsp;I also uploaded the Driver View report you so kindly directed me to make.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is built by me with an ASUS P8B75-M LX Plus motherboard. &nbsp;Here is a list of the major components:</p>
<p>

 it. &nbsp;I just used the onboard video. &nbsp;My goal was to build a simple, stable machine. &nbsp;I built this last spring and all seemed well. &nbsp;I occasionally had unexplained pauses but maybe crashed once. &nbsp;In November, it started shutting off. &nbsp;When I turned it back
 on it would run for about 10 minutes and shut off again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it to Best Buy (big box retailer in US) to see what they thought. &nbsp;They saw nothing wrong and suggested I replace the power cable (AC mains) from the wall. &nbsp;I did and the machine ran well for a week and then shut off again. &nbsp;I started leaving it on
 at night and noticed it would shut off 50% of the nights left on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read a post about defective power switches on cases. &nbsp;I unplugged the power switch lead from the motherboard and it ran for six days straight. &nbsp;I thought I fixed it, then it shut off again. &nbsp;I replaced the keyboard from reading another post. &nbsp;Two days
 good ..and then it shut off. &nbsp;I've connected another computer to the same outlet to make sure it's not the power from the wall and that computer stays on every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for reading this and helping.</p>

            <p>I'm going to stop singing, "Someday my Prince Will Come." &nbsp;I think he's here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GoFlex passed chkdsk and SeaTools. &nbsp;There's no new firmware or driver for it. &nbsp;I may just ditch it, if it continues to show up in the event viewer. &nbsp;Seagate used to be the king but apparently WD has ascended to the throne now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Drive 5 was the card reader on my HP OfficeJet L7590 printer. &nbsp;No way to disable it on the printer's panel, so I disabled it in Windows. &nbsp;Same for the card reader on my Epson Work Force 845. &nbsp;I never use them to read cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually had problems viewing computers on the network. &nbsp;Sometimes I had to reboot to view the names of XP workgroup computers in Windows Explorer. &nbsp;Plus I had duplicate names showing for one or two machines. &nbsp;I deleted the idstore.sst file as you'd described
 above and all is well with the duplicate names at least. &nbsp;We'll see if the "problem viewing other computers" situation arises again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Sir) Gerry, I can't thank you enough for your insight. &nbsp;I never used the event viewer to view events or application details. &nbsp;I reviewed the files you asked me to create and I see where you saw the issues. &nbsp;I've got a really good feeling about this fix.
 &nbsp;I'm hoping it works out. &nbsp;I will certainly let you know what's happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you think I did all I could. &nbsp;I want to let you know that I'm 1/8 English. &nbsp;I drink plenty of tea and I eat Carr's Table Water crackers more than most yanks. &nbsp;My wife swears by Newcastle beer (and boy does she swear when she's had 4
 or 5) and we both think Camilla is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously though, thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;You've opened a whole new world for me by describing these diagnostic techniques and I'm truly grateful.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uploaded the new files for review. &nbsp;It looks like the Seagate GoFlex still has a controller error visable on 27 March at 10:31:13 AM. &nbsp;The Seagate is now listed as Disk 3 in Disk Management. &nbsp;That would probably be the exact moment I got to my desk
 and started moving my mouse, etc. this morning. &nbsp;I'd left the computer on all night again and it was still on this morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea what the error logged for 26 March at 10:09 might indicate:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The master browser has received a server announcement from the computer DONNA that believes that it is the master browser for the domain on transport NetBT_Tcpip_{2361FA33-04C4-4356-9CE0-8D29CA476DC6}. The master browser is stopping or an election is being
 forced."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a computer named DONNA on the network and that was probably the time it was turned on yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Ken</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick reply, I have uploaded the DMP files, location = https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhJDX8Fje9SIoB9vrontdd7Gle7V</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also a bit of history.</p>
<p>The PC was working fine until about a week ago at which point it started causing problems.
</p>
<p>It would boot up as normal and then nothing would display on the screen.&nbsp; Every time I rebooted the screen would work, just before the login page it would stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Googling a bit I decided to re-install Windows 10, this worked and then the same again - screen would go off.</p>
<p>I searched the internet and then changed the monitor cable from DVI to VGA.</p>
<p>The PC now stays on beyond the login screen but now gives the ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE_MEMORY error.</p>

    <title>mouse and touchpad pointer moves but can&#39;t click windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amanda1  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse and touchpad pointer moves but can&#39;t click windows 10</h2>
                    <p>(SOLVED: SEE EDIT**)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the batteries in my wireless USB mouse died. After replacing them, I get a pointer that moves properly but I can't click on anything.</p>
<p>So I try the touchpad and it is the same. </p>
<p>I try a wired mouse and it is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Toshiba satellite laptop L455, windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried some troubleshooting and sometimes a click will work.&nbsp; But troubleshooting is difficult to impossible because i can't click, but playing around with tab and arrow keys I could try a few things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I went into device manager and removed the touchpad driver and restarted. After restart the clicking seemed to be working. I went online, opened a few tabs. On one tab, on a page I use every day, when I would click on login, suddenly the page would change
 to my home page. After a few minutes of browsing around, the mouse quit again, no clicks would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started in safe mode, it still wouldn't work. While in safe mode I managed to run a spyware scan, it found a bunch of adware I removed, but after restart still no mouse clicking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to need to go into task manager to get shutdown options, and I have noticed that once I go into task manager , clicking sometimes starts to work again, but never for long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the right click feature will work but most times it won't. Sometimes I can left click on a few things but not all things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes after shut down or restart the mouse will work for a few clicks, sometimes it doesn't work from the get go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I am running a virus scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What more can I try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Edit: SOLVED:</p>
<p>I fixed it! </p>
<p>I took the wireless mouse USB out to try it in another computer. The touchpad then started to work again.</p>
<p>It occurred to me I had reinstalled the touchpad driver, but what about the wireless mouse driver? So I plugged the usb part of the wireless mouse back into the laptop, into another USB port. Windows popped up and said it was installing a driver. Once done,
 I re-connected the mouse to it by pressing the connect button on the back of the mouse. Now all mice work properly!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I can get back to work. I will leave this question up in case it helps someone else.</p>
<p>

Trying to be able to put separate JPEGs and other video backgrounds into the green area on videos.<br />

Thanks Considerate Guy.<br />
I am amazed that MS has not yet implemented an integral Green Screen transition into its Movie Maker program.&nbsp; Without this, millions of Users are forced to implement arduous workarounds, using previous versions of 3rd party software and we have to also use
 previous editions of the MM software!&nbsp; That doesn't make sense.&nbsp; I have just suggested that MS implements this feature.&nbsp; Shouldn't be a difficult task for them.&nbsp; I guess I will have to do as you suggested above.&nbsp; I appreciate the help.<br />

            <p>Chroma-keying (green screen or blue screen) would require Movie Maker to support multiple video streams (tracks).&nbsp; It's something I've been hoping for since the Windows XP days and haven't seen it.&nbsp; Apple added such features to iMovie 2009, but Microsoft
 sees Movie Maker as a simple tool for novices to quickly get their camera video and photos into a presentable format for sharing.&nbsp;I don't think they ever intended for it to be a full on video editor with cool items like picture-in-picture, green screen, cutaways,
 etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Even in the past, it has required creative members of the community to find ways to do things with two video streams using transitions, as you have noted. So one option is to use WMM 6.0 and these
<a href="http://goo.gl/jLyuG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">custom transitions</a>.&nbsp; Otherwise, your options are to look into higher-end 3rd party video editing packages like Nero Video, Adobe Premiere Elements, Sony Vegas, Pinnacle Studio, etc.&nbsp; Or you can wait and hope...</p>

            Thanks CG.&nbsp; Looks like you're the Wiz of making WMM all it can be.&nbsp; I will definitely try the WMM 6.0 route.&nbsp; Seems like a shame that the latest and best WMM can't be used, but I guess that is MS's strategic choice.&nbsp; I think I am challenged enough just
 by the basics.&nbsp; Don't think I'll want to dabble with higher end editing software.&nbsp; Hopefully I can pull together enough neurons to do the 6.0/Shader thingee.&nbsp; I (and I am sure countless others on the Internet) am in sincere appreciation of your sharing your
 experience and smarts.&nbsp; Thanks again. <br />

            Hello CG,<br />
<br />
Say, I was able to download WMM 6.0.&nbsp; I even got my .MOD (JVC) camcorder video I shot yesterday to come up.&nbsp; However, the audio cannot be heard.&nbsp; I checked my main computer audio setting and WMM's audio settings and they seem to be at max.&nbsp; Not sure what to
 do now. <br />

            <p>Unfortunately the older versions of Movie Maker (e.g. WMM 6.0) have support for a limited number of video types.&nbsp; MOD files have always been a problem for Movie Maker.&nbsp; I believe they contain MPEG-2 video and AC3 audio.&nbsp; So the issue is probably the AC3
 audio.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a workaround, I would suggest installing Freemake Video Converter and converting the files to WMV format instead before editing.&nbsp; When you install Freemake, be sure to choose the Custom Install option so you can uncheck any add-ons you don't want.</p>

            Well... I did download FreeMake.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it does not appear to recognize the .MOD format.<br />
Before I got my current 64bit power computer, I purchased a 32 bit online downline video converter WonderShare (I think from mainland China) for about $50.&nbsp; It DID convert .MOD files, but that 32bit version isn't going to help me with the new 64 bit machine,
 so I guess I'll have to pay for the 64 bit version, instead of trying to get non-working converters for free.<br />
<br />
But thanks for your help.&nbsp; <br />

            I don't think you can really change a file type simply by renaming it.&nbsp; I remember about 2 years ago going through just about anything anyone could imagine and nothing worked to convert a .MOD file except WONDERSHARE conversion software.
<br />
<br />
And...Good news!&nbsp; I just contacted Wondershare, and explained that I previous purchased their conversion software about 2 years ago and only downloaded to my old 32 bit computer, but now I have a 64-bit computer and no records of that previous download.&nbsp; Guess
 what?&nbsp; Wondershare gave me another download link for no charge!&nbsp; And they gave me my registration information.&nbsp; So now I have Wondershare on my new computer.<br />
<br />
And even better: it handled the .MOD conversion to both a WMV and a MPEG4 in about 30 seconds.&nbsp; Great software there, and a generous company that believes that once you have paid, they support you!&nbsp; American companies could learn something from these folks.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your green screen counsel.&nbsp; Now, at last, I have versions of our video(s) that can try to use WMM 6.0 to try the green screen hocus pocus.<br />
<br />
THIS POST IS THE ANSWER FOR CONVERTING .MOD FILES TO ANY OTHER FORMAT!&nbsp; <br />

 restart doesn't help. My contacts are randomly asking why their Skype doesn't render emoji too. What's up? :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upd: when I open the list of emojis in Skype client, most of them are missing, only a few are available. Out of these few a couple can be used, the rest don't render as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            internal hard drive now recognised as removable storage&#63;</h2>
                    all was well until i updated my motherboard drivers. i have an Abit NF-M2SV (Nforce 405) and after updating the drivers (chipset, storage, etc) and my second hard drive which is SATA, has shown up in removable storage as if it were a memory stick. if i
 stop the device it tells me to now unplug it, but it is internal and the system is still on. does anyone know what may have caused this?
<br />
thanks

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
If this happened when you updated your motherboard drivers, then you need to contact your motherboard manufacturer to see if they have a fix for it.&nbsp; In the mean time, you can try restoring your system back to a point in time before you updated the motherboard
 drivers.<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, you can try rolling back the motherboard drivers, but that is very risky, so you should back up your system first.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

                    <p>Hello there. I have this serious problem with my gateway and everyone I try to contact wants money and that is something I don't have. I really really really really need help on this one before I explode with frustration. Now. The computer before this happened
 was running awfully slow and constantly crashing with blue-screens and other infuriating BS that I don't need. One day I turned it on in hi hopes of it working right but the worst has happened and this screen appears with the Status of 0xc00000e9 and I/O error.
 Now I do know that it is a booting problem or something of the sorts. Its been sitting in my desk for a while now and I desperately need it for homework when school starts. So please I do beg you to help me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to help you with this issue. We might&nbsp;need a Windows 7 disc to try the steps given below&nbsp;in case your computer does not have a Recovery partition in-built. If you do not have one try borrowing a Windows 7 disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error message: An unexpected I/O error has occurred. Status: (<strong><span>0Xc00000e9</span></strong>) is a hardware error pertaining to your system’s BIOS.&nbsp; Basically it is telling you that the computer is not able to reliably communicate with the
 hard drive.&nbsp;We can try a few steps and check if it works: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> Disconnect External Devices (USB Flash Drives/ External Hard Drives etc.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: If Startup Repair is preinstalled recovery option on your computer:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong><span>NOTE: </span></strong></em><em><span>If Repair our computer is not listed as an option, then your computer does not include Startup Repair as a preinstalled recovery option.</span></em>)</li><li><strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong>. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem and, if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.</li></ol>
<p>Refer to the link for details: </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Repair is done you can boot to the desktop. But if this fails then try Steps 1 to 5 and now select “<strong><span>System Restore</span></strong>” on the 6 Step instead of Startup Repair. &nbsp;Select a Restore point to the date before you had this problem
 and follow the steps. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-system-restore#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-system-restore#1TC=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Boot the computer in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>. (</span></strong>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that&nbsp;starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<span><span>Safe Mode</span></span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use a Safe Boot option, follow these steps: </p>
<p>a. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. </p>
<p>b. Select an option when the <strong><span>Windows Advanced Options</span></strong> menu appears, and then press ENTER.
</p>
<p>c. When the <strong><span>Boot</span></strong> menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If safe mode does not work then you can try Last Known Good Configuration and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>This error is sometimes an indication that the hard drive may be failing.&nbsp; Complete the following steps to check the integrity of your hard drive. If you are unable to get to the Advanced Boot Option menu using the F8 key, you will need to obtain a Windows
 disc.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Advanced Boot Options</span></a> menu.</li><li><strong><span>Safe Mode with command prompt</span></strong>.</li><li><strong><span>chkdsk /r </span></strong>(there is a space between <strong><span>k
</span></strong>and <strong><span>/</span></strong>)</li></ol>
<p>Once you are able to start Windows, backup all of your important data.&nbsp; Let us know if this helps.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Important: While performing Error-checking or chkdsk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found and when it tries to repair that sector, the data available on that sector might be lost.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NOTE: If none of the above steps work then my recommendation is to contact the computer manufacturer Support for help with updating BIOS.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Updating BIOS can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Hope this information was helpful. Let us know if you have any further questions.</p>

<h2>            Deleted a Windows Update Task in the Task Scheduler- Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally deleted a task underneath the "Windows Update" area of the Task Scheduler for Build 1511 (in case that is relevant) and I don't know what I need to do to replace it (or what it said at this point; I was trying to delete a trigger rather than
 the entire task when this happened). I know there are four tasks listed under the Windows Update area and the 3 that I have left are "Automatic App Update", sih, and sihboot.
</p>
<p>If someone who works for Microsoft could tell me what it is I deleted and provide an exported file of the task that I deleted, I'd appreciate it.
</p>
<p>(Otherwise if I need to manually re-create it, if you can tell me exactly what I need to re-create with screenshots of each of the sub-tabs like "triggers", "actions", that would be great.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to use a restore point to fix this but I do not have one since Microsoft deleted them after I rolled back to this version. (Dealing with Windows 10, Build 1511 in case the tasks changed by build.)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Scheduler is used by Windows to perform any tasks that are related and are necessary to the system. You can modify these tasks to fit your preferred schedule. If a task is deleted, you may create another task that is similar to the deleted one. In your
 case, we have posted screenshots that portray what you might have deleted. Kindly refer to the below screenshots:</p>

<p>Great, thank you for the screenshots! I should be able to re-create it from that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, I did notice this error when trying to import a task or alter a trigger (that is, after altering one I go to hit okay and see this): "Task Scheduler service is not available. Task Scheduler will attempt to reconnect to it." I
 looked for some basic ways to solve this issue and went through a couple of them: the scheduler is still set to automatic and is currently running, and the value for the Start DWORD related to it in the registry was a 2.
</p>
<p>Is there anything else I should try to solve this?</p>

<p>I believe the total represents the number of years of Gold account service. &nbsp;So, if you have had an active Gold account since 2006 and you move your account to a new console, the total shouldbe 7 or 8 years. &nbsp;On the other hand, if you bought a 360 in 2006,
 paid for &nbsp;a year of Gold service, then sold your 360 and only recently purchased a new one, your total may only be 1 or 2 years.</p>

    <title>&#34;User profile cannot be loaded&#34; - A reproducible bug that can - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;User profile cannot be loaded&#34; - A reproducible bug that can be caused by deleting files and unknown factors</h2>
                    <p><br />
This is a reproducible bug with widespread influences that can be caused by deleting files and some unknown factors and can lead the error message "User profile cannot be loaded".<br />
To all the apps that need to sign in with Microsoft account, it results that they all cannot sign in with any Microsoft account anyway, and "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" or "Sign in with a local account instead" will suddenly and rapidly crash
 without any error messages when working.</p>
<p><br />
Please notably note the following four points:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>1. It is a V1703 bug. </strong></p>
<p><br />
In V1507, V1511, V1607, it may also exist, but not apparent with serious and direct impacts.<br />
It apparently occurs in V1703 from build 15063.0 to the latest build 15063.540, perhaps it will continue to occur in the V1709 that is coming soon.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>2. It can be caused by deleting files, however, only deleting files cannot let it immediately occur.</strong></p>
<p><br />
This bug differs from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-winpc/two-reproducible-bugs-that-can-be-triggered-by/163e86ce-b3ca-4c97-bd39-58d7b78f8add">
the two bugs in my previous thread</a>.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
There are also some unknown factors in order to make it occur, so after deleting files, need to wait for one or two days, and then it will definitely occur. The unknown factor(s) also can be called X factor(s). I always can't figured out what the X factor(s)
 are. Windows update? Or other thing(s)? Many people also are confused at this. Maybe only the people of Microsoft can figure it out.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>3. Most people just see the partial impact of the bug when it occurs.</strong></p>
<p><br />
For examples, Some people just see that the Mail app has the problem that can't sign in with a Microsoft account when the bug occurs, such as in the following three threads:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/windows-10-getting-error-message-0x80070425-when/141f6fac-f941-448b-ac62-7d72b9169cb1">Windows 10 Getting Error Message (0x80070425) when adding account in Mail App</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/cant-add-gmail-account-to-windows-10-mail-app/97d4e308-54a8-4afe-b74f-501b1ea0fa2a?page=19">Can't add Gmail account to Windows 10 mail app</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/windows-10-getting-error-message-0x801901f4-when/02dccf6e-83ee-4370-8b27-68265256e976">Windows 10 getting error message 0x801901f4 when trying to add account in mail app</a>
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
In the following thread, the user can see that the bug's impact is covered Store and Cortana:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/error-0x80072eff-windows-10/390ff5e1-9e9d-4c93-a69a-83c865431e63">Error 0x80072EFF (Windows 10)</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
In fact, the bug's impact is covered all the apps or settings that need to sign in with Microsoft account, such as the feature of "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" or "Sign in with a local account instead" in system's "Accounts" settings, the apps
 of Store, Cortana, Mail, Calendar, Feedback Hub, OneNote and so on.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
You know, in Windows 7 there will be error messages when an app is crashing, but in Windows 10 an app could crash quickly without any error messages.<br />
In my country, people invented a word to describe the manifestation of the apps unexpectedly quiting -- shantui(閃退), means that a Windows 10 app quickly crashes without any error messages just like a flash of lightning.
<br />
When the bug occurs, to run "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" or "Sign in with a local account instead" in system's "Accounts" settings, will meet the "shantui".</p>
<p><br />
Users who ask questions in Microsoft Community or other forums simply point out the partial impacts of the bug, and the replies also only give some solutions just for the partial impacts, and the solutions are not solved for this bug after tried. ( If the problems
 are not caused by this bug, might be solved by those solutions.)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>4. Up to now, no any helpful solutions have been found for the bug.</strong></p>
<p><br />
No this bug occurs after upgraded from V1507 to V1511 to V1607, but after upgraded to V1703, found that the bug occurs.
<br />
Tried many solutions that had been searched, all didn't work.<br />
In the latest build 15063.540, the bug still hasn't been fixed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>

After running the above two batch files to delete the files and folders, <strong>
it is not immediately possible to see that the bug occurs, need to wait for one or two days, waiting for the mysterious and unknown X factors to work</strong>.<br />
What is the X factor(s)? <br />
May be that 'Windows Update' is running? May be that 'Downloads and updates' in Store is running?
<br />
To me, really don't know what it is, really isn't immediately possible to say what it is.</p>
<p><br />
To the above two batch files, one of them Delthem.bat is mentioned in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_files-insiderplat_pc/delete-some-unnecessary-folders-and-files-by/ae6ecc75-cfbb-4f29-b196-c0de1af256ed">
a previous thread of mine</a>, and now it is a reduced edition;<br />
in fact, previously, I was always running them, always OK, never lead to meet the bug, until updated to V1703.<br />
To someone else, some other things may have caused the bug's occurring; <br />
to me, after running the above two batch files, and then wait for several days, always can see the bug's occurring.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>How to determine whether the bug occurred?</strong></p>
<p><br />
Press <strong>Windows Logo Key + I</strong> --&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> --&gt; <strong>
Accounts</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the current account is a Microsoft account, click on "<strong>Sign in with a local account instead</strong>";
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8d00e70-2c83-4d04-96e9-b9ae2801f861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8d00e70-2c83-4d04-96e9-b9ae2801f861" /></a></p>
<p><strong>or</strong>, if the current account is a local account, click on "<strong>Sign in with a Microsoft account instead</strong>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4922800a-4260-40c0-a282-cf0b907890bd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4922800a-4260-40c0-a282-cf0b907890bd" /></a></p>
<p>Then the dialog box window of the account settings' wizard within the prompt of "<strong>Just a moment...</strong>" pops up,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/505741d5-ba39-47b0-96e9-d89861472579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/505741d5-ba39-47b0-96e9-d89861472579" /></a></p>
<p>then wait for <strong>the progress spinning circle </strong><strong>of dots is rotating several times</strong>,<br />
<strong>suddenly, it rapidly crashes and disappears without any error messages, just vanishes without a trace</strong>...</p>
<p><br />
This is that the bug has occurred.</p>
<p><br />
To all the apps that need to sign in with Microsoft account, <strong>it results</strong> that they
<strong>all cannot sign in with any Microsoft account anyway</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
After the bug occurred, each app's error message dialog box is as same as the following prompt:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Something went wrong</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Please try again later.</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>0x801901f4</strong></p>

</p><p>Previously, I was always running these two batch files, always OK, never lead to meet the bug, until updated to V1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The users' anger and disappointment to this bug, was very obvious and not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, a friend of mine stopped using Win10 and then went back to switch using Win7.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Now in the latest build 15063.632, the bug still hasn't been fixed by Microsoft.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that the bug would be brought into the new version V1710 which&nbsp;will be released on next month.</p>

</p><p>Hello Melerix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you&nbsp;so much for this posting. I tried a ton of other recommendations, but only&nbsp;your help&nbsp;finally solved my problem (no updates on freshly installed Windows 8.1). I had to install one other&nbsp;manual update though (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3021910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3021910</a>).</p>

            You are a genius! I have battled this issue for a week, trying everything under the sun. I cannot believe I have gone to such measures, when the answer was as simple as you laid out - worked like a champ! Thank you ever so much. I find it odd that with
 5 tablets (4 running Win8.1), this issue only happened on one of them. But, I feel like I won the lottery today, finding your resolution. Thanks again.<br />

<h3> patrickhertel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skypeforlinux is broken</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am currently using 8.11.0.4 because newer versions do not find my webcam (HD PRO C90) despite it's being on the supported list.
</p>
<p>I don't know about the newer versions but the incoming audio starts to break up after a while and there is a "bad connection" message. I had the same problem with a slightly newer version which is no longer available in the archive.</p>
<p>The "bad connection" has no effect on video or outgoing audio. </p>
<p>My connection is 10/100.</p>
<p>I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit</p>
<p>Memory 32 GB</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-5930K CPU @ 2.50Ghz x 12</p>
<p>Geforce GTX 980</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only conclude that the problem lies with Skypeforlinux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No such problem occurs when on a&nbsp; Windows 8.1 laptop although (quelle surprise) it does not detect the laptop webcam so I have to plug in the C90 ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I could use the old 4.3 ... say what you want. It worked.</p>

    <title>NASCAR Heat, Hmmm....... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fatt47  say:</h3>
<h2>            NASCAR Heat, Hmmm.......</h2>
                    
<p>So the latest info I can find in regard to game features is this:</p>
<p>Three forms of racing rooms or lobbies.</p>
<p>For my needs as a dedicated Wheel Racer I would probably only be interested in the 3rd feature, Hosted.</p>
<p>I'm hoping the Hosted feature will at least give us the option of setting the guidelines for what I consider the most fun and fair way to enjoy a racing game. A Spec Race format with "No Setups and No Upgrades Allowed" sets an atmosphere of fair and competitive
 racing where skill and accountability rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are other Wheel Racers out there who are interested in this form of racing and depending on how good this new game turns out to be let me know here so I can move forward with sharing my Spec Race format with you.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No Rules:</b>&nbsp;If you’re a beginner just looking to learn, bump, and crash (or you just want to bump and crash), the No Rules lobby is for you. This is a great place to practice, try things out, or just have a good time with friends.
</li><li><b>Normal:</b>&nbsp;For players who want to test their skills but are still looking for a good, clean, and friendly race.
</li><li><b>Hosted:</b>&nbsp;This lobby is for people who are more serious about racing. Race hosts will have the option to decide which level of player can join the race session. For example, if the host only wants racers level 5 or higher, he or she can set that parameter
 when creating the session. In addition, hosts have the right to boot players from their game.
</li></ul>

<p>Why there was the need to add a character creator in this game I have no idea, when will a created racer ever be seen?</p>
<p>From the recent trailer released it resembles the attempt by EA in their last golf game,, ugly results that discourages anyone with a creative feel.</p>
<p>Maybe before the game comes out they'll add some robotic fans cheering on the sidelines, no doubt that is a much needed addition LOL</p>
<p>These kinds of features are nothing but unneeded performance drags that come across (at least to this serious racer) as silly bells and whistles but I guess they serve as chum for some, &nbsp;in reality though they only lessen the replay value and quality of
 a game IMO.</p>

<h2>            NAT type open on 360 but Strict on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>How do i fix this? I'm still able to join parties and play with friends just fine on my Xbox One but it says my NAT type is strict. My ISP is a local fiber optic telecom that you've never heard of so I won't bother mentioning who they are. Running a wired

<p>Have you configured any portforwardings on your router for the 360? If so please disable them as the One needs basically the same ports, so if they are already in use by the 360 they cannot be used by the One and lead you to a strict NAT there.
</p>
<p>Also please take a look at the ports opened by UPnp and erase them for the same reason.
</p>
<p>To provide you more help on your problem it is absolutely necessary to know what router you are using and what you have configured already.
</p>
<p>Also it is important to know if you have had this problem from the beginning of if it just happened out of a sudden.

<p>The modem is a Smart RG made by clear access. I can't do port forwarding on my own. My ISP has control of it since they supply it to the customer. I've had to configure settings in my 360 a couple of years ago while on the phone with my ISP tech. guy. If
 I disable or undo any of my settings in my 360 won't the 360 go back to saying strict?</p>

<p>Ok, so for now just leave the 360 untouched but disconnected. </p>
<p>Are you connected directly to your modem then or is there a hub / switch / router in this chain?
</p>
<p>If you say you can do nothing on portforwardings and stuff and had to configure this by your isp for the 360 already this may be the same for the one. So please phone your isp on this and let them configure it for you again. Just be aware that the one needs
 some more ports than the 360.</p>

<h2>            Do I need a gold membership to download the Season Pass&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I don't have a gold membership and I was looking to download the Season Pass for Assassins Creed 4 today. I realize that I obviously won't get the full experience with the multiplayer content, but do I need to have it to enjoy the extra single player content?
 Someone give me an answer as soon as possible. Thank you.</p>

<p>You don't need gold to get the season pass and download the single player content, I did the same with AC3. You will need to activate your Uplay passport code that came with the game, and when you download the content you have to do it through the in-game
 "additional content" menu. At the moment there isn't much available, I think just the Kraken pack that has a sail, figurehead and wheel for your ship. Eventually season pass holders should get most or all of the preorder dlc, as well as the Adawale short story
 and there's a mention in that menu about a pack that has Altair's and Ezio's swords and some more decorations for the Jackdaw. You should check out the Uplay menu as well and access that menu from other Ubisoft games that you have, with Uplay you get their
 version of achievements that give you points you can use to buy dlc. For AC4 there's a theme for your console background, a pirate costume to use in the game, and a set of swords that I'd say are the fourth best swords in the game.</p>

<p>Alright. Thank you. :) I downloaded AC3's Season Pass, so I figured it'd work the same. I have UPlay as well.</p>

    <title>Factory Recovery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Factory Recovery</h2>
                    So I have a Dell Inspiron 15R (5520, Mid 2012) and I wanted to reset it using Dell's factory recovery. The problem was, for some reason, my laptop had an ungenuine version of Win7 Professional and I wanted to go back to the genuine version of Win7 Home
 Premium that came with the laptop. I proceeded to go to "Repair My Computer" but I didn't have Dell Datasafe 2.0 to do Dell's factory image recovery. I don't even think I have the factory image. This laptop came with no disks. How do factory recover this laptop
 to go back to Win7 Home Premium and back to its factory image (I don't want to keep the files in my computer, I don't need a backup)?<br />

            The link you gave me instructs me on how to factory reset when my computer has Dell DataSafe. I don't have an option that says "Dell Factory Tools." So how would I factory reset?

<p>
</p><p>Dell Datasafe&nbsp; is irrelevant.&nbsp; If in step 9, it says something different, you want "Dell Factory Image Restore"</p>

            See, I don't have anything that has to do with Dell there. It should normally be at the very bottom, but at the very bottom I only have Command Prompt. Nothing with the word, "Dell" is there. So what should I do?
