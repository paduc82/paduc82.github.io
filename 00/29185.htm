<p>*this was meant to be a way to contact you, not go on the forums*</p>
<p>Hello Enforcement team. I was playing Xbox today and i was in a party with my friends: Uzuza , JCM Practicali , Gibby Slays , and Me, HardScopingHero .</p>
<p>Someone named' Accouchments 'joined the party, talked trash, threatened to shut our modems down and invited his friend ,' Always DDoS ' who then Joined the party. Accouchments was telling Always DDoS that he would give him God Mode on Black Ops if he kicked
 us offline.Then they were telling each other IP's and they were kicking us all offline. I wasn't able to get back on for another hour and i was even talking to a support agent who troubleshot with me and referred me to here. If someone with the Gamertag "
 Always DDoS " Isn't suspicious in the first place, i don't know what is. For the sake of my friends and I along with other Xbox Users, i bring this to you. This is not a lie and I hope you can consider how frustrating this was for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT: Clarified.</p>

<p>Hey mate, in these situations the best thing to do is report the player through the console. This is the only way the XBLPET will look into the account:

support.xbox.com/.../file-player-complaint</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also if you get DDoS the best thing to do is unplug the router for a good 5 minutes. This should ensure you get a new IP address when you plug it back in. See here for more info on DDoS attacks:

<p>You did the right thing by removing these players but there are some things which you can do to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Most routers have DoS protection settings so it's worth checking your routers manual to see how to turn these on.</p>
<p>Initiating a DDoS attack requires a great deal of resources and criminal-level access to a great deal of machines so most threats of DDoS attacks are just that, just words. Make sure you are careful about who you add to your friends list, keep your password
 secret and make sure you have turned on two-factor authentication at <a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Cannot connect to itunes store or check for updates</h2>
                    After updating to itunes 8.2.1.6, I tried to go to the itunes store and received a message that said that itunes could not connect to the itunes store.&nbsp; The network connection timed out.&nbsp; It recommended that I make sure my connections are correct.&nbsp; I am
 able to connect to the internet, so the network should not be a problem.&nbsp; I also cannot check for&nbsp;updates to itunes&nbsp;through itunes itself (although I am running the most recent version of itunes).&nbsp;To try and alleviate this problem, I have done the following:<br />
<br />
-Disabled firewall<br />
- Took itunes off the exceptions list and added it back on<br />
- Disabled Symantec anti-virus<br />
- Uninstalled and reinstalled itunes<br />
- Cleared DNS<br />
<br />
I am running Vista on a Compaq laptop.&nbsp;Here are the results of the diagnostics test on itunes:<br />

            I had the same problem, but I couldn't fix it. Then, my internet explorer and Google Chrome stopped working, and I looked for a solution for that. After I fixed it, my itunes store starting working too!
<br />
<br />
This is what I did:<br />
<br />
Open your internet explorer<br />
Select Tools<br />
Click on Internet Options<br />
Click on the Connections Tab<br />
Click LAN Settings<br />
Uncheck "Use a proxy server for your LAN"<br />
OK out of both screens. <br />
<br />
I hope it works! <br />
<br />
I love the person that told me about this. Fixed a lot of stuff for me!

<p>Left 4 Dead 2 on the Xbox 360 will finally receive its long-awaited Cold Stream DLC tomorrow, August 3, when the game is set to receive a new title update with the fresh campaigns.</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead 2 was launched many years ago, but this hasnâ€™t stopped Valve from releasing all sorts of content and allowing users to create their own maps or campaigns for the zombie shooter.</p>
<p>One of the biggest community efforts was the Cold Stream campaign, which was bundled by Valve in a new add-on that included, besides it, updated versions of Death Toll, Dead Air, Blood Harvest, and Crash Course, the scenarios from the first Left 4 Dead game.</p>
<p>The DLC appeared last week on Valveâ€™s Steam service for PC and Mac platforms, and will be headed onto the Xbox 360 tomorrow, August 3, according to Valve.</p>
<p>The add-on is incorporated into a new title update for the game, so players will only have to download the patch thereby automatically accessing the new campaigns.</p>

<p>So it does add L4D1 into L4D2?</p>
<p>Is it the original characters or just the crew from part 2?</p>
<p>I gather the old campaigns are updated so that we can use things like Baseball bats &amp; LMGs?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was using the camera up until Saturday 8th December, I tried to use it today on&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;and it keeps telling me the camera in&nbsp;being&nbsp;used by another&nbsp;program&nbsp;and to close it (it is not) also the microphone is not available. I have not installed any new software
 between Saturday and today. I have looked through the previous posts re this camera, but were of no help, the driver is NOT listed on the web cam driver page I have also performed the following tasks with no luck:
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unplugged the&nbsp;camera&nbsp;and tried a different USB port</div>
<div>Uninstalled the driver and plugged the camera in to re install driver</div>
<div>Powered down my PC and powered it up again</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The camera is showing in the devices and printers screen and it says the driver is the most up to date, and it is showing as a&nbsp;USB&nbsp;camera on the device manager, but the microphone is not showing up in the sound settings. The camera will not work in Windows
 live movie maker, or on on-line test pages for web cams...THIS WEB CAM WAS WORKING FINE 2 DAYS AGO......Any suggestions????</div>

<h2>            &#39;Looks like you already own this&#39; message freezing my game</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft, I logged onto Destiny 2 a few days ago with the newest expansion loaded and it worked completely fine with no 'Looks like you already own this' message.&nbsp; I logged onto the game again recently with the expansion downloaded and then the message came up.&nbsp; There was an option to close it which I did.&nbsp; Then it completely froze my game.&nbsp; It came up with an error code from Bungie.&nbsp; I have tried restarting&nbsp;my Xbox, uninstalling and re-installing the expansion and the whole game itself.&nbsp; These messages never stop coming no matter what I do.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>This update has tried to install twelve times in the last 24 hours and continues to fail. My biggest issue with this is that suddenly I can't run my laptop unless I'm plugged in. My battery is fully charged, and I don't like being tethered to the wall while
 trying to get my work done (I wander). I was able to use it like normal yesterday, but today it won't let me unplug and use it. It turns off. I also cannot start it if it's not plugged in. I repeatedly get this error: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 for Windows

<p>Manual download tried but installation froze up.&nbsp; Dell tech support manually loaded 4.7 from their resources and installer messaged that 4.7 was already installed.&nbsp; This is interesting because Windows Update History recorded 12 failures and zero (0) successful
 installations.</p>

 it says rollback, win 10, win 7. Long story short I end up setting the default win to 7 in hopes of getting it to work because I try all ther other options.even comprompt. Bootrec...... sfc /scannow, chk dsk / fc: but nowI'm just stuck on a loop with the win
 7 set as default and not win 10. Its a amd set and ..... I'm going to bed ill beback in the later morning &nbsp;to give spec. Just want win 7 back MS can suck win 10 if its off to a bad start. Error unmountable_boot_volume

            Hi thanks for your reply... i bought my windows 7 ultimate from Amazon and it's been updated countless times without problems. I downloaded the Windows 10 software upgrade it pass the security test pass the hardware test and everything what does seem to
 crash on the reboot. I lost all my recent files but I do have a backup copy of my original windows 7 system image but I am nowhere near my product key and this is a custom built system. At the moment i install a fresh copy of Windows 10 without a product key
 because my product key is nowhere near me at the moment I have to wait until I reach back home before I can reinstall windows unless there's a way to put my current Windows 7 system image back onto my SSD Drive that way that way I can call Microsoft for more
 assistance with their upgrade or I might just keep my windows 7. Does anyone know of a way currently to reinstall my Windows 7 system image ?unfortunately right now I am on windows 10 freshly installed without a product and I cannot down

</p><p>If the Windows 10 was activated previously when it was upgraded then now again you don't need the product key. You can just connect to internet anytime and activate the Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sync Center has stopped working.</h2>
                    Suddenly, whenever I reboot, I get a message telling me Microsoft Sync Center has stopped working.&nbsp; I'v never used Sync Center, don't anticipate using it, and actually didn't even know it existed until this happened.&nbsp; I can open it and go through the various
 menu options, although everything I do elicits the warning I describe.&nbsp; If I just close the warning by clicking the X, all seems to proceed, but since I'm not sure what it does, I don't know if it's doing it.<br />
<br />
Since I don't, and don't anticipate, ever using this feature, is there some way to just turn it off?&nbsp; At least that would do away with the annoying alerts during boot up.

            You can't turn off Microsoft Sync according to several articles I've read - but you may be able to disable it or prevent the alert from showing up (but I'm just guessing here - I could find no articles on how to do it).<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search Box and type in msconfig and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Move to the Start-up tab and open it.&nbsp; Scroll through the list until you find Microsoft Sync (it may have a slightly different name) and uncheck
 the box that indicates it should start at startup.&nbsp; That should remove it from the startup group and you should no longer see the alert.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, perhaps it's a service that's starting up.&nbsp; Go to Start / Control Panel / Computer Management / Services and then scroll to find Microsoft Sync.&nbsp; It is probably set on automatic.&nbsp; Change it to manual.&nbsp; That should prevent it from starting
 up unless you actually activate the program (and again, it should eliminate the alert).<br />
<br />
<span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesnâ€™t work. Y<span>ou can make a bootable Recovery Disk using
</span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.&nbsp; This may resolve whatever caused the problem with Microsoft Sync in the first place and "repair" it so the alerts stop.<br />
</span></span><br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

            I tried both approaches, and found nothing in either place that applied.&nbsp; SFC /SCANNOW reports no problems.<br />
<br />
This started after I let the MS site do an auto-repair of WMP, which had stopped working, although I don't see how they're related.&nbsp; If my only choices are to live with the alert, or go back to a non-working WMP, I'll put up with the alert.&nbsp; What irritates
 me is that I have to put up with either one.&nbsp; And I refuse to give the MS money-grubbers cash to help me fix a problem that they created in the first place.<br />
<br />
Thanx anyway,<br />

            Active Sync and WMP are definitely related somehow (I too don't know why) because I've seen several articles where both are stopped by the same problem (and addressed by the same solutions) - but they don't apply in this situation (or one is adversely
 affected by the other as in your case).<br />
<br />
Check your Firewall settings (Start / Control Panel / Security Center / Windows Firewall / Change Settings / Exceptions / Windows Active Sync (make sure it is checked).<br />
<br />
Here's an article with an answer that proposes several solutions (I don't know if any worked).&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/c53aa548-d4b8-4a1c-8342-b554decc4814/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/c53aa548-d4b8-4a1c-8342-b554decc4814/</a>
 This is somewhat different from your problem in that both Active Sync and WMP aren't working so maybe the solutions are more extreme than you need (or may interfere with WMP which you don't want).<br />
<br />
I've confirmed that Active Sync cannot be turned off - even with the registry.&nbsp; If it can be disabled, I don't know how to do it.&nbsp; I would not uninstall the program because it seems to be tied closely to WMP and uninstalling it may adversely affect WMP (and
 still may not fix the problem because there may be more than one related program installed).<br />
<br />
Perhaps a Microsoft Systems Engineer or a MVP will see this thread and post a reply with a suggested resolution - especially when they check to see why the question hasn't yet been answered.&nbsp; Hopefully they will be able to help us because I'm out of ideas.<br />
<br />
Sorry I couldn't help you with your problem (if the above doesn't work).<br />
<br />
Good luck!

            This gets stranger by the minute.&nbsp; I read the article you suggested, and the only solution I hadn't tried was turning media sharing on.&nbsp; Every time I try to turn it on, I get the message that Explorer has stopped working, my Task Bar disappears, and then
 reappears in a few seconds.&nbsp; Media Sharing remains off, however.<br />
<br />
Thanx for all your efforts.&nbsp; It appears I'll just have to live with the inconvenience of the periodic alerts about Sync Center, since I never use it anyway.<br />

            It seems that Microsoft Sync Center and Media Player are in fact linked together somehow - there are too many posts showing both having problems that are related.&nbsp; Here's an article with some proposed solutions (some of which you may already have tried).&nbsp;
 Perhaps one of them will resolve the problem: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/c53aa548-d4b8-4a1c-8342-b554decc4814/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
In the meantime, perhaps someone else will see and reply to this thread with a suggestion (too bad personal messages are turned off in this forum or I would contact someone I know who is very knowledgeable about such things but I have no way to reach him directly)
 - perhaps a Systems Engineer who notices that this thread still doesn't have an answer.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

<p>Nativement prÃ©vu pour la Xbox 360, aucun driver, (pilote), n'existe pour PC, par ailleurs, ce fabricant ayant justement des modÃ¨les destinÃ©s au PC, je doute que des drivers voient le jour par son intermÃ©diaire.</p>

<h2>            Acer laptop keyboard and touchpad not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;<br />
About 5 days ago I woke up to my laptop's keyboard and touchpad not working or responding. I did not install anything the day before. I did install a steam game about a week or so ago, but I don't&nbsp;think that is what caused this<br />
Here is what I have done:</p>
<p>-uninstalled both the keyboard and touchpad in device manager</p>
<p>-checked to make sure both ribbons were connected in the internals of my laptop</p>
<p>-turned off the laptop and took the battery out and pressed the power button for 30-45 seconds</p>
<p>-Did a soft reset&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I have nothing installed on my computer, but Chrome and my USB mouse and laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me. I am so frustrated. </p>
<p>Do you think it could be a virus or a broken hard drive?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience you are facing. I appreciate the troubleshooting steps that you have tried. I suggest you to perform Hardware troubleshooter and check in the first
 place. The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search bar and press â€œ<strong>Enter</strong>â€.</li><li>
In the â€œ<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>â€ window, click on â€œ<strong>View Allâ€</strong> on the left pane.</li><li>
Click on â€œ<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>â€.</li><li>
Click on â€œ<strong>Advanced</strong>â€ and then click on â€œ<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>â€.</li><li>
Click â€œ<strong>Next</strong>â€ and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</li></ul>
<p><span>Make sure that your system is up-to-date. Most of the issues are fixed by installing Windows Updates. Type
<strong>Windows Updates</strong> in search bar and select <strong>Check for updates</strong> from the results. If updates are available, try installing them and check. Also suggest you to go to the manufacturer website and install the latest keyboard and touch
 drivers and check if it makes any difference. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know how it goes, I hope it helps.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response. I suggest you to go to the manufacturer website and install the latest keyboard and touchpad drivers and check if it helps.
<span>Also&nbsp;run <strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> scan to check for any system files corruption in the system. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>:
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></li></ul>

<h2>            Malwarebytes self-protection module can block email client from launching</h2>
                    <p>This may be of interest to anyone who has Malwarebytes Premium installed and has enabled the self-protection module which I've indicated wih a red arrow in the screenshot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that enabled, I'm unable to launch Mozilla Thunderbird email client. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not aware of whether it affects Windows Live Mail or Outlook as well, but if you have it installed with the self-protection module enabled and you experience the same problem, deselect it and you should find that your email client will launch normally.</p>

<h2>            My browser keeps logging me into login.live.com with the wrong, non-primary Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a "primary" Microsoft account being an "name"@yahoo.com.&nbsp; I also have another Microsoft account being "name"@outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to sign in to Microsoft on-line service, the @outlook.com acocunt gets logged in.&nbsp; I have to sometimes jump through hoops to eventually get the @yahoo.com account to be used for logging in (this is the account through which I do have all of
 my subscriptions, services, memberships and so on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed this behaviour on several browsers, though I am primarily using Firefox (latest version, all patched).&nbsp; Is there some trick to "promoting" my @yahoo.com account to be the primary login account or is it a "Microsoft thing" trying to push @outlook.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Personalisation &#40;personalization&#41; - Themes error</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a small issue that has been annoying me for while.&nbsp; I downloaded a programme a while ago that changed the login background to whatever I wanted.&nbsp; I deleted this programme but....<br />
<br />
I can now no longer change the theme.&nbsp; The background and screen savers remain the same whatever I change it to.&nbsp; When I go to change it, I can select a new back ground, but it does not show at the bottom of the personalisation panel in the control panel and
 does not actually change the desktop/screen saver.<br />
<br />
I tried just loading a standard theme but all it changes is the 'Window Colour' and 'sounds'.<br />
<br />
I presume that the programme that I stupidly installed has changed the registry which is why it is no longer working.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to remedy this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Pro SP1 <br />

<h2>            Network printer is recognized by computer but will not print.  No error messages.</h2>
                    <p>I am on a University campus.&nbsp; I am on one of the schools computers that the general school population is not allowed to use.&nbsp; It is running Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I do seem to have more privileges (not complete admin) on this station than others.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This is at an information desk on campus.&nbsp; The student workers do have printing privileges&nbsp;
</p>
<p>We have a networked printer that the student workers have not been able to get to work.&nbsp; One person gets it to work and then it just quits working seemingly randomly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have not had such success.&nbsp; I have found the printer and added it to the desktop.&nbsp; The status shows that it is available and ready to print.&nbsp; Whenever I send a document to it, it says the document has been sent, but nothing prints and there is nothing
 in the print queue.&nbsp; I get no error messages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We do have IT service, obviously, because it is a university, but it seems that they are not coming to fix the problem so we are trying to figure it out ourselves.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Unsure what to do.&nbsp; It is a HP Laserjet 4350.</p>

</strong>Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and&nbsp;vents. On<br />
a laptop about all that can be done is reseat the memory and clean the vents. (Of course remove<br />
ALL power prior to opening the case.)<br />

<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to
<br />
Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update&nbsp;the BIOS
<br />
and chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Installing XP on a tablet PC without CD or Floppy drives - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing XP on a tablet PC without CD or Floppy drives</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having trouble installing XP Tablet Edition on a Toshiba Portege P3500. It came with a copy of XP Home Edition on it meaning no tablet features like handwriting recognition or a proper on-screen keyboard. It has no built-in floppy or CD drives but does
 have an external PCMCIA CD-ROM drive. I have tried using this to install XP but the installer bluescreens when it gets to the "Setup is starting Windows" section. I'm assuming this is because the BIOS has handed control of the CD drive over to the Windows
 installer but the installer has no drivers for it.</p>
<p>To get around this I tried following a tutorial which instructed me to remove the tablet's hard drive, mount it in another computer with a built-in CD drive, install DOS 7.10 to the hard drive, copy the contents of the XP installation CD onto the drive,
 mount the hard drive back in the tablet, boot into DOS from the hard drive and then install XP from DOS. Unfortunately this hasn't worked. I can install DOS to the hard drive but when I try and boot DOS I get an error along the lines of "A disk I/O error has
 occoured".</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was to download a DOS live boot CD. the tablet's PCMCIA CD drive will boot this as the BIOS retains control of the CD drive the whole time. I copied the XP installation files to the hard drive beforehand, booted the DOS live CD, started
 smartdrv.exe, navigated to D:/I386 and ran winnt.exe. The Windows XP installer started and ran successfuly. When the tablet rebooted to begin the GUI stage of the installation it wouldn't boot. I'd just get a flashing cursor. I tried this a few times but I
 couldn.t get the GUI stage of the installer to run.</p>
<p>Has anyone successfully re-installed XP on a computer with no CD or floppy drives? People have suggested I use the original Toshiba recovery CD's but I don't have these as I bought the computer second-hand.</p>

<p>It's a Toshiba Portege P3500 made around 5-6 years ago. I sustect that Toshiba deliberately removed USB booting so that the only way to re-install would be to buy their external CD drive and their recovery CD, both of which are optional extras that cost.
 Either that or send the laptop back to them which would also cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a BIOS update available for it which may add USB booting but I've got no way of installing it. It runs in a GUI in Windows and not from DOS. I don;t particularly want to try running it in WINE under Ubuntu because any error could render the computer
 completely screwed.</p>

<h2>            indexing Publisher files</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to search my Publisher documents and I believe it is the filter type. Word and Excel files have "Microsoft Office Filter" but Publisher has "Plain Text Filter" - how can I change Publisher to the other filter ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx</p>

<p><span><span>What do you mean when you say '</span></span>how can I change Publisher to the other filter ?'</p>
<p><span><span>Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with search and indexing of files and folders. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check
 the status of the issue. Refer these steps:</span></span></p>

<span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, select
<strong>Control panel.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Change the <strong>view by </strong>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>troubleshooting</strong> and click on the
