<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2782198f-db8e-4d84-aaa1-9f4760330f0e" title="DonaldBouwkamp">
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to access your accounts simply by using your Skype Name, email, or phone number (<em>depending on what you used when you created your account</em>) when logging in to Skype. If you forgot your Skype sign-in details, please follow the below
 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to this link:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</a>
<span>&nbsp;â€‹</span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;the email address or phone number connected to the Skype account that you're trying to get back into, and hit
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>We'll show you all the accounts connected to that email or phone number.</span></li><li><span>Find your Skype Name and click
<strong><span>Sign in</span></strong>. (<em>If you forgot your password, choose Reset password, and we'll route you to our account recovery page</em>).</span></li></ol>
<p>

<h2>            How can I sync Internet Explorer 11 Favorites saved on Win10 PC with my Windows 8.1 phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>* Original Title: How do I get the list of IE FAVs to sync with my new Smartphone's FAVs?</em></p>
<p><em>* (Lumia 600 series)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my first Smartphone a few weeks ago and I set it up. It is a Windows 8.1 phone. But I've noticed that even though my list of IE Favorites is in there, the ones that I've added since the day that I set up the new phone aren't synced in.<br />
I read somewhere that only happens if you're using IE-10 on your PC that also has Outlook.com in it since the FAVs are stored in a Folder in MY DOCS. Well my PC gets automatic updates from Windows Update and it has IE-11 on it.
</p>
<p>Can I uninstall IE-11 somehow and then install IE-10 from a download somewhere and then set Windows Update to ignore ever updating IE, at least for now, until they fix this bad deal for US users?<br />
I'm a lifelong supporter of Microsoft/Windows stuff and others have said in many places to switch browsers so that your FAVs can sync into your Smartphone. That's not really what I want to do.<br />
In trying to do this myself, I can't find any places in my Control Panel's ADD/REMOVE to uninstall IE-11.</p>

            <p>Thanks Giridhar but I still have a problem. I was excited to get your Reply but when I did what you said, SYNC SETTINGS and SYNC THIS PC along with SETTINGS, FAVORITES &amp; HISTORY was already set to ON which I'm sure that I'd done in the recent past trying
 to fix this deal.<br />
</p>
<p>When I clicked on the link to see the files, it had me enter my password for my outlook.com email address and then it said in the upper right of the screen "Uploading xx%" which took about 5 or 10 minutes. I was excited but once again it hasn't changed anything.</p>
<p>After it was done and said "All File Are Up To Date" I clicked on File Storage which says that I have "29.7 GB Available of 30 GB" and I saw this image:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b62cd6bb-56d8-45b3-8bf8-c1629c7f9501" /></p>
<p>Here's a PrintScreen (that I turned sideways to save space here at this site) of another place that I just did that shows what OneDrive of what it has for my IE Favorites:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2293679-7f76-4738-a2a8-5a1ea463e380" /></p>
<p>But here's a PrintScreen (that I turned sideways to save space here at this site) of the current FAVORITES in the dropdown in my Internet Explorer 11. You'll see that the list that says that is was synced isn't this current list. It is one from a few months
 ago. I has many of the same Folders but you can see that I've added several and even renamed a few:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26149391-9a67-4517-b910-ccf05e7c5609" /></p>
<p>This isn't making any sense to me. I sure hope that you can help me fix this mess so I can trust it and use it in the future with any new PCs and with my new Smartphone which is my first one.</p>

            <p>I've caught on to what is happening but I'd like to ask for help in resolving it. I must have moved where my FAVs are stored at some point or maybe Microsoft did themselves.
<br />
</p>
<p>I'd noticed in the past a folder in My Docs named Favorites. Maybe I put it there somehow or maybe some former version of IE did that such as IE-10? I just looked in My Docs &gt; Favorites and I see that same OLD list of Favorites&nbsp;one that I put an image of
 above that is also the one that OneDrive is apparently finding and syncing to. That is also the list of FAVs that shows up in my Smartphone.<br />
</p>
<p>But the true list of IE-11 FAVs that I'd really like to have synced into my Smartphone thru OneDrive is the newer one that IE-11 must be storing somewhere else.</p>
<p>I'm kind of a dummy about this stuff. I just want to ask for some help in dealing with this. At some point, that old list of FAVs must have been copied into the new location the IE-11 uses now but OneDrive is still thinking that it should sync to that old
 list that are saved in that folder in My Docs.<br />
</p>
<p>This might also explain why sometimes I've click on a old FAV up in my FAV BAR or in one of my FAV Folders and it pops a box asking me what program I want to use to open it with. That hasn't ever made any sense to me but I just got around it somehow every
 time. It didn't happen too often.</p>
<p>So<strong><em>my 2 new Questions will be:</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>1. HOW DO I TELL ONEDRIVE THAT MY ACTUAL FAVORITES ARE IN THE NORMAL PLACES AND NOT IN THAT FOLDER IN MY DOCS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;WHERE IS ONEDRIVE GETTING THAT INFO AND HOW DO I RESET IT SINCE THE FAVORITES ARE NOW STORED IN THE NORMAL PLACE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'D ASSUME THAT I WILL JUST DELETE THAT FOLDER OF FAVORITES IN MY DOCS AFTER THIS IS ALL WORKING.</strong></p>

            <p>Giridhar, could you please give me a bit more help on this even though your Reply has been marked as THE ANSWER?
</p>
<p>My last Reply that I made yesterday is my asking for help after giving some more info.<br />
I've thought about what I've found and the only explanation that I can come up with for why I find that folder named FAVORITES in My Docs is that I used to use something to backup the Favorites so that just in case I had another issue with my PC or wanted to
 move to another, that I'd have them safely stored on an external hard drive that holds my backups.<br />
</p>
<p>But this must have confused the situation so that the old list of Favorites is what was installed into my new Smartphone that I got for Christmas and it still syncing into it.</p>
<p><strong>Could you please help me either sync that old file of Favorites to the new one or preferable just delete it and stop using it by redirecting my cell phone to sync the newest set of Favorites that IE uses on my PC?</strong></p>

            <p>Thanks for the Reply. I got busy fighting other issues so I hadn't read this until now.</p>
<p>I'm not sure you understand my deal since I think that what you said is backwards.</p>
<p>I want the new Favorites that I see in IE on my computer&nbsp;to sync into my phone. I don't want the old ones which are in a Folder stored in My Docs on my computer&nbsp;that I think I set up at some point in the past when I used to use the Backup Favs APP built
 by Microsoft that put an entry in the File column in IE. I'd set it with the Browse feature that was built into it to store them in a Folder in My Docs so that my backup software would keep a backup copy on my E: drive.</p>
<p>I haven't hardly ever used IE on my Smartphone and for sure I've never added a Favorite on my Smartphone but I'd just like to have my Favorites handy and with me if I ever do want to use one while I'm out somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>So the list of Favorites that is the most current is the one that IE stores somewhere on my computer that I don't even know and that is the one that I want to sync into my Smartphone</strong>. But for some reason, perhaps when I initially set up
 this new Smartphone that I got for Christmas, it found a folder in My Docs called My Favorites and it synced them in.<br />
So you can now probably see my problem .... I add new Favorites in IE on my PC and they don't end up in my Smartphone which is my first one that I've ever had.</p>

            I'm going to start a new Question on this. This is still a mess for me. So I thought that starting a new Question would bring more attention to it than just asking for more help here especially since I'd marked this as Answered months ago. Thanks.

            <p>Could I please have some help still even though this had been marked as Answered? I've removed them as it has never worked yet for me.</p>
<p>I was told here to: </p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to Enable the Sync settings on the computer:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows key + C</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on <strong>Change PC settings</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Click on <strong>OneDrive.</strong></span></span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on <strong>Sync settings</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Turn on <strong>Sync your settings on this PC</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Under Browser, </span><strong><span>turn on Settings and info like history and favorites.</span></strong></span></li></ol>
<span><span>
<p>But Windows key + C gives me this small Cortana box </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/463e8a9b-f7f8-4080-b000-e2782b1ec42c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/463e8a9b-f7f8-4080-b000-e2782b1ec42c" /></a></p>
<p>and I can't even type into it and saying "settings" doesn't give me anything at all and that box just closes. Then I open Cortana and type in settings and I click MY STUFF but still it doesn't give me anything that I can click Change PC Settings on. It gives
 me some useless junk even then and if I scroll down and click on Settings, I get this and nowhere does it say
<strong>Change PC settings</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d31a1a6-9f78-4f4a-81f7-92a2210d41c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d31a1a6-9f78-4f4a-81f7-92a2210d41c9" /></a></p>
<p>What should I do? Where am I going wrong?</p>
<p>Is there any way to delete all of the 100 or so old FAVs out of my Windows phone and just import the new ones since syncing just isn't in the cards for me even though I've worked on it at times for a year now?</p>
<p>I'm no dumbo and I've actually always considered myself somewhat tech savvy. But I sure can't figure this one out and I've even been asking for help for almost a year.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store on Build 10240 suddenly stopped working, now it crashes without an error message at the blue loading screen.</h2>
                    As the title says, also it's worth noting that I have two accounts on my Laptop, and only my account is affected by this, I can open the store app in the other account normally. I have tried WSReset, I have tried several other solution but none of them
 worked out. A whole system reset isn't an option as setting it up was a massive burden for me, is there's a way to reset the whole store app for a specific account?

<h2>            Office 365 Groups not available in Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>We have users with Office 365 ProPlus 2016.<br />
So with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>We are testing the use of Office 365 groups.</p>

<p>The problem is that the groups are not shown in Outlook.<br />
We can create a group in Outlook and invite people during creation.<br />
The group is immediately shown &nbsp;in Office 365 web portal and we can work with it.<br />
But the group is not displayed in Outlook.</p>
<p>Also we can create groups in the web interface but and work with it but the groups are not shown in Outlook.<br />
<br />
We have a hybrid environment:<br />
Exchange 2010 on premise with DirSync</p>
<p>Our autodiscover records should be fine.<br />
We don't have any other problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>Any ideas what the problem might be?</p>

<p>The problem is solved.</p>
<p>We didn't have any problems whatsoever with our setup so it didn't look like an issue, but apparently we need an internal cname record for autodiscover.</p>
<p>We had only an SRV record, but no CNAME record.</p>
<p>Also the connectivity analyzer gave no warnings before so we thought that everything was okey with our Autodiscover.</p>
<p>So, the problem was solved after we've created an internal CNAME record in our dns.</p>

            <p>Was that error message after clicking one of the white tiles on your desktop? I am guessing those white tiles were formerly shortcuts to "modern" apps right that carried over via "syncing" from your Windows 8 or 8.1 install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started as a Windows Insider when it was on build10130; I am now on build Th1 10240. At no point since I started using the Windows 10 Preview have&nbsp;I ever been able to put shortcuts to apps from the Start Menu onto the desktop.&nbsp; The only shortcuts I can
 put onto the Desktop are for normal win32 programs or for folders/files etc like normal. Shortcuts for "modern" apps can only be pinned to the Start Menu or the Task Bar in Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi SubashPokhrel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you cannot store videos and music on your SD card. On your phone, if you go to Settings &gt; Phone, have you changed the settings for Store new music+videos and Store new pictures on SD card? Once you have done that, music and videos as well
 as photos will be stored on the SD card from now on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you first inserted the SD card, did you get a message saying "SD card found"? If not, the SD card might not be compatible with your phone. Have you tried any other SD cards? Do they work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about using an SD card on your phone, please have a look at the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/basics/use-an-sd-card-to-add-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/basics/use-an-sd-card-to-add-space</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Gemma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For external access control, the site collection level is the lowest level, which means that yes - you will need to allow External Sharing on the site collection in order to share the subsite with external users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your question.</p>

<p>writing here won't do anything. this is primarily a user to user forum, so if you want your voice to be heard, i suggest that you click on the Contact Us link at the top of the page and let Nokia know your concerns directly. as for new firmware updates for
 the 5630, it may be a matter of months or not, depending on whether your handset is branded or not, or if the firmware is released for your product code. further information here in an informative article written by one of our senior users Grschinon here:&nbsp;<a href="http://linux.sgms-centre.com/nokiafaq/branded-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://linux.sgms-centre.com/nokiafaq/branded-phones/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>word out is that there is a v012 available for Euro codes, however it hasn't yet been made available to other regions of the world. that's the only advice i can offer you at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 not speed up the release let me assure you.&nbsp;

<p>The same to me. the music player hangs while listening to the music and the phone restarts.</p>
<p>I bought via Amazon.de in Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software Version</p>
<p>011.020.C04.01&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typ</p>
<p>RM-431</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product Code</p>
<p>0586557</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's indeed a little bit annoying. I didn't bought the phone primary to hear music with it but I hope there is soon a Firmware update that will fix that issue. It cannot be that I have to buy an extra music player for a XpressMusic-Phone!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I received my Nokia 5630 just over a week ago here in New Zealand.&nbsp; I got it parallel imported and it came in from China.&nbsp; When i ran up the software updater it updated the phone straight to v012 and i haven't noticed any issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the short time i used the phone before the update it appeared to work fine also.</p>

<p>This morning I tested the music player again. It seems that the Music Player only crashes / hangs when it runs in background.</p>
<p>On the way to work&nbsp;I used the Music player and didn't hide it and it worked fine. So this could be a workaround till the new firmware is released.</p>

<p>The Music-Player of my 5630 XM crashes / hangs also when it doesn't run in background. I contacted Nokia Care and they recommended to install the Firmware with the NSU again. When this doesn't solve the Problem I should go to a Nokia Service Point.</p>

<p>Tommorow I will go to the Nokia Service Point in town.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t see Facebook birthdays in my calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to see my Facebook contacts birthdays in the Outlook calendar. I have added them as an Internet calendar using the link from Facebook and it doesn't want to sync. I've tried removing and re-adding it several times under different names, but it
 did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link from Facebook is ok, since I've used it in my Gmail calendar and the birthdays sync fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, I can synch Facebook events to my Outlook calendar using the same procedure and this is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how do solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wojciech</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying this procedure from the start:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Outlook.com, Windows , Windows Phone and Office 365 Calendar sync</em><br />
<br />
<em>Facebook events will no longer automatically sync to your Calendar on Outlook.com, Windows, Windows Phone and Office 365. As a workaround, you can subscribe to a link that Facebook provides from Outlook.com calendar.</em><br />
<br />
<em>When you connect that Outlook.com account with your Windows, Windows Phone, and/or Office 365 Outlook Calendar, the events that you subscribe to will sync across those apps.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Sign in to Facebook, then choose Events on the left side of the window.</em><br />
<br />
<em>On the lower right of the page, notice the message: "You can add your events to Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar or Apple Calendar. Once you add them, they'll stay updated. Learn More. Upcoming Events. Birthdays.".</em><br />
<br />
<em>Right-click Birthdays, (or long pause on a touch device), and choose Copy link address.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Sign in to your Outlook.com from a web browser, and go to Calendar.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Choose Import from the header.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Choose Subscribe on the left side, then paste the URL that you copied in step 3 in the Calendar URL box.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Enter a name for the new calendar and click Subscribe.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And I repeat, it works for events, doesn't work for birthdays. I am using a similar procedure in my Gmail calendar and both events and birthdays sync fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Dann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't do a repair because I'm using the web version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An importing from FB to Gmail to Outlook won't work in this case. I can import my calendar, but the Facebook birthdays are synced to it using ical. So those events are not in the Gmail calendar itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, guess I'll need to rely on the Gmail calendar for Facebook birthdays.</p>

    <title>Excel Tables and Structured References - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slimslender  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Tables and Structured References</h2>
                    <p>I like Tables and Structured References. However, I am having a problem. I am using a Vlookup in a column in one Table to retrieve something from another Table. The formula that was generated by selecting cells reads:</p>
<p>=vlookup(Table1[[#This Row],[LoanNumber]],Table2[#All],10,False)</p>
<p>It works fine, but I wonder why the "hard coded" 10 for the column is there with the "relative coding" of the table structured references. And when I try to put the field name in in place of the 10, it doesn't work. It returns nothing. It seems strange to
 me that a "hard coded" or "absolute reference" to a column number would be required and that a field name wouldn't work in this situation. Does anyone know the syntax for using a field name in this situation?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can use MATCH function within VLOOKUP to utilize the relative coding of the table structured references.&nbsp; Please find below Excel 2007 and 2010 examples to achieve the same result as your hardcoded formula above.&nbsp; Replace "Column10" in the below formula
 with the Header name of the 10th column in the second table to achieve the result you are looking for.<br />
<br />
MS Excel 2010 Formula:<br />
<br />
=VLOOKUP(Table1[@LoanNumber], Table2[#All], MATCH(Table2[@Column10],Table2[@], 0), FALSE)<br />
<br />
MS Excel 2007 Formula:<br />
=VLOOKUP(Table1[[#This Row],[LoanNumber]], Table2[#All], MATCH(Table2[[#This Row],[Column10]],Table2[#This Row], 0), FALSE)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

            That works so that the boxes are the correct size but we need to scale it down to fit on one page.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I will redo our excel file so that it fits on 1 page without scaling.&nbsp; Unless there is another setting that would fix this.

            Most probably every unlocked Nokia phone with 3G/WCDMA/UMTS network suppport sold in Europe or Asia will work in Japan (with, e.g., Softbank's 3G SIM card there, or through roaming with a foreign SIM card).<br />
<br />
North American (USA, Canada) models won't work (the 3G frequencies are different there).

            Be aware that every mobile phone account in Japan, whether postpaid or prepay, must be registered to the name and address of a Japanese resident. They are terrified of anonymous prepay and as a foreigner you can no longer just go and buy a SIM card, you
 need a local to get it for you.

<p>Hi Ian_Bimbimbie, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest for you to get a Skype Number. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/onlinenumber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Skype Number</span></a> is a phone number that you pay monthly for. People can call you from their mobile or landline and you pick the call up in Skype. A Skype Number is great
 option if you, or your friends and family live in different countries, or plan to travel abroad and want an affordable way to keep in touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not however, possible to use your own phone number. You'd have to select one from our pre-selected range: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i-get-a-skype-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I get a Skype Number?</a></p>

<h2>            What is the little backwards P that shows up every time I open a Word document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I open a word document a little backwards P shows up. Sometimes it is all over the place. Does it mean "post" or "paste"? It does show up every time I click on "Paste".&nbsp;It is very annoying. This started to happen all of a sudden. I do not remember
 it always being like that. How do I get rid of it, or should I worry about it. It does not show up in the finished product. ?????</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            It's a paragraph mark. See <a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/NonPrintChars.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/NonPrintChars.htm</a>.<br />
<br />
Usually it appears and disappears (along with the dots in the spaces between words, and arrows for tab characters) when you click the Â¶ button on the Home tab. If that button doesn't change the appearance of the paragraph marks, click the Office button (the
 circle at the top left) and click Word Options, then click Display, and clear the check mark from the box for "Paragraph marks".<br />

            The behavior of that set of options is a bit unintuitive. It works like this:<br />
<ul>
<li>Clicking the Â¶ button or pressing Ctrl+Shift+8 or checking/unchecking the "Show all formatting marks" box in the Options dialog are all equivalent. If you turn on the button so it's highlighted, that will also check the box in Options; and if you check
 the box in Options, that will turn on the button. The result is that all of the formatting marks in the document are shown, even when all of the other boxes in that section are unchecked.</li><li>If you check one or more of the boxes for specific types of formatting marks -- just paragraph marks, say, or just tab characters -- then those kinds of marks will continue to be shown regardless of the setting of "Show all" or the Â¶ button. The kinds of
 marks whose boxes are still unchecked will be shown or hidden by turning the "Show all" on or off.</li></ul>
<p>So what you saw was exactly what is supposed to happen, although the rules aren't obvious.<br />

<h2>            Why did excel remove the ctrl key deselect function&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using excel more than ever before over the last 2 months and the Ctrl to deselect function has been amazing. I can select an entire row then deselect the three or four cells I don't need, rather than typing in a range. Why was this removed!?
 I was so happy with the change! and then I open up excel last Thursday and its gone! vanished! It didn't even leave a forwarding address, or a goodbye note. For all I know it was taken against its will, I mean our bond was strong and I just can't imagaine
 ctrl -deselect leaving without at least saying goodbye. Please Microsoft, Don't take CTRL- deselect away from me. we had something special

<h2>            Microsoft Office Family Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using microsoft office family through my mother. on my personal mac i have signed into my microsoft word with her email address and password, because mine did not work even though i have been invited to her family package and accepted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway my question is does she now have access to my word documents and word documents I create subsequently since I am signed in via her email and password? Not that I mind at all, I'm just curious as to how this whole thing works and why she had to give
 me her password for me to be able to sign in</p>

            <p>You can try the following steps. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Make a backup of your database first,</strong></span> however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Compact the database</p>
<p>2. Compile your code - from the VBA Editor click Debug - Compile. Fix any errors, and continue doing this until the menuitem is disabled.</p>
<p>3. Compact again</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to Decompile the database. To do that, create a shortcut with this as the Target:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"full path to msaccess.exe" /decompile</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run that, and Access should open. Open your database, and let Access complete the decompile process. After your database opens, run the 3 steps above again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YOu may also need to create a new, blank database and import everything from the old database into the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also be sure that your Office and Windows installations are fully up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But be sure to make a backup before trying any of these things.</p>

<br />
<br />
It is July now and the solution stated is from March.<br />
<br />
I'm not very computer savvy, but I've never had trouble attaching a file in any mail service except Outlook.<br />
<br />
Also, I couldn't find any tutorials on 'how to attach a file'.&nbsp; My search was answered with how to attach photos.<br />

Very frustrating!<br />

<h2>            Lumia 525 does not detect any custom ringtones</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I found the official guide to add custom ringtones and put two mp3 files in Ringtones folder in my phone internal storage, but then it cannot detect any of them. It is not a matter of waiting as several days passes since I did that, and I have rebooted
 the phone and taken the SD Card several times so far, but still no clue. Can anyone help me out?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long is the ringtone? (39 seconds or under)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you set the MP3 genre to ringtone?</p>
<p>I believe if you want the full version as ringtone you'll need to convert it to wmv.</p>
<p>
Connect your phone to your PC with a USB cable, and use the file manager of your PC to move the song you want to the ringtone folder in your phone.
</p><p>To set the song as your ringtone, in the <strong>ringtones+â€Žsounds</strong> view, tap
<strong>Ringtone</strong>, and under <strong>Custom</strong>, tap the song.</p>
<p>You can use a song as your ringtone if it is not protected with digital rights management (DRM), and itâ€™s smaller than 30 MB.</p>
<p>Want to create your own unique ringtone? Tap <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fdownload.support.nokia.com%2fncss%2fPUBLIC%2fen_MA%2fuserguidance%2f100000365911%2fstart-icon-marketplace.png" /><strong>Store</strong></span>,
 and download the Ringtone Maker app.</p>
<p>Your PC must have Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8.</p>
<p>---Nokia Guide---</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Zune for PC users</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In Zune, find the media file you want to turn into a ringtone</li><li>Right-click on the file and select&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong></li><li>In&nbsp;<strong>Genre</strong>&nbsp;list, click or type&nbsp;<strong>ringtone</strong>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong></li></ol>
<p>Connect your phone to your PC with a USB cable and transfer your file to your Lumia.&nbsp;<strong>Then on your Lumia:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Ringtones + Sounds</strong></li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Ringtone</strong>&nbsp;and then scroll down to the file that youâ€™ve created to make it your ringtone.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Done on the Lumia 800</p>
