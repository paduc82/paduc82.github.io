    <title>old ms-dos trick to autoconfirm hitting &#34;N&#34; with xcopy - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            old ms-dos trick to autoconfirm hitting &#34;N&#34; with xcopy</h2>
                    Due to the file copy speed bug discussed at length with no real solution in this thread below, I tried the XCOPY command to copy a lot of data to a D Drive. Xcopy has an option to automatically replace duplicates, but that is inefficient. I remember an
 ancient trick dating back to at least MS-DOS 6.22 using input redirection to automatically provide the "N" character when copy or xcopy asks if you want to overwrite, but for the life of me I can't recall exactly how to make it work. It galls me since I used
 to use it regularly. <br />
<br />
The benefit of skipping duplicates instead of replacing them is that when you accidentally deleted somethings, you can have the computer just copy the files you need to restore without having to wait hours for it to copy everything. It makes it much more efficient.
 Can anybody tell me if that trick works in the NT-based version of Xcopy and refresh my memory on how to do it? The solution I'm using now as the copy working is to rig a pen and a book on the keyboard to hold down the "N" key. I recall a more elegant solution,
 but I can't recall what it is. Given that I used this in the MS-DOS 3.30 era where hard drives still had the 32mb limit and disks were either 360K or 720K and I had one "IBM compatible" without a hard drive (PC Transporter card in my Apple IIGS, booted a 720K
 disk, then would swap disks to run apps or games. I used it primarily to transfer text files to AppleWorks as this was before the MS-DOS FST was released with System 6) , I doubt I had a file filled with Ns for the trick, it probably only had one N.
<br />
<br />
Please do NOT mention using /y, that will cause xcopy to overwrite rather than skip duplicates.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I do NOT want to overwrite</span>.<br />

<br />
P.S. The mods are free to move this if it belongs in "Files, Folders, and Search" rather than Performance. I'm using Xcopy instead of the built in Explorer with it's ability to ignore duplicates because I'd rather get the copy done in under and hour than have
 to hope it finished overnight.<br />

            I recall it was a trick, I think it included redirecting the input from the keyboard, I just can't remember how to get it to work. Maybe a pipe was invovled. It wasn't a single command, but a fancy string. I thought I figured it out, but obviously I did
 something wrong<br />
<br />
I tried xcopy path\filename1 path\filename2 &lt; n.txt<br />
<br />
where n.txt contained a single character 'n', but it only worked for the first file:<br />

It didn't report X files copied, it simply repeated the question 3 times before terminating.
<br />
<br />
Obviously there was more to it, but I can't recall the rest of the trick. I know I'm on the right track, but how do I supply an endless stream of 'n's?<br />
<br />
I suppose since this is a modern system I could just create a huge file with a few kilobytes of ns as my hard drive has more gigabytes than the old system I learned on had megabytes.
<br />
I take that back, the old system I learned on had only 3.5" 720K disks at first and no hard drive, so it only had kilobytes. The hard drive that came with my computer has almost as many gigabytes as that old disk had kilobytes (650), and that's not even mentioning
 the 1.5TB D drive.<br />
<br />
Still, it bothers me that I can't recall how to get the endless stream of Ns without creating a huge text file.<br />
<br />
P.S. How do I make quotes or code or something to separate the text capture from the rest of the post on these boards? Standard BBCode doesn't seem to be working.<br />

            I'm unfamiliar with this "robocopy", and this is apparently why, I'll have to try it on the other computer when it finishes with the current installer:<br />
<br />
Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]<br />

<br />
D:\Documents and Settings\slick&gt;robocopy /?<br />
'robocopy' is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br />
operable program or batch file.<br />
<br />
D:\Documents and Settings\slick&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm just now starting to learn about some of the new commands even though I've been using Vista since January of 2009 when my old XP computer died (the screen capture is from an ancient win98SE computer i just upgraded).
<br />
<br />
P.S. Other boards have "code tags" or intuitive ways to make quotes. Is there such a mechanism here for posting text captures in an easily distinguished way?<br />
<br />
P.S.S. If you want depreciated commands, what about a way to use the old MS-DOS "backup /m" command? That could do the job quite nicely.<br />

            I couldn't get this "robocopy" to work. It's installed on Vista &amp; 7, so ignore the copy/paste from XP. My modern computer was busy installing software when I made that post.&nbsp; Can somebody recommend a tutorial page that is at least as good as the old MS-DOS
 manuals that explained the finer points of XCOPY?<br />
<br />
This, the result I got when searching on Microsoft sites, is little better than robocopy /?<br />
<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733145%28v=WS.10%29.aspx<br />
<br />
There are tons of other pages featuring Robocopy, which is the best intro one?<br />

I am afraid that you have misunderstood the situation. &nbsp;When I am connected to VPN I can access both drives on the VPN AND my local drives on my hard drive (c:). &nbsp;But if the VPN is then disconnected, I cannot access VPN drives (no surprise - and VPN is completely
 disconnected) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but I also cannot access local drives
</span>because every Windows program is apparently searching for the VPN drive last used and then freezes trying. &nbsp;If I reboot (restart) that might solve the problem, but that should hardly be necessary every time I use and then go off VPN. &nbsp;Is there a way
 to instruct Windows not to have all the programs searching for a VPN drive and then freezing when it cannot be found? &nbsp;Thank you.

Allow us to ask some information, so we would better understand the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you disconnect your PC from the VPN network before trying to access the local drive? Have you tried to restart the PC to check if you will be able to access your local files right away? We suggest that you do that every time you encounter the same concern
 to know if not being able to access is just because you have not completely disconnected the PC from the VPN connection.<br />
<br />
We're here for your feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards. <br />
</p>

Thank you, but as I said, this happens after I disconnect from VPN and the VPN client reflects that I am disconnected. &nbsp;I'm not sure restarting will fix the issue and will test that, but restarting is the very opposite of doing something "right away". Restarting
 takes several minutes. &nbsp;I'm trying to avoid that. &nbsp;Indeed, I can fix by restarting the program that crashed and then logging onto VPN. &nbsp;That's a little faster than rebooting the computer. &nbsp;But I'm trying to avoid that, too, and not have the problem in the
 first place. &nbsp;The question I'd like answered is whether there is some way to have Windows programs not attempt to access the last drive use and stop functioning if they cannot reach them. &nbsp;Please answer that.

            <p>It is not something that you can set on Windows configuration. The issue may be a result of the IP address being retained by the computer after connecting to the VPN network. If you don't want to do a reboot, you can disable (not just disconnect) the VPN
 connection temporarily and re-enable it afterward. See if that helps.</p>

Thank you for your persistence with the problem. &nbsp;How do I disable the VPN connection, as contrasted to just disconnecting it?&nbsp;

There was no Disable option under Network Connections for the VPN connection, but only connect and disconnect. &nbsp;This is Windows 8. &nbsp;Any other suggestion?

<h2>            How to request a new keyboard layout to be added in microsoft windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to add my language to windows. I mean a keyboard layout (like Kurdish). My language is Gilaki and you can find more information about it here:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilaki_language</p>
<p>And can see Gilaki Wikipedia:</p>
<p>https://glk.wikipedia.org</p>
<p>wich have more than 6000 articles.</p>
<p>We made a keyboard layout for it by Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) software but now we want to add it to list of keyboard layouts in windows. What must to do?</p>

            <p>This is not my answer!</p>
<p>Wish you would read my explain above. I said that my language there is not in list and I want to add my language to microsoft windows.
</p>
<p>For more explain, in this link:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/change-keyboard-layout</p>
<p>and in step 3 I cant "Choose the language that I want to add a keyboard layout to, tap or click
<span>Options</span> next to the language name, and then tap or click
<span>Add an input method</span>."</p>
<p>Because there is not <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilaki_language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Gilaki</a></strong> language. And this language has nota keyboard layout yet.
</p>
<p>I want to know how to register a new language to windows layouts?</p>

    <title>Storage Sense only working on OS drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricardo3m_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Sense only working on OS drive</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 SSD drives connected via SATA cable to the motherboard. Both are detected as internal drives.</p>
<p>On storage sense I activated the option to delete files on the recycle bin that are older than 30 days. Storage sense is only deleting files on the recycle bin of the OS drive and the recycle bin of the other drive stays untouched. I tried changing to 1
 day and files on the recycle bin from the secondary drive stay untouched. I tried running storage sense manually and the same problem.</p>
<p>Is this a normal behavior or is it a bug? I've got windows 10 1803 17134.472.<br />

<p>What you're saying has nothing to do with my problem. I also can right click on the recycle bin and click empty but that is not the point of storage sense. When enabled it should delete files that have been in the recycle bin longer than 30 days (with my
 current settings). It is only working for the OS drive and doesn't work for the secondary drive.</p>

<p>Your theory doesn't work. Here are a few screenshots as proof of what is happening. I changed storage sense to delete files in recycle bin older than 1 day three weeks ago. How do I get it working properly? I think it would be a great feature if it worked.</p>

                    <p>when I try to share a document from nitro pdf or ms word 2007, sending a file to outlook 2007 or em client the mapi transfer fails.&nbsp; I get an operational error from ms word and nothing happens when I try to click send attachment by email in nitro pdf.&nbsp; This
 is a new problem since the win 10 update.</p>
<p>I can click an email link from the internet browser and that brings up the default client.&nbsp; I hope that microsoft hasn't disabled outlook 2007s mapi function.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that Office 2007 hasn't been tested on Windows 10. Office 2007 will still run on Windows 10 but you may encounter some errors when using the Office apps like the issue that you're currently experiencing. For more information regarding the
 compatibility between Office 2007 and Windows, you can check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-versions-of-Office-work-with-Windows-10-0fc85c97-da69-466e-b2b4-54f7d7275705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
 If you want to use Office apps that will work on Windows 10, we highly recommend that you purchase the perpetual (one-time payment) version of Office 2016 or subscribe to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want to continue using Office 2007, you can roll back to the previous version of Windows 10 so that Outlook 2007 will work again. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the Windows logo (Start button).</li><li>Click the gear icon (Settings).</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li>On the left pane, choose <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Get started</strong> button under <strong>Go back to the previous version of Windows 10</strong>.</li><li>Follow the prompts and wait until Windows 10 is finish on reverting to the previous version.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, please reply to this thread.</p>

<p>I did some testing and determined the problem.&nbsp; Something did change in windows 10 creator's fall update...&nbsp; I use Em Client, a third party email program and after the update, Em Client's default status is being ignored and mapi transfers are being sent
 to outlook.&nbsp; Initially my outlook was not configured so the transfer was going nowhere creating the error message.&nbsp; To determine the cause, I put in a program called Mailbird and gave it default status and that worked!&nbsp; I switched the default over to em client
 and transfers still brought up mailbird's email form!&nbsp; Then I removed mailbird and documents were sent to................ outlook.&nbsp; So I wrote the developer and asked him to look into his code for a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know why microsoft does not build in a mapi component into windows 10.&nbsp; Office is not the only program that wishes to share documents or pictures with the default client.&nbsp; Nitro Pdf relies on Office's mapi component and not everyone has the Office
 Suite.</p>
<p>I figure if smart phones share resources, that it would behoove Microsoft to support the function on a broader level that is not determined by a consumer having to use MS Office.... 20XX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are I believe third party apps.&nbsp; At any rate it took some time to test and the changes in win 10 were not compatible with Em Client... something I am sure that Em's engineer will deal with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving back to pre-update I would think is not a great solution as windows needs to move forward.&nbsp; I am very happy with Windows 10, just occasionally bugged with the initial bugs and hangups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>

<p>Thank you for the detailed information. Based on your post, you encountered the issue before because your Outlook is not yet configured. After configuring your Outlook, you're able to share files using Outlook. It seems that there may be a compatibility
 issue between the Fall Creators Update and eM Client that is why you are unable to share files using the email program. It is good that you already contacted the developers of the program so that they can release an update that will work on the Fall Creators
 Update. We recommend that you wait for their reply to know what steps you need to do to resolve the issue or if you need to update the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disagree with MICROSOFT... but the windows platform should motivate app development and support for 3rd party apps.&nbsp; When long used mapi support is denied, due to a re-design of an interface in windows AND an existing older interface provides
 a means to assign that MAPI function, then MICROSOFT really needs to take note.&nbsp; If the user is now to set the protocols, then the means to do it is not available.&nbsp; Instead of choosing the application and choosing from a number of available protocols... now
 one has to find the protocol and hope that the app is listed with it.&nbsp; Backward's...&nbsp; Many 3rd party programs take advantage of MAPI transfer.&nbsp; If the older interface is the solution to assigning protocols, then it seems reasonable to make it readily available.
<br />
<br />
Earlier in my post I sighted a program that calls on this...&nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\control.exe /name Microsoft.DefaultPrograms /page pageDefaultProgram&nbsp;&nbsp; ...this is where all things wonderful can occur.<br />
<br />
This is NOT a development issue but an oversight.&nbsp; The ability to send an object through MAPI is a convenience that is now omitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many component's by necessity are backwards compatible, that's what windows re-parse points are all about, so rendering OFFICE 2007 obsolete is not a wise choice.&nbsp; I really wonder if MICROSOFT has bothered to alert it's 3rd party partners to its changes.&nbsp;
 In the end, while trying to make Windows 10 better, which it has, the customer has become the BETA tester, the Answer Desk persons often require a MAPI refresher course and this forum becomes the point of contact with MICROSOFT's developers.&nbsp; More than one
 way of doing things is backwards!</p>

<h2>            Skype Chat History not in iOS Backup</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i recently had to restore an iOS device from a backup, however i found that all my skype message history seems to not be present at all in either iCloud or iTunes backups, or at least they don't seem to get restored. The messages had emotional value,
 is there any other way to recover them, or understand why they would not be backed up?&nbsp;</p>

            You may be able to recover it if you access Skype from a desktop client. Depending on how old the conversation was, iOS Skype only backs up 30 days or for more recent ones it is 2 years.

            Thank you. The newer conversations are kept even on mobile, as they were downloaded from skype's servers. Unfortunately older ones were not, and apparenltly weren't part of the ios backups either. It's good to know they're now kept in the cloud for two
 years though, thank you.

            Oh, unfortunatly it didn’t as i was referring to the older conversations not stored by skype anymore, but it was nice to know they now keep them for 2 years instead of just one month on their servers, at least! I’m getting pretty sure the other messages
 are gone since itunes seens not have backed them up. But you were very nice and helpful so I did rate you 5 stars! Thank you! And have a great day also!

<h2>            Windows 7 can&#39;t find network</h2>
                    Hi guys I'm hoping someone can help me, i browsed trough the forums but none of the answers helped me. I also don't really understand some of them. But this is what happened. My internet was fine yesterday, i was looking at some stuff on aliexpress when
 my mouse froze, i tried to restart the laptop but nothing worked so I had to take the battery out. After that the computer took ages to turn back on and when it did my computer could not find my wifi anymore. I ran the anti-virus, tried following the steps
 for system check it all passed. I went into sync center, i trid adding in manually, i tried looking for a wifi switch (I don't think i have one) i tried restarting the pc and the internet, i tried system restore, I really don't know what else to do. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi Kate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Windows 7 does not find the network and I appreciate the effort made towards trying the fixes. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did the system restore complete successfully?</li><li>What exactly happens when&nbsp;you try to connect to Wi-Fi?</li></ul>
<p>This could be due to several reasons including any third party software conflict. Try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Start the computer in Safe Mode with Networking&nbsp;and check if the issue persists. If the issue does not persist in safe mode with networking, place the computer in clean boot state and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start the computer in Safe Mode with Networking</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode with Networking&nbsp;is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking&nbsp;</strong>appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using. You can use internet connection in this mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please refer to: </span></span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your computer in safe mode</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I suspected that it would be HP related. Once every 24 hours, my ethernet adaptor stops working and I need to reboot my machine. I run a HP Proliant ML115, and this issue affects all the same workstations within the business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe we can narrow it down to the type of ethernet adaptor we have?</p>

            This update also breaks OpenGL applications. Frame rates plummet when switching an OpenGL application from fulscreen to windowed, or do an alt+tab from the OpenGL application to other windows. This problem also happened with&nbsp;KB3189866. Uninstalling&nbsp;KB3189866/KB3193494
 eliminates the problem.

            <p>HP af131-dx. </p>
<p>Tooks two days of research to figure out why my computer could no longer access network computers. Discovered it was this update. I uninstall it and it works fine. But w10 always reinstalls it a day later because we cant shut off updates. Piece of crap setup
 if you ask me. Its not limited to other w10 pcs either. Also affects my win7 and my local cloud drive on my Netgear router. No remote drive access. Did discover I could access win7 drive when I added a user/password account to access it. So it looks like it
 affects anonymous/everyone access to drives. I havent found any other work around yet. I just keep checking every day to see if it reinstalled and uninstall it. User name/password could work for the pcs, but the cloud drive doesnt have that option.</p>

            But what about the network cloud drive? No user name option. It just plain 'inaccessible'. Its meant to open to anyone on the local network. It assumes if you can access the network tou have permission to use it.

            <p>I dont know what you mean by "cloud drive". I do not have a device outside my Local Area Network.</p>
<p>In my case the drive is Inside my router on my Local Area Network and to access it needs a user/password.</p>
<p>It has an IP@ and a name "\\MYNETN900C" a user ID "admin" and a password "xxxxx".</p>
<p>In Windows 10 I entered the&nbsp;above values: (name (not the IP@), user ID and password) and "voilà".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have a user/password for what you call "cloud drive" setup one and then try the above suggestion.</p>
<p>Hope this help.</p>

<h2>            Router IP address&#63;  </h2>
                    I have a Microsoft wireless base station MN-500. The modem and router do not seem to be talking to each other so I cannot connet my laptop wielessly.&nbsp; The hardwired computer is connected to the modem which is connected to the router via ethernet cables.
 I was told that I could get the IP address for the router which I could then tell the modem.... or vice versa.&nbsp; I do not know the IP address of either.&nbsp; I haven't a clue how to do this.&nbsp; Do I need to contact my ISP?<br />

            It should be hooked up like this.<br />
Modem &gt; Router &gt; Computers<br />
<br />
On most SOHO routers the Wireless is disabled by default.&nbsp; So you will have to login to enable it and configure the wireless so that it is using encyrption.<br />
<br />
Usually the IP address to get to your router config is the Gateway IP address of your IP configuration on your PC.<br />
<br />
Open up a cmd prompt.<br />
Start &gt; run &gt; cmd<br />
type: ipconfig /all<br />
<br />
Look for the Gateway Ip address.&nbsp;

    <title>Elite Controller Right Bumper button broke and it only has a 3 month - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swifty n shifty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite Controller Right Bumper button broke and it only has a 3 month waranty&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I bought an x box elite controller maybe 5 months ago and the right bumper button stopped working and felt loose. Next thing I know the whole button comes off the controller. On top of that there is only a 3 month waranty. For a product that costs $150 dollars or close to 3x as much as a regular controller and still have a 3 month waranty is wrong. What is worse is I see there are other people who have had the exact same problem with either the right or left bumpers. Called support and they told me unless I had the receipt&nbsp;showing proof of purchase. there was nothing they can do for me. &nbsp;It is total BS because their system tells them when a product is out of waranty&nbsp;but doesn't tell them the exact date the product was purchased. At any rate don't waste your money buying a cheap chinese&nbsp;made controller that is over priced, lacks on&nbsp;quality as well as durability, and is only backed with the same **** 3 month warranty a normal controller is backed with. Wow Micr

            <p>I've also had issues with mine. Mine was that the upper left paddle&nbsp;&nbsp;went out conveniently at 4 months in and couldn't get it replaced. I tried just using the bottom row and now the bottom left paddle went out. Can they at least have a program to repair the controller for a cheaper price than $150 dollars.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Wow!&nbsp; that's messed up!&nbsp; They sell you that expensive of a controller and its made of cheap plastic!&nbsp; Microsoft should do a mass recall on all controllers and replace the cheap plastic bumpers with metal ones, or offer a full refund on all of their controllers.&nbsp; Furthermore, they should stop making cheap junk, and charging so much for it!&nbsp; Even better, they should make their 360 controllers backward compatible so we can actually have a solid wired controller.&nbsp; Not the crappy charge cable that you plug in to you controller that breaks all of the time.&nbsp; Stop ripping us off Microsoft.&nbsp; You make plenty of money!&nbsp; Stop being greedy!!!&nbsp; At least if we are going to have to pay 60+ USD, make the controller solid!</p>

                    I'm trying to save (publish)&nbsp;my 8 minute movie made in Windows Movie Maker 2.6 using Windows 8. (the new version of Movie Maker that came with the computer is hopeless in comparison) When I try to&nbsp;save the video to my computer in order to publish it to

 free disk space available, and then try again." I have plenty of space, the source files and publishing location are still available and I've had no problem with shorter movies - so is it really that it just can't cope with an 8 minute movie which has admittedly
 quite a few overlaps but only a few effects? Other online advice suggests saving it to Other Settings and I've tried High Quality Video (large and small) which produces the same error message and also DV-AVI and u

 that my original files are AVI and is that something that's compatible with Youtube anyway? Many thanks&nbsp; Andy

====================================<br />
The error you are receiving usually occurs when <br />
the source files are not fully compatible with Movie <br />
Maker. <br />
<br />
There are many types of .AVI files and many if not <br />
most are problematic in Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
Converting the .AVI to the .WMV format before <br />
importing into Movie Maker should produce a <br />
better result:<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free, some retail...the following freeware&nbsp; <br />
is just one example that works well for me.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 )<br />
(***Carefully read *all* the install screens...there <br />
may be some items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />

<h2>            &#40;Windows 8 Pro&#41;windows cannot be installed on disk 0 partition &#40;3, for example&#41;</h2>
                    I tried installing windows 8 however, when I come to select the partition to install on its says windows cannot be installed on disk 0 partition (3, for example). How would I go about fixing this, as windows 8 is completely new to me.
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that you will need to reformat your hard drive to a GPT type instead of MBR....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of people have been having that issue, and it kind of seems strange to me....</p>
<p>I have a EFI\UEFI system, and used a MBR type&nbsp;HDD\SSD without a problem....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using a 2TB&nbsp;or larger drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can only do that type of install with the OEM version of Win 8, otherwise you have to upgrade a previous version...&nbsp;</p>
