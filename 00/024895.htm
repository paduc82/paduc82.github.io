<h2>            Headphone &#40;and baby&#41; problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My baby got hold of my phone and played with it without me knowing. What happened after that was that the Headphone symbol is onscreen all time although there´s none attached. Biggest problem is that the phone "BELIEVES" the headphones are connected so I'm
 not able to talk or listen to a phone call unless I use headphones. Also it turns on the radio, altough it should'nt without the headphones plugged (of course no signal comes). How do I "turn off" these settings or what kind of problem this is...help would
 be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a Headset symbol stuck on your screen but have no headset plugged in, its probably down due to the pop port at the bottom of the handset.<br />
This normally shorts or fuses together inside the phone when exposed to some type of liquid (baby spit for example, in your case).<br />
You will need to take this to a Nokia Care Point and they will need to check inside the handset for you as there are not settings on the phone that can turn this off.</p>
<p><br />
If it has got wet, then it is not covered under the manufacturers warranty and you will need to pay for the repair.</p>

<p>There is no way to track your Zune after it has been lost.&nbsp; You should check the lost and found over the next few weeks.&nbsp; Your warranty would not a lost or stolen Zune.</p>
<p>Your local police station might have a system for recording lost/stolen property.&nbsp; If you have the serial number of your Zune, consider getting it entered into the system.</p>

<h2>            Can I use keyboard in Project My Screen</h2>
                    I have Microsoft Lumia 535. I am able to connect my phone to my laptop for Project My Screen Successfully. But I have a query to ask and want its answer and solution if possible. When my phone's screen is projected on my laptop's screen and I can see my
 phone on my laptop, I can operate my phone from mouse cursor. But keyboard doesn't work/support. Actually sometimes I have to use phone for chatting with my friends. And its really so hard for me to type on phone because I am habitual of typing on keyboard
 from years. So I want to know that when I have to use phone, is it possible that I use keyboard for typing when I am using feature PROJECT MY SCREEN? I don't know you get me or not that what I mean. But I just want to ask that can I reply a text in my phone
 using keyboard??????? Please answer me if any possible way is there please help&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is no downgrade option in Windows 10 Technical Preview build 9879. You may refer to section
<strong>“If you want to go back to your previous operating system</strong>” from link
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Before you install</span></a></strong>, you&nbsp;options are limited to&nbsp;basically a reinstall.&nbsp;Specifically it states "You'll need to reinstall your version
 of Windows from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC (typically DVD media)."&nbsp;As you don't have the recovery media, your best option is to contact the computer manufacture to see if they're able to provide it. One thing you do want to do
 is copy all you date to another drive/device as it will most likely be lost when a reinstall is performed.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<h2>            Paste function not working in Word</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason, the paste function stopped working!&nbsp; I am in a plain Word document (no weird formatting - just a letter) and when I highlight text (again, no weird formatting or in a header, etc.), then cut (or copy) and then go to another part of the document
 and click paste, nothing happens.&nbsp; There's no weird symbol or space or anything, it just doesn't do anything.&nbsp; This is true for the right-click, the menu and quick keys (Ctrl-V).&nbsp; It worked fine yesterday and nothing has changed (that I know of).&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; It's the new version of Word, if that matters.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have a question on behalf of my father. He has A microsoft Lumia 640 phone. The problem is that he dosen't get text messages from a british number. He can send a text message, but when my sister is trying to send him a text message, it fails(she
 has an iphone). Is this a setting on his phone, that text messages from abroad-numbers wont get through? I have checked with his cellphone-company, but they said they couldn't fix it. I hope you guys can help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In advance, thank you.</p>
<p>Kind regards, Mats Vabø</p>

<h2>            Messages that were send when I was offline suddenly don&#39;t come in anymore when I log in</h2>
                    <p>Since last week, the messages that were send while I was offline (I'm part of some chat groups) are not coming in anymore when I log in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, as soon as I was logged in, all messages came in. Now not anymore.</p>
<p>My settings are correctly set. Also on the skype webversion they are not coming in. Someone else had this issue? Someone knows what I have to do to solve this?</p>
<p>I use it for my work with countries with other timezones, so it's very annoying that I miss a lot of communication as it is important information that is posted.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still got an issue with 1 group. I see a notification that someone send something, but when I check skype itselfs, I don't see the group and don't see the message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I search for the group, I even can't find it. It's not in the found results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I redo all the steps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better that I just create a new account? But then I loose everything and have to search all my contacts again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Uanble to close frozen IE window</h2>
                    
<p>I encounter IE windows from time to time&nbsp;that are not responding and can only be closed through the Task Manager or by shutting down the computer. What is causing this and how do I fix it?</p>

            That's correct Blanketcheese, you need to close all open Internet Explorer windows, open Internet Explorer using the link I've posted above (to open Internet Explorer without any add ons), and then browse as normal and see if you still encounter IE windows
 which are not responding.<br />
<br />
If you still have problems, we know it isn't a faulty add on causing your issue and can try some other solutions.<br />
If you find this solves your problem, we can find out which add on is faulty and remove it from your computer.<br />

            It may be caused by a faulty third party add on.<br />
<br />
Could you try opening start --&gt; all programs --&gt; accessories --&gt; system tools --&gt; Internet Explorer (no add ons) and seeing if you still get any frozen IE windows.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply.

<h2>            Motorolla Q &#38; ActiveSync 4.5</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a new computer &amp; I'm trying to sync my Q with it (Dell Optiplex 755, Windows XP Professional).&nbsp; It's attached through the USB port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My old computer gave me no problems but this one is not connecting &amp; when it does takes a long time (up to 30, 40&nbsp;minutes) before it begins syncing, then it stops.&nbsp; I checked the Windows firewall &amp; it has ActiveSync listed as an exception &amp;
 the "don't allow exceptions" box is not checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas what could be on this computer that's not allowing it to connecting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            In Windows 10 default client, it doesn't show status. You need to login to web version of Skype to see the statuses.

            <p>IncrementRotation is intended to rotate shapes as a whole, but chart shapes cannot be rotated.</p>
<p>Instead, you have to work with the Rotation, Elevation and Perspecitve properties of the chart. See:</p>

 you for answer. Actually I only interrupted the download. So is there any chances that by connecting to wi-fi again, download will resume ?

            The download should resume. But if it doesn't, connect your phone to a charger, press vol.down + power for ~10 sec. until phone vibrates, connect phone to WiFi and try downloading the updates again.&nbsp;

    <title>How do you mail merge when the column headings are on the second - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juliusvazquez  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you mail merge when the column headings are on the second row&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having trouble on mail merging when my column headings are on the second row or any row that is not the first row?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an answer here: </p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/mail-merge-header-row-from-3rd-row-not-first/f4fcf893-85c3-4fc7-a669-b5dc2c8c82bb</p>
<p>
</p><p>where the response is:</p>
<div>
<p>You can do what you want IF you assign a name to the range that begins with Row 3 and ends with the row that contains the last record and covers the columns that contain all of the fields.&nbsp; Then when you attach the data source to the mail merge
 main document, the name that you assigned to that range will appear in the Select Table dialog that appears along with the names of the Sheets in the workbook.&nbsp; Select that name and then click on OK and the data in Row 3 will be used as the field names for
 the mail merge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do not understand how you are able to implement this? When I select the table I want to use, it only allows me to select the whole excel table not a specific range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<h3> sfjbb  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is filling up my quota</h2>
                    
<p>My phone will not sync because it says my online quota is used up.&nbsp; How do I know what is using up this space?&nbsp; There is no way to check how much is being used by music, documents, videos etc so I do not know what to remove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 2GB storage card, over half of which is map / gps data which I do not want syncing, and this is not visible on the web, so what is filling up the space?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know other people have requested a explorer style interface - can I add a request to find or sort files by size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>John</p>

</p><p>I believe it to be the update they introduced and I understand their want to keep their customers safe and secure but for those who have 2-step verification is surely enough security.</p>

            <p>The Outlook auto sign out is aggravating to the point where I primarily use Gmail instead. I do not want to be signed out automatically, especially since it's an arbitrary action. It happens without warning, sometimes as many as 10 times in a day, but usually
 "only" 4 or 5 times, and it happens in the middle of writing emails -- I have no way of knowing I've been logged off by Microsoft until I click "Send" and I'm told I've been logged out "for my protection.". I lost and had to rewrite many important emails until
 I found a tedious work-around this <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">incredibly annoying function.&nbsp;</span></em></strong> I have to highlight and right-click copy the email, sign back in, and paste over the incomplete draft with the finished
 product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather be the one to decide when to protect myself by signing out, thank you very much. I'd rather not be subjected to Microsoft's patronizing paternalism. I'm a big girl Daddy, I can make these decisions all by myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable it? If not, I'll continue to use Gmail as my grown-up email, and save Outlook for bulk mail and newsletters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>My problem has since been resolved using one of the solutions provided above, I think with the 'delete browsing history on exit' being unticked on my internet browser (Chrome). Follow the steps above and hopefully it gets fixed asap.</p>

            <p>I believe SkyDrive is the best way to sync your notes between multiple devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're using OneNote 2010, go to File &gt; Share and share it to the Web using your Live ID/Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then your notebook will live in the cloud and you can access it from anywhere. You'll also be able to use any of our mobile apps (for Windows Phone, iOS, or Android) so that you can get your notes on your phone.</p>

<p>I have the same issue. <strong>I turn "Joyful Animations" off, save it, and it turns back
</strong></p>
<p><strong>on </strong>as soon as I open something else. I type "Thank you" and it makes me look like a
</p>
<p>juvenile. I also turned off all animations in the "Ease of Access Center" and pressed "apply"
</p>
<p>and then "ok." It does not disable&nbsp;the "Joyful Animations" my mail client. I have to reword any professional communications.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>My system description:<br />
</strong>Windows 7 Pro x64</p>
<p>IE11</p>
<p>Mail Client: outlook.live.com (from the url in IE11)</p>
<p>Office 2010 installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Changes made as shown below:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ease of Access Center changes made:</strong><br />
Windows key + u &gt; Use the computer without a display &gt;Turn off all unnecessary animations</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hotmail/Outlook.com changes made:</strong><br />
Settings &gt; View All Outlook Settings &gt;Compose and reply &gt; Joyful Animations</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I noticed that the setting below also resets itself to checked status after it is unchecked.</strong></p>
<p>Settings &gt; View All Outlook Settings &gt;Compose and reply &gt; Quick suggestions &gt; Offer suggestions based on keywords in my messages</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is what the problem looks like:</strong></p>
<p>The animations put a blue box around the words thanks, thank you, etc. in new messages. It happens even when I press space or CR after those words.</p>

            Also having this issue. Turn off Joyful Animations in settings, hit Save, but on the next reload of the page it is back on.

<p>Ditto to the above.&nbsp; Outlook refuses to save my changes in settings for this.&nbsp; Absolutely frustrated with this invasion and disruption to my email use.&nbsp; For a couple of days I thought I had a malicious bug on my computer, but apparently, it's intentional!</p>

            Hello everyone, well today this gets better (NOT) For some reason, I have to change the settings for EVERY new e-mail that I compose. At least before the&nbsp; changes would last through the work day. Thank you for letting me rant.

            This stupid feature keeps turning itself back on.&nbsp; I turn it off, save, and it works fine.&nbsp; After logging out of email and signing back in, it has now turned back on.&nbsp; I am not a stupid teenager and do not need this pointless, juvenile, and annoying feature.&nbsp;
 Please help.
