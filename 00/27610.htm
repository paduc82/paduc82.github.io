<h2>            Ease of Use - Content Selection</h2>
                    <p>I feel content selection generally appears to be poorer in Windows Phone compared to other mobile platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try selecting a paragraph from a web page loaded in IE or even for that matter try in a email in read mode or even when&nbsp;you reply, try copying few lines from the mail you replying to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The usability of pin cursor used for text selection can also&nbsp; be improved by increasing the size of the round&nbsp;cursor head to&nbsp;be responsive and&nbsp;fit to&nbsp;the size of finger tip while user trying to touch and drag the cursor.</p>

            Hi Josh,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesnâ€:tm:t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that youâ€:tm:ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<h2>            copy here versus copy</h2>
                    <p>In PPT I want to right click a graphics object and copy it to memory and paste it into a different presentation.......simple? (this would be the equivalent of CTRL C on the keyboard). &nbsp;The problem is, usually (apparently at random), but not always, &nbsp;I get
 an annoying little menu&nbsp;with COPY HERE jumping up (keyborad equivalent of CTRL D which does not copy to memory but only to the page). How do I stop this annoying little&nbsp;menu from always jumping up first. Usually if I then immediately re-right-click &nbsp;I get
 the larger menu with the simple copy command. I don't have a problem with the copy here command. I would just like to be able to tell the computer&nbsp;to deault to bringing up the larger menu first.</p>

    <title>Open Office Writer vs MS Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thefonebug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Office Writer vs MS Word</h2>
                    <p>I miss having the function available in Open Office that auto-completed words that I had typed before, a custom dictionary. I was in medical school and taking notes on my&nbsp;laptop (when no one else carried a PC, and hardly any phones back then) which made
 easy work of rearranging notes into a coherent outline, adding hyperlinks for demos referenced by the professor, and putting things in order if the instructor forgot to mention something and added it later in the lecture. Also, scribbling as fast as you can
 with pen and paper can make even your own handwriting difficult to make sense of. With a laptop, you have the option to look things up and adjust your notes for accuracy. In no time, the entire class was asking me to email my notes to them that evening. I
 was happy to help. It is a real time-saver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I really miss, and I've asked forever if and when MS would put this feature in Word. It's the autocomplete I mentioned. In medicine, there are a lot of big and complicated words. If I began to type "cardiopulmonary" for example, I would just get the
 'c 'and 'a' typed and "cardiopulmonary" would pop up and I just hit enter and kept right on taking notes. Forever, I have used Open Office until last year. The laptop I bought had Office 365 on it and it hasn't cost me a thing so I began using it, believing
 it was probably superior and now I could benefit by using it and not losing money to get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's got me thinking. Please advise if I need to put this post in another area. Is Word really superior to Writer? Can anyone give some specific examples of why Word is a superior product to Writer by Open Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm considering going back to the free and open-source option but I'd like to know what&nbsp;I may be sacrificing by leaving Word. Also, what are some disadvantages to Word that I'd be thrilled with not dealing with if I switch back to Open Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the flip side of the coin, what are the shortcomings of Open Office that might change how I feel once I begin using it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, the distant past, it was an issue to compose a document in Open Office and save it as a Word compatible file type only to have the people you sent it to reply back that the file was just nonsense as if corrupted, it did not translate well at
 all. I am pretty sure this is not even an issue anymore using the latest versions of Word and Writer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any feedback I can use to choose which piece of software I would be happier with. Again, tell me if this post should be posted elsewhere, I was just using my last post as a jumping off point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, everyone.</p>

            In Word, you could create a series of AutoCorrect entries, but I would use cp for&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">cardiopulmonary rather that ca, which is common to many other words and if&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">cardiopulmonary
 popped every time that you tried to use it, it would become a nuisance, though hitting CTR+z would remove it and let you continue typing the required word that contained ca.</span>

<h2>            Outlook.com doesn&#39;t want to send SMS security code to my number.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I wanted to add two-step verification to my several email accounts under my live custom domains and to make some settings. So a lot of repeated sign-ins. I received and used a lot of SMS security codes (about 20-30 in two hours). But at once when I try
 to sign in to any of my account with two-step veryfication and text verification code to my phone number, it says:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span><b>We couldn't send the code. Please try again.</b></span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>When I try to add this phone number to another email address, it says:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>You've requested too many codes already, so try adding different security info. Be sure to use your real phone number or email address—you can't access your account until it's verified.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I looked for this issue, but I didn't find any info. Maybe I should wait a month until I can use the number again?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I looked to&nbsp;<b><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support</a></font></b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;clicked&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=294733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I

By the way, there is also a limit on the number of accounts you can setup in a day (like 5); but if you use a proxy browser, like Tor, you can switch IP addresses and setup a lot more. &nbsp;However, it does not solve the problem of getting the above error message
 when you have sent too many codes to the same recipient email address in a week. &nbsp;But, the fix or workaround would be to try to setup multiple alias on your receiving email account, or multiple alternate email accounts, and use those. &nbsp;Good luck!!<br />

            This will have to be done through VBA. Can you please post a screenshot of your worksheet without any confidential / sensitive data? Make sure that your row numbers and column letters are visible in the screenshot. This would help us to understand your problem better and come up with a solution.

<h2>            Where are my old hotmail rules after switching to outlook.live.com&#63;</h2>
                    I migrated to outlook.live.com from hotmail.com a long time ago. When I had hotmail I had a rule that sent all email from a particular sender to a special folder. That rule is still operating, but I no longer want it to operate. However, I cannot find
 the rule. It is not on the list of rules in outlook. Where can I find it?

<h2>            Build 10158 old store tile not properly removed from start - fixed in 10162&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading in the all apps list there's an entry for what I assume was the 8.1 windows store. Clicking on it doesn't do anything, there's no uninstall option and there's no app package for that entry installed. Seems just some leftover that wasn't removed
 during migration.</p>

<p>
</p><p>How do I get rid of this? It's really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> After updating to 10162 the @{blahblah... entry is still there, but now you can right click and select 'Uninstall' and it's gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah! Finally 😄</p>

                    I am taking online classes and I am required to post to a discussion forum on Blackboard, I will get docked for attaching a file instead of copying and pasting it into the forum.&nbsp; My current assignment that I need to post I used equations and they will
 not copy and paste correctly into the message area.&nbsp; I used over 40 equations in and am really hoping that there is a way I can just copy and paste it somehow and not have to redo all the equations.&nbsp; I am using Microsoft Word 2010 and Windows 7 is my current
 operating system.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't really understand what you mean by above. You should always try to code in a logical order of what you expect to take place.</p>
<p>Sometimes you might find that code like your case 2 will work but I personally wouldn't even consider using it because it is not in logical order to save the workbook after quiting the application.&nbsp; If code closes a workbook before finishing the code then
 logically you cannot always&nbsp;expect the remaining code will run.</p>
<p>Even if your case 2 does run, if used in a production application there is a possibility that it will fail in another version of Excel.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;I see it you have the following 3 options and if one of them does not achieve you aims then please tell us what it is you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Sub Save_Exit_1()<br />
&nbsp; 'Saves workbook then closes workbook and Excel.<br />
&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Save<br />
&nbsp; Application.Quit<br />
End Sub</p>
<p><br />
Sub Save_Exit_2()<br />
&nbsp; 'Will prompt to save workbook if any unsaved changes.<br />
&nbsp; 'Closes workbook and closes Excel.<br />

<h2>            Nokia lumia 630</h2>
                    <p><strong>I have a Nokia Lumia 630 .The problem is that I cannot connect to my home wifi network.Evertime I enter the password it shows the message "your phone cannot connect to the wifi network'network name'".But this happens only with the home network and
 a mobile network of a friend's phone when sharing stuff through xender .I don't think there's an issue in the router because my brothers android phone and the laptop connects to it without any problem.I cant connect to the him wifi but I can connect to others
 ones.This is a disaster just imagine wasting money for mobile data when there a wifi network at home.</strong><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a48f4481-f38c-4b87-997f-9689f967c6f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a48f4481-f38c-4b87-997f-9689f967c6f1" /></a></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>There are several possible reasons why you're encountering this issue. To isolate this, please provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Have you tried deleting the Wi-Fi from your known networks and add it again?</li><li>Does performing a soft reset after deleting the know networks made any differences? Press and hold
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> button until your phone vibrates and restart.</li></ul>

<h2>            Setup could not find any available products to install. Please contact your system administrator. Office 2013 error message.</h2>
                    I have been trying to install Office 2013 Home (CD) on my computer. I bought the computer with an Office 365 trial version installed in it, which I have uninstalled. But I keep getting this error message. The Fixit tool has not resolved the issue yet.
 How do I walk around this problem?

            Thanks for your reply. After following the steps you outlined, I still get the same error message. By the way, the software is on a CD, not a download from the Microsoft website. I have even copied the files to my root directory, still got the same error
 message. What else should I do?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a quick question before we start with troubleshooting the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it read on the disk from which you are trying to install Office 2013?
</li><li>If you are not able to install from disk, you may also try to install from website.
</li></ul>
<p>To install office follow the below steps provided</p>
<ul>
<li>Login to the website&nbsp; <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a> with your Microsoft credentials used to register Office 2013.</li><li>You will be routed to your "My Account" page. You will see your Office product and the Install button as well.</li><li>Once you are in the page you will be able to see the install option please click on install
</li><li>After you click on "Install" it will provide you an option to "Run" or "Save". If you click on "Run", it will download and start the installation after the download would finish
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get back to us with more details so that we may assist you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

                    One is led to believe that some dispicable socially unacceptable content, or content that is deemed malicious or contrary to MS privacy standard, is the only type of content that will be removedby Bing. Just how naive do you think we are? Removing some
 content begins the censorship, and ultimately will lead to, perhaps, political ideas or searches that might no be in the best interests of it's advertisers. Or, the only search results shown are results that better serve it's advertisers, such as not showing
 competators websites. The list goes on and on, as far as you can imagine. And you know that it's heading that way. You can add the US to the list of countries that filter content, because as long as I'm being led away to one corner of the internet, and cannot
 go where I want to go, then it is censorship. And that puts us in the company of Saudi Arabia, China, North Korea etc. I always thought that we were better than that. That we walked the higher moral ground. You couple the censore

            I do agree with whatever morals point of view has been projected. But when it comes to competition with other web browsers, Microsoft or bing is found lagging behind. I don't know how this fine balance between the two requirements like 'being honest and
 not rude' at the same time&nbsp;will be achieved. Lovers of both Microsoft edge and Bing are always looking forward to a brighter future in the longer term.

<p>I disagree. No Activation is not a major show stopper.</p>

<p>Well there you go, installing beta software on a main machine is just asking for trouble. I hope at the very minimum you are dual booting.</p>

<h2>            Office for Mac 2011 documents become read only when saved on mac network shared folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have two computers running the latest Mavericks (10.9.3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One is sharing a folder using the standard folder sharing in the system preferences panel.</p>
<p>The other is connected to the first one using afp or smb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I save an office document on this shared folder it becomes instantly "read only" and thus cannot be modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This ONLY happens with Microsoft Office created documents... all the other documents when created/saved on this folder can be freely modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Carlo</p>

            <p>This is an access permissions problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client machine needs to authenticate to the source machine. &nbsp;So the user on the client machine needs an account on the source machine and needs to log on to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the machine can't tell the two users apart so it sets the file read-only thinking it is already "in use".</p>

            <p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately in this case I have already created a "sharing only" user on the source machine and the client machine logs on the source machine with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "sharing only" user obviously has read-write permissions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After further investigation, this odd behaviour only happens when the file is saved in sub folders of the source machine (it works fine at the root level of the shared folder).... even though they all have the same permissions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be the "invisible" temporary folder bug ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas ?</p>
<p>

            Perhpas a “sharing only” user does not have permission to open hidden read/write files. This capability is required to avoid Read-Only problems.

<p>Hi Ana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you send a message by accident, you can try to recall the message from the recipients by using the
<strong>Recall This Message</strong> feature in Microsoft Outlook. The message recall feature lets you recall, replace, or delete messages that you have sent.
<br />
<br />
To recall or replace a message, follow the steps provided on the article below:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/recall-or-replace-an-email-message-that-you-sent-35027f88-d655-4554-b4f8-6c0729a723a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recall or replace an email message that you sent</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the message recall is not successful one or more of the following reasons are:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The recipient is not using Outlook.<br />
</li><li>The recipient is not logged on to the mail service provider.<br />
</li><li>The recipient is using Cached Exchange Mode and is working offline.<br />
</li><li>The original message is moved from the Inbox. This can occur when rules are used.<br />
</li><li>The original message is opened first and marked as read. This can occur when the message is displayed in the Preview Pane or Reading Pane.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you require any further information, feel free to let us know.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

    <title>Deleteing Messages is slow in Outlook. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> praetorian55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleteing Messages is slow in Outlook.</h2>
                    When I delete an email message from any of my folders, Outlook then takes me
<u>right back to the folder</u> every single time, instead of to the next message, which slows me down such a lot.
<br />
<br />
After deleting a message Hotmail used to move onto the next message, and open it automatically, thus saving my time having to move the cursor around onto the next message myself and then and click and wait for next message to open.
<br />
<br />
It's a real time waster when you've got lots of messages to go through. <br />
<br />
(I need to open the message and read it in order to be able to make a choice as to whether or not to keep or delete it, so the delete button next to the message is not really of much use to me.)<br />
<br />
It was so much quicker on Hotmail to sort the messages and delete the ones you didn't want.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this time waster? And if so is it possible we can get someone at Outlook to listen to us about our concerns?<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi praetorian55,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your frustrations about your time being wasted when you are trying to delete an email message from your folders&nbsp;in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To inform you, the feature that opens the next message after deleting the other one is not currently available in OUtlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mean time, if you think that feature is a must to have, you can post your suggestions and feature request&nbsp;on our
<a href="https://feedback.live.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Feedback</strong></a> page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other questions, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello Alden D.,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply, which has helped to explain at least, that the useful feature that we used to have on Hotmail is no longer with us on Outlook. That's a pity it was such a time saver.<br />
<br />
However, I think I've found another way to speed things up. I've recently started to familiarize myself with some of the keyboard shortcuts available and when using them I've found out that it can make things a little bit quicker than using the cursor, at least.<br />
<br />
It's not the ideal solution, but it's a step towards speeding things up I suppose.<br />
<br />
The ideal solution to me would of course for Outlook to keep the useful tools we had on Hotmail. I hear people telling me how bad Outlook is compared to Hotmail and after seeing for myself how things are I am starting to appreciate their point of view.<br />
<br />
What galls me the most I suppose is that we had no choice as to whether we as individuals wanted to keep Hotmail, which many of us know, trust and love; or whether we wanted to switch to Outlook. We had no choice. Outlook was thrust upon us whether we wanted
 it or not.<br />
<br />
Money talks eh? <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>No.&nbsp; The issue occurred on every appointment</li><li>The exact error is "you cannot make changes to contents of this read-only folder."</li><li>This appointment is located in the Birthday Calendar. I am not sure I am the creator of the appointment in the birthday calendar but from the content of the appointment, it looks exactly like another appointment in normal calendar folder.</li><li>I have attempted to delete this appointment in the birthday calendar from Outlook.com, Outlook 365 and Outlook 2016.&nbsp; All attempts failed.</li></ul>
<p>Hopefully I had replied your queries.&nbsp; Thanks for assisting.</p>

    <title>Cell borders will not print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nivek916  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cell borders will not print</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and am using Excel 2016 on my laptop. &nbsp;I have a spreadsheet that I am trying to print that includes cell borders for selected cells in the spreadsheet. &nbsp;When I open the spreadsheets, I can see the borders and when I click on print, I can
 see the borders in the print preview. &nbsp;However, when I actually try to print the spreadsheet, none of the borders will print. &nbsp;If I check the box to print all the gridlines, all but those where the borders have been established will print. &nbsp;I made sure I had
 the latest drivers downloaded for my printer, but nothing seemed to help. &nbsp;I even tried saving the spreadsheet to PDF, but the document that was saved did not include those borders. &nbsp;I'm not sure what to do to get this to print...or even save as a PDF so I
 can print it from there. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated!!</p>
