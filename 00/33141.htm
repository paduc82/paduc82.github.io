<h2>            Temporary files will not delete</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10.&nbsp; I cannot delete my temporary files.&nbsp; I have tried at least 10 times and it doesn't work.&nbsp; I have tried going through the Disk Cleanup window as well and that doesn't delete the temp files either.&nbsp; They are
 clogging and killing my drive.&nbsp; I have no storage left!&nbsp; Has anyone had this problem as well?&nbsp; What can I do?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks but I already did that last night and it didn't help.&nbsp; I did it again this morning but the computer is still saving more and more temp files and will not delete them no matter how many times I try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest next?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to access my hard drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikesh k.  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to access my hard drive.</h2>
                    Hi, I just changed my mother board from evga to gigabyte. When I turned on the computer, it would go to the "start windows normally and the last good configuration screen" and when I select either one of those, the windows corporation loading screen comes
 up and freezes and it restarts. I tried to re-install the operating system, but when the screen comes for selecting where I want to install, my hard drive doesn't show up. So then I hooked that hard drive into another computer, then I see it on my computer
 but when I try to go into it, it says that I need to format it before I can use it. And when I right click and go to properties, both used space and free space show up as zero. Then I tried to see if I could access it through command prompt but it says that
 it cannot read the file system. What should I do to retrieve data? or do you believe that my hard drive is corrupted? Please help.

<p>If you change Motherboards, you normally have to reinstall Vista.</p>
<p>How to reinstrall Vista:</p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

<p><span>Windows Vista Installation Super Guide</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installation &gt;<span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for
 latest Vista Drivers for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></span></p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>To recover your Data:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download/Save the above Knoppix Live CD ISO file.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.</span></p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>Error when Uploading pictures on Win 10&#58; &#34;Something Went - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimbot2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error when Uploading pictures on Win 10&#58; &#34;Something Went Wrong.&#34; Cannot upload&#33; now have to use SD Card reader.</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 two days ago.&nbsp;I am having a problem uploading pictures from my digital Camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;use a finepix J50 camera. I use the photo app and connect my camera. A dialog box says "Found 145 photos." I click "Import". Dialog box says "Sorry, something went wrong" I click "Try again."&nbsp; and then "Something went wrong", over and over.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried finepix software, which is what I have always used. Pops up:&nbsp;"found 145 photos". click import and error message pops up and "could not import pics." "File not found"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded new finepix software, And "found 145 pictures". Click Import. And it downloaded pics (At first), and then there was a message "There was a problem importing pitcures". And it listed 145 pics that "Could not be imported." The newest version shows
 thumbnails being download, so it knows the pic are there, but it says:&nbsp;"Problem. Could not import."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, no photo software is&nbsp;working for&nbsp;importing pictures. Not the old finepix, not the newest version of finepix, and not windows app. I have racked my&nbsp;brain trying to solve this.&nbsp;I reset the "Pictures Library."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have to use the SD Reader, Which is&nbsp;a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Note: I used this J50 camera and plugged it into another windows 10 computer, and&nbsp;the pictures&nbsp;downloaded fine, so I know the camera is compatible. Just not working on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why&nbsp;can I not&nbsp;import pictures from digital camera to computer??? Is it a bug? Did a file go missing?
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are getting an error while trying to upload photos. Let me help you resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to test the issue by manually copying a single photo and save it. Check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would also suggest you to check if you have permissions to the folder to which you are importing the photos.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow these steps and give permissions to the folder:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key + X </span></strong>on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At the command prompt, type “<strong><span>takeown /f &lt;foldername&gt; /r /d y</span></strong>” without quotes and then press
<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong>. (Replace &lt;foldername&gt; with the path of the folder).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then, type “<strong><span>icacls &lt;foldername&gt; /grant administrators:F /T</span></strong>” without quotes and hit enter. (Replace &lt;foldername&gt; with the path of the folder).</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Using the above mentioned commands, we took the ownership of the folder and then assigned the Administrators group
<strong><span>Full Control</span></strong> Permissions for the folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope the information helps. Please reply with the updated status and details. We will be happy to assist you accordingly.</span></p>

            <p>Okay. So I tried the Admin Command Prompt and entered the fields as you said, and after a couple tries it said "Access Denied." for both command inputs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also tell you that when I set up the computer when I first got Win10 I may have unchecked a box that may have said something like "Allow Microsoft to verify my Identity?" So maybe Microsoft wasn't able to verify my identity?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a couple days ago I went to verify my identity with Microsoft, (as indicated as necessity from&nbsp;control pane/action center)&nbsp;and the email box that the code was going to is no longer a valid email, so I clicked an option to verify it a different way. So
 I had the email/code sent to my valid email. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And then the dialog box said that it would be&nbsp;1 month before my identity could be verified. Therefor I wonder if I have to wait 1 month to be granted "Administrator rights"?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also did as you suggested to try to save a picture from Internet to my Libraries Folder and it said "You do not have permission, contact the administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it seems to only happen with photos so far, as I was able to save a Word Document no problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>***And also another problem I am having is the toolbar on the bottom right of my screen does not allow me to open action center, and doesn't allow me to adjust speaker volume. The icon says "New Notifications" and I click on it and nothing happens. On my
 dads win10 computer when he clicks that icon a window opens up from the right. And when I click on the speaker icon nothing happens.</p>

            <p>I fixed it!!! I went to the Libraries Folder &gt; Pictures, right-click, properties, and clicked "Restore Default". And now I can save pics to the Library, it displays them, and also the digital camera downloads pics now.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Alright. So part of the problem is fixed. I can import pics from camera now. I can save pictures from Internet to the "Pictures" folder, but I cannot save pictures to sub-folders that I created in "Pictures" folder. It says I don't have permission. For instance
 I cannot save a picture to a subfolder such as&nbsp;"Scenery" or "Family" or any other one I created, but I can save it to "pictures" folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I download that picture of Scotland, and save it to the Pictures folder, &nbsp;I can&nbsp;then drag it into the correct sub-folder labeled "Scenery", and I always get a prompt that&nbsp;says "Access Denied, you must have Administrator Permission." I can, however,
 click "Continue" and it WILL put the scenic pic into the correct sub-folder, only after I click continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to take ownership of the pictures folder using the command prompt and it said "Access Denied."</p>

            <p>Okay. I believe the problem is now fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right clicked on "pictures" and clicked "Properties" then Security to set permissions. What I found is that there were 6 different accounts all with various degrees of permission. Most with partial permissions. One was "account unknown", another just a
 bunch of random digits, and yet another that I did not recognize. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, of the 6 accounts with permission, I kept 3 and removed the rest. I kept "SYSTEM, Administrator, and another with my name on it. So, by removing those other accounts, I solved the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am wondering where did these other accounts come from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ways problem is solved now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***note. I imagine I could've really messed things up if I deleted the other accounts with permissions. Whew, that was close.

            <p>Problem seems solved now. One final thing I had to do right-click each subfolder within the "Pictures" Folder, that contains pictures, click, "properties", then "Security" and then edit permissions and allow full control for :</p>
<p>Homeusers (myname)-PC\homeUsers. When I did this to each sub-folder I can now move/save pictures without the "Access Denied, need permissions" dialog prompt. It works all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution I think that worked for the problem uploading pictures from camera was to click "Libraries", right-click "Pictures" folder, click "properties" and "restore defaults".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, the "notification" icon on toolbar at bottom right corner now works as well, which may have been fixed in a recent update. Idk</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems fine now.</p>

<p>I have tried all methods here to solve this issue with no success - I was able to successfully import 1000+ photos - but before the last 150 or so were imported, I received the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to start the import again, it shows there are 150 left, but it still reports same error.&nbsp; It writes about 2 pictures and 1 video and then the error happens.&nbsp; Perhaps there is an issue on the phone?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the log which shows what the issue actually is?&nbsp; There's no permission issue as I tried to create a folder c:\temppics folder&nbsp;and still get the error.</p>

            Hi,
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;that reinstall go to Acer's website and find and&nbsp;reinstall the Windows 7 Drivers for your Laptop Model Number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the computer you are on to get here to download/save the Network Adaptors/Wi-fi Drivers for it first&nbsp;&gt; copy them to flash drive &gt; transfer and install them on the Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can use the Laptop to get the rest of the drivers from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Driver Downloads:</span></span></strong></p>

</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you call a mobile/landline number from Skype, a random number will appear to the recipient. If you want them to know that you're the one calling them, I highly recommend to set up caller identification.</p>

<h2>            moving my xbox account profile to my daughter&#39;s new profile</h2>
                    <p>When we first bought our xbox, my daughter didn't have a phone or email address.&nbsp; Now I want to set up a family profile so that I can limit her screen time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Until now, she has used my email address and password, and the associated xbox "stuff" is associated with me.&nbsp; She doesn't want to lose all her game profiles, history and stuff.&nbsp; how can I just move everything related to gaming from my account to my daughter's account?<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Maybe what I&nbsp;mean is moving my daughter's "gamertag" from my account to hers, but I'm not sure what a gamertag is.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Thanks<br /></p>

<h2>            video_memory_management_internal BSOD after updating to Windows 10 version 1803</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">&nbsp;I am a Intel 600p SSD user my laptop is ACER VX 15 and this SSD was facing issue with this new update version 1803. Microsoft released the patch KB4100403. After the installation of the patch system is stable but now i am getting
 a new major problem and its a graphics driver problem. My computer is freezing on the startup of Windows 10. Its just freezes there and other times it give me this BSOD error
<strong>video_memory_management_internal</strong>. My laptop has Intel HD 630 graphics card and Nvidia GTX 1050Ti. Display is connected to<strong> Intel HD Graphics 630</strong>. I tried updating my driver to latest version but that doesnt work. I tried installing
 driver given on my manufacturer website and that also doesnt worked. Drivers given on my laptop's support page are out-dated. They have version 21.20.16.4526 on their website but the latest is 24.20.100.6094. But the thing is on both the drivers my laptop
 is freezing on the startup. So I have uninstalled the graphic drivers and now running
<strong>Microsoft Basic Display Adapter .</strong> Now my laptop is working fine. Is it ok to run this graphic adapter from Microsoft as it is the only way right now for me. I have dump file too. I am attaching it. Is there any chances that it could be the
 hardware problem like my integrated graphics card got corrupted or something or it is just a software driver problem ? PLEASE HELP !

<h2>            Windows 10 - Update Stuck in Restarting mode</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspirion all in one desktop computer (2014) and upgraded to Windows 10 several months ago. Periodically, upgrades are installed without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, however, after installing a Windows update (including the install progress screens), it is stuck on the Restarting page. &nbsp;It has been there for over 90 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? Ctl-Alt-Del is not available at this point (I've tried), and I don't want to unplug or force a shutdown if I can avoid it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Akheel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick -- and helpful -- response. &nbsp;It worked!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a hard reboot, but the problem persists. &nbsp;Windows did recognize that there was a problem with the latest update attempt and uninstalled it, but it again became stuck in "Restarting" mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did a second reboot and this time it worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One follow-up question:</p>
<p>The Windows 10 ISO is 4.3 GB in size, but the max storage on most CD's is 900 MB. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I missing something? &nbsp;Should I simply use another format with more storage capacity (e.g. flashdrive)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p>Matter not resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know enough to do a hard re-start, but Windows 10 continues to fail to install the Windows update, specifically,&nbsp;Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3147458).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been over two weeks and Windows has not corrected this problem. &nbsp; The computer continues to cycle through attempting to install the update, then when unsuccessful, removing it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides wasting time and resources, it also leaves me vulnerable without this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, Windows! &nbsp;Help, someone. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>I am having this same issue with one of my computers (HP ProDesk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the updates the computer gets stuck at restarting (CTRL+ALT+DEL) does nothing. &nbsp;After leaving it over 4 hours it is still stuck at restarting and I have to reboot it. &nbsp;Then update says it has failed and the computer attempts to remove it.
 &nbsp;After many reboots I can log back into the PC (at this point it will work for short periods of time and spontaneously restart). &nbsp;After enough restarts it will work fine... until it attempts to install the update again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I basically have no use of the computer for half a day when this happens.</p>

<p>I will be using skype in a limited way and only want a few numbers, some just for one call. How do I just 'make a call' on skype. There is no way I am going to sync my contact list with skype - that is intrusive!</p>

            Hi Claire
<br />
<br />You must have a little Skype credit to male calls like this . . .
<br />
<br />Click the Calls button (looks like a phone receiver)
<br />
<br />Then the dial pad will appear
<br />
<br />Dial the number and click the call button
        </p>

<br />
<br />The trial period covers Skype to Skype calls, it does not cover calling landlines or mobile phones that do not have Skype
<br />
<br />See this link for how to purchase a little Skype credit to add to your account:

            Hi Claire
<br />
<br />Skype to Skype calls are always free, Skype to landline or non-Skype mobile phones are not free
<br />
<br />If the person you are calling has Skype, then you must send them a message and if they accept that message, they will be added to your contacts and form there you can call them
<br />
<br />If you intend using Skype to make Skype to Skype call other people, you must add them as contacts

            If the person you want to call has a Skype account already, you can make free calls over the Internet, but if you want to call them by mobile (cellular) or landline, you need to have Skype credit on your account. 
<br />
<br />To make a free call, follow these steps.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1261bac-a35d-49e2-b220-e58d77019c17?upload=true" />

<h2>            Please Add Voice command short cuts to Games and Apps</h2>
                    MS please add voice command short cuts for games and apps. It would be easier if there was games and apps settings where u can choose a preselected short cut. example: "Xbox go to Ghost" for Call of Duty: Ghost or "Xbox go to BF4" for Battlefield 4. Also
 the ability to turn off voice commands because friends can be jack wagons by saying "Xbox turn Off" in a middle of an intense match online.

<p>Friends can already be dicks by walking over and turning off the tv or messing with the remote. The same etiquette applies.
</p>
<p>I do agree that there should be shortcuts. They could even make them customizable, so you can call your shortcut whatever you want.</p>
<p>You also need to be able to set up voice commands for things that currently have NO command. Like quitting a game/app, for instance. The function exists, under menu button-quit. Why not allow the user to create custom voice commands for any existing function
 in the system?</p>

<p>Once you've said "Xbox, Select" everything you can use gets highlighted Green. Then you only have to say the word, and not "Xbox go to". As for "Xbox, go to Battlefield 4" versus "Xbox, go to BF4"... come on now. The time saved is micro.</p>

<p>Saying Xbox select is one shortcut but what I'm talking about is having a selection of shortcuts for a certain game or app. Example: Saying "Xbox select or Xbox go to Forza Motorsport 5" vs saying "Xbox go to Race" is a shortcut.</p>
<p>Instead of saying the whole name have the ability to change it to a selection of names like ( Race, Race 1, Race 2, or record a custom name for it).</p>
<p>So if u have game with a similar name or genre u can still call it what u want.
</p>
<p>Saying "Xbox select Kinect Sports Rivals Preseason" vs "Xbox select Rivals" shortcut right? I realize that time saved is micro but it's suppose to be instant.</p>
<p>I love that I can just say "Xbox select ------ " and boom ur there but a shortcut would be nice too.</p>

<p>Hi Oge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that some outdated drivers caused conflicts with your computer after installing the latest update. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to confirm, which browser were you using to access the video streaming websites?
</li><li>Does this happen when using other browsers?</li><li>Are you using a third-party antivirus program?</li><li>Does this happen when playing videos stored locally on your computer?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As initial troubleshooting, we suggest performing a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> to find out if this behavior is caused by a third-party program. This will load Windows with minimal drivers and programs, preventing software conflicts from occurring. If the computer stops freezing while streaming videos in a clean boot environment,
 check the section <strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong> for what to do next.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: To return your computer back to normal, check the section <strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, check for updates for your graphics drivers by following the steps listed
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after performing a clean boot and updating your drivers.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I use Google Chrome most of the time, but also Edge. It has happened while watching Youtube in full screen on Chrome but also while watching a movie on Netflix via the app, so it's not a browser specific thing. Common factor is they were both in full screen
 mode.&nbsp;</li><li>No third party anti virus</li><li>So far, it hasn't happened with locally stored videos</li><li>I have performed a disk check and that came back ok.</li></ul>
<p>Some other issues I have experienced alongside this are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>BSOD with stop code: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED What failed: iaPreciseTouch.sys (but my touch screen has generally been working well).&nbsp;</li><li>And loud fan noise/overheating with minimal work being done.</li></ul>
<p>When i perform a clean boot, how do I check to see with drivers a faulty and needs replacement as the full screen issue is very unpredictable. Any more info will help, thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 loaded (icons, gadgets, etc.) all of a sudden an error message pops up saying "windows explorer has stopped working" then it tries to restart and shows this error message all over again. And it goes on and on and on until I close it (explorer.exe) with Task
 Manager. I did some windows updating yesterday (automatic updates) but I only installed the required updates. Everything worked perfectly yesterday after the update. Another thing is when I shut down my PC last night I got a steam error message right before
 the log off screen saying something about steam could not read some memory or something...
<br />
<br />
I checked for solutions but couldn't find anything. <br />
<br />
Here's what I tried:<br />
sfc /scannow - no errors/corrupted files found<br />
restoring system to an earlier point - didn't help<br />
playing around with startup programs - didn't help<br />
full system scan for viruses - nothing found (I'm using Norton360)<br />
<br />
My system specs:<br />
<br />
Intel Core i7 930 2.8GHz<br />
400 GB HDD<br />
6 GB RAM<br />
GTX470 1.2GB<br />
ASUS P6T SE <br />
Win7 64bit<br />
<br />
P.S. I can still run safe mode without any problems. I am using safe mode right now...<br />
P.P.S. After checking the event viewer I found that "thumbcache_dll" and "thumbcache_96.db"&nbsp; are causing the problem...<br />
<br />
Faulting application name: Explorer.EXE, version: 6.1.7601.17567, time stamp: 0x4d672ee4<br />
Faulting module name: thumbcache.dll, version: 6.1.7601.17514, time stamp: 0x4ce7c9d0<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000006<br />

Faulting application path: C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\system32\thumbcache.dll<br />
Report Id: 0f27cbd1-c3fa-11e0-866c-485b39203072<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any advice will be appreciated.

            Hi Chris Harris PN,<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>This issue occurs when all the following conditions are all true:<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span>• You have a removable drive configured as drive letter C.<br />
• You do not have a removable disk in the removable disk drive.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To resolve the issue, use one of the following methods:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Change the drive letter assignment for the removable drive to a letter other than C.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To change the drive letter assignments in Windows 7, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Log on to the computer as Administrator.<br />
b. Insert a disk in the removable drive.<br />
c. Click Start, right-click on <strong><span>Computer</span></strong>, and then click<strong><span>Manage</span></strong>.<br />
d. Click <strong><span>Disk Management</span></strong>.<br />
e. Right-click the partition, logical drive, or volume that you want to change, and then click<strong><span>Change Drive Letter and Paths.</span></strong><br />
f. Click the removable drive, click it, click <strong><span>Change</span></strong>, click the drive letter that you want to use, and then click<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</span></strong><b><br />

<h2>            Blank screen after &#34;Expanding windows files&#34; gets to 100&#37;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried installing Windows 7 now twice from Vista 32 bit. First time I went to sleep after it said it was good to go and 4 hours later my gf shut my computer off because it appeared to be in stand by and she couldn't get it to respond. I then started
 it again and watched it closely, after it got to 100% of the second part called expanding windows files I think it's called. What is causing this?

            <p>Please see the following instructions thanks to Amrita M, Microsoft Support, Moderator:</p>
<p>...you may check if you are able to boot in safe mode. To boot in safe mode first remove the Windows 7 DVD from the drive and press F8 key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Check if you are able to boot to the desktop now. If you are able to boot to the desktop without any error message, go to device manager and disable the display adapters and check if you are able to boot into normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get an error message saying that ‘installation cannot be completed in safe mode’, then press Shift+F10 key. That will open Command Prompt, from command prompt open Device Manager by typing ‘devmgmt.msc’ in the command prompt and then disable the display
 adapters and check if you are able to boot in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this allows you to boot to the normal mode and complete the installation process then go ahead and first update the display adapter drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if the computer works fine.</p>
<p>If that does not work<br />
Try rolling back the installation, this require that you power down the system.<br />
Turn it on a again and select the option to rollback the installation to Windows Vista</p>
<p>1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</p>

            The first part simply made my screen shut off at an earlier time. It only got to expanding windows files to 40 or 50% and shut the **** off. This is starting to get very frustrating. About like the time I bought Office2010 before it came out which came
 with 2007 to use in the mean time... They never sent me the email they said they would and when I finally noticed the program had been out a while I called and they said it was too late to get it free (i sure as **** wouldn't have bought that **** knowing
 what I know now, and this situation sure seems like another bad memory with microsoft)...... Anyway, trying the second part.... Wish me luck.
<div><br />
<div>*edit* by the way my display adapter keeps reinstalling with auto play or something, could that possibly be the problem? During the installation it always restarts at 20% and maybe it then turns it back on? Just a guess....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Okay... the chkdisk won't work either. The screen shuts off after it gets to the 4th stage. If anyone else has a suggestion I would greatly appreciate it.... I'm using the dvi input and my card has never had any problems to this date...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Somewhere in this process of trying to update to windows 7 something got screwed up. I cannot upgrade my drivers for my video card now back to where they were because an error pops up saying that the file is not a valid win37 file or extension or something.

            Hi Admed
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />We have been noticing this trend with high CPU after a fresh install or upgrade. Normally, Windows Defender is the culprit, in addition, Windows 10 Update applying updates and Defender definitions. Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint what is the exact source of the high CPU usage.
<br />
<br />Sometimes, just giving it a few days to a week, it will eventually settle down - this has worked in most cases. So, please consider that first. 
<br />
<br />I would first check Windows Update and make sure any pending cumulative updates are actually being installed succesfully. 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />Other things you can also check include:
<br />
<br />If you have Chrome installed, uninstall then reinstall it. 
<br />
<br />Disable your audio adapter in the BIOS to see if it helps or check for an updated driver or reinstall the existing one. 
<br />
<br />Look for blank icons on the desktop and delete them.
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Open This PC
<br />Right click your local drive where Windows 10 is install (you will see the Windows logo on it)
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Hardware tab
<br />What is the name of the drive listed?
<br />
<br />Is it an SSD?
<br />If it is, you might need to update the firmware.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps
<br />Disable all Background apps.
<br />
<br />Disabling Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to Disabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Also, check whats starting up with Windows.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click Startup tab
<br />Disable all except Windows Defender.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, 
<br />hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: problem reports
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Delete any failed or pending reports.
<br />
<br />Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications and actions &gt; Turn off "Show me tips about Windows."
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Andre Da Costa</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replaying</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>my machine model is Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming</span></p>
<p>My Windows 10 Version is 1903</p>
<p>Last Update check was performed 2 hours ago</p>
<p>my pc works fine but after updating my windows to 1903, windows defender still working after disabling it from Group policy editor and registry editor&nbsp;</p>
<p>i want to point out that after update was done, windefender was disabled and I couldn't enable it without type this line in power shell "<em><span><span><span><span><span><span>DISM.exe&nbsp; /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></span></span></span></span></span></em>"
 (I did so to be able to turn it off, but it still working any way)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need a way to permanently disable windefender service</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi AhmedGamal9070,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get clarity on this issue:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>How did you disable Windows Defender?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you using the Home edition or the Pro edition?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate the efforts taken by you in troubleshooting this issue. The details provided helps us to avoid repeating the steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods one by one to check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Reschedule the work of Windows Defender.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open the run window, type ‘taskschd.msc’ and click OK.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now, look at the left panel in the window that opens and expand (by double-clicking them) the following sequence of folders: Task Scheduler Library &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the Windows folder, find one called Windows Defender.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now, look at the panel in the center and double-click Windows Defender Scheduled Scan.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In General Tab, click to put a tick in a checkbox next to Run with highest privileges.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Finally, do the rescheduling part. Go to Triggers tab, and then click New. And customize the scan schedule according to your preference. Click OK to finish. Before you do, make sure
 the “Enabled” box is checked.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Add the Antimalware Service Executable
 to Windows Defender exclusion list.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Settings screen and click on Update and Security.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to Windows Security &gt; Virus &amp; Threat Protection &gt; Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under Exclusions, click Add or Remove Exclusions.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Choose to Add an Exclusion &gt; Process.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Type MsMpEng.exe and click Add.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the process should be consuming less CPU power and resource.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Awaiting your reply.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,
</span></p>
