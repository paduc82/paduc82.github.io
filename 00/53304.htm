<h2>            Windows 10 - Hotspot restriction</h2>
                    <p>I have assigned my home router MAC addresses for a number of laptops throughout the house where I have no problem with limited account Individuals using the Internet.</p>
<p>However it has come to my attention some are using the laptops hotspot to tether via games console etc.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can restrict the hotspot (switch it off) via the laptops but maintain access to the internet on them also.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Stiofan,<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no option to restrict or disable access of the hotspot on your laptop but you can put a password on it instead. This will allow you to limit the accessibility of the hotspot. The steps can be found on this

<h2>            Keep Getting Error Message When Transferring &#40;Import&#41; Old Mail from XP Home Outlook Express into Vista Windows Mail - with existing folders</h2>
                    In a previous thread, someone called Diana said:
<p>"My desktop is running XP Home with Outlook Express. I usually use the desktop computer to administer email. Now I'm away from my desktop and using my laptop only. I brought the files in the Outlook Express Identity on a flash drive. I have quite a few folders
 with many messages dating back quite a while.</p>
<p>I previously put these folders and the messages I had up to that point on the laptop (last summer) when I went out of town. Since then, I hadn't used the laptop to administer email.</p>
<p>Now I want to update my folders on the laptop with the messages I saved since last summer. I tried to import the messages, hoping I would not overwrite (and empty) any folders on the laptop, but only add messages that weren't already there (since I may have
 added messages to the laptop that I never transferred back to the desktop).</p>
<p>What I tried to do didn't work at all. I did the following: File - Import - Outlook Express 6 - OE Store Directory (only option available) - Browsed to location of Identity. Selected folder - Next. Then I get the error:<br />
"No messages can be found in this folder or another application is runnning that has the required files open. Please select another folder or try closing applications that may have files open."</p>
<p>Well, I know there are tons of messages in the selected folder, so that's not the problem. As for other applications that are open, the only things that are open are IE and Windows Mail, and I can't do the import with Windows Mail closed (as far as I know).</p>
<p>Any suggestions will be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that you don't need to use an 'export' tool to port the messages from Outlook Express to another program. You just copy the .dbx files. I copied the folder with the .dbx files from the desired identity, put the folder on a flash drive, copied
 to the laptop hard drive, and then tried to import them into Windows Mail on Vista Home using the import 'wizard'.<br />
<br />
I've tried different folder names for the destination of the .dbx files, and I've tried to rename each .dbx file so that there would not be a conflict (i.e., so it could just establish a new folder to deposit them or deposit them in local folder - in which
 case there would be a 'sent items.dbx' and a 'sent items2.dbx' etc..&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I've unchecked 'read only' on the folder properties.<br />
<br />
When I browse to the folder with the .dbx files and select it, and then click next on the 'wizard', I get the error, "No messages can be found in this folder or another application is running that has the required files open. Please select another folder or
 try closing applications that may have files open."<br />
<br />
The only applications open are Windows Explorer (which is not displaying this folder), Windows Mail, and the browser.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate your help in figuring this out."<br />
<br />
<br />
She was asked to transfer all the files at once, to maintain the directory structure, and to get back with us to let us know how it went. She hasn't since April, so I replied:<br />
<br />
It's obvious Diana is not going to let us know how it went, but I have the identical problem - except for using a hard drive enclosure. I successfully transferred these .dbx files to my new machine's document folder, running Vista 64 bit. I did everything as
 described above, including trying to transfer the whole file I called Outlook Express from documents to Windows Mail on the same computer. No matter what I do, I always get the same error message as stated above. Help please!<br />
<br />
Being that the original post was starting&nbsp;to get old, I thought I would try a new one in a desperate search for an answer.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Ed&nbsp;</p>

            I am pleased&nbsp;to say that I just solved my own problem. After spending many hours reading&nbsp;searches with lots of similiar&nbsp;problems, trying&nbsp;many of the&nbsp;suggestions, and not finding a&nbsp;successful solution, I finally found the silver bullet for me and maybe
 many others. This answer was not readily available in Microsoft support, or the tons of other computer based knowledge out there...maybe because it is so basic.&nbsp;Simple, but&nbsp;effective, with no more error messages - and my Outlook Express .dbx folder&nbsp;was fairly
 large - 1.10 gb. It is as easy as opening the last file in your identity folder, the one that opens the&nbsp;actual .dbx folders and .dbx email, select all, copy to a new folder you make, and use this new folder as your location when using the Windows Mail wizard.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>

<h2>            CAN BAD BLOCK ON SECONDARY &#40;STORAGE&#41; DRIVE CAUSE WINDOWS10 &#40;PRIMARY DRIVE&#41; TO STOP REBOOTING</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
<br />
I am using a primary SSID drive for my OS and other programs and a SCSI DRIVE for storage. Recently, I noticed that windows explorer is getting to be very slow when browsing pictures (especially) in the storage drive, so I did a sfc /scannow. Today, Windows10
 refused to reboote after a few attempts, afterwhich I did a F11-repair function.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now with the system repaired, I checked my Events Viewer and under system, I found this message under the WindowsLog/System:<br />
<br />
The device, \Device\Harddisk1\DR1, has a bad block.<br />
<br />
There had been many such warnings which I was not aware of. I am wondering if anyone experiences this. I am very sure my Primary Drive is in good shape, and suspect that the secondary drive is the culprit. I am seeking to confirm it before changing that drive
 entirely. Thank you for all your incoming advice.

Thank you, &nbsp;Dave. It clears my doubt that I have to now change my storage/secondary drive. I have suspected it to be. On the phone, just now, the technician insisted my SSID may have a problem. After using a SSIDToolkit, i found that it was not faulty.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Dave, as a matter of fact, I have one little favour to ask here, and if anyone can assist.
<br />
<br />
i) I have now CHKDSK-ed the troublesome drive and see if the problem persists to reconfirm my earlier findings. The trouble is CHKDSK-ing that half Terabyte drive is estimated to take 160hours, or 6 days. Can I interrupt it or should I continue? All data within
 that troubled drive has been out-of-reach as the drive has been dismounted with&nbsp;<br />
<br />
CHKDSK /f /r /x.<br />
</p>
<p>ii) If there a faster CHKDSK option, ie /r or /f or /x which makes it speedier?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I could wait out the duration with no productivity lost though since I still have access to the Internet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance community members, and Dave.<br />

            <p>Sorry estung I have been offline for a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkdsk /r takes a long time, however it checks for bad sectors and tries to mark them so they are not used</p>
<p>chkdsk /f runs fairly quickly, but only looks for and fixes simple errors on your disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to stopping chkdsk once it has started running, I would strongly advise against it as you can brick your hard drive . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some users say you can open a new Command Prompt Windows and run this command to stop chkdsk:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">taskkill /f /im chkdsk.exe</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">But again I would not recommend doing this as you may not be able to mount the disk again in Windows . . .</span></p>

            <p>Hi Dave..<br />
<br />
Sorry to have taken so long to respond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) You were right all along - my secondary harddisk (for data) was the cause of all my troubles. I have since changed it to a new one and it's been smooth sailing. The cause of the harddisk failure (too many bad sectors) was because twice I was interrupted
 by power failure and the backup didnt kick in on time.<br />
<br />
2) I decided to terminate my CHKDSK midway because the system detected insufficient space to move the data. What happened after that termination of CHKDSK was predictable - it destroyed it completely. If there is anyone reading this, and is doing CHKDSK, be
 forewarned that it will cause the bad disk to completely fail. I cant explain why because I am not IT savvy.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all your help and to the microsoft community members, thanks for your presence.</p>

            Even on your primary drive, a bad block doesn't affect the computer's ability to boot. Windows simply marks the block as 'bad' and doesn't use it in the future. Your computer boots from a disk sector that is not accessible to Windows, so Windows wouldn't
 know if it's damaged or not.

    <title>Display Resolution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenmulvenna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Resolution</h2>
                    <p>I have bought a Dell XPS with MS Win 10 and the high resolution of the screen is not handled in a way that make the computer usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 3 calls to MS to resolve this, they logged on to my pc remotely to fix twice, both time failing, then after 30 minutes trying to get a face to face appointment with an expert, MS gave me a contact number for a local partner who would help face to face.
 Unfortunately the number owner was an old man who had never owned a computer. I am not willing to deal with MS again, but having spent £1500 on my laptop, I cannot just throw it away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See 3 examples, 1 showing the alt text when hovering over the file explorer icon pinned to the task bar; 2 the file explorer that pops up when I selected a folder to save a download to; and 3 the view I was presented with when I tried to upload images 1
 to this website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note these are screen shots from a 13" laptop, making the text barely over a millimetre tall and thus illegible.</p>
<p>Increasing screen text, increases everything, not just the effected text making the screen effective area tiny as it is filled with the now over sized text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can advise how to fix this I would be so grateful...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Can you read the alt text of the pinned icon on the task bar?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea39f5a5-8764-46e7-96ae-356f04ec35a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea39f5a5-8764-46e7-96ae-356f04ec35a1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. How come I can read everything except the file browser?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f45cd68-7e4c-4147-8e25-79a45d065eb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f45cd68-7e4c-4147-8e25-79a45d065eb3" /></a></p>

            <p>I also have a 13" laptop with a high resolution screen (3200 x 1800).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my laptop to be usable, I first had to change the resolution to 1600 x 900. &nbsp;I have also tinkered with the scaling option described above. &nbsp;I tried 125% but that was too large. &nbsp;100% was too small. &nbsp;I eventually did custom scaling (which they don't recommend
 but do provide as an option) and set it to 110%. &nbsp;Just right, for the most part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed to do some tweaking, but discovered that Microsoft has removed the Display / Control Panel which contained more granular controls for text sizing of specific items such as Menus, Display Boxes, Icon Text, and others. &nbsp;There are several discussion
 threads about the removal of Display / Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 3rd party tools which provide this important resizing capability. &nbsp;I recommend
<strong><a href="http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.1836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Winaero Tweaker</a></strong> as it has these controls and others. &nbsp;Another, simpler tool is
<strong><a href="https://www.wintools.info/index.php/system-font-size-changer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Font Size Changer</a></strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A BIG issue with the install of Windows 10 Creators is that it resets all your custom text size settings, and specifically reduces the
<strong>Icon Text size</strong> to quite small. &nbsp;Icon Text size controls the size of text inside Windows File Explorer, and possibly is responsible for the tiny text in your Select File dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So get one of these 3rd party tools and adjust as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes.</p>

            <p>Thanks cnguinn, very helpful and I see you have had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the 3rd party app is installed, do you have to configure every app, or does it apply/give you some general rules? Also do you have to keep the laptop in lower res for it to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I bought the laptop, I would have bought a mac except for 1 app that will not emulate on mac's OS... In hindsight, a cheap laptop for that 1 app would have been a better solution. Mac's solved the problems with high res retina displays before they sold
 them, it is a shame MS don't seem as interested in the same level of quality as they used to...</p>

            <p>These 3rd party programs work the same as the old Display Control Panel setting worked. &nbsp;They affect specific user interface components (menu text, icon text, window title text) for everything on your machine. &nbsp;You do not need to apply these to each app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first got my hi-res laptop a couple of years ago, I was appalled that some programs (mostly older programs) did not have Hi-res detection and automatic scaling. &nbsp;This weakness of various programs resulted in very small menus and dialog boxes in these
 apps. &nbsp;I tinkered with the system's screen resolution, the scaling adjustments, the "zoom" adjustments available in several programs (but not all), and the Display setting for text sizes. &nbsp;Eventually I settled on using the half resolution of 1600x900 instead
 of the max 3200x1800. &nbsp;These is a slight drop-off in clarity, but this was the setting that made everything work visually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my machine auto updated to Windows 10 Creators this past week, it automatically reset all my display setting, and also removed the Display Control Panel, the User Interface to these settings. &nbsp;I was toast! &nbsp;Just adjusting screen resolution and their
 global scaling options came nowhere close to making my display usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I found the tools above. &nbsp;Winaero Tweaker is the more powerful tool, and allows me to have more granular settings. &nbsp;I still had to go into most every program and test the general display of that app, as well as the menus, dialog boxes, and the
 like. &nbsp;I was making global adjustment of various setting to accommodate all my programs. &nbsp;It took me several hours to get all the setting just the way I had them before, but I am very specific about how I want my display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that Microsoft made terrible decisions to remove the Display Control Panel and then to reset all the display settings. &nbsp;They have made a mess. &nbsp;Fortunately the settings still remain in the Registry, they just removed the User Interface to easily
 adjust these settings. &nbsp;The 3rd party tools give us back the UI that Microsoft removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck.</p>

<p>Mira, Si Compraste Gold con Restriccion de que se Renueve, No vas a poder Quitar la Tarjeta de Credito Hasta que Acabes con el Plazo Actual. Asi que te Recomiendo Abras una Cuenta de Paypal, Le Agregues Una Tarjeta de Credito o Debito. Aqui en Xbox.com Agregues
 tu Cuenta de Paypal como Forma de Pago. Luego Transfieres tu Deuda (Aunque sea de Ceros) de tu Tarjeta Actual a tu Cuenta Paypal. Luego en Unos Dias en Tu Cuenta Paypal Quitas la Tarjeta de Credito Y Listo No te Cargaran mas Nada Aunque Quieran.</p>
<hr />
<p>Y ya Cuando Quieras Comprar Algo, Agregale la Misma Tarjeta de Credito u Otra Diferente a tu Cuenta Paypal y Listo, Tu Controlas tus Gastos. (Esto Sirve para Gamertags que no Son Tullos Tambien).</p>

<p>Lo que quieres es quitar la renovación automatica al live? Si es asi solo debes entrar &nbsp;www.xbox.com-&gt;loggearte-&gt;entrar al link mi cuenta, veras un apartado donde dice Xbox live, abajito existe un link "Cancelar &nbsp;pago automatico" y listo.</p>
<p>Si quieres cancelar tu Xbox live, no se puede hasta que se caduque el plazo de tu Live(1 mes, 3 meses, 1 año).</p>

<br />Sorry, just the way the web app was created.

            Hi Michael, the Microsoft Catalog does not have the facility to search for multiple updates at once
<br />
<br />A workaround, if the updates are for the same version of Windows 10 is:
<br />
<br />In the search box enter Windows 10 and the Version No., for example:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 1709       
        </p>

<h3> kittymoneypenny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blinking hourglass - Windows 10 issue, Maybe Office Click to Run</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I upgraded to Windows 10. Ever since, I've had a blinking hourglass. I have checked for antiviruses, removed Chrome, stopped other programs, but nothing works. The only thing that stopped it temporarily was disabling Office 2013 Click to Run,
 but when I rebooted, it returned and would not let me disable it again. (It simply kept returning.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was very impressed by the Windows 10 demo, but so far, it's been nothing but headache. I cannot work on my laptop because of this issue and have spent the whole day trying to track it down. Help, please!</p>

            <p>Hi Kitty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience caused to you. <span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>clean boot</strong> and check as there could be some third party conflict.<br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or
 determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you
 start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you
 from following these steps.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Note: </span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<span>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</span>to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly get back to us with the updated status and we’ll be happy to help you further.</span></p>

            <p>A clean reboot was the first thing we did, and it did not help. I finally just started closing programs, and it looks like One Drive is the issue. If I remove it from startup, I don't have a problem. I'd been having problems with it crashing word the day
 before I upgraded. I had thought the upgrade would fix it. Instead, it looks like it's made everything worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we work the issue with One Drive and see if that helps? I've tried the advice on the forums already for this issue and it has not helped. the problem specifically in relation to Word. When I open word and try to open a file from One Drive, it crashes
 Word, which then closes and reopens. It does not happen if I open a file on the computer. I can drag a file from One Drive to my desktop fine and open it, but if I try to save to One Drive, it crashes Word.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth disappeared completely after uninstalling it with no way to get it back.</h2>
                    <p>Laptop&nbsp;</p>
Aspire VN7-792G(more details, see the link below)
<p>https://www.acer.com/datasheets/2015/4876/VN7-792G/NX.G6TSG.001.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is how it happened.</p>
<p>headphone was paired with laptop bluetooth, went out of range into my kitchen and bluetooth disconnected automatically.</p>
<p>went back to set to back on.</p>
<p>discovered bluetooth toggle button is missing(bluetooth became hidden in device manager too)</p>
<p>googled solution</p>
<p>found a solution to uninstall bluetooth drivers and reinstall them</p>
<p>bluetooth gone from device manager after uninstalling</p>
<p>reinstalling does not make any bluetooth options pop up, that is when i realized im screwed.</p>
<p>driver installing link &gt;&gt; https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support-product/6404?b=1 (bluetooth driver)</p>
<p>googled solution</p>
<p>no viable solutions found because all of them assumed that i could find bluetooth or any of it's remanents that has the option to find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont know how to proceed, bluetooth troubleshooting just showed me that my device does not support bluetooth.</p>
<p><span>Bluetooth Support service and handsfree service is set to automatic too. Just so you know i searched all that i could find before i finally give in and ask for help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>i uninstalled it by uninstalling all the device dropdown from bluetooth option in the device manager which was hidden before i delete it. im unable to uninstall it completely because halfway through the list, i think i must have uninstalled the core stuff
 which made the bluetooth device not be able to detect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix this? I dont know if it is a microsoft driver detection problem or a bluetooth driver problem both were fine before and this is the first time it happened</p>

<strong>How can I try to automatically fix common Bluetooth problems?</strong><br />
Troubleshooter can't detect that my computer support bluetooth and responded that bluetooth is not available on this device.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Bluetooth toggle is missing in Bluetooth &amp; other devices settings or can’t be turned on. How can I try to fix this?</strong><br />
It indeed is missing, only problem with this step is that there is no bluetooth drop down option, even when i view&gt;show hidden devices.</p>
<p>(i expanded all the list and still cant find one that has the word "bluetooth" in them)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Bluetooth doesn’t appear in Device Manager after I upgraded from a previous version of Windows to Windows 10. How can I fix this?</strong><br />
There is no "other devices" listed in device manager. with the settings of View&gt;device type. And therefore unable to proceed.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bluetooth doesn’t appear and there are no unknown devices listed in Device Manager. How can I fix this?</strong><br />
Did them step by step, even going thru the entire list thrice while the options are fully expanded, still unable to find any word that has "bluetooth" in them.<br />
<br />
<strong>I updated my PC to a newer version of Windows 10, and now my Bluetooth device doesn’t work anymore. How can I fix this?</strong><br />
The problem exits before any update of newer version of win10, i was hoping that the update would help but, no.<br />
<br />
<strong>I don't know the PIN for an accessory I want to pair with. Where can I find it?</strong><br />
Unable to proceed with this step as bluetooth is unable to be found in the first place.<br />
<br />
<strong>My Bluetooth device shows as Paired, but it isn’t working. How do I fix this?</strong><br />
Unable to proceed with this step as bluetooth is unable to be found in the first place<br />
<br />
<strong>Help… I can’t&nbsp; send or receive files over Bluetooth</strong><br />
Unable to proceed with this step as bluetooth is unable to be found in the first place<br />
<br />
<strong>My audio quality is low when Bluetooth settings is open or when I'm sharing files. What can I do to try to fix this?</strong><br />
Unable to proceed with this step as bluetooth is unable to be found in the first place<br />
<br />
<strong>Music doesn’t play over my Bluetooth speaker. How can I fix this?</strong><br />
Unable to proceed with this step as bluetooth is unable to be found in the first place<br />

<h3> rorylanelutter  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I repair an instalation of windows on a 2nd drive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I had a computer crash. My windows instalation on my original C drive wouldn't boot.</p>
<p>So, I installed a 2nd hard drive, and installed vista on it.</p>
<p>From this fresh instalation of windows, I can view the files on the original drive, and that drive, as a whole, seems to work fine still.</p>
<p>Is there a way to repair an instalation of vista while running a different instalation of vista?</p>
<p>The DVD seems to only be able to perform operations on the active instalation of vista.</p>
<p>Basically, I'd like to get around having to install all of my programs again.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You really can't repair the 2nd drive's Windows installation. You can run checkdisk on it.<br />
And you should be able to copy your files to the new drive. Without some (unknown to<br />
me) 3rd party software you will need to re-install your programs on the new drive. An<br />
added caveat is that the programs, registry, and other files on the old drive might be<br />
corrupt/damaged.<br />
<br />
Check with a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores)<br />
or the System maker's Support to see if the old drive installation can be saved. Of course<br />
that depends a lot on the methods you might have already tried.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p><br />
You will have to reinstall the Programs.</p>
<p>When Programs are installled, they&nbsp;are not just&nbsp;installed in&nbsp;Program Files.</p>
<p>The Program is also installed in part in the Registry and with associated Programs and processes througout the Operating System.</p>
<p>That is why you can not transfer Programs and they have to reinstalled.</p>

            Hi Ricardo, there is no paste command in Command Prompt as such, you use the copy command to both copy and copy and paste:
<br />
<br />This example will copy Example.txt from the users Desktop to D:\backup
<br />
<br />copy C:\Users\DaveM\desktop\Example.txt D:\backup\Example.txt
<br />
<br />
<br />Currently a better command than copy is xcopy, see the article below to read up on that command:

<br />The Command Prompt (CMD) uses DOS type commands. So COPY specifies the file to be copied and the destination where the copy is to be placed. So there is no need for Paste.

            The command line supports several types of copy commands:
<br />
<br />    Copy: If you just want to copy files or folders from location to the other.
<br />    Xcopy: A robust copy option suitable for copying the contents of a folder with subfolders to a destination folder. Xcopy is being superseded by Robocopy which provides the same functionality.
<br />
<br />Here are some examples how to use these copy commands.
<br />
<br />I want to copy the PowerPoint presentation named Evolution of the Settings interface.pptx to the Work folder located in the Groovy folder we created earlier. First, change your directory to the location of the file.
<br />
<br />In my case, the PowerPoint file is in my User folder under Documents. First, type the copy command, followed by a file name with open and close quotes then the file path destination, example: copy “Evolution of the Settings interface.pptx” c:\Users\Andre\Documents\Sample\Groovy\Work
<br />
<br />Since Robocopy has superseded Xcopy, we are just going to focus on using that command for this example. Robocopy includes a number of arguments you can use to copy lots of folders thoroughly. It’s particularly great for creating backups. For instance, if I want to make a backup copy of my Downloads folder to a folder on my thumb drive named Backup, this is how you do it.
<br />
<br />robocopy “D:\Users\Andre\Downloads” “F:\Backup”

    <title>Recovering files deleted from Cloud - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meatmancer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering files deleted from Cloud</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>[Note sure if this should be located here or in the "Managing my Xbox Live Account ..." forum, so if it's in the wrong spot, feel free to move it with my apologies!]</p>

<p>I was trying to clear up some room on the Cloud for the game I am currently playing (Fallout: New Vegas) by removing some old save files stored there (Fallout 3). When I deleted the save files from the Cloud, however, they were removed from my hard drive
 as well. Do I have any recourse at all?</p>

<p>This is irritating for all of the obvious reasons. Firstly, it didn't warn adequately (in my opinion) that anything I've stored on the Cloud is synced in such a way that it can't be removed without deleting it from my hard drive as well. Secondly, the idea
 that I have to upload all of my saved files from a game or none at all is bizarre. Why can't I back up the most important ones? And if I can (say, by going through them one-by-one, though I'm now scared to test this), why would the software assume that if
 I remove a title from the Cloud altogether, I must therefore want to remove it from my HD as well?</p>

<p>Obviously, losing hundreds of hours of gameplay/progress is maddening, so if there's a way to recover the lost files, I'd be forever grateful. As it is, I'm pretty unhappy with the way Cloud and my Xbox are linked as though in some kind of suicide pact.
 :P</p>

            There are no untrusted publishers listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; My publisher is Samsung Electronics CO., LTD.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to install a new driver for scanning software that stopped working with my business printer when I updated to Win10.&nbsp; The Samsung site says Win10 is
 supported, but I can't install.&nbsp; There NEEDS TO BE AN OVERRIDE here!

            <p>This worked for me as well. &nbsp;The process I used was:</p>
<p>Navigate to c:\windows\system32 </p>
<p>Right click on cmd.exe and choose Run As Administrator. </p>
<p>Typed cd\users\myUserName\downloads and pressed enter to get to the location of the file, this may be different for different people.</p>
<p>Typed the name of the file I wanted to run and pressed enter.</p>

            <p>Yes, that worked and thank you for your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this is a horrible way to workaround, ex\specially from a trusted publisher.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another prime example of a software author just tossing their product to the masses &amp; letting the users debug this mess.</p>

            THAT worked.... Thanks.<br />
<br />
It's amazing that such a complicated workaround is needed...and that "run as administrator" doesn't work when you select the original file with right-click.<br />
<br />
This workaroung saves the day...<br />
