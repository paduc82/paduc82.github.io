<h2>            Phrasing of &#34;Devices associated with your family&#8217;s Microsoft account&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Using the web portal, I am reviewing my devices and family devices in my account. There is wording that's confusing me. It's not clear what's being displayed in one case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using the Device View choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a family member, the header reads: "Devices [name] has signed into with a Microsoft account" (name elided by me)</li><li>Selecting myself, the header reads: "Devices you have signed into with a Microsoft account"</li><li>Selecting everyone, the header reads: "Devices associated with your family’s Microsoft accounts"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Okay... so I have to be reading this wrong, but am I? I interpret the last header to mean devices that belong to my family -- not to any particular family member. Are there two separate categories: family devices (like a PC) and personal devices (like a
 phone)?<br />
<br />
If I am wrong, I'd like someone from Microsoft to receive this feedback. Clearly, that last header can be taken two ways. I am just getting into Microsoft Family, and trying to learn the ropes. As a beginner, that phrasing is tripping me up. I'd like to believe
 I'm not the only beginner confused by that wording. Thank you so much.</p>

<h2>            Color Laser Jet Pro M252dw doesn&#39;t print after Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    HP tech support spent 2 hours trying to get my printer to work in Windows 10.&nbsp; I had my husband install the printer on his Windows 8.1 computer and there was no problem.&nbsp; Apparently, there is no driver for this printer which I bought only six weeks ago.&nbsp;
 I cannot return it.&nbsp; What choices do I have now?&nbsp; The printer is connected wirelessly.&nbsp; I've tried to access it on my husband's machine, but it is very cumbersome. Can anyone help?

    <title>Issue using some ProShow slide transitions with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david grahl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue using some ProShow slide transitions with Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my laptop to Windows 10. When working on a slideshow in ProShow Producer version 7, I am having problems with some of the slide transitions such as cloud, smoke, sparkle, etc. They don't work properly. The slide display turns white
 and there is no cloud, smoke, sparkles moving across the screen. It seems the issue is with transitions that have .wmv files included in the transition. They worked fine when I was running Windows 8.1. Has anyone else had this problem and if so, how do I correct
 the issue?

            After talking to ProShow Producer tech staff and having them look on my laptop, the issue was not with the ProShow producer software. When my laptop was upgraded to Windows 10, Microsoft eliminated/changed some codecs that were required for the Producer&nbsp;software.
 The tech staff were able to correct the codecs and the software functioned properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Never seen this either and I tried it on 2 different Ones and the both did the same exact thing. I ran a chkdsk /R&nbsp; and found out that there was a corrupt file on the USB&nbsp;drive. :( Now that I let the chkdsk run, the Xbox doesn't see the drive at all. I may have to copy off the videos, reformat the drive and copy all the videos back. Hopefully that does the trick.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>

    <title>Microsoft Hearts game freezes on the computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cluny macpherson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Hearts game freezes on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>MS Hearts freezes temporarily whilst the game is being played. A typical freeze last around 20 seconds and everything stops - Control + Alt + Del doesn't work and the second hand on the Clock gadget stops. The problem seems only to involve the Hearts game.
 I have not noticed it with other programs but this is a new build that I have not used extensively (or intensively!) yet.<br />
Also, the window always reverts to a small size every time the game is opened: resizing is not 'remembered' by the program.
<br />
I have tried "uninstalling" and reactivating Games as described elsewhere in the Forums. This has no effect whatsoever. I have also turned off/uninstalled everything I can identify that might cause a conflict and also reseated my graphics card but the problem
 persists. Any idea how to resolve this? - I don't fancy a complete reinstall!!!</p>

                    Earlier today, my computer wouldn't open and it would always go into a troubleshoot menu, after a while, I fixed it. Once it opened, I reseted my PC. It has now been at least 3 hours since then, I think my PC was reset But now, my computer won't open (Or
 at least it's trying to open but can't), It's on the opening up screen (without any loading wheel or text, it's just the ASUS logo.) for 10 seconds, and then, the screen turns black for 5 seconds... I tried to shut my pc down 3 times to get to the troubleshoot
 menu, but it didn't work. I have no idea what to do and i would really appreaciate it if you could help me.

            Hi Mathilde.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's likely the Reset failed which is not surprising in a corrupted PC which can literally choke the Reset to death.  
<br />
<br />While the solution is a project it is also one of life's great learning experiences that will permanently make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how keep it that way.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Virtual PC for 16-bit apps in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought a laptop with Windows 8 on it, and I am trying to install my applications on it.&nbsp; It looks like I need the virtual PC program to be able to run 16-bit applications.&nbsp; I looked for it on the Microsoft web site, but it's only available for Windows
 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When will it be available for Windows 8?&nbsp; Or is there an option I can use to make the Windows 7 version of it install?&nbsp; I have too much money invested in 16-bit apps to use an operating system that does not support them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Christian.</p>

            <p>If you have Pro edition of Windows 8 it includes the Hyper-V virtualization platform / application. Instructions on how to start with Hyper-V here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2493-hyper-v-how-use-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2493-hyper-v-how-use-windows-8-a.html</a></li><li><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5078-hyper-v-create-linux-virtual-machine-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5078-hyper-v-create-linux-virtual-machine-windows-8-a.html</a></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For test purposes I have installed Windows 7 Ultimate on Hyper-V virtual machine on Windows 8 Pro. On this virtual Windows 7 I have installed Microsoft Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Using the virtual 7 over remote desktop connection on full screen, and
 then launching XP Mode on full screen is almost as if you had a real XP running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a basic Windows 8, I recommend to buy Pro Pack to get Hyper-V. More information here:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have Pro and decide against buying the Pro Pack, you can always use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Oracle VirtualBox</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VMware Player</a>. Both are
 free and allow you to install almost any legacy OS on a virtual machine.</p>

            <p><span>Hi harish,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!</span></p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Which game were you about to play?</span></p>
<p><span>What is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p><span>Are you trying to play online game or a installed game?</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1: Perform a system maintenance troubleshooter.
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press Windows key + W on the keyboard</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type Troubleshooter then click on Settings under the Search field</span></p>
<p><span>c) In Settings click on Find and Fix Problems</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on System and security</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click System maintenance follow the prompts from there.</span></p>
<p><span>Also perform a clean boot and check:</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </span>
</p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft
 services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft
 services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to
 clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Run a memory diagnostic.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Windows key + W.</span></p>
<p><span>Type "Diagnose your computer's memory problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you can utilize to get the issue resolved.</span></p>

            <p>I did all those steps, it happens when I hibernate my laptop for some time. Have the page file size set to around 7gb which is approx. 1.5 times to that of my RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game was an installed one i.e Assassins creed Revelations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shutting down the system and restarting the system solves the problem temporarily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If possible how do I set the cache memory size? BIOS options are at a default and it doesn't show mMemory Remap feature.</p>

<h2>            Cross platform</h2>
                    Hi all I would like to ask which games would you like cross platorm and why. I personally think the Cod re masters might be interesting if benefiting from cross platform. But There might be also downsides to that one by chance.

<p>Monster Hunter World.&nbsp; There is a dwindling collection of players, and having Cross-Compatibility would increase the number of possible quest-mates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any of the Free-To-Play games, World of Tanks, Warframe, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But beyond crossplay, I would like cross accounts.&nbsp; For example: I play Warframe on my Xbox One, but get sent on a 2 week long business trip.&nbsp; If I could grab my Switch and continue the same account and progression from there, that would be AWESOME!</p>

<p>It'd be great to see the BR games be cross platform, like fortnite and Apex Legends, but as always we (the players) need the option to enable or disable cross play as we please.</p>
<p>Also cross platform progression would be great to see added to any cross platform game.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Stuck at &#34;HP Black Screen&#34; with &#34;Swirling Loading Logo&#34;. Wont boot.</h2>
                    <p>I received this computer for my birthday. My dad bought it brand new and barely used it and gave it to me. I used it a few times just fine, but now when I try to boot it up all I see is a spinning loading animation and "HP" logo. &nbsp;Eventually it will "Restart
 for automatic repair". It proceeds to restart and then does nothing. I cannot find a fix to this ANYWHERE and this computer is brand new. &nbsp;Does anyone have any help on how to fix?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If reinstalling the&nbsp;Operating System&nbsp;does not fix it, I suggest that as it is new, you do a Warranty Claim with the Store where you bought it or HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as it may be a Warranty Claim, only use the HP reinstall options.</p>
<p>Keep the Microsoft download information for a later&nbsp;time as using it now may void the Warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these HP steps to do a Recovery to Factory Settings (new condition).</p>

    <title>Working with corel draw on windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clinton brits  say:</h3>
<h2>            Working with corel draw on windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using corel draw 6 since it came out in 1995 and it's still as relevant today as it was back then.&nbsp; When i upgraded from windows xp to windows 7 32 bit, i ran the program with success.&nbsp; The problem comes in when you try and import graphics onto
 your page as the cursor changes from the corel draw black arrow and it becomes the white windows arrow and the software freezes.&nbsp; Windows reports that it's still running, ie it hasn't stopped responding but i cannot work with the software anymore.&nbsp; I have
 tried setting the compatability settings but nothing i do seemed to help.&nbsp; I did however set the compatability wizard to disable scaling on high DPI systems and this got the import window to open but when the window closes it then does exactly what happened
 before.&nbsp; Does anyone else have a problem with other versions of corel draw and has maybe found a solution because losing this would be a pitty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Clinton</p>

<p><span>Hi clinton Brits,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since it is a pretty old program, it may not work with Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=corel%20draw%206&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>However, you can try compatibility mode and check if it helps.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Uninstall the current installation
 and then reinstall it in the compatibility mode.</span></p>

<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right

 right click the setup file and select Run as Administrator and follow the normal installation procedure. Check to see if you can use the program now.</span></p>

    <title>The DVD Burner feature has stopped functioning with my Slimtype DVD A - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blsev55  say:</h3>
<h2>            The DVD Burner feature has stopped functioning with my Slimtype DVD A DS8A1H ATA Device.&#59; but it still burns CD&#39;s&#33; &#40;since the installation of the Windows 7 operating system&#41;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>The DVD ROM in my Compaq Presario C300 Notebook PC is also a CDRW and a DVD Burner. The Model is:
</p>
<p>Slimtype DVD A DS-8A1H ATA Device</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I have discovered that the drive no longer burns DVD's. It will burn CD's and will read both, DVD's and CD;s.
</p>
<p>I have also discovered that this seems to be a common problem with this very same drive model. I discovered this when I typed the model # into a search engine, with hopes to find a solution and restore the drive's DVD burning capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another commonality is the fact that this loss of function occurred after I, and all of the other reporters of this problem, installed the operating system, "Windows 7". I have noticed dates of the many reports vary and some are actually too old to have
 occurred after installing Windows 7. Therefore, I don't think the problem is directly related to Windows 7. However, I 'do' think it is related to the intallation of a different operating system, somehow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to my email address with any suggestions, ideas, and/or solutions for this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate and thank you for your consideration and any assistance you may provide towards resolution of my problem.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>blsev55</p>

<h2>            Ищу игры с разделение экрана &#40;Split-screen&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Доброго времени суток, такая вот трабла. Нашел только Gears of War и War in the north</p>
<p>в остальных играх пишется кооперативный решим по сети...но это я подразумеваю не то, хотелось бы поиграться в какую нибудь фэнтези, нашел&nbsp;Dark Souls, но опять же "<span>Кооперативное прохождение в сети: 2 - 3</span>" или это и есть разделение экрана, запутался
 уже.</p>
<p>Спасибо</p>

<p>Скачай демо версию Rayman Origins, там на одном экране, без разделения. Очень весело и можно играть сразу 4-ым игрокам.</p>

<h2>            Skype number theft&#63;</h2>
                    I was alerted by my credit monitoring service that my Skype number had been compromised and used by a person whom I did not know, in the town where the Skype number area code is based. &nbsp;Has anyone else faced this? &nbsp;I haven't been able to reach anyone at
 Skype to discuss the matter, as yet. &nbsp;Thanks!
