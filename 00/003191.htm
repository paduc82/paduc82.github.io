                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for Sharepoint solution for managing&nbsp;User Stories, similar to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Confluence product requirements blueprin</a>t.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something that will automatically convert product requirements into user stories / manageable tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Rachel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my search, I don't find any official article which is talking about the Product Management and User stories in SharePoint Online. However, I find an article talking about using the Microsoft Planner in Office 365 might be related to your requirement.
 Please check the article below.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t open links in my emails.</h2>
                    &nbsp;I tried to resolve this with the first two suggestions on the microsoft support site. Neither worked. I got onto the chat service initially and explained my problem and after being told to shut down and restart the computer I can no longer get a response
 to the chat or recall service. It tells me to there is a problem and to try again later. All extremely frustrating !

    <title>Don&#39;t opt out of the WIP just yet. Some build numbers have to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cbarnhorst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Don&#39;t opt out of the WIP just yet.  Some build numbers have to agree first.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Edit:&nbsp; One report indicates that it is now possible to opt out without any re-installation occurring.&nbsp; Nevertheless, be cautious.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because build 16299.15 is the RTM does not mean that you can just opt out of the WIP with no consequences now.&nbsp; Build 15063 is still the official public release and probably will be until Oct. 17th.&nbsp; If 16299.15 becomes the public release before then
 you can opt out then.&nbsp; Watch this forum for verification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you opt out the software compares major build strings; what you are on with the public release.&nbsp; If your build string is greater, the software reverts you to the public release.&nbsp; If they are the same, you are good to go as you are.&nbsp; Right now they are
 not the same.&nbsp; Patience!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software doesn't know anything about terms like "RTM," etc.&nbsp; MSFT has to throw a lot of switches when they roll forward from one version of Windows to the next officially.</p>

            None of the above.&nbsp; The MSFT management software that manages various parts of Windows 10 availability internally at Microsoft so that folks get the right builds according to the distribution channels they are on.&nbsp; It's called "provisioning."&nbsp; There is
 a lot of coordination required by the time Oct. 17th. rolls around. &nbsp;

<p>This I gotta see, the friends' laptop I just fixed stalled in April trying to update to the CU apparently because it was the Home Edition downloading the Pro Edition along with .Net Framework 4.7.... and it wasn't happening. It has 15063.608 now, hope it
 goes well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Insider builds,, who's grand idea was it to flight these late builds?? Not to mention the 2.5hr updates..... Been logging the last 6 in FH, I'm gonna request a bucket of Sumatra coffee for these 6am surprises :-)</p>

<p>I still do not understand, if build 16299.15 is the RTM why when people leave the Insider</p>
<p>program on this build you say they will have issues and need to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On build 16299.15 if you click [Stop Insider Preview builds] you do get the option to fully leave</p>
<p>the Insider Program. It removes your settings in the registry (after a reboot) and also allows in</p>
<p>Privacy settings (Feedback &amp; diagnostics) to have basic &amp; change the Feedback frequency to
</p>
<p>Always, Once a day, Once a week, Never.</p>
<p>Also if you cleanly install 16299.15 it does not automatically add you to the Insider Program and</p>
<p>set Insider Settings in Feedback &amp; diagnostics as "windows Insider Program manages this option".</p>

<p>My guess is in a day or two ISOs would be up.</p>
<p>Pushed to the RP ring by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 12th the upgrade assistant and MCT would be upgraded if they want to do like 1703.Though for 1607 and 1511, they updated the MCT and assistant on the global rollout day.</p>
<p>But MS wouldn't mind updating them before the global rollout as more people install the build, the more Feedback they get to fix up the things.</p>

<p>Agreed.&nbsp; But the ISO files have to be on the Media Creation site and the Download Windows 10 ISO site and not just the Insiders ISO site.&nbsp; I expect ISO files to be updated on the Insider ISO site very soon, but maybe not the public sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, it is not just a matter of ISOs.&nbsp; What we are discussing here is when can Fast Ring Insiders change their settings to stay on the FCU without winding up back on 15063.&nbsp; In other words, when does the FCU replace 15063 as the current public release?&nbsp;
 Not when do we know it is happening, but when does the Insider software "know" it?</p>

<p>If you clean install a regular Insider build it will make changes to your build to manage Insider settings.</p>
<p>If you clean install a RTM it will not.</p>
<p>The build versions should not go backwards to an older version.</p>

            Which is what I said.&nbsp; Until the current public release build is officially 16299.15 instead of 15063, just opting out of Slow or Fast Ring will result in an attempt to revert to a lower build number, resulting in a "refresh" back to 15063 because the
 WIP is still set to 15063 as the current public release.&nbsp; "RTM" simply doesn't mean anything to the WIP program.&nbsp; It's all about what is set as the "current public release build" in the WIP at the moment by MSFT. &nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for your response. I'll try to address all the issues I've encountered here. Yes, I have installed the disc previously. It worked perfectly on my old computer with Windows XP, and I never had a problem with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as you suggested and I started the Windows Installer. No go. I'm still getting the same message. So, I tried spoon-feeding it every file in Office 2007 (starting with the Enterprise.WW file), and it told me that was an invalid file every time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I tried copying the disc to a flash drive on another computer, and I got a message there was a problem with the device. I'm thinking the flash drive I have is just not big enough.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I tried copying the disc to an external hard drive and installing it from there but, again, I got the message "Set up cannot find Enterprise.WW\EnterWW.cab". That really doesn't make any sense because you can see the Enterprise.WW file right there
 on the list! UGH. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched high and low trying to find an answer for this, and I am far from the only person to have this exact problem, but no one seems to have an answer. I really do not want to spend big bucks on another Microsoft program (especially since they
 don't even give you a disc anymore). Any other suggestions? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! </p>

            <p>I wonder if there &nbsp;was a time bomb or some expiration forcing one to upgrade or buy new. I find it hard to believe that all of my copies stopped working at once on different machines and operating systems (7, 8, 8.1 and 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even my archived CD and DVD copies, stored in a binder, did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like a case for CSI:Cyber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the same by going back to my UNIX roots and installing Ubuntu and using Libre Office.</p>

            <p>I'd suggest starting with wrapping your code in something like this (so that you have a place that you can put a breakpoint in, and read the description of the error)</p>
<p>try</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>catch com as ComException</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; msgbox(com.message)</p>
<p>end try</p>

    <title>How to change my Skype password &#40;as opposed to my Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artfulrobot  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change my Skype password &#40;as opposed to my Microsoft password&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have had a skype account for ages. Way before I had to set up a Microsoft account, which Microsoft have now unfortunately linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is that I log in to Skype with my original skype username and a password I know to have been pwned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I follow the chain of links to change my password I'm bounced over to my Microsoft account, which has a different and secure password. Therefore I have no way of changing my skype password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Skype app I click my face, click Account and profile. This fires up a web browser and redirects a zillion times before finally landing on a "Skype My Account" page. I scroll down to find the Change Password link and I'm then presented with a "Change
 Password. Your Accounts." page which then says "Microsoft Account" as the only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option for changing my skype password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot, as requested by moderator. You will notice there is no option to change the SKYPE password, which is
<strong>separate</strong> from my Microsoft one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There seemed to be a weird situation where I kept getting half logged in - logged in enough so that I can't access the login form, but not logged in enough to access my account (and therefore the logout link)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I did from memory:</p>
<ol>
<li>enter my skype username at the login box</li><li>enter my skype email for verification</li><li>wait wait wait for the code and enter that.</li><li>then it asked me to assign an email (erh, ahem, you just verified it), so I entered the same email again</li><li>wait for the 2nd code to come through and paste that in.</li><li>Finally I was able to access the change password screen.</li></ol>

<p>I'm glad you were able to change your password. You went through the account verification flow where you are asked to enter an email address for a verification code. This is the same with clicking the reset or change password button next to Microsoft account
 on the screenshot you provided.</p>

<p>Hi Sri,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first prompt seems to suggest that you are trying to open file attachment from an email either from the web or linked file from an email. This is normal behavior in such case. The second prompt suggest that you are using a computer connected to a network
 domain, likely a workstation (office computer). Could you confirm these otherwise, provide us information in detail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The security prompts however, seems to be requiring the username and password of user granted the security privileges to open it. We recommend that you get in touch with your local I.T Administrator for the Network domain,
<strong>GOLDCRM2</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will look forward to your feedback regarding this matter.</p>
        </p>

<p>We are trying to open a file from cloud(by using url). We are only facing the issue when we try to access the file from IE, we are able to access the file from Chrome and Mozilla.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And from the first prompt if we select save and then if we open a file we can access it. we are facing an issue only when we choose open from first prompt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, the prompts are normal behavior when using an computer access that has a security policy in place. Your local I.T or the technician maintaining your computer and network security should be able to make changes in the security settings- to get around
 these prompts. We suggest tapping on your local I.T to check on the user permissions in the machines in question.

            Hi vivienne_hr<br />
<br />
When you say "put in battery charger" do you mean a desktop charger, rather than plugging one in? There may be damage to the middle pin of connector.<br />
<br />
Local mode is needed by technician when accessing phone EEprom, but you should not see it normally.:(

    <title>Can&#39;t view drawing in Visio 2007 &#40;no &#34;shapes window&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allenn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t view drawing in Visio 2007 &#40;no &#34;shapes window&#34; in View menu&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I reopened a cross-functional flowchart (Visio 2007) and can't see my drawing. The only window I can open has a caption with ":Separator &lt;GROUP&gt;" after the file name, and has a mostly-empty canvas except for a gridlined sheet with "Phase" in a horizontal
 bar across the top. </p>
<p>The "Shapes Window" item does not appear in the View menu. </p>
<p>I have no idea how this happened, and I'm not prepared to start all over if I have no idea how to prevent it recurring. The file is bigger than an older version that contained plenty of shapes, so I don't think the drawing elements have been deleted -- I
 just can't see the drawing canvas!</p>
<p>Am I facing&nbsp;a bug or a corrupt file? </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            As John says in the other thread, your diagram is stuck in Group view mode, It's not corrupt! Close the current window, now do a Save As, choose another filename temporarily, next to the Save button is a small black triangle, use that and ensure Save Workspace
 is set.<br />
Close the document, now reopen it.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for asking. Sorry to hear that you are not able to view hourly appointments in Outlook. However not to worry, you may refer to the
 following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the issue with Outlook showing a blue line for hourly appointments check if the Monthly view is set to show Medium detail. To do so, in
 the Outlook Calendar view, click on the View tab and then in the Arrangement group click on drop down arrow for Month. If ‘Show Medium Detail’ is highlighted then you may click to select ‘Show High Detail’ and then check how the appointments show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For posting a screen shot of the calendar on this forum, you may refer to the following link:

    <title>Synchonization issues...HELP&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roxannecs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synchonization issues...HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am at a loss as to what to try next. I've read through every forum and post I can find and still have the same issue. I purchased a new Dell laptop last week and installed my new Office 365 on it yesterday. I cannot get Outlook to stop synchronizing subscribed
 folders. Here's what I've tried:</p>
<p>1. Setting root folder path as [Gmail]</p>
<p>2. IMAP Folders - unsubscribing and subscribing repeatedly and checking and unchecking "When displaying hierarchy in Outlook" option at the bottom</p>
<p>3. File-Options-Advanced-Send/Received-Edit then unchecked the "Get folder unread count" option</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I Send/Receive all folders, it shows up as Sending is complete (even though I have an email stuck in my Outbox) and it is not receiving any of the 20+ emails I've seen on my phone in the last hour. Across the bottom is the "Synchonizing Inbox" gray
 and white bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about thisclose to throwing in the towel and using Gmail alone and never opening Outlook again. If anyone has any other ideas to try, I'm game and would be very appreciative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Application error 0xc0000142</h2>
                    <p>I am having this problem. My Office has been working fine for over a year.&nbsp; I renewed my annual subscription a few months ago.&nbsp; I use either excel or word at least 5 times a week or more.&nbsp; I am using Office365 Home.&nbsp; My laptop is HP Envy 8.1.&nbsp; Today when
 I tried to open my excel I received this message :&nbsp; <br />
excel.exe - Applcation Error&nbsp; <br />
The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142). Click OK to close the application.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>When I try to open a specific file from the Documents folder I get the same message and after I hit ok, I get this message:<br />
C:\Users\******\Documents\nameoffile.xls.xlsx<br />
Big red X - There was a problem sending the command to the program.&nbsp; <br />
Only option for me is to x out or hit ok.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open word the message is the same except in the header it is winword.exe - Application Error</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?&nbsp; </p>

            When I did not receive any answers from this thread, I went to the Microsoft Help Desk and after 4.5 hours I did get my problem resolved.&nbsp; The tech had to manually remove all remnants of my office 365 and then reinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manually removing the Office
 365 took quite a while but the download and reinstall took a much longer time,&nbsp;&nbsp; That may have been due to my internet provider.&nbsp; Bottom line, this problem is solved and I am able to access my files now.&nbsp;

    <title>Outlook steals focus every few seconds when phone is turned on that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> austin macdade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook steals focus every few seconds when phone is turned on that syncs with Exchange.</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
<p>One of our users syncs his phone to his Exchange mailbox, and when his phone is turned on and he is running Outlook on his computer, Outlook keeps stealing focus away from other programs AND ITSELF every few seconds. If his phone is on and he is using another
 program such IE, Outlook steals focus and it shows his inbox. If his phone is on and he is writing an email, it switches focus to the inbox. If his phone is on and he is browsing another folder, it switches focus to his inbox. If he turns his phone off this
 odd behavior stops. This is incredibly frustrating as most people would prefer to be able to use their phone that IS NOT connected to their computer or synchronizing with it and their computer at the same time with no troubles. This, however, is not the case.
 The odd thing is is that he is not the only one in this office with the setup he has, but he is the only one with this issue. I have not found anyone with a similar issue yet, which is odd. I have not found any identifiable odd process running that would cause
 an issue. The user is running outlook 2007 as part of Office Small Business Edition 2007 with SP3 on Windows XP with SP3. This phones runs Windows Mobile 6.1.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I recently had the pleasure of migrating our phones from Verizon's sync software to ActiveSync in a hurry because Verizon suddenly told us that they were going to stop the service in a few days. I anticipated having to cope with duplicated appointments,
 as they had documented that as a problem with such a migration. This wouldn't be too painful, as there were only 4 windows mobile phones that had to be migrated to ActiveSync, but I could not predict what would happen with one of them... 3 of the phones sync
 just fine, causing no issues besides duplicated appointments. These phones all run Windows mobile 6.x and are some Samsung variant, 2 of the users use Outlook 2003, and the other 2 use Outlook 2007. All the computers and phones sync off of a single server
 running Windows Server 2k3 R2 and Exchange 2k3. Other non Windows Mobile phones also sync with Exchange with no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Austin</p>

                    Hi I had someone record me on Skype and threatened to share it with family members of mine of Facebook. I screenshotted the chat and the person even texted me to since we "met" on a dating app and exchanged phone numbers. I blocked this person but I am
 scared they will actually share it. Please help!! They wanted me to send $300 to them or they would post it which I denied immediately.

<h2>            Office 2016 - addin failed to load from Office Store</h2>
                    <p>We have a problem with add-ins in Office 2016.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be with all users. All computers are running Windows 10 x64 Education version. They are using Office365 and either Office 2016 downloaded through the Office365 portal or installed manually with a MAK volume license key. When they are
 trying to add an add-in through the Office Store in Word or Powerpoint (haven't tried other Office programs) they get an error stating that the add-in failed to load. I can't seem to get any detailed info on why the Add-Ins are failing to load. Is there a
 log somewhere where I can get some information? I don't seem to get any other error code than this one (see screenshot).<br />

We got your concern. We would like to know how many device is affected by this concern. Did you check the number of add-ins that were already in your Office 365? Did you check the compatibility of the add-ins you are trying to put in your Office 365?

We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>Hi SueBentsen,</p>
<p>About this issue, we may need to involve the admin of your organization. I’d like to confirm whether you are an admin.</p>
<p>If not, could you please provide a screenshot of the symptom.</p>
<p>To upload the screenshot in the forum, please click&nbsp;<b>Use rich formatting </b>
and then the<b>&nbsp;</b><b>Insert/Edit Media</b>&nbsp;icon.</p>
<p>Here is a workaround to disable Clutter for one user. Please let the admin run PowerShell by the following steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>2. Run the command: Set-Clutter -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -Enable $false</p>
<p>If you run into any issue during the test, please post back the error. Then we will dig further into the issue.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Monique</p>

<p>as a admin, i have tried turning off clutter using powershell on my side successfully. please let your admin run the commands to help you turn it off.</p>

<p>Very strange that my Options in OWA are so limited, but I am happy at this point with Clutter being turned off.</p>

    <title>Issues with Outlook after Mojave update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alyssiabailey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Outlook after Mojave update</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else experiencing issues with Outlook after the Mojave update on Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Outlook version is 16.18 so is up to date as far as I can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I updated to Mojave I can't ever seem to connect to all of my email accounts on Outlook (I have 8)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just shows the lightning bolt next to various accounts meaning they aren't connected, they seem to swap around so some will connect just fine and others don't. I did not experience this issue before Mojave and it's driving me nuts! I am connected to the
 internet just fine so that isn't the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to report this issue using the 'help" then 'contact support' feature on Outlook but it never stops loading, so that's bust as well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having these issues?</p>

<p>Hi AlyssiaBailey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, it shows the lightning bolt next to accounts. It means those accounts are offline. The issue could be caused by different root causes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reboot your Mac firstly. Then click the lightning bolt to see if there is anything happen. Sometimes you need to enter your credential again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you can follow the steps in link below and try to clear your keychain to see if the issue can be fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4010106/outlook-2016-for-mac-repeatedly-prompts-for-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4010106/outlook-2016-for-mac-repeatedly-prompts-for-authentication</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can try to manually switch from offline to online, please follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Outlook </strong>in the upper right.</li><li>Select the <strong>Work Offline</strong> option.</li><li>There will be a check mark next to <strong>Work Offline</strong> when you are in Offline Mode.</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/227b6def-3ab4-404d-a603-aef19a317871?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/227b6def-3ab4-404d-a603-aef19a317871?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If it still doesn't work, you can back up your data and try to re-add your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further assistance, may I know if all of your accounts are disconnected?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Carlos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting my computer which doesn't seem to make a difference. Nothing seems to happen when I click on the lightning bolts which is odd as when I used to click on these, it prompted me to enter my password for that account as it had become
 disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try clearing my keychain and see if that makes a difference.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Received received an obviously bogus on screen and audio warning regarding a virus and online shopping. Call the actual Microsoft support number, as opposed to the number listed in the warning. I was told it was a known issue, the transferred. The next rep
 told me normal antivirus/spyware/malware removal would not work. I was then offered a couple of choices, the cheapest of which was $99. And I got a pretty high pressure hard sell. I hung up. Is this normal for Microsoft tech support? Any insight about any
 of this would be appreciated. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

      If that does not resolve the issue, follow the instructions here.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      For Edge:<br />
      <br />
      User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.<br />
      <br />
      ************************************************<br />
      <br />
      When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task
      Manager.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom
      off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in
      google.com and hit enter.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.&nbsp; You can see
      the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.&nbsp;
      Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site
      tab or it will get focus again.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the
      offending site tab will be gone.<br />

    <title>Outlook 2016 Folder Pane Settings - Accounts &#38; Folder Spacing, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> folderpain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Folder Pane Settings - Accounts &#38; Folder Spacing, Favorites&#47;Accounts Split</h2>
                    <p>Working in Mouse mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Font size for accounts is excessive and spacing between accounts is abnormally large - formatting options are required.</p>
<p>2. Spacing between folders is excessive - a formatting option is required, which could be linked with 1.</p>
<p>3. Favorites/Accounts split is not adjustable - a movable split is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The large font size and huge spacing between accounts, together with the excessive folder spacing, greatly limits productivity and serves no useful purpose. When working with more than a few accounts and/or more than a few favorites, the folder pane soon
 becomes unworkable - requiring constant scrolling and constant opening and closing of accounts and folders in order to do the simplest of operations, such as moving a mail item from an inbox to a folder. As the number of favorites increases, the accounts space
 is proportionally reduced, to the point where the accounts space becomes unusable without first closing Favorites. Again, the absence of an adjustable folder pane split greatly limits productivity in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are fundamental problems with the Folder Pane and the usability of the Outlook 2016. The loss of productivity is even greater in Touch mode.</p>

            <p>So... no resolution?&nbsp; Did Microsoft just give up?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My company just "upgraded" me from Office 2010 to Office 365 and the font &amp; spacing in the folder pane is HUGE and cumbersome; just as&nbsp;many others have been complaining about.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I have to hack the registry to fix this?&nbsp; Or is it something that I just have
 to live with because 'Microsoft deems it so'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Office 2013 hack of changing menu font size and that did absolutely nothing.&nbsp; So my 'scroll' finger is starting to get cramps trying to find the different folders I need to find &amp; file email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just glad I haven't updated my home PC's... and probably won't... at least not to Microsoft Office.</p>

    <title>Contacts synchronisation logic&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrian_jhb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts synchronisation logic&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried without success to work out what is WM 6.1's Contacts sync logic (with Vista, WMDC and a Sony Ericsson). &nbsp;Is the PC or the Mobile Device the master? &nbsp;Is there a Master? &nbsp;Or are they both on the same level? &nbsp;I have tried a number of variations
 - I added Test 1 to the PC contacts and Test 2 to the mobile contacts. &nbsp;After syncing, both had Test 1 and Test 2. &nbsp;I deleted Test 1 and Test 2 from the mobile but left them on the PC and re-synced. &nbsp;They were synced back to the mobile. &nbsp;I deleted Test 1 and
 Test 2 from the PC but left&nbsp;them on the mobile&nbsp;and re-synced. &nbsp;They disappeared from the mobile! &nbsp;I then tried adding them to the mobile but not the PC and re-synced. &nbsp;They did not get put back on the PC.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way of specifying how the sync should work? &nbsp;I would like the simplest and safest method - the sync should not delete anything; if I want to lose a contact, I should have to delete it from both before syncing. &nbsp;Otherwise, any PC contacts that
 are not on the mobile should get added to the mobile and any mobile contacts that are not on the PC should get added to the PC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I only sync contacts and calendar...</div>

<br />
Once you have completed the first sync, which ever device has had the most recent change should be the one that has sync'd ... in theory that is.&nbsp; So if you delete a contact on your device then sync, that contact will then be deleted on your PC (and visa versa).<br />
<br />
Just to be safe, you should use PIM BACKUP which is a FREE and safe method to have a backup of your PIM in case something goes wrong.&nbsp; You can get it here:&nbsp;
