<h2>            Microsoft Office Word, Excel, and other Office products</h2>
                    <p>I tried to open my Microsoft word and excel files today to create some assignments for school, but when i opened them the templates that normally show up when you first open them were not there and when I tried to click on anything. Word an Excel crashed
 and I have had the same problem every time I've tried to open them again. Any ideas on what might be causing this or what i can do to fix this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Disabling WLAN  on an E75 or keeping it totaly connected to the WiFi</h2>
                    
<p>Every once and so on the WLAN search screen appears.&nbsp; I tried to disable the WLAN but never found a strong parameter to disable the WLAN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, by the same means, is'nt there any manner to have the phone connected on ther router once and for all, if I am near the route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, even if connect the phone to the WIFI, it still disconnects and starts to search again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>I've already done all this.&nbsp; There is no application running, but still, on the main screen appears the message Select a connection for Wlan or something as this.&nbsp; My phone is in French so the message is different from what you could see on your.&nbsp; But the

            Do you use Push for Mail like Exchange or automatic retrieval? Check your e-mail settings. There must be some app that demands a connection. Deleting accesspoints in no use because the phone will bug you some more. Bon courage.

<p>Hi Marta,</p>
<p>To disengage your email address with Office 365, you can consider changing the domain suffix to onmicrosoft.com first, then removing your custom domain.

<p>After you remove the custom domain and you’d like to use mda**low@dag**ing.com email address for the personal Microsoft side, availabilities of this email address such as sending or receiving emails are required.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 - Moved Messages do not drop off Search Results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Moved Messages do not drop off Search Results</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed the Latest Office 2016 Products and after doing this the Move of a Message from the Search Results No Longer disappears off the results as it always has prior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated all the products to the latest update and it currently reads as Outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.4.266.1001) 64-bit.</p>
<p>Operating System is Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Scenario is as follows: (Running Desktop Application)</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a Domain Account and a Local Outlook Data File that I use for moving/archiving messages from my active account.</li><li>I Open the Inbox of my Domain Account and type something in the Search Field, at the top of the Message List, with the folder option set to "Current Folder".</li><li>Search lists filtered results as normal.</li><li>I Click on any Message that I would like to Move from my Domain Account to the Local Outlook Data File and then Click the Move Button to choose where I would like to move the message to.&nbsp;</li><li>I Click the Selection of my Local Outlook Data File and it briefly indicates that it is moving the message and then returns to the list. &nbsp;However the same Item I just moved is still listed in the Filtered Results, like nothing happened... &nbsp; If I double
 click the message it opens like normal, but if I try to move it again I receive an error message of "Could not complete the move. &nbsp;The items may not have been already moved or deleted." &nbsp;Clearly the Move did happen, but the Filtered List did not refresh to
 show only the items that match my Criteria and Folder option.</li><li>If I click back on my Inbox, the message has clearly been moved, however if I put the same filter criteria in the Search Box, with the same folder option as before, the item Magically appears in the filtered results again as though it is still in my Domain
 Inbox. &nbsp;Clicking on it and trying to move provides the same error indicating that the message is not there. &nbsp;The only way to get the search to not include the moved item is to click on a completely different Mailbox Folder and then Click back on the Inbox.
 &nbsp;Now if I search again with the same criteria and Folder Option the Message does not display.</li></ol>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Since updating to Office 2016 with the Latest Updates Applied, the Search and Move Functions are not working as they previously have before. 1. Search Results do not refresh after a message has been moved and would no longer qualify for the search criteria
 provided. 2. The Search seems to retain a cache of the prior listed items, because even after confirming that the item was move out of the qualifying criteria it is still listed in the filtered results, but will error if I try to move it again.</p>

            <p>Parth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I greatly appreciate you taking the time to reply, so please do not misunderstand my following question/concern...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I go down the road of creating a New Profile, I was curious why a New Profile would be any different than the one I am currently using, as it pertains the the Search and Move functionality of Office 2016. &nbsp;The rest of the application appears to be
 working as expected and non of my emails are corrupted or missing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that this has something to do with a Bug with the way the Search Feature is refreshing or using a cached result, as the move feature does move the email and if I Move an email from a NON-Filtered list of emails the message moves and disappears
 from the inbox. &nbsp;It is only from the Search/Filtered Results that the application does not refresh its results and recognize that the message has been moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for curiosity, are you running Outlook 2016 and have you tried searching your Inbox to get a limited list of email and then moving one of them to a different folder or local inbox that would be outside of the limits of your search? (i.e. Limit the search
 to the "Current Folder" and move the message to a different folder, which should not be included in your initial search.) &nbsp;If this works for you and the message is No Longer listed in your original search results, what version of the application are you running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create a New Profile as you suggest, but I wanted to at least get your thoughts/reasoning as to why creating a new profile would have an effect on what appears to be a BUG in the 2016 product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your time and efforts...<br />
</p>

            <p>I added the "In Folder" field &nbsp;to my displayed columns. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then entered the search word and limited the results to just "Current Folder", which is what I always do, and the results all indicated "Inbox".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested moving the Message first to a different Mailbox and the "In Folder" field remained "Inbox" and was still listed in the results. &nbsp;I then&nbsp;exited the search and moved the message back into my Inbox for another test. &nbsp;I put in the key work and limited
 the results to "Current Folder" as I did before. &nbsp;This time I tried moving the message to the "Draft" folder, within the same Mailbox, and the results still showed the "In Folder" was Inbox. &nbsp;If I change just the Limiter from "Current Folder" to "All Mailboxes",
 the list refreshes and shows the message was actually in the "Draft" folder. &nbsp;I do not think it matters, but I get the same result if I attempt to Drag the messages from the Search Results to a different Folder and/or Mailbox. &nbsp;The Search Results do not seem
 to be refreshing after any Move Function. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To complicate the issue even more, I did a test with the search limited to "All Mailboxes" and this time the results appear as though the messages was duplicated. &nbsp;In other words, it continued to show the original listed message was still in the "Inbox",
 but also indicted that the message existed in the "Draft" folder. &nbsp;If I exited, the search and did what I have to do to cause the Search to think it needs to be refreshed and then performed the exact same search limited to "All Mailboxes" again the message
 is only listed in the "Draft" folder, which is where it is...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue does not apply to Deleting a Message, as these will drop off the Search Results immediately. &nbsp;It just affects any of the ways to perform a move of a message and does not appear to be Reloading/Refreshing the results after the move function is
 performed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping this information will help lead someone, at Microsoft, to the issue so the bug can be fixed...&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Summary: Outlook 2016 Search results are not updating/refreshing, to reflect a message has been moved outside of the search criteria, when limited to "Current Folder". (i.e. Search within "Current Folder" and move a message to a different Folder or Mailbox,
 but the message continues to be listed in results after the move, even though it should no longer qualify.)</p>

            <p>Reading the original post and replies top to bottom, it appears that searching for keyword results and moving the messages from the results has changed from previous versions of Outlook.&nbsp; I'm not sure if that is the expected behavior, or a possible bug.&nbsp;
 At this point, what would be helpful is a work-around.&nbsp; Does anyone think that using Rules would be helpful?&nbsp; I support customers who do client work, so they often want to move items from certain senders to a client folder.&nbsp; It seems that Rules could save
 them the trouble of doing the search and manually moving them, which would create a better efficiency for their process anyway.&nbsp; They could either setup auto-rules or have the rules applied whenever they would like to move a group of keyword messages.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 not working after update</h2>
                    <p><strong>For those still struggling with this of office 365 not working after update the following worked for me, follow it step by step, it can take up to an hour. Remember the old saying if at first you don't succeed try and try again, the answer is in
 there somewhere.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the computer and then try performing a quick repair of Office installation. Refer to the following link for more information on how to repair Office 2013/365.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the <strong>Fix it</strong> from the following article to remove all traces of the Office on the system.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a></p>

            <p>No, in mail merge you set up the merge document only once, then let Word do the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you insert AddressBlock from the Mailings tab of the ribbon? If so, you get a (more or less) fixed format determined by Word.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you can insert fields from the Excel data source by clicking Insert Merge Fields on the Mailings tab of the ribbon. Hopefully you can then create the layout that you need.</p>

<h2>            VLOOKUP Value pulled based on multiple conditions</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a Medicare fee schedule, fee suggestion worksheet.</p>
<p>Ultimately for medical billing purposes we need to set fees that cover 2.5 times Medicare's allowable. I created this worksheet based off of Massachusetts Medicare Fee Schedule so when the appropriate procedure code is entered it pulls from this table and
 displays the fee on the main worksheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am trying to also specify this to our client base which are in multiple states and abide to different fee schedules based on the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am trying to look for is if how do I tell the worksheet that if this ClientA pull from the procedure code's value from WorksheetA, if ClientB then pull the procedure code's value from WorksheetB, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping I am making sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Robin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The web address was correct.</p>
<p>Search engines find the page.</p>
<p>I refreshed many times over an hours time.</p>
<p>All cables were fine (keep in mind that the Windows 10 email client accesses both of our hotmail accounts on that same PC)</p>
<p>No flight mode.</p>
<p>Wireless fine (though not in use - cabled connection)</p>
<p>Mobile broadband works on my phone (even to those hotmail accounts)</p>
<p>I restarted my router many times with no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all occurred last night (I'm in France) about 9 hours ago. This morning when I wanted to check on the situation, I discovered that this entire region of France has no internet service from that internet provider - it has been out of service for 6 hours.
 Perhaps something was wrong with the server that ultimately broke down completely? I have a different internet provider in my office and can access my hotmail there.&nbsp;Since I could access my account from the Windows 10 email client and from my android phone,
 I would think that something was happening with the OWA code somewhere between the server and my interface (I am an experienced programmer myself).<br />

                    I have filled up my allotted space on the My Phone server (main and archive)&nbsp;and want to transfer videos and photos to my hard drive, or CDs,&nbsp;External Drive, etc.&nbsp; in order to free up space. I would then delete the transferred files from My Phone. Is there
 a way to do that?&nbsp; Thanks a lot!

<p>There's no way to download any of the data that is stored on your My Phone web page directly to your computer, a CD or external drive.&nbsp; Here's a way I worked out to do what you want to do, but it's a bit convoluted:</p>
<ul>
<li>On your My Phone web page, select all the photos you want to download to your computer.</li><li>Then select "Share All" (you will need to have a site set up where your pictures can be shared - you can use a Windows Live website, but Flickr will work too - both are free)</li><li>Select the website where you want to share your pictures and select the "Share" button</li><li>Then go to Windows Live or Flickr and log on to your account.&nbsp; The pictures will now be displayed there.&nbsp;</li><li>For Windows Live, you can then select More &gt; Download &gt; Download as .zip file</li><li>After you've downloaded the pictures to your computer, you'll need to go back to your My Phone account and delete the pictures there to free up space</li></ul>
<p>Both Windows Live and the free version of Flickr have some space limitations, so you may run up against those limitations when you attempt this.&nbsp; If you do, you may wind up having to handle batches of pictures at a time (100 or 200 pictures at a time) until
 you've managed to download all of them to your computer.</p>

    <title>why is this icon on screen&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmtx4  say:</h3>
<h2>            why is this icon on screen&#63;</h2>
                    i just got a nokia 2330 classic. i was fooling around in fun/app&gt;media&gt;radio and also music player. i now have an icon at the top of the screen to the right of the "battery" icon that looks like a phone inside of a parenthesis. i cannot get rid of it.
 i made sure the radio is off. music player shows no content selected. i even did a restore settings only and it is still there. should i try to do a restore all? i don't want to lose any numbers in sim card. my manual doesn't really show this icon (or any
 others really). anyone know what this icon means? thanks

            try removing the sim and battery for 5 min then factory restore the code is 12345 unless you can point out what the symbol is there is not much more help we can give the only other thing i can think of is the gprs to remove that you go to packet data settings
 and select when needed

            thanks for the restore info.&nbsp;the screen symbol or icon is in the&nbsp; "indicator" area just to the right of the battery power icon. (the same place on the screen that shows the "key" symbol when the keyboard is locked) &nbsp;it looks like a small picture of a phone
 (it has a small antenna) it is between these symbols "&nbsp;&nbsp; ". i can't find anything from my service providers site that shows what this symbol means. thanks

            it's not in the guide, ive looked through it thoroughly. the guide doesn't really list many of the symbols. i did a restore all and it's still there. i'm not a pre-paid customer. i use t-mobile. t-mobil has symbol guides for numerous nokia phones but not
 for this phone. i've searched that database and none of the other phones have this symbol. as far as i know it doesn't cause any trouble, it's just there. the locked symbol shows instead of this symbol when the keyboard is locked. i'l go by the t-mobile store
 where i got it and see if they know whats up. maybe i'll go to a different phone.

    <title>Changing the Default Email Account in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changing the Default Email Account in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community Forum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am inquiring about the integration between the Mail and Calendar App and the new Outlook premium domain service. I have switched my main Microsoft email to the one associated with my custom domain name, and that is reflected in every part of my Windows
 computer besides the "Email, calendar, and contacts" section of the accounts section of the settings app. I would like to use my custom domain as the way I send email, but on my Windows 10 phone, it seems I am unable to update the account settings for the
 default email to reflect this. Is there any way on Windows 10 and Windows 10 mobile to change the default email account, so outgoing mail comes from a different alias, in this case, my custom domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to hear my concerns,</p>
<p>Brannen Hall</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I introduced few new user profile properties to SharePoint online user profile properties. And I did mapping between manged properties and crawled properties for the newly created properties. But only some of the properties values appering when we do a people
 search others don't appear. Is there can be any reason not to appear those other fields. Please let me know if I want to check for settings. I'm using SharePoint online.</p>

<h2>            Merging Skype account and Microsoft account</h2>
                    I have both a Skype account and a Microsoft account. Is there any way to merge these? I used to use my Skype account on a daily basis, but since I reinstalled Windows 10, it now signs in directly using the Microsoft account. Ideally, I would like to have
 everything in one place. Any pointers are more than welcome!

<p>
</p><p>You can merge an existing Skype account to a new Microsoft account created during the process of merging. It is not possible to merge a Skype account to an existing Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;you should still can use your Skype credentials to sign in to Skype. To check, please
<strong>sign out </strong>and <strong>sign in</strong> again using the credential when you initially create the account.</p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; Yes, I checked that. Everything is on. Its really strange.&nbsp; An example is the final score of a game involving a favorite sports team....On my windows 10 laptop, I receive a final score notification from Cortana. On a "internet only" iPhone 6 (no
 cell connection), I receive a final score notification from both Cortana and also a notification from the Microsoft Sports app. On my Lumia 950, a big fat nothing.&nbsp; This same scenario holds true for News, Money and flights that I am tracking.

<p>OK, so I noticed that under Notification it was in the list on my device yet it was not in the list for my PC. So I uninstalled on both my device and PC. After they reinstalled, it was NOT in the list for Notifications on both devices. I'm thinking that
 they removed the ability for notifications on both.</p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; Yes, I think you are on to something.&nbsp; I checked my notification list on my phone after I hard reset and reinstalled The apps and the notification on/off for those apps are no longer there! ESPN app also is no longer there as well.&nbsp; I still have
 them on the notification list on my laptop. Frustrating how they keep weaning off the capabilities of this phone. Why? FYI I have a internet only iPhone with Microsoft Sports, Microsoft News and Microsoft Money apps all installed and I get notifications from
 all of them....including the ESPN app.&nbsp; Funny (and ridiculous) how Microsoft's own apps give notifications on other platforms and don't even bother with notifications on their own Windows platform!

<p>Priyesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure that Actionvoip offers a S60 client? I wasn't able to find it. However, there is specific instructions to configure SIP clients at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.actionvoip.com/en/sipp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.actionvoip.com/en/sipp.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Althoug I do not own a E75, it's pretty sure that you will find SIP configuration under Tools -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connection -&gt; SIP settings. Use information from link above to populate your own confi settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also opt to use other clients like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fring: <a href="http://www.fring.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.fring.com</a></p>
<p>Nimbuzz: <a href="http://www.nimbuzz.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nimbuzz.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both offer SIP capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>in Control panel &gt; Printer Preferences but this will affect all printing not just PPT.</p>

<h3> venkatanarayanan r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 525 - Upgrade not available, What next&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Nokia Lumia 525 with Windows 8.1 updated with Denim Version of software, hoping to upgrade to Windows 10. However, shocked to note in the new press release from Microsoft that this device will not be upgraded. Does that mean users of Lumia 525
 like me (also other Lumia models which is not upgradable) to either go for new mobile or change their loyalty to the easily available Android phones? Or is there a possibility that these handsets will be upgraded later?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This doubt is because, earlier Microsoft was announcing all Lumia device (including Lumia 520/525) will be upgraded. Suddenly, they say it will not be upgraded. One fails to understand the inconsistency in their announcement.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any resposne. Thanks - Venkat</p>

            Thanks for your answer. However, this was not what I was expecting. Moreover, I have changed by handset now. Hence, this is irrelevant to me. Anyways, once again thanks for your rep;ly

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the "Folder on the phone" it's already located at E:/Briefcase and this it appears, cannot be change as it's not writable. (E: being the Memory card I have in use)</p>

<p>Sorry, your answer makes no sense.</p>
<p>How would creating a new folder work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is, in the Files and Folders settings I can't change the existing setting, so there's no way I could change it to any newly created folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have a different folder I want it to point at, as noted in my original posting, but no way of changing the setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've even Deleted the ...king folder "Briefcase" on the E63, but that doesn't help as next time I do a sync it's re-created.</p>

<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link to reset Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
Change or reset Internet Explorer settings<br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11</span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
Note: You can reset Internet Explorer settings to return them to the state they were in when Internet Explorer was first installed on your PC. This can be useful for troubleshooting problems that might be caused by settings changed after installation. Resetting
 Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.<br />
&nbsp;Please post back the results and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></span>

<p>Using the Search box, search in any folder and you will get the most recent search results, with a suggestion to see more result (a "More" link).</p>
<p>Clicking that link, to get more/older results, shows one result only even though there are many more results.</p>
                </div>

            <p>I was able to uncheck the option in the settings and now I do seem to have all search results showing up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this is just a work around, and it is clearly a bug that I hope Microsoft acknowledges and fixes in a future service pack.</p>

            <p>Why this continual downgrade of functionality?. Outlook 2010 could find anything anytime, outlook 2013 is just LOST. The MORE function should be called RANDOM and even though I cache ALL messages, search continually asks to look for more on the exchange
 server and then finds extras.</p>
<p>What a bitterly disappointing result for a change we have been forced into. I have lost hours over this because I used search extensively in 2007 2010. My clients hate me for installing 2013 and they hate the look and feel. AND what about the lost functions
 in RULES!!</p>
<p>Microsoft WAKE UP, we are drowning in a muddy&nbsp;functionless ooze&nbsp;of over-development and under achievement. Business is hurting, and businesses are hurting. We have moved from an environment of people looking for new versions to people looking for old ones</p>

            I would be curious as well. &nbsp;I have tried both options, and it still limits the searches even though the entire mailbox is cached, the option to limit searches off, and the registry key is set.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Outlook Community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would like to know the email account type configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Microsoft Exchange and Exchange Active Sync).

<p><span>If it is an Exchange Server, then it would be best if you post your query in the
