<h2>            Block O365 user based on the device&#33; Is it possible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have configured federated O365 subscription with my on premised domain. I can successfully block my employees based on their location or IPs.</p>
<p>I want that my employee can access O365 from their devices provided my company only. In other words I want block O365 access based on their devices along with their locations. So could someone tell me that how can I achieve this.</p>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi KaitlynARC,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the research, there is a similar issue described in the link below, please see the reply from Shyamal, and then check it on your side:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sfb-mso_winother/skype-for-business-shows-white-screen-cannot-see/4567f347-768f-453c-af23-baba5b67895d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sfb-mso_winother/skype-for-business-shows-white-screen-cannot-see/4567f347-768f-453c-af23-baba5b67895d</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, can you tell us when you or other users share your screen with this user, he/she can see the presentation? Also, to exclude the account issue, please try using another office
 365 account to login to this problematic Skype for Business client to check the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your update.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error code 80180005</h2>
                    <p>I've recently been notified of a new update for my HTC WP7 Mozart.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;I connect to the PC / Zune, it notifies me of an 'HTC update' for my phone, plus I am also getting the notification on the phone.</p>
<p>I accept the update, and it goes through the long process of downloading, then backing up, then applying the update, but ultimately it fails with the error code 80180005. I've followed the link provided which eventually links through to the MS page of error
 codes, but it is not listed. Have tried on several attempts but each time it fails. Have removed the battery and tried again, but still no joy.</p>
<p>The phone as mentioned above is a HTC WP7 Mozart, in the UK on Orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS version: 7.0.7392.0</p>
<p>Firmware: 2250.09.13001.061</p>
<p>Hardware: 0004</p>
<p>Radio s/w: 5.54.09.21_22.33b.50.10U</p>

<p>Bootloader: 1.30.2250.1(117854)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that before this attempted update it was OS 7.0.7392.0, but not sure about the other items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't know if this an essential update or not, but the continual notifications are annoying if it's going to refuse to take it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers, Chris.</p>

            I've finally managed to update my phone!&nbsp; I used a pc that&nbsp;I'd previously used with no success but this time the update went through first time without having to reset to factory settings.&nbsp; I'm not sure why this time was any different to the other 10 times
 I've tried but it went through this time.&nbsp; The only difference&nbsp;I&nbsp;can think of was that there were some Microsoft windows updates waiting to install on the pc which i installed before trying the update so maybe one of those fixed the issue but its done now
 whatever the problem originally was so maybe anyone who's getting this error code should just give it one more try?

<h2>            Error Code 0x800CCC78</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just set up a new email address on Outlook, at first when entering the port number which the website recommended (The one I used to create the email), there was an error. I was looking online for the solution and noticed a person using a different
 port number so I used that one and it worked, no issues. Yesterday I sent a few emails and no errors occurred so no problem. Today when sending around 50 emails the error occurred (0x800CCC78). Again I looked online for a potential fix but they were all made
 for old versions of Outlook which were no help to me. I tried sending an email to my person email and it sent with no issues but the error was still there, I am wondering if anyone has a potential fix for the latest version of Outlook or should I just ignore
 it as it still sends the email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<br />What was the potential fix?  
<br />
<br />That error is usually incorrect settings for port &amp; ssl, but there can be other causes.

<p>The fix was to go into the account settings and then click a check box, I clicked this checkbox before I clicked complete account but I wanted to double check so when I followed the steps to get to the setting which was needed the interface was changed and
 the images they were showing were the images I saw when creating the account. When I followed the steps to get to the setting it came up with a different information box which gave no help to finding the setting I needed. The email host is 1and1.</p>
<p>

            I'm guessing you have the new account settings dialog - which doesn't allow server &amp; port (or password) changes. See <a href="https://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/change-password-outlook-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/change-passwo...</a> for screenshots and the methods to get to the correct screens. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Turns out it was just 1 email which was causing the issue
<br />It's properly formatted and the message sent?

<p>I looked at your website and saw a way to get to the page which I needed as suspected the checkbox was checked so that wasn't the issue, I then changed the port number to the one the email host said to use and this caused an error so I changed it back. The
 emails that I was sending were all the same with no variation other than the email address and they all sent fine so it was just this email which was causing the issue. I then sent an email to my personal email and it worked without any error so not sure whats
 really going on.</p>

<p>When the Skype displays message&nbsp; "Internet connection problem. Hold on till we try to fix it" it is at the center of the video which is annoying while conversation. This message display needs to be shifted elsewhere, so that it is not displayed in the video

            <p>In order to email documents from Word, you must have a local email application (such as Outlook or Windows Live Mail) set as your default mail client. If you use only webmail (such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail accessed via a website, opposed to downloaded to your

<p>You can also attach files the same way in your local mail application, but you can send files from within Word using Office Button | Send | E-mail. If you do this frequently, you may want to add the E-mail button to your QAT. To do that, right-click on the
 E-mail button in the Send menu and choose "Add to Quick Access Toolbar."</p>

            Wait for a few days. After a phone reset, it takes a few days for all available app updates to get targeted to your device.

            <p>Hello Cheryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support.&nbsp; I understand you're having issues with apps on your Nokia Lumia 900.&nbsp; In order to get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to ask the following of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The error message you're receiving regarding JavaScript should typically only appear after the app has installed and you're trying to use it.&nbsp; Can you confirm that the app was actually installed first, or, does this only actually happen when you try to
 download from the marketplace?</li><li>Does this happen to any app or game you try to download/use on your phone?</li><li>Let's check which version of Windows Phone you're on as well.&nbsp; On the phone, please navigate to
<strong>Settings&gt;About&gt;More Info</strong>, and if you could, please tell us what the complete OS version number is.</li><li>Do you have any issues viewing websites on your mobile phone?&nbsp; On the phone, let's open up Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Tap the three dots in the lower right (the ellipsis), and go to Settings.&nbsp; Make sure all three boxes are checked in.</li><li>See if you can replicate this error with both Wi-Fi off, and on.</li></ul>
<p>Feel free to get back to us when you can and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chanh S.</p>

            Thank you Chanh S for replying to question. I turned off WiFi and same thing happens. The app doesn't install correctly, it goes to old version of Walgreens app. The app works with Windows 7.5, 8 and 8.1. My phone was a 7.5 after update went to 7.8. OS
 version # 7.10.8862.144 this is what the about shows. I can pull up IE but site info is very small until I zoom in on it even the above info. The app was installed on my phone and it stated that I needed to enable javascript for it to work and it also told
 me that I needed the flash player, which if app is to work that I can use html instead. But when I try to use photo part of app it tells me to upgrade app and doesn't pull up anything. Most apps just install and seem to come up correctly, but a couple of others
 have problems to. Can't remember exactly which ones, just the Walgreens one since I work for the photo dept at a Walgreens store. Please give me some advice on what to do or if anything can be done without buying a different phone. Thank
        </p>

            <p>Hey Cheryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, and the updated information.&nbsp; In looking further into this, I'd like to ask the following of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this issue occur for all apps you try to install, or use?</li><li>Does this error actually occur during the installation, or does it happen when you try to open the app?</li><li>Are you installing directly from the phone's marketplace, or from the windowsphone.com website?</li><li>I've noted you said the Walgreens app is giving you issues in particular, so I tried it out myself.&nbsp; I also receive an error when accessing the Photos section.&nbsp; What this typically means is the app developer needs to update the app, so you would want to
 reach out to them.</li></ul>
<p>Feel free to get back to us when you can.</p>

            Hi Chanh S,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for responding.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
........Most apps install without any problems.<br />
........Issue happens after installation while trying to use the app.<br />
........I have tried installing from both marketplace and windowsphone.com website.<br />
........The walgreens app is suppose to install by tile form in app and I have been in touch with&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walgreens.com customer service/IT people trying to find out. I think it is due to new update on 7.5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phone that updates to 7.8. App shows that it works with windows 7.5, 8.0, and 8.1, but doesn't show
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.8. I know some of the employees with website can't use app either so I know they are looking into&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this issue from there stand point.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I really appreciate your feedback. I don't want to have to purchase a new phone just to make it work Sorry I tried to respond two days ago, but it came back to me

            <p>Hi Cheryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; It's completely understandable you don't want to purchase a new phone just to make the Walgreens app work, but it would be up to the app developer to make it compatible with 7.8.&nbsp; There wouldn't be any way for us to force Windows
 Phone to make this app to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the Walgreens app, which other apps are you running into issues with?&nbsp; Would you mind listing a few?&nbsp; I'd like to see if it may be issues with content in the marketplace and try installing a few on our test devices.</p>

<p>Hi Krbot,<br />
<br />
I would like to clarify what is an external user in SharePoint Online. They are users that are not part of your organization and usually uses a work/school account of a different tenant, or a personal Microsoft account.<br />
<br />
If the user is part of your organization (same tenant), then he/she is not an external user. Can you please let us know what the user's account type is?<br />
<br />
Regarding the permission issue, we'd first like to confirm the detailed steps you did to add the user/group to the site (if possible, please add screenshots for each step).<br />
<br />
Based on your description, I do not see an issue with your steps, which is why I would like some screenshots to see whether it may be an issue with the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also use your browser's private mode to make sure that the user logged in is the user you have invited to the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Sheen </p>

<p>
</p><p>It is an external user - their accounts belong to another organization, which is registered with microsoft&nbsp;licences, and not a personal account. Their account is subscribed under&nbsp;business essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps for what i did:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clicked on site permissions on the top right:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49bb291d-0bbb-465e-a149-3d1ed7a14938?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49bb291d-0bbb-465e-a149-3d1ed7a14938?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i clicked on a pre set group with read access. The other users in this group are able to read, so this is not a group issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b6267f9-3190-45f9-adf1-27058e19c04a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b6267f9-3190-45f9-adf1-27058e19c04a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>then i add users here. I have tried adding them as a group, and as individuals. all do not work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Krbot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to confirm where did you see the Active User list. Was it in the Office 365 Admin Center?<br />
<br />
Normally, when you invite a user, you enter the email address. In this example, let's say the email is user@contoso.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the user opens their email and see this invitation then click on it, the login screen will show up. Here, you can use any email (not necesarilly the initial user@contoso.com) to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, the user might forgot the he logged in using different email (such as a personal account) and forgot, and now when he/she used the work/school account, it is not located in your directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, you can:</p>
<p>1. Navigate to the SharePoint Admin Center &gt; User Profiles</p>
<p>2. Manage User Profiles</p>
<p>3. Enter the user's email address</p>
<p>4. Compare the account name with the e-mail address</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example where the email was sent to my personal Outlook account, but was logged in using my corporate account. The account name will not match the e-mail address. Please make sure that this isn't the case with your external users.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sheen</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have checked and it is the same email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, i have gotten the users to log out of all accounts and click on the invite, also to try in incognito.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see below. it is the same, left and right. So this means they are logged in with the correct account</p>
<p>
</p><p>only thing is that it is an underscore instead of a @ on the left. what would have caused it?</p>

<p>Hi Krbot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to collect more information in order to get a clearer look at the problem:</p>
<p>1. Do all the problematic users come from the same tenant?</p>
<p>2. Have these users logged in successfully before? Either to this site or a different site.</p>
<p>3. Have you tried a different site collection? If not, please do and let us know.</p>
<p>4. Have you tried inviting a personal Microsoft account? If not, please do and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I'd also like to collect your tenant as well as the external user's accounts to check the configuration from the backend. I would also like to collect a network trace of the user that is logging in and getting the issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Issues with Image printing in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 and Office 365/Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an inserted logo image in Excel and when I resize the page to "Fit on one page", the logo image doesn't resize smaller with the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ticked/unticked the following "Picture properties" in varying groupings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lock Aspect Ratio</li><li>Relative to original picture size</li><li>Move and size with cells</li><li>Move and dont Size with cells</li><li>Dont move and size with cells</li><li>Print Object</li><li>Locked</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing changes the image to scale to a smaller size when I "fit on one page"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Weird performance and issues of E72 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Weird performance and issues of E72</h2>
                    Hi Folks<br />
<br />
It seems something is wrong recently on my E72, and sometimes causes the phone to respond extremely slowly with really weird issues.<br />
<br />
For example, when the bad luck comes, the phone is nearly not responding. It is really hard to switch between tasks using the Home button. Not only just can't switch to a task, the Open Applications also shows heaps of unusual system tasks such as alfredserver,
 autolock, sharecomm, and screensaver.<br />
<br />
Moreover, typing *#0000# does not show the system info but I do see Dev Mgr is listed in Open Applications.<br />
<br />
My E72 has been updated with the latest firmware 091.004.<br />
<br />
The only way to fix the issues is to restart the phone. Sometimes the restart process may be very slow, and I have to remove the battery and wait for several minutes for the next restart.<br />
<br />
I really have no idea what's wrong with the phone. Maybe it is just getting old and should be retired?<br />
<br />
Any comment is welcome.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
bbao

<p>Easy for me to say as have access to completely re-install device software, but did you consider returning device to "Out of box" state by keying in *#7370# followed by 12345 (default nokia lock code unless altered by user) before updating the firmware as
 E72 has UDP = User Data Preservation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly don't experience problems with *#0000# working as per screenshot:</p>

            My E72 has the exact same Software Version, Version Date and Custom Version.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by "completely re-install device software", re-install the current firmware? How please?<br />
<br />
BTW, I have tried hard reset and didn't see any difference. :-(

<p>Hard reset the phone again by the Shift - Space - Backspace combination, and all the above problems are now gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the three-key combination more thorough than *#7370# ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, one more issue appear, sometimes while switching between tasks, just one part of previous task's screen may leave on the current screen for a little while, as shown below. the part is always at the same location on the top of screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any hints about why this could happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can be more so for some devices than others and in the case of Symbian S^3 devices possibly too destructive, as wipes both C\ and E\ of user data plus some esssential certificates needed for operation of Nokia Store &amp; Maps!</p>

            Thanks for the explanation.<br />
<br />
One more interesting thing was that the phone's keypad tone was off after the three-key reset. Normally it should be on by factory default. I did twice and got the same result.<br />
<br />
Regarding the new screen issue, do you have any comments please?

            Just an update: After removed all configured connections and stopped using SC (Smart Connection), the strange small box area no longer appears. therefore that area should be caused by some prompts of SC.

<h2>            macro to add fill to a shape</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got Office 2013 a week ago and besides the weird typing issue - which I've corrected,&nbsp;the ribbon shouting at me - which I've corrected and the enormous lack of color issue (daily headaches and extreme eyestrain) which I'd love to have corrected, I do
 like it, however, when IT swapped out 2010 for 2013 some of my macros disappeared.&nbsp; So I am now trying to re-create my most often used macros and have had some success so far, however, I can not seem to re-create my macro to change the fill color of a shape.&nbsp;
 Our company uses specific colors for our new branding, so when a report is prepared using a chart, the company wants the colors to coincide with our branding colors.&nbsp; But as you all know, if you aren't using the proper theme, you get the default colors.&nbsp; So,
 it is my job as the editor to change those colors to our company's colors.&nbsp; I created a macro in Word 2010&nbsp;that did this beautifully, but I can't seem to get it to work in 2013.&nbsp; And, I can't remember what I wrote to code it.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; If someone
 can get me started, I can change the RGB to the proper colors.&nbsp; Thanks all.</p>

<h2>            Nokia X6 - Sim card not valid</h2>
                    
<p>Got a replacement handset from O2 today for my 16GB Nokia X6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On start up it says "Sim Card not valid"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sim works in other handsets no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoke to O2 and they advise its definately approved for O2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried reset also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Does other sim cards work in the X6 phone? O2 simcards?<br />
<br />
I would ask with O2 again and get a new phone. It might be a hardware fault with the sim card reader on the replacement device you got. I'v seen this a couple of times, e. g with a my best mates N95 8 gb.

<p>Ah, I see. The phone isn't locked? You could ask if O2 could check the Imei number and possibly provide you with a lock code, but since its "their" device, I guess its more likely to be some fault. Maybe they could provide you with a new Sim card too, just
 to be sure?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess it's solved tomorrow then! You could ask them if they could try the new phone with a O2 sim before they shipped it.</p>

<p>Its problem after problem with them though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMEI was checked and they said it wasnt locked for O2, they said an unlock code can take up to 7 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if they post a new one out tomorrow, I could ask them to check with a working sim but the last replacement I got nearly 2 weeks ago was a faulty battery.</p>

            I understand that this feels like a sting in the a**. Unfortunately theres little I can help you with when it comes to O2s phones. It might be that they have got a bad batch or something which has faults with different phones.<br />
<br />
Ask them to check it with a Sim card before sending it, hopefully this one will work.

            Yeah, I totally understand that. I cannot come up with anything else as your simcards works in other phones, O2 has checked the IMEI and no other Sim card works in the new X6 of yours. Looks like a replacement is the only solution to this.

<h3> gusnor---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E6 Really slow internet</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried this on 3 different Nokia E6 phones, on GPRS with 5bars, 3G with 5bars and at home over wifi...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All internet traffic is really slow, when on the browser downloading the SIS file for google maps, it took 5mins to download just 160k. Once i did get it installed, the Google Maps app take ages to load map tiles, and emails take about a minute to download
 an email with just a few lines of text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whe using OVI store, pages load really slow. So all internet apps are slow. The phone overall is quick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this in an edge or 3G area with 5bars, and 3 phones do the exact same. all firmware&nbsp;ver 22.14</p>
<p>on o2 uk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same settings, area&nbsp;and sim card in my Nokia E71 and E72 are perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas or does anyone else have slow internet apps on E6 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3 phones, very funny, i wish! they are for a customer..</p>
<p>all devices are new with standard firmware 22.14 and no extra software installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow though, thanks for the suggestion. I uninstalled F-secure and bang, the speed increase was massive. It's now a totally different phone.&nbsp; Kasperky is not on the phone. I knew fsecure was there but it was set to 'not active' so i didnt think it would maater.
 But it so did matter. Only once it was removed totally did the speed go way up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi store, google maps, email, browser. All infinately faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again, you really helped me out.</p>

<h2>            Unlocked Samsung Omnia 7 Mango Update using Windows Phone Connector for Mac</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I picked up a Samsung Omnia 7 in December 2010 from a store in Mumbai, India. I was unaware&nbsp; at the time that the phone was an
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unlocked model from 3 (Three) in the UK</span>.<br />
<br />
I waited for a almost 10 months for the NoDo update to show up in Windows Phone Connector for Mac, and finally today when I plugged it into my iMac, I got an Update Available Message. So I clicked Update. It updated without any issues.<br />
<br />
This is my current info:<br />

<br />
So, after it updated to the above, I got another Update Available message. So I clicked Update, but this time after about 30 minutes, during the Installing Update Stage, I got an
<span style="font-weight: bold">'Update Cannot Be Installed, Please Try Running The Update Again'</span> error message. There was no error code.<br />
<br />
So, I came on here to see what the issue was, and find that Phones etc are being bricked or suffering from a host of other issues. By all accounts, Mango is a significant upgrade, and I would like to have it, but my Omnia 7 is not under warranty, and it cost
 an awful lot of money, so I don't want to take any chances.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution for this? If I click Update Again, is there a chance I could brick my phone ?
<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated,<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Sandeep.<br />

            Erm, you are running the between-NoDo-and-Mango build. The phone should not left in this state.<br />
<br />
Check for updates again by going to Device Options&gt;Check for Updates. Continue with the Mango update. If it fails again, restore the backup the Connector prior to starting the Mango update process and try again from scratch.<br />

                    <p>Hi, all. I have a document with multiple tables. When a table carriers over to another page, it shifts its position to a different margin setting. When I try to adjust, the ENTIRE document shifts. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Charles' suggestion of a screenshot is a good idea. You can use the Picture tool (circled below) to upload one:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5844d833-1f99-416c-a298-fb0fff4ca190?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5844d833-1f99-416c-a298-fb0fff4ca190?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your document is set up with different even and odd pages, you could see a margin shift from one page to the next. You can verify this by choosing
<strong>Format&gt;Document</strong>, then clicking on the <strong>Layout</strong> tab. Is
<strong>Different odd and even</strong> checked? Now choose the <strong>Margins</strong> tab. Is
<em>Gutter</em> greater than <strong>0</strong>? If so, that's the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's not that, please show us.</p>

<h2>            Slow typing or lag when composing emails</h2>
                    <p>There is a delay when I type an email in Outlook. It's not just typing, even using backspace there is a delay.</p>
<p>This only happens in Outlook email, no where else. I have tried other browsers with same results.</p>
<p>When I contacted Microsoft helpline, I was asked a stream of inane questions and then told that Outlook email was not part of Microsoft but a kind of third party.</p>
<p>I am using windows 7, 64bit, and have had this problem for about a week.</p>
