<p>Am I wrong? &nbsp;I have achieved 15th Prestige lvl 50 so the double XP isnt going to do anything for me at all? &nbsp;Or do they also give double cash during this time period, which is the only thing now that I need, to buy items.</p>
<p>Once a player reaches 15 / 50 I think it would be a great idea that those players get COD cash since the XP doesnt do a darn thing for us anymore.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;If the double cash is already a part of the double xp weekend then disregard post. &nbsp;If not, how do we actually make a suggestion to Treyarch to put this in place?</p>

<p>[/quote] Maybe just maybe... everyone shouldn't have rushed to get Prestige 15 so quickly. I've had friends who made Prestige 15 in three months time (some less) and not one of them seem to play any better than I do (Prestige 2). Conspiracy?!?!? As for the
 double cash... um, nope. Keep it like it is. Want cash? Go play wager match.</p>

<p>About 10% of experience earned, whether you are at max level or not, is awarded as COD points. So during double exp weekend, you get double the money.</p>

<p>[/quote] You know I luv ya ADC like I do all my friends on my friends list (even when I want to ring their necks like Homer does Bart sometimes). Having a goal is a good thing in these type games. It might be Prestige, kill ratio, win ratio (my personal
 goal), SPM (which I think is overrated) or even just to have the best time possible (which is arguably the best goal). But for all the goals the goal of 15th Prestige might be the most overrated. Players in CoD4 through Black Ops rush to get there and all
 that happens... is they not only have no where to go but now everyone who wants to talk crap... will if you play bad and honestly they should if you're playing like you got the game yesterday like many do. A 15th Prestige player with a k/d of 0.75 shouldn't
 talk crap (and I see this way too much) because of his prestige. He should let his game play do the talking. Let it be known, I do not mean this for all the past 10th and 15th Prestiges. The ones I'm directing it to know who I'm talking about.

Prestige carries no weight in the CoD series whatsoever.</span> Too many times kids and newer players get all bright eyed at the high level players when they should be paying attention to how that player carries himself instead.</p>

<p>Yes cus just because you reached 15th prestige Treyarch should no longer do double xp. Obviously the world revolves around you.</p>

<div>None of the two solutions you suggest succeeded.</div>
<div><br />
<div>CD-DVD-BD Drive : still reading DVD but not BD</div>
<div><br />
<div>Still Microsoft Explorer GREEN BAR when drive is empty : see screenshot in Skydrive :&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=9FFD1894107A9C2E!551</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you suggest another solution ?</div>

<p>Remember that when playing co-op in Gears 2 you don't have to be on the same difficulty. The co-op partner can be on Casual, while you play on Insane. They can take care of all the hard work and you'll still get the Insane achievement.</p>

 anything I can do besides chuck the piece of junk out the window?

            We do not know what exactly you mean with "I have tried everything", so here are the usual methods to resolve this issue:<br />
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if the problem occurred recently).</li><li>Log on under an alternative admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up an alternative admin account).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you enabled the Administrator account and know its password).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you created such a keyfile).</li></ul>
If none of the above work for you then the cure will be painful. Post again if this is the case.

                    <p>I was watching Hulu when all of the sudden it stopped working. I quit the app and restarted, it loaded up, then wouldn't play anything. Tried Netflix, same thing, loads the app but won't play. Detailed network statistics: all is well except I have 100% packet loss. 100mbps down 50mbps up. All other wireless devices working fine in the house. Logged into router, needed firmware update (set to automatic, not sure why it didn't). Updated, rebooted, same thing. Reserved IP is fine. Xbox is connected but it's not bringing up any of my tiles on the home page. Apps load but won't play content. Homepage says to connect to Xbox Live. Also performed hard reset, and sign in/out of profile. Disconnected and reconnected wireless. No joy. Ideas?</p>

            I just clicked update and followed the steps. &nbsp;I'm not sure. &nbsp;I ended up redoing it from a usb following a Microsoft employees suggestion and then it wouldn't activate and another Microsoft employee then informed me I'd have to pay for a new one. &nbsp;So I
 gave up. &nbsp;Gave my computer to my brother to try to get my Windows 7 back. &nbsp;Thanks though.

            Which method are you using to install the Service Pack, Windows Update or .exe download from Microsoft Downloads?<br />
<br />
If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.<br />
<br />
Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22 2011). Unlike previous Service Packs, Windows
 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22 2009. If you have been diligently updating your computer through Windows Update since
 then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.<br />
<br />
* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix: http://is.gd/22brle<br />
<br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Type CD\ and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Other solutions:<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.<br />
<br />
2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.<br />
http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/<br />
<br />
3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in your
 off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.<br />
<br />
4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you have
 a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.<br />
<br />
5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced the
 issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which is based
 on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.<br />
<br />
6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Accept User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.<br />
<br />
7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.<br />

Check your hard disk for errors, Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.<br />
<br />
Install the drivers for your LAN adapter (Wireless, Ethernet or Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your computer. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.<br />
<br />
Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">reinstall</span></strong>&nbsp;8.1 it will pick up the Product Key and activate the system&nbsp;automatically.</p>

<span><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><span>It isn't possible to play sounds at the same time from speakers and headphone because only one can be default at a time.&nbsp; You can, however,<br />
play sounds from two different applications.<br />
<br />
To do this, follow the steps below:<br />
a. Open iTunes, play a song with headphone being the default device.<br />
b. Open your second application and change the default device to speakers.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Your music will continue to play through your headphones while your second application plays through your speakers.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>During reinstall TPM message came up twice 'A configuration change was requested to clear the computer's TPM' 'Press F12 to Clear the TPM, Press ESC to reject this change and continue' and I hit ESC to reject change request and continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall all fine, but now the message comes up on every restart and I have to hit 'Esc' before it will open.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To change the TPM configuration settings, need to get into BIOS settings, so it’s better to contact the computer manufacturer for changing the configuration settings.</p>

                    Hi,i noticed that i couldnt connect to the internet so i opened up my device manager. i noticed there was an (!) beside WAN Miniport (SSTP).I viewed the hidden devices and thats still the only one that has a (!) beside it. ive tried SO much to get this
 thing uninstalled, but nothing is working. My windows firewall wont work either, and i think the WAN is the source of that problem too. ive chatted AND called someone from microsoft, but noone was any help, nor did it seem like they were trying to help or
 that they knew what i was talking about. Im using another computer to connect to the internet right now(obviously). Please someone shed some light on this subject,i feel like microsoft has given up on me.

<p><span>To work with this issue, refer these methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
First, uninstall all the drivers related to the WAN miniport from your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to browse your computer manufacturer’s website and download the latest drivers for chipset and
</span><span>network adapter</span><span>.</span></p>

<p>Hi Stanley,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums. We are here to help you with all your Windows related issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the given description, you would like to change the account type of the second user from “Standard” to “Administrator” without adding another email address.
 Please let me know, if I got this incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can definitely change account type of another user account in your computer. But, you need to be an administrator for doing this. Follow these steps and check
 if it works:</p>

<h2>            what is Win32NT-6.0.6002.131072</h2>
                    I just did a Windows update and now I get this window that pops up when I restart my computer. I have Vista.
<br />
<p>Win32NT-6.0.6002.131072. I can close it but I don't know what this is....<br />
</p>
<p>Also, my HP ToolBox is now not working. I get this error: HP ToolBox has stopped working.
<br />
</p>
<p>This happened the last time I updated windows and I had to set my computer back a week for these things to fix themselves.
<br />
</p>
<p>I know that there are so many scenarios of what might have happened when I updated windows. I wish I could pinpoint what update caused these things.</p>
<p>I will set my computer back to yesterday and see if it works. I am spooked now to update windows...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
If you have any fixes, let me know.<br />

                    When I insert a DVD disc it does nothing on my computer. Used to autoplay. I installed DVD cloner on my computer so I am able to copy so of my DVD discs. DVD Cloner runs and copies but nothing will play on my computer. When I insert any type of media nothing
 happens, I have to open it manually. How can I fix this problem?&nbsp;

            Hi <span>shiloh107</span>,<br />
<br />
I'd be glad to assist you with your concern. Since you have mentioned that you have tried re-installing the program several times and still the issue exist. I would suggest that you perform a repair of your Windows Live Essentials as corrupted files might also
 contribute to the error that you are having with.<br />
<br />
Please follow the steps provided below on how to repair your Windows Live Essentials:<br />
<br />
1. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
<br />
2. Double-click <strong>Programs and Features<br />
</strong><br />
3. Right click <strong>Windows Live Essentials</strong>, and click <strong>Uninstall/Change<br />
</strong><br />
4. Click the radio button labeled <strong>Repair</strong> in the window that appears, and click
<strong>Continue</strong>. Windows will repair all of the files needed to run Windows Live Messenger, and the program should return to functioning normally.<br />
<br />
If this does not resolve the issue, please check if WLXPhotoBase.dll is missing on this path file C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Photo Gallery.
<span>
Surely, this will help facilitate our actions regarding your issue.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            Hi <span>shiloh107,<br />
<br />
It's possible that your firewall software is blocking the file to be downloaded on your computer. We request that you turn off your firewall and anti-virus&nbsp;temprorarily then try to install the Windows Live Essentials while offline. Please follow the instructions
 in the Solution Article below:<br />
<br />

            OK Idid all the suggestions as far as turning off the firewall and installing windows live programs while off line and still get the same message of the missing program. And just for the heck of it I tried to start windows live mesh and that also gave
 me a message of a uninstalled dll file. To be honest Installing windows 7 in the first place has been a pain from day one I wound up loseing all my data when I first installed it, spent days on the phone with your techs just to get the computer squared away
 and photo gallery did not work back then I just ran out of time I could devote to fixing my computer. It is really annoying that I can get a third party software to install and work easily, but MSoft always seem to have some glitch that consumes all my time
 to get it to work.

            Hi <span>shiloh107,<br />
<br />
I can assure you that this is an isolated issue. For the next steps, let's make sure that this is not an issue with the computer's system file. Please run this Fix it tool:<br />
<br />
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></strong></a><span><br />
</span><span><br />
Then, uninstall and re-install Windows Live Essentials in the same exact order as show below:<br />
<br />
1) Perform Windows update:<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx</span></b></a><b><span>
<br />
<br />
</span></b><span>2) Clear Windows Live Essentials by following the instructions from this link:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=64db5c80-85e4-49fe-bf07-cb08ffc5dd53" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>How to uninstall Windows
 Live Essentials</span></strong></a><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><span>3) Browse your computer to
<b>C:\Program Files</b> then delete the <b>Windows Live </b>folder if available.<br />
Go to <b>C:\Program Files\Common Files\ </b>rename the folder Windows Live on this location.
<br />
<br />
4) Temporarily disable other firewall.<br />
<br />
Note: Disabling the firewall may make your computer or your network vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. Please make sure that you do not have any other Internet Explorer window open or any other programs running
 while trying to install Windows Live products. Once, you are able to install our services, please turn your firewall back on.
<br />
<br />
5) Reset browser to factory settings:<br />
<br />
For Internet Explorer: <br />
<br />
a. Open <b>Internet Explorer</b>. <br />
b. Click <b>Tools</b>, and then click <b>Internet Options</b>. <br />
c. Click the <b>Advanced</b> tab. <br />
d. Under <b>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</b>, click<b> Reset</b>.<br />
<br />
If you are using other browser, please look for steps on how to reset your browser to factory settings via bing.com
<br />
<br />
6) Download and install Windows Live Essentials from </span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other</span></b></a><b><span>

            I tried all this and to no avail. I'll try again when i get a chance. I noticed none of the windows live programs work. But one funny thing is if I start the virtual PC running Windows xp photo gallery comes on without a glitch. I wonder if this has anything
 to do with it.

            Hi <span>shiloh107,<br />
<br />
Just to verify, was there any error found when you run the Fix it on my last post?<br />
<br />
I appreciate if you can inform us&nbsp;what the results will be&nbsp;once you try again.<br />
<br />
Another step that you can try during your spare time is to create a new Windows user account and install Windows Live Photo Gallery and Windows Live Movie Maker. This way, we can discount the possibility that your Windows user profile is corrupted. Here's the
 link for the steps:<br />
