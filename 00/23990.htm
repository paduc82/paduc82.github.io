<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/E04189E8-B5DE-430E-BBA9-798F3D4AF726">blanquito,</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to purchasing methods please see the link below:</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-GB/howto/wp7/apps/find-and-buy-apps-in-marketplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-GB/howto/wp7/apps/find-and-buy-apps-in-marketplace.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Microsoft's Windows support site states</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span>"</span>By default, applications are added to your phone bill
<u>(when available)</u>. To pay with a credit card instead, press&nbsp;<span>Change payment method</span>&nbsp;on the purchase confirmation screen"</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your operator doesn't support this then the only other method is to pay via credit card. You can't use Microsoft points as this is designed for the Xbox games console&nbsp;Live Market ecosystem and the gift card you refer to is either the Xbox points card
 which again applies only to Xbox console or the Zune music pass with applies only to music purchases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Presumably <strong><font color="#FF9900">Raoul_Duke</font></strong> didn't mention these prepaid app. cards as AFAIK they have only been provided as a result of two Lumia promotions and not available for purchase, one being a Visa card run by Citibank which
 is now closed <a href="https://www.nokiaarch.co.uk/appspromo/nokia.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.nokiaarch.co.uk/appspromo/nokia.html</a>&nbsp;and the other a Mastercard run by Newcastle Building Society in this scheme

            I've never used one but presumably any pre - paid card would work and would be useful for OP to use on other sites which need payment by credit card.

<p>that is incredibly short sighted of Microsoft i have no credit card and the phone bill thing doesn't work so i basically can not buy any apps I've been a loyal Nokia user every since the 5110 and i have had many since,</p>
<p>and i do understand that the windows marketplace has very little if anything to do with Nokia but at the end of the day who's name is on the front of the lumia 800 what else can i say my girlfriend has an iphone personally i don't like them or the app store
 but at least you can buy apps from IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :thumbdown::cursing:</p>

    <title>Outlook stopped working with ntlworld.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbybill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook stopped working with ntlworld.com</h2>
                    I run office 365 with Office Profesional 2010 Plus on the PC. There 7 email accounts set up in Outlook&nbsp; with thedefault accountand all has been working an Office 365 Microsoft Exchange as the default. All has been working fine for a number of years.<br />
However recently people with ntlworld.com addresses have not been receiving emails sent by me although they do receive from all&nbsp; other people.<br />
I have tried rectifying by the following<br />
1) restarting Outlook and Windows - no change.<br />
2) deleting and adding the account with&nbsp; the same settings (IMAP/smpt)&nbsp; set up automatically and manually-no change<br />
3) deleting and adding the account with pop3/smpt again set up automatically and manually.&nbsp; These are identical to the&nbsp; Virgin Meadia account which is one of the accounts that continues to run satisfactorily. - no change<br />
4)When setting up the accounts above the test emails Microsft sends work perfectly and return to the default email box . They are shown in the&nbsp; Virgin Media ntlworld web view inbox<br />
5) if I send an email to myself (ntlworld account) from the logged in account on the Virgin Media site (web view) it is arrives in my default in box. Shown in web view inbox.<br />
6) if I send a mail to myself (ntl account) from outlook it does not appear in the ntlworld logged in web view site so has no chance of arriving back in my mail box. It is shown in the Sent folder. Have tried sending from several of the 7 outlook accounts all
 with same result so it appears to me that Outlook is not sending composed mail even though it will send test mails to test the connection - do this frequently to make sure this works.<br />
<br />
I have tried one online service that required the PID&nbsp; 02260-523-3052022-48396 but said this was invalid. We are an educational Charity with a volume licencing arrangement in the UK where this version of Office was installed from<br />
<br />
I have exhausted my input and would like some help please - we do have helpers with ntlworld accounts.<br />

<br />
From when are you facing this issue with Outlook?<br />
<br />
Start outlook in safe mode and then try to send emails to verify the result.<br />
<br />
Are the email service provide and internet service provide same or different??<br />

            I have tried the safe mode with the same results. I have also sent mails from my laptop while travellling around but still using Exchange Microsoft, as well as trying with the Andriod phone - same result.<br />
However with a 2 day lag I am receiving Delivery fail mails, example&nbsp; copied below - I am not familiar enough to interpret these- any advice on next steps.<br />

<br />You don't have to use it very long  - but sometimes it helps to set it as default, verify links work then go back to your preferred browser. 
<br />
<br />on this: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\.html You could try changing value not set to FireFoxHTML

</p><p>If, by <em>text box</em>, you actually mean <strong>text placeholder</strong>, the placeholder will not be locked on the slide created from the layout, because locks are released on those objects when a slide is created from a layout. In this situation,
 the best you can do is prevent users from modifying the layout.</p>

            How&nbsp;does it not? ... Netflix, et al, streaming is accessed via the IE web browser.. It seems IE "functionality" is being compromised by pen and touch pop-up... It degrades streaming feature no matter what I do with it... allow, don't allow, or close (which
 lets screen time out during streaming)... Why&nbsp;does pen and touch pop-up appear at all? How can I rid myself of it? ...It&nbsp;displeases me<br />

<p>I followed the thread here on community and it had several suggestions. One was to add Netflix to your trusted sites and that worked. I can now watch full screen movies and whatever that pen and touch thing does not pop up.

<h2>            Some imported drawings won&#39;t print from Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I've experienced this problem in several documents:</p>
<p>Buildng a large file with text, tables, figures. Some of the imported figures (viso block diagrams for the most part) don't print from Word, but WILL print if I save the files as a PDF (then view or print the PDF). I've tried replacing the offending illustrations,
 to no avail.</p>
<p>I have made sure that the appropriate options are set (all printing options except "Print document properties" are checked in the Display options list).</p>
<p>Stumped.</p>

    <title>PowerPoint slides are not consistently updating from Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greys4me  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint slides are not consistently updating from Excel spreadsheets</h2>
                    
<p>My company recently upgraded from Office 2000 to Office 2007 (and WinXP to Win7 at the same time).&nbsp;&nbsp; Our CFO is an experienced Excel and PowerPoint user and he has a large number of Excel spreadsheets with data and graphs that are linked to several PowerPoint
 presentations.&nbsp; All were created in Office 2000 and have been working together successfully for several years.&nbsp; By "working together" I mean that the PowerPoint slides have always updated completely from the Excel spreadsheets.&nbsp; Since moving to Office 2007,
 however, several of the PowerPoint presentations have some slides that will not update fully from Excel.&nbsp; The "cell" portion of the Excel spreadsheets appear/update as expected onto the PowerPoint slides but the associated Excel graphs are not being updated
 (are not appearing at all) on the related PowerPoint slide.</p>
<p>The CFO gave me a nice demo about how he set up the PowerPoint/Excel links and how they<em>should</em> update the PP slides but were not reliably doing so. &nbsp; I could<em>see</em> the problem played out on his computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am NOT a PowerPoint user and not
 a real whiz with Excel either--I'm an applications programmer who has inherited the user education and troubleshooting duties for my company's recent WinXP to Win7 and Office 2000 to Office 2007 upgrade.&nbsp; I had the CFO send me one of his PP presentations and
 its associated Excel doc so I could play them and become a bit more familiar with the setup between PP and Excel.&nbsp; I wanted to play with some possibilities--I was wondering if the issue was caused by the PP doc not having been converted to Office 2007 file
 type (.ppt) while the Excel docs had been (.xlsx).&nbsp; Of course, without any intervention at all from me other than asking the PP to update when I opened it, for<em>me</em> the PP presentation was appropriately updated from Excel. This was NOT the result for
 the CFO from performing the same steps.</p>
<p>I'm now mightily confused about what is going wrong for the same PP/Excel docs for the CFO. &nbsp; But I've got to&nbsp; resolve this for him since, well, he's the CFO and these nifty PP doc that are misbehaving are the ones he uses for all his board meeting presentations.&nbsp;
 They represent a huge amount of work that we really do <em>not</em> want to loose or redo.</p>
<p>So, any ideas?&nbsp; Some kind of setup issue?&nbsp; If so, what?&nbsp; Any help will be gratefully accepted as I am stumped and way over my head on this one.</p>
<p>--Lucy</p>

            <p>I *think* the patch is included in SP2, which then causes other problems with graphs. PPT crashes when you edit them under some circumstances, but there's a patch for that too.&nbsp; Are we having fun yet?&nbsp; ;-)</p>

    <title>disconnect Skype from hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kazibear  say:</h3>
<h2>            disconnect Skype from hotmail</h2>
                    PLEASE tell me how I can disconnect Skype from my Hotmail. I don't want to have Skype on, but if I turn Skype off, it turns Hotmail off. While I'm writing an email, if something changes on the Skype screen, my cursor jumps and I start writing to someone
 else on Skype, without my being aware. This is driving me crazy. I want my Hotmail separate from my Skype PLEASE. I don't want people on Skype to think that I'm available if I'm on Hotmail (and it keeps automatically making me available). Please tell me how
 to get Skype off my Hotmail page. If I can't, I'm going to have to stop using both of them. I never asked for this and wasn't asked if I wanted this. How can I disconnect them?&nbsp; Thank you.

</p><p>Skype is fully integrated with Outlook.com/Hotmail.com and cannot be turned off. In the meantime, you can customize notification settings for incoming Skype calls and/or chat notifications in Outlook/Hotmail, turning notification toasts and sounds on or

<h2>            No spelling or grammar check in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I cannot use spelling or grammar check in Word 2016. It doesn't underline or recognize any mistakes as I go, when performing a review of spelling and grammar, or in any other configuration. Every document check I perform with intentional mistakes comes back
 instantly as finished and no errors detected. I've tried and checked everything except editing the registry. Even the Grammarly add in does not detect mistakes, but I'm not sure what that tells me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS customer support will only help if I purchase a premier support plan which costs close to the purchase price of Office itself. I cannot function without this feature. I'm willing to try editing the registry if I know the directions are specific to Windows
 2016, which I haven't seen on this forum. I've tried everything on the Master Spell check document, except modify the registry. Thanks very much for any help you can offer.</p>

Thanks! I disabled Grammarly already, and had only added it when MS Support didn't seem an option. I'll check out registry edit then.

<p>OK - took the plunge and edited the registry. Seems to have fixed the problem and so far everything seems to be working! Thanks for giving me the confidence to proceed!</p>

    <title>I upgraded my Access mdb database to accdb and nothing is working now. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I upgraded my Access mdb database to accdb and nothing is working now.</h2>
                    <p>I'm at a loss. My company is planning to move from Office 2010 to Office 2016. At work, I have a desktop running Windows 7 pro with Office 2010 and a laptop running Windows 10 pro with Office 2016. We use a Common.dotm file for Word and a Common.xlam for
 Excel. We have visual basic code inside that out quote templates pull from to get an automated quote number. Of course, 2016 didn't like the .mdb file format, so I use Access 2010 to update it to a .accdb file. From looking at it, everything should work with
 just a few slight modifications to the code. But it doesn't. I get nothing but errors in both Word and Excel. Now this whole database was made using Access 97 so it's pretty old. I'm going to attach the excel version of it because the code is pretty much the
 same in both. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What we do is take the common file, which contains the auto number code, and put it in the xlstart folder. So when we open up our quote template, we get an automatically generated quote number in sequence, it always picks the next number up. So if the last
 quote number was something like 3456, the next time some one opens the template the number would go up to 3457 and so on. This is the same with word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a fix for this? I'm putting the code below.</p>

            No I don't see anything missing. Forgive me though, I'm very new to this. Before this past week I have never touched VB or access before. But I'm the only IT guy in our office who has and knows windows 10 and office 2016 so I was told to figure it out
 so we can upgrade. So I apologize ahead of time. Also, I didn't write this code. I was still in high school in a different state when this code was written.&nbsp;

            That's our inventory list. It queries that so if sails types in a part number or a description it pulls the info in automatically. I'm not sure if I can send that one. But I'll try. That part works though. It's just the auto number which is the quote number
 in the upper right of the sheet.&nbsp;

            I can't view the VBA code in your spreadsheets as it is password protected.

<h2>            Changing search providers in IE</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 with IE 11 and wanted to change my search provider however unlike in the past when the IE Gallery at Microsoft would bring up numerous alternatives it now brings up Facebook and Ask. Facebook? Are you kidding?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me how to get the rest of the selections that used to be available to select from like maybe Google?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the page that comes up when you select find more search providers from manage add-ons in IE options. I believe there also used to be a search option on the page so you could search for what you wanted but that doesn't appear to be the case anymore
 either.</p>

<h2>            &#39;Preparing to install&#39; message when clicking on Microsoft Office programs</h2>
                    Everytime I click to open a Microsoft Office program, for example Excel or Word, a 'Preparing to install' message appears. If I leave the install message, a few seconds later a 'fatal error during installation' message appears. I want to uninstall Microsoft
 Office (Home and Student 2010) and reinstall it, but it won't let me uninstall it as when I go to the Control Panel and click 'Uninstall', nothing happens. I've tried various programs, Windows FixIt and manually removing all the programs and I still get the
 same error message.

<p>
</p><p>There is NOT a credential specifically needed in order to use a google calendar link. However I've tried my google account password and specific app password. Neither of them works. Tried to delete entire outlook profile and add new one, no luck either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can pour them into my Outlook.com calendar first and then add it into my Outlook, but I'd rather not to do it for now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook on my PC was set up first though with exactly the same settings but works fine.</p>

<h2>            E71 software missing features and bugs</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just "upgraded" my 6220 classic to a E71 and am shocked to realise that the 6220 had software features not present on the E71. I thought they were both S60v3 phones so I wasn't expecting there to be any issue.</p>
<p>I mean how can you not have "timed profiles" on a "business phone"?</p>
<p>Then there is the variable snooze time feature which is missing and also a bug in the SMS viewer where your messages are always shown as "lastname, firstname" even when you set it for "firstname, lastname".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to know from Nokia if they ever intend addressing these software issues in future software updates or if they are going to just give their customers the middle finger and tell me to buy a new model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also can anyone with the latest E72 model please clarify if the E72 has these issues fixed?</p>

<p>The E71 (S60 3rd FP1) runs a different OS as the 6220c (S60 3rd FP2). The E72 uses S60 3rd FP2.</p>

<br />
Ostensibly, perhaps the following does what you want:<br />
<br />
In V2:<br />
=IFERROR(INT(T2/3105),"")<br />
<br />
In W2:<br />
=IFERROR(ROUNDUP(MOD(T2,3105)/1350,0),"")<br />
<br />
However, that might not provide an "optimal" result, depending on your definition of "optimal".&nbsp; For example, suppose you have 4050 units (1350*3).&nbsp; The formulas above will result in 1 in V2 and 1 in W2 with significant "waste" in the latter.&nbsp; If you are happy
 with that answer, fine.&nbsp; But under some conditions, 0 in V2 and 3 in W2 might be the preferred result.<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; It is unclear why you use IFERROR in your original formulas.&nbsp; I retained it just in case there is a good reason (e.g. T2 might be the null string).<br />

<p>Hi ИльяЖаворонков,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Based on our investigation, we renamed the file to <em>.zip</em> and extract it to be able to look what images could be the cause of the issue. There are some
<strong>TIFF</strong> images that seem to be not able to compress. We suggest trying this on your side and convert the
<strong>TIFF</strong> images to <strong>JPEG</strong> and see if it will solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Regards,<br />
Justin</div>

<h2>            Skip Ahead Preview</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time I have opted in to Skip Ahead program and updated my main laptop to the build 16353.</p>
<p>Now I've got another installation on build 16251 and when trying to update it, it fails with below error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An update is being prepared for your device, but it's not quite ready yet. We'll keep trying or you can try again now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is, if the insider content type linked to my account or to the particular build that I participate in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, YR.</p>
<p />
