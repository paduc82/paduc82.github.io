<h2>            Outlook.com auto-forward not forwarding all emails</h2>
                    I have forwarding set to automatically forward any emails received into my outlook.com account to my hotmail.co.uk account. &nbsp;recently emails from certain senders have not been received into my hotmail.co.uk account. &nbsp;This only seems to be affecting certain
 senders and not all emails. &nbsp;I have tried removing the forwarding and setting it up again but this has not resolved.

            <p>It appears there is no solution for the time being. The below post by Terry Zink of Microsoft describes why this is happening and that there is still no fix in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tzink/2016/05/19/why-does-my-email-from-facebook-that-i-forward-from-my-outlook-com-account-get-rejected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tzink/2016/05/19/why-does-my-email-from-facebook-that-i-forward-from-my-outlook-com-account-get-rejected/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[UPDATE 12/16/2016]</strong></p>
<p>Terry Zink reported on 12/9 that they still have not been able to check in a fix for the problem, so this saga continues. I personally have been getting&nbsp;<em>more</em> emails forwarded through outlook.com since last week, but there are still sporadic situations
 where emails aren't getting forwarded. It is still <strong>highly</strong> advisable to go to your outlook.com forwarding settings and check the box to keep a copy in your inbox.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017, 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7,16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3) running Mojave operating System) and running the Excel in Microsoft Office 2016, Version 16.16.3, Product ID: ***-***-***. I have automatic update enabled and update the
 software whenever the program says to.&nbsp; I use the spreadsheet to keep track of member information for a club, and we have about 650 lines of data.&nbsp; One of the members in the club, who is much sharper at Excel, than I.&nbsp; created the spreadsheet, which has macros,
 to catalog and process member information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is two-fold:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The spreadsheet was created in windows and runs very quickly on any windows machine, but is much slower on my Macintosh.&nbsp; Since both PC and Mac's have Intel processors, its not clear why this should be the case. Is there anything that can be done to increase
 the processing speed on my computer. I mean the difference is speed is striking when comparing the side by side, talking seconds to do an operation versus an minute or more on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When we do a certain operation (preparing a data sheet for printing, the Mac will either hang up (spinning ball that requires a force quit to break out of the loop.&nbsp; If the program executes the operation, it generates a file that can be printed. However
 when I save the file and quit, it corrupts the data file, not allowing it to be opened again by my computer.&nbsp; My Windows based programmer can bring it up on his computer and recover the data, but this is obviously annoying to him, and should not be happening
 on software that is compatible across platforms, and EXCEL should be.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would really appreciate your input and suggestions on this, as we use the spreadsheet extensively.&nbsp; Note that the Windows user has never had either of these problems on his machine, whereas mine is consistently having them.</p>

<p>Hi Ron</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code base of Excel for Mac and Windows is the same. Given similar processor specs and assuming similar graphic card specs speed should be about the same for both platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a known issue that Page Layout view in Excel for Mac has speed problems. Use Normal view, instead. If you have a boat-load of active fonts, that can slow things down, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than these two factors, I don't know of anything in particular that would be a lot slower on the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're not the code author, perhaps you could convince the code author to step through the code on your Mac and see exactly which command(s) are slowing you down. Then the author could post a new question here for each thing that is causing the slowdown,
 as well as a question that addresses the file saving issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without knowing which commands were issued, what they were doing and how they were doing it, there's not much anyone can do to try to speed up the code.</p>

<p>Did you try running the same test workbook on a windows machine?&nbsp; I think you need to do that to understand why there is such a tremendous difference in execution time between the two platforms.&nbsp; The difference in truly striking, and since both machines
 have the same Intel processors, and the code is the same for the workbooks, I can't understand why the execution of the code should be so different.</p>

 and the source files all had different Notes Masters.</p>

Now I'm trying to get everything fixed, and I figured Automator would be the way to do it. So I recorded the steps, but when I run the workflow, it always says "PowerPoint is not running." The workflow includes clicking on the PowerPoint icon in the dock.</p>

<p><span>Hi Vtsangv,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings. About this issue when joining a Skype for Business meeting without a Skype for Business account on your iPhone/iPad, it is recommended to install the Skype for Business APP from the APP store for iPhone and
 iPad.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Also, to isolate whether this issue is caused by the network connection, could you please switch to a different and better network connection of WiFi to see if there is any improvement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, to have a deeply understanding of this issue, I need to confirm following questions:</p>
<p>1. Whether the other&nbsp;meeting participants can hear you after you join the meeting?
</p>
<p>2. Or you cannot hear their voice and they also cannot hear yours?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Whatâ€™s the version of your iPhone and iPadâ€™s OS?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Vtsangv,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt update and provide the details. Given this situation, please also try using the option "call me at" and then check if you can successfully join the meeting and open the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if there is an&nbsp;dial in number in the meeting invite email and you have an audio conferencing, could you please try use the dial in number to join the meeting as a workaround?</p>

<p>Hi Vtsangv, &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/join-a-skype-for-business-meeting-from-your-mobile-device-without-a-skype-for-business-account-90e59db5-2801-4284-80a7-0e87ec479273?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong></span>,
 it is supported to join theSkype meeting as a guest in Skype for Business for iOS app. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to further troubleshoot this issue, may I confirm whether the other affected user also cannot use the "Call me at" option to join Skype meeting? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, based on my test, you need to enter your phone number and then wait a few minutes to join the meeting, could you please try using the cellular data to see if there is any difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still does't work correctly, please try calling into the Skype with the Skype meeting if there is a dial-in number, see:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/call-into-a-skype-for-business-meeting-on-your-mobile-or-other-phone-9fc51fc3-f201-49b1-b2d3-97fe6f9da238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Call

<br />
<br />By adding a second account my subfolders appeared, e.g. Gmail and Echange account. My subfolders within my Exchange account are now showing as in Inbox &gt; Exchange Account Name &gt; Subfolders.
<br />Can you try that.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.

<p>Adding screen shot showing what it looks like; as you can see there is no sub -folders under "on my computer", i've deleted or move all other emails within the inbox, drafts sent and trash, i copied this one item into junk to show you what it looks like.
 VERY strange; how do i access or remove this without having to rebuild my account.</p>

    <title>Assistance with downloading Skype recording - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernmerchant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assistance with downloading Skype recording</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm wondering if I can get some advice please about downloading a Skype recording. My issue isn't that I don't know how to do it, but just that it is not working (though it has in the past, and I not doing anything differently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recorded a Skype call today and the recording showed up in the chat as it should. When I choose the download option, nothing happens (apart from a message on the bottom saying "Downloading"). But it just does not initiate a download. I also tried from
 my iPhone and the same thing happened - no error message, but it did not move to my camera roll, i.e. no download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within this same chat thread, I downloaded a recording only 2 weeks ago with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried logging out of Skype entirely and logging back in. I've tried restarting my computer. Nothing works. I'm using a Mac with 10.14, and I have the latest version of Skype on both my Mac and iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for whatever reason, I just cannot get this download that I can see to actually download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recording video itself works - I can play it within Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas of anything else I can try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>Bern&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you Vijay. I just tried this, but on Web Skype I cannot see the recorded calls at all. In fact, it is showing as "Missed Call" when it wasn't a missed call at all.</p>

<p>I did some further testing and still no success:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now tried to download using my Mac, iMac and iPhone. On the iMac it was a fresh download and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also logged into Skype using another account and forwarded the video to that account. That account could also see the recorded video, but again could not download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Web Skype with both Safari and Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be a corrupt file or something like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. If anyone has any other ideas or suggestions, I'm all ears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This video was recorded for an online class, so if there is a way to access this video as a download, it would be very helpful.</p>
<p>

            It could either be a problem on<br />
your memory card<br />
or the phone's function.<br />
Try the hard reset as I always advise.<br />
If it still says that then I guess the problem lies in the memory card.

            format the memory card and clean the gold terminals on the card as well, use a rubber to clean.

    <title>email security alert and auto synch entries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> albatross1  say:</h3>
<h2>            email security alert and auto synch entries</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have received a web monitoring alert from Experian to inform me that my email address and password had been picked up as being sold online -&nbsp; Not good news . I changed my password and others as recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked recent activity on my account and found some unsuccessful auto synchs to countries notorious for cybercriminals - the earliest was Russia but also Albania, Brazil, Thailand and the latest India. Bad news but not as bad as them being successful.
 So it looks like people are trying to access my email so far unsuccessfully. I am using multi factor authentification which maybe what is keeping me secure - it may also be that they don't actually have my password - Experian just send a generic message about
 this and cannot identify actual password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ........... not sure what else I can do in terms of security - short of changing my email address or closing account ?. I have looked at other posts from people on this topic and it seems I am reasonably secure given the circumstances.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated !</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried the 'Virtual Help' but not much help and not sure how to contact an actual person at Microsoft support.</p>

            There really isn't much you can do besides using a password that is unique (not used with another sites) and is complex, plus 2-factor authentication.

<p>Thanks for the information Miguel. But this doesn't work.&nbsp; I have the same issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For starters. This number below is no longer valid:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Corporation in the USA is 1800 102 1100</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I called this number&nbsp;800 (642-7676).&nbsp; Which directs you to a whole lot of recordings. So, basically, I went through technical support and&nbsp;was able to speak to a person.&nbsp; This phone call was an hour long.&nbsp; And all I could do was repeat the same problems that
 I cannot get into my Hotmail account.&nbsp; We were just going in circles.&nbsp; All they can do is reiterate the steps all of us have already performed in trying to access our accounts.&nbsp; She did give me this number; 866 425 4826.&nbsp;&nbsp; With this number, you can call it
 and it gives you directly to a customer service representative.&nbsp; However. You'll get the same answer.&nbsp; They DO NOT have access to your Hotmail account nor the ability to unlock it.&nbsp; I was told that you would need to email
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they do not have a phone number for the handling of email issues.&nbsp; They only deal with Microsoft office.
</p>
<p>I asked him if he's gotten calls about this issue as well and he's said "quite a bit".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has anyone been able to get their old email back?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is there an actual person that we can speak with?&nbsp; </p>

                    My Father-In-Law has an old Word doc that he created around 1995 and he wants to open it.&nbsp; Current version of Word opens the 105 page document but it is all random letters, numbers and symbols.&nbsp; I can't identify from the Word symbol on the document what
 version of Word was used to create the document.&nbsp; It was created on a PC not Mac.&nbsp; What can I do to open the document for him and save it to a format he can import into his current version of Word.&nbsp; Thanks.

 and I found my move messages in the deleted items.<br />
<br />
Second:</p>
<p>It became another problem also that when I send any email the email shows in the deleted items and sent items so how it can be like that ?<br />

 that you have asked about it.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Account Type:&nbsp;<span>Microsoft Exchange.</span></p>
<p><span>It's Office 365 account.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi M,AL-Rashed,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your description, it seems that the issue occurred after you created a new folder and moved some messages to the new folder in the outlook client. To isolate if the issue is related to the custom folder you
 created, please move back the messages in the new created folder into its original folder and then delete the new created folder in the outlook client. After that, please restart the outlook client and check if the issue disappears.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, if the issue persists after you delete the new created folder in the outlook client.
<strong>Please temporarily close the outlook client</strong> and use your office 365 account to sign into the office 365
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Outlook Web App (OWA)</span></a>, first check if the new created folder is still in the OWA, if not, please try to send some emails again in the OWA and check if it can make any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the suggestions above donâ€™t work, Iâ€™d like to collect some more information for further investigation:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If other people in your organization have the same issue as you? I mean when they send some emails and if the emails are showing in both sent items and deleted items like you?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Please take a full screenshot about your inbox rules in the OWA. You can click Settings ( itâ€™s like a gear on the up-right corner of OWA) &gt; Mail &gt; Inbox and sweep rules, then take a full screenshot about the rules to me.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you reopen the outlook client now, do you still receive any prompting messages as before? If so, please provide the full details messages to me, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hi M,AL-Rashed,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the picture you provided, I did not find
<strong>the same emails</strong> that in the recoverable deleted items folder and already exist in the sent items folder. For the emails in the recoverable deleted items folder in your picture, Iâ€™d like to share with you that when you send out an email in the
 outlook, in general the email that you sent will appear in the sent items folder, then if you delete the email from the sent items folder, it will appear in the deleted items folder and disappear from the sent items folder. After that, if you delete the email
 from the deleted items folder, the same email will appear in the Recoverable Deleted Items Folder and disappear from the delete items folder. From your picture, you can try to click the hyperlink â€œ Recover items recently from this folderâ€ to find out the emails
 that were deleted from the deleted items folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this is not your current scenario, for example, when you send some emails in the outlook, the emails you sent are showing up in the sent items folder and deleted items folder
<strong>at the same time</strong> ( you did not manually delete them), please share some screenshots about
<strong>the same emails in both sent items folder and deleted items folder</strong> with me for comparison, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>Hello Oliver,<br />
<br />
I understood the scenario that you have been said and I knew it. As you have said when I send some emails in the outlook, the emails that I have sent are showing up in the sent items folder and the list of "Recover items that I have been deleted recently" at
 the same time and without deleting it.<br />
<br />
So if you can check the pictures below and notice that there is 3 emails that showing up in Recover lists and sent items without delete it manually or doing anything.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Powerpoint 2010 won&#39;t accept wmv. files</h2>
                    I am a seasoned Powerpoint 2003 user.&nbsp; I give a lot of lectures and routinely insert video clips into powerpoint&nbsp; slides.&nbsp; Here's the problem.&nbsp; I got a new laptop loaded with Windows 7 and Powerpoint 2010, and the new Powerpoint program will not allow
 the insertion of wmv. files.&nbsp; Strangely, it WILL allow the insertion of avi.&nbsp; files.&nbsp; The main reason I&nbsp;saved most of&nbsp; my video cllips as wmv. files was for just this kind of&nbsp;compatablility issue.&nbsp; I have worked around it by saving any new Powerpoint presentatons
 in Compatability mode (effectively turning it into a 2003 version), but that defeats the purpose of havng Powerpoint 2010 in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently this is a Microsoft generated problem, because both sides of the equation (wmv. and Powerpoint) are their
 products&nbsp;&nbsp; Any&nbsp;ideas ???

            <p>Thanks to Glenna for your advice, but no luck.</p>
<p>Even thought the&nbsp;computer is&nbsp;literally brand new, the diagnostic program you suggested did detect 4 "faults" with Windows Media Player, but that didn't&nbsp;correct my problem which is, I believe, within Powerpoint 2010 software.</p>

<p>When I try to insert the file (the Wildlife.wmv file), or any other wmv. file for that matter, the computer&nbsp;freezes.&nbsp; The nature of the freeze-up is that the little blue icon telling me something is happening (the one the goes round and round like a clock)
 does this infinitely until I force a restart.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>More facts pertaining to this problem.....I tried the same sort of thing on another computer (inserting wmv. files in powerpoint presentation) and it works. That computer is about 6 months old, but loaded with identical Windows software - Windows 7 and Powerpoint
 2010.&nbsp; Then when I transfer that powerpoint presentation into the new laptop, the wmv. videos won't run, even though they have been inserted into a ppt presentation.
</p>
<p>Apparently my problem is specifically related to the functionality of Powerpoint 2010 software in a new Lenovo Thinkpad.&nbsp; The mystery continues.</p>

            <p>pptusr here.......<strong>PROBLEM SOLVED !!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took a bit of work, and in the end I needed help - my friend Sam Li helped me get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>First, we did all of the suggestions on this thread (plus a few more), and Nothing Worked.&nbsp; However, looking back on what
<u>John SR Wilson</u> suggested, he had actually&nbsp;put his finger right on the problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, on my first run through,&nbsp;removing Lenovo software did not fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To figure it out, we decided to wipe the computer clean and start over.&nbsp; It turned out there were<strong> 2 impediments</strong> to the insertion of wmv videos into Powerpoint 2010 - both software ad-ons, and they BOTH needed to be removed before video could
 be inserted:</p>
<p><strong>- the first was&nbsp;one item in the Lenovo specfic software.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- the second was a third party media player (by Nero) which had also been installed by Lenovo.</strong></p>
<p>We have simply eliminated all the Lenovo software plus the&nbsp;medial player.&nbsp; Powerpoint 2010 now works seemlessly.</p>
<p>This obviously explains why Powerpoint 2010 in most Windows 7 machines works normally, while in others it does not - it's the&nbsp;extra software which is getting in the way.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone's help on this thread.&nbsp;Hopefully anyone else in the world who encounters this same issue with a brand new computer will see this and be able to solve their problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Assuming that you only want to copy the values, leaving possible formulas behind.<br />
<br />
Try this macro:<br />
<br />
Sub copy_rows_to_sheets()<br />
&nbsp; Dim firstrow, lastrow, r, torow As Integer<br />
&nbsp; Dim fromsheet, tosheet As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp; firstrow = 1<br />
&nbsp; Set fromsheet = ActiveSheet<br />
&nbsp; lastrow = ActiveSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, "P").End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp; For r = firstrow To lastrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If fromsheet.Cells(r, "P") &lt;&gt; "" Then&nbsp; 'skip rows where column P is empty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo make_new_sheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set tosheet = Worksheets("" &amp; fromsheet.Cells(r, "P"))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoTo copy_row<br />
make_new_sheet:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set tosheet = Worksheets.Add(After:=Worksheets(Worksheets.Count))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tosheet.Name = fromsheet.Cells(r, "P")<br />
copy_row:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; torow = tosheet.Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell).Row + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fromsheet.Cells(r, 1).EntireRow.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tosheet.Cells(torow, 1).PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Next r<br />
&nbsp; Application.CutCopyMode = False<br />
&nbsp; fromsheet.Activate<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Hope this helps / Lars-Ã…ke<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Two methods. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong> uses Copy and PasteSpecial. If you use this method you will see that the last pastespecial in the loop leaves the&nbsp;destination range selected. (You cannot Copy and PasteSpecial in one line like my previous post for simple Copy and
 Paste.)</p>
<p><strong>Example2</strong> does not leave the destination range selected and only one line of code. (Does not actualy use Copy and Paste but makes the&nbsp;destination range equal the values of the source range
<strong>but they are not links</strong>. Unlike Copy and Paste where the destination can be a single cell, the destination range must be the same size as the source range for this code to work.)</p>
<p>Replace the loop section of the code in my previous post&nbsp;with the example of your choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each rngCel In rngSource<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If rngCel.Value = "Design" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wsDestin<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngDestinRow = .Cells(.Rows.Count, "P").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rngCel.EntireRow.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Cells(lngDestinRow, "A").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next rngCel<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each rngCel In rngSource<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If rngCel.Value = "Design" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wsDestin<br />

<p><br />
In my test I am not having the problem so don't know what is causing this. Anyway try the code bleow.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation of code:</strong> It is not possible to test for an error and test for another condition in the one If statement line like the following.&nbsp;The code will error when attemping to perform the second part of the test just the same as if a
 test for zero is coded on its own and the cell contains an error.</p>
<p>If IsError(rngCel.Value) Or rngCel.Value = 0 Then</p>
<p>Therefore I have coded to set a boolean variable to True if an error and if not an error then test for zero and if sero set the boolean variable to True. The boolean variable is then used to determine if the remaining code is to be processed.</p>
<p>I hope I understand you question correctly in that if either error or zero then do not copy.</p>

            Thanks, I saw this as well and the information does not address this issue or give a way to have a Rep from Microsoft look into this. We are passing all the requirements.&nbsp;

<h3> stacy_722  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot print envelopes from manual feed tray on Epson WF-4630 from Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have the envelopes properly loaded in&nbsp;the rear feeder tray according to Epson instruction and am using a simple Microsoft envelope template. No mail merge is being used.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I select in the options for the feed tray,&nbsp;the printer only pulls from the main tray.&nbsp; My only options are Default Tray (automatically select) or Automatically Select.&nbsp; This worked with Word 2013 but I have lost all capability with Word 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are up-to-date.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If yes, then the printer driver may still need another update to work properly with Word 2016 and you would need to take up the issue with Epson as they are the supplier of the driver.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the issue has become worse ever since the Microsoft technicians have handled it. They have now erased all of my content on my Onenote on my laptop erasing 2.5 years of my life and the issue of the iPhone hasn't even been resolved as I was on
 the phone for 1.5 hours and the technician escalated to level 2 technicians without trying to resolve the iPhone issue. I've been receiving emails stating they have tried to call me claiming my phone has been engaged however I know for a fact that isn't the
 case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very upset about my content being lost and they way Microsoft have handled this.</p>

<h2>            Extracting data from MS Project 2010 while in MS Access 2010.</h2>
                    I have an MS Access database within which I run a routine to extract data from MS Project and populate a table in the Access database.&nbsp; This worked great when I was running MS Project 2003.&nbsp; Now my company has upgraded to MS Project 2010 and I get a message
 that the provider can't be found.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; What can I do about it?&nbsp; If the answer is to use late binding, where can I find some very simple and very clear instructions for creating the code for late binding?&nbsp; I have seen examples for setting up the late
 binding, but nothing that tells me how to proceed from there.

    <title>Lumia 1320 RM 994 - not able to connect to LTE network of vodafone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardfreddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1320 RM 994 - not able to connect to LTE network of vodafone</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Pls help me. I bought a Lumia 1320&nbsp;RM 994 from Altex Romania. &nbsp;Date: November 2014. I think is an authorized dealer of lumia phones. In april 2015, I changed my sim, and I received a 4g compatible from Vodafone. Nobody from them wasn't able to connect my
 lumia to lte network. A couple a days ago, I changed again my sim, still nothing. The Vodafone people, after looking in my lumia menus, told me, that they think that my device is not 4g capable. In highest connection speed, it only shows 2g or 3g. To prove
 me that their sim is 4g capable, a guy from Vodafone insert my sim in another phone, and in that device, the sim connected to lte network.</p>
<p>Please tell me &nbsp;what is wrong to my device. I bought the phablet, at a price of aprox 250 euro, the 4g connectivity being one of the reasons. The data conection work fine on 3g, I don t think that the antenna is broken. Maybe if the lte conection uses another
 antenna, in lumia 1320, that one might be broke, I am no specialist. The shop kept sending me to Vodafone, teeling me that the device is fine.</p>
<p>Could be a driver problem? Also: in my Microsoft account, I can t delete my old 520 lumia from it, and can not add lumia 1320!</p>
<p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the answers. I understand that is not my concern as a end user to flash another rom. I guess that the service should be able to do that, or if they can t, simply Altex Romania, should&nbsp;refund my money or give me another lumia 1320 or other phablet,
 capable of 4g. I will print the answers received here, if the service don t know what to do, or if they fail to update rom or other software, I will make an official complaint to the Consumer protection office. I hoped that the solution will be more easy,
 like a missing driver, etc.

            As a remark: I know that lumia 1320 was made by Nokia, not Microsoft. Still, I think that Microsoft should do something about this kind of situations. A recall in service, to update the rom would be an idea, not to speak of some kind of refund or discount
 for purchasing another phone, because I paid 250 euro, a year ago,&nbsp;for a phone that was n t capable of actually having a 4g connection.

            <p>You have the latest available OS version and firmware running on your handset, which is a European regional version version intended for sale in Austria and Switzerland. I find it hard to believe that a phone intended for these markets will not have 4G enabled
 in the latest firmware. Perhaps it would be worth performing a clean software reinstall using the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Phone Recovery Tool</a> just to make sure everything is in order. You can ask Altex to do it for you, but you need to back up your data before that.<br />

            <p>I am not a specialist in phones. I know a think or two about pc. </p>
<p>If the problem is indeed the rom, or bios of the phone motherboard, how would help me reinstalling the OS? I would go to the service, hoping that they can help me. I can make pictures of the menu, it is easy to see that the only connections possible are
 2g or 3g. </p>

</p><p>Do what @93tid advised you. I doubt that it will give you the 4G, but you can always try.<br />

I think that the problem is the ROM. If is the case, and for respect the code of conduct, send it in a customer service "certified" by Microsoft, or wait an firmware update that will give you the 4G.</p>

<p>or maybe the 4G frequency used by the provider is not supported by his phone variant.

This problem is from the ROM. I have seen many cases like this. </p>

    <title>Footer height issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diannecp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Footer height issue</h2>
                    <p>I don't know what happened to my beautifully formatted document! I deleted the i, ii, iii page nos. from the front matter. Suddenly, some of the page no are at different heights, namely page 4 and page 6, in Section 4. The "footer from bottom" is 0.3" on
 all 3 pages. The page no. looks to be a different distance from the footer marker. Beginning with Section 5, all seems well. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Going to single page view and merely pulling the footer down seemed to mess up subsequent
 pages. I"m thinking i could possibly delete and recreate Section 1-4 ?</p>
