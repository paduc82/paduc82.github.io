<h2>            Cannot add second email address to contact</h2>
                    <p>I have a contact with one email address. I want to add a second email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened the contact, select email-2 and type in the email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tab out of the field, the e-mail address vanishes. When I save the contact and go back in, only the first email address is displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know why this is happening?</p>

            <p>The normal action that should occur when adding an email address - be it the first, 2nd or 3rd is that the corresponding email display name gets populated which based on your description sounds like it's not the case.</p>
<p>What kind of email account does this involve (POP, Mapi (Hotmail/Outlook.com...), Imap etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an effort to isolate potential causes without knowing the email account type
</p>
<p>- if you start Outlook in safe mode - does the issue still occur?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to start Outlook in safe mode<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem does not appear in safe mode - then the issue is more than likely related to an installed 3rd party addin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If the issue remains after running in "safe mode" - would suggest doing a repair of your Office installation which for O'2010 would be done by re-running the Office setup either via the control panel or re-running the setup from the DVD --&gt; Add/Remove
 --&gt; Change --&gt; Repair</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If that doesn't resolve the problem and this is for a POP email&nbsp;account - suggest running ScanPST on the PST file in which&nbsp;the contact folder is contained. In most cases, this would be the default contact folder contained in the default PST file in the
 profile).</p>

            <p>The type of account should not matter - I actually have two different types of email accounts in my Outlook 2010 - 2 POP3 Veriazon.net accounts, and an MSN.com Hotmail account (with Outlook Connector installed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I am talking about adding a second email address to a contact, not adding a second email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did try and start Outlook in safe mode. Same problem occurred.</p>
<p>I proceeded to run SCANPST.exe. It found and fixed 79 "errors".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started Outlook and tried again I did something a little different. Previously, I had selected E-mail 2, typed the new e-mail address, hit tab (this only advanced the cursor 1 space - I would have thought it would move to the next filed - "Display As").
 Press the tab key a second time did advance the cursor to the next field, but my entry for the email -2 disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time, I typed the email-2 address and immediately clicked on Save and Exit. For whatever reason, this worked! The email-2 address was saved.</p>
<p>This appears to be a bug - whether it was always present in my installation, and is present in any other installations of the same version of the program, I cannot say.</p>
<p>Strange, to say the least...</p>

            <p>So this behavior occurs when adding contacts too either your POP or Mapi (Hotmail) account? (reason for asking about the type of email accounts - did not misunderstand the question/issue)</p>
<p>As for this being a generic issue - have O'2010 on various systems and can't replicate the behaviour and have don't recall ever seeing the same issue before.</p>
<p>One thing that would be worth investigating is if their is something on your system intercepting keystrokes.</p>

I&nbsp;am experiencing this problem as well.&nbsp; I tried tabbing and the second email disappeared.&nbsp; I tried saving immediately and it still disappeared.&nbsp; SO frustrated!&nbsp; I too have searched the Internet&nbsp;for a fix, but have thus far come up empty-handed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This issue seems to have surfaced&nbsp;only recently on this particular PC where&nbsp;the only changes have been MS Updates along with updates to the anti-virus software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone have a real fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp; User error!&nbsp; I was trying to enter a 2nd&nbsp;email address in Contacts that was already&nbsp;in use by&nbsp;another person in my Address Book.&nbsp; In weeding through my Address Book, I found several instances of this "duplicate address" issue and once cleaned up,
 I can now enter a 2nd (and 3rd) address for any of my contacts!&nbsp; <strong>Problem FIXED</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div>The update number is same for each definition update. As described in the FAQ, MSE checks for updates once per day and you may see optional updates listed in Windows Update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The error you see is a bit useless as it means that Windows Update encountered an unknown error when trying to install an update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The important thing is that MSE is updating. Open MSE and click on the Update tab and button. What happens and what version and date is shown as the latest installed update?</div>

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Word has stopped working&#34; error message</h2>
                    I am using Microsoft Office 2010. Lately it has been randomly shutting itself down while I'm in the middle of working on a document. The following error message flashes on the screen "Microsoft Word has stopped working" then the program shuts down. I lose
 all my work. It does not save a recovery file. This happens about twice a month. At other times, it does save a recovery file. This particular issue appears to be random (and rather sinister I might add). Suggestions on how to fix this?&nbsp; Kathie

<p>
</p><p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to Skype a contractor who's got Skype and I have Skype for Business. Apparently the contractor needs to accept me friend request, at least that's what my SFB says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been such a painful experience so far, and for reasons I've still yet to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's a matter of versions on the contractor's part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Skype</li><li>Skype for desktop</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We've followed this guide:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12005/how-do-i-accept-a-contact-request</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn't apply. We're both running the latest versions of Skype.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello georgeprince1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. I would be more than glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're getting an error message when calling in Skype regarding the playback device, it means that Skype cannot detect your speaker or headset properly. To isolate the issue, please refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Run the troubleshooter first. Select the <strong>Start</strong> <span>button, type
</span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong><span>, and then select </span><strong>Troubleshoot&nbsp;</strong><span>from the list of results. Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Playing Audio</strong><span> &gt;
</span><strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong><span>.</span></li><li>Update your sound cards. Open <strong>Start</strong> , enter <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results. Under
<strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>, select your sound card, open it, select the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab, and select <strong>Update Driver</strong>. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</li></ul>
<li><span>
<p><strong>If that didn't work, try this:</strong></p>
</span>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Uninstall your audio driver:&nbsp;open <strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or press and hold)&nbsp;the audio driver, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li><span>
<p><strong>If the issue still persist, try using the generic audio driver that comes with Windows. Here's how:</strong></p>
</span>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or press and hold) your audio driver &gt;<strong> Update driver software...
</strong>&gt;<strong> Browse my computer for driver software </strong>&gt;<strong> Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong>, select
<strong>High Definition Audio Device</strong>, select <strong>Next</strong>, and follow the&nbsp;instructions to install it.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Re-launch Skype then&nbsp;make a voice call and let me know if you're still encountering the same issue.</p>
</li>

<h2>            Sharepoint Online Search</h2>
                    I have moved the files from our file server over to SharePoint online. I have mapped the location to my workstations. When the files are done indexing on the site, will the index be shared with the mapping so that I can search in the windows explorer view?
 With the previous setup our server indexed the files and provided the information to the windows search. I was hoping to replicate this with SharePoint online for the easiest transition of the users. Also is there a way to change the file extension list that
 the index uses. We have .edi files that are just text that I need to have the contents indexed for search.

            <p>Hi AQCTH,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1</p>
<p>It is not feasible to search it in the Windows Explorer view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2: </p>
<p>It is not feasible to do that, either. The feature to add the non-default crawled file name extensions from search index is only available in SharePoint server not in SharePoint Online. You can check the following articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-SG/library/jj219530.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Default crawled file name extensions and parsed file types in SharePoint Server 2013</span></a><span> (it also applies to SharePoint Online)</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>For the feature you mentioned above, I would suggest you share the same with our related team through
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/330321-sharepoint-search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">user voice</a>. Your providing feedback will make our products better for you and others.</p>

            It is a made up form of Old&nbsp; Latin or Greek Usually starts out with Lorum Ipsom (epsom) or something similar. All and I mean All word Processing Program that use templates the The Greek/Latin Text is used as place holder information.
<br />
<br />
Look up Lorum Ipsom (Epsom?) on Wikipedia and there is a Nice explanation of&nbsp; it. Some parts of it does actually use some old Greek terms but in no particular order.

<p>
</p><p>FYI. </p>
<p>I found the solution to my problem!&nbsp; I changed my log in method for my laptop from the&nbsp;pre-Windows 10&nbsp;local log that I have been&nbsp;using&nbsp;on Windows 10 for the last several months, to my Microsoft username, which is my msn email address its&nbsp;associated password.&nbsp;
 Having made this change, I opened&nbsp;IE 11 (my default browser), typed msn.com in the address bar and clicked on sign in link and it automatically signed on and displayed my name!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I google it online and find the following article in which contains one option related to Access to ACT.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is another article about how to transfer your access data to ACT.</span></p>

            All you can transfer is the data. And ACT can export to a variety of format (at least the versions I've used). Many are ones that Access can import.

            As Scott stated: "All you can transfer is the data", so the form, queries, reports and all the automation would need to be recreated if switching to Access. But you should have no problem whatsoever to export the data from Act and the import it into MS
 Access Tables to be able to work with.&nbsp; No need for any special converter...

            Thank you for all the replies and assistance it's certainly appreciated. Correct me if I'm wrong when you say "data" it doesnt include the notes or history? Also I actually have been looking at converters just to make it as simple, time saving and pain
 free as possible. Is this a waste of money? I've heard most don't convert all the info. Can anyone recommend a good converter that transfers all the info including notes? Thank you so much again for the help!

<p>
</p><p>I regularly get this message when I attempt to save certain Power Point presentations. &nbsp;<strong>Problem is, I have no other users in my system.</strong></p>
<p>The only way to solve the problem, is (as the dialog box says) to save another version. &nbsp;That works fine, until I make changes and try to save them, when the effort appears again.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Previous versions of the file may be found on a Google Drive. My desktop (where most of my presentations sit) is backed up in iCloud. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running MacOS Mojave&nbsp;10.14.2 on a beefed up MacMini. &nbsp; I use Office 365, but there may be a normal, stand-alone version of Office 2016 Power Point still installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Marty,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, it seems that you installed multiple versions of the Office 2016 for Mac applications on your Mac. If yes, as multiple versions of the Office 2016 for Mac applications may cause some issues, first I suggest you uninstall all
 the Office 2016 for Mac applications via the steps in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-for-mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the article</a>, only re-install the Office 2016 for Mac applications from the Office 365 subscription, restart the Mac and then re-activate them to see the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

    <title>Outlook.com landing page not going directly to Inbox immediately after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bliksem1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com landing page not going directly to Inbox immediately after signing in ... the cause of much irritation &#33;</h2>
                    <p>The sub-category I'd want to select is simply "Connecting to Outlook.com via web-browser", but as not available, opted for "with apps and devices" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I'm experiencing is that, whenever I sign-in to my Outlook.com account, the next page I'm taken to is anything OTHER THAN my Inbox - it's usually to Update my details, but today was taken to "Create An Account" page, as soon as signing-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no easy way to get to the Inbox thereafter, as no drop-down menu at that stage for Outlook.com, Drive etc. like you find on the pages, when within the Email prog. itself.<br />
<br />
I have to go 'through-hoops' to get to the Inbox, sometimes going to Windows.com main page, and selecting sub-headings until one of them finally gives an option to go to the Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This must be a software glitch on YOUR side, as I've tried both IE and Chrome, and have the same problem on both - I've searched for the problem in Google, and within the MS Outlook.com forums.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's only 1 post from January 2014 in which someone was experiencing the same thing. ;
</p>
<p>however,&nbsp;I'm not convinced anything I add to that will even be taken notice of, as the original post hasn't had any feedback in 2 months, from anyone.
<strong><em>(although I did add to it before starting this new thread).</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Would someone at MS Support be able to shed some light on this ? - </p>
<p>whether you know of the existence of this Outlook.com fault ?</p>
<p>... and what you / your Tech Dept. can do to have it resolved ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm surprised not more people are experiencing this, as it's the kind of thing that should affect many, or none at all.</p>

<p>Hello <em><strong>pieterbeukes</strong></em>, &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
To better manage this thread related to your query, I'd like to verify if its already been answered. If not, I'd like to inform you that you'll be needing to rip the music from the CD-R. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Make sure your PC is connected to the <strong><em>Internet</em></strong> if you want Windows Media Player to automatically get info about the songs, such as the name of the CD, the artist, and titles for the tracks being ripped.</li><li>Open <em><strong>Windows Media Player</strong></em>.</li><li>Insert an audio <strong><em>CD</em></strong> into the <em><strong>PC's CD drive</strong></em>.</li><li>Select the <em><strong>Rip CD</strong></em> button.</li><li>Select a different format or bit rate, select the <em><strong>Rip settings</strong></em> menu, and then choose
<em><strong>Format</strong></em> or <em><strong>Audio Quality</strong></em> in the Player Library.</li><li>If you don't want to rip every song, clear the check boxes next to the songs you don't want.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.
</em></p>

<h3> madzinho8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onenote formatting error</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have problem with the formatting in onenote. When I write the surface pen with let's say pen thickness 0,5 , everything is just fine. But when i try to copy some notes and paste them somewhere else in the page, the pen thickness changes to 1,5 for
 the copied text. I can pan/zoom the pasted, then it suddenly changes back. The same thing happens when I try to draw a line, cirkle or any other shapes with the shape-drawing function. The formatting changes to bolder lines. Pan/zoom of the shapes size and
 its back to 0,5 thickness. Im on a surface pro 4, windows 10 pro (updated), office 365, onenote 2016. Can someone help?</p>

<h2>            Grey bar print Preview mac &#40;NO markup&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have a strange problem with word 2016 (latest update), mac version, latest sierra os.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In every document a grey bar on the right side of the print preview appears. The document also seems to be in the wrong format, because it changes the size of the document. It cuts on the right side and at bottom if i print the document and if a create a
 PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstalled Office, deleted libary-files, reinstalled office</p>
<p>- Changed markups</p>
<p>- Deleted printer, changed printer</p>
<p>- used other PDF-program</p>
<p>- Test with new user in mac&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How it looks:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://picload.org/image/rdpciada/rand.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't fix this problem. What can i do? My last chance seems to be reinstall the complete OS - that would be horrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>What is a Gutter? A Gutter is an addition margin added&nbsp;either on left or right side (alternating if you print two-sided&nbsp;printing. This allows the Document to use type binding to, make a&nbsp;book, or report and still equal sided text margins. &nbsp;Example have &nbsp;reports

            <p>Word does not generate the Quick Preview in the Print dialog. That's handled by the OS X print subsystem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that everything is fully updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your flavor of OS X</li><li>Office 2016 [15.27 or later]</li><li>Printer driver/firmware: Check the mfr's web site for the most current information.</li></ul>
<p>*I realize you wrote "latest" for the first 2 items, but without the nomenclature I can't be certain :-) The last item is equally - if not more - important than the others, especially with the more recent rapid fire releases of the operating system. What
 ships with the OS often is flawed.</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this problem is crazy. I uninstalled my whole system (Sierra, formatted everything). After that I made clean reinstall. No backup. Nothing. Clean system. I installed Word. I created a new document. No more freaking edge on the right side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few hours later I opened a old document to write in it. I pressed cmd p and look who's back: the freaking edge. And of course for alle documents again. Even complete new documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats going on here?! It's no even a printer installed.</p>

            Same weird issue tormenting my OCD. My MacBook is fine, it happens on my wife's. It is only in Word 2016. Any other print preview is fine. I checked Excel, PowerPoint and Text Edit. I doubt this is a system glitch since only appears in Word 2016.

            <p>I'm not disputing your experience, but I can confirm that I never have seen this occur in any update level of any version of Word for Mac. If you are "now" seeing it in Word 2011 (which indicates that you were
<em>not</em> seeing it previously) it's all the more reason to suspect something other than Word... As you, yourself, have written, there have been no substantial modifications to that release of Office [v14.x.x] for quite some time due to it approaching the
 end of its life cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one common denominator shared by those seeing this aberration is that they all are running some release of OS X 10.12 [Sierra], whereas I am running OS X 10.10.5 [Yosemite]. I also continue to run Office 2011 [v14.7.1] on OS X 10.6.8 on a different Mac
 &amp; have never seen the aberration there, either.</p>
