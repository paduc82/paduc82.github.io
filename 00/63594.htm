<p>My computer was working fine just the day before. &nbsp;I turned it on today and found that no files, folders, text, titles, etc are showing up...I have no idea how to fix it because I can't read anything. &nbsp;It also does this to windows such as browsers, pictures,
 steam, and even other non-Microsoft programs. &nbsp;Please help so I can get this fixed ASAP!</p>

<p>&nbsp;Advice to you depends on a few things.</p>
<p>1) Do you have data on the system you don't want to lose?</p>
<p>2) Do you have backup for any data you don't want to lose?</p>
<p>3) Have you enabled System Restore?</p>
<p>4) Have you looked in the Onedrive folder?</p>
<p>5) If the answers to 1 and 2 above are yes and no respectively, are you familiar with Linux?</p>

                    If I press alt-shift-x, where x is some alphabetic key, Windows 8 treats this as alt-x instead. Does anybody know why this might be happening ? I know that the shift key is working since in Windows 7 it works properly.<br />

                    <p>I had blue screens on my windows 10 machine by and then. After some time I read somewhere that I should disable "let windows manage your swap file" and this solved the problem. This is a pretty fresh installed machine without any third party software.</p>
<p>This weekend I discovered that some device security setting was disabled (device security - core isolation) and I wondered why, as I remember having enabled all those checkmarks and more. So I enabled this again and later tried to watch a video on amazon
 prime. Which caused a repeated crash. Then I tried the same in safe mode -- but was told that my webbrowser is not compatible (edge) and that I should use edge. I figure that amazon is loading

<span>some </span>amateurish implemented device driver -- or some device driver which is knowingly violating Microsoft rules for kernel programming. Searching the web for this I only found a movie at amazon prime for $1.99 to rent which was supposed to help
 repairing this issue (I did not fall victim to this scam). I also found various discussions here, but as usual without any tangible resolution. I'm curious about this. As far as I know Microsoft gets plenty of crash reports and should be able to pinpoint such
 things very easily. I'm now going to enable driver verifier. But again: Why do I need to do this, as Microsoft gets plenty of crash reports automatically?</p>

<h3> &#91; fast sh0tz &#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install games</h2>
                    I have had this happen with multiple games and DLCs now, and quite honestly it's making me super mad. I buy games or DLCs and there is always a chance it won't install. I have tried everything, nothing seems to work to fix this issue. I do not know if
 it has something to do with my external storage. I have bought multiple games for $60, and not to mention the games can uninstall randomly when I already have them installed. I hope getting an Xbox One S would solve this, but I need to know first. Also, if
 it isn't obvious enough, I can't reinstall them. I am stuck with having games uninstall whenever they want and then I'm screwed. I could be playing a game I have been working on a project on for a while, when the next day I get on my Xbox just to see it in
 the "ready to install" section. Then, I know, that thing I have been working on is long gone.

<p>Hello there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! I understand that this situation can be frustrating but I will be happy to assist you with the issue. Just to clarify, does this only happen to games installed on your External Hard drive or does this happen to games
 installed on your internal hard drive?&nbsp; If you have yet to try installing games on your Internal I would recommend trying to install the games on the Internal Hard drive to make sure that it's not your External having the issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I would also suggest checking your <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/check-xbox-live-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Purchase history</a> to make sure that you have indeed purchased the games. If the games were purchased on the account you're using, then I would test your
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Connection</a>. Additionally, I would check out this support article for <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/store/download-game-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you still have further questions or concerns please feel free to reply back. Thank you again for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

            FSX Acceleration has a separate activation code and needs to be activated also. I purchased the FSX Gold edition and it came with the acceleration disc that had its own activation code, the&nbsp;acceleration pack is an option that needs activating also. Be
 sure that, if you are using it for private pilot lessons, to also install the scenario builder, if not it is not necessary.

<h2>            Refunds &#61; bannable&#63;</h2>
                    I was banned in 2016 for having to many refunds done on my account but there are plenty of people I know and heard of who had more refunds than I did. I submitted a case review and everything but nothing ever happened. I was console banned and my account
 was permanently banned. Is there anyway to get in contact with the enforcement team about this or anyone that can help?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Ayy&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>submit a case to the enforcement team via your Microsoft profile and ask them what the offense was and that may provide some insight into why the account was banned, they may even be willing to unban pending circumstances but as for the refund side of the
 enquiry was it maybe not that you had less than others but the Frequency of the refunds? (buy a game on the 1st play it finished get refund on 3rd, then get new game? as an exaggerated example ofcourse)</p>

<p>Be aware that we in this forum here are "only" gamers like you, so we can't look into your account to see what exactly caused the ban. So the following is purely speculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's not only the amount of refunds that play into that statistic. They also check on how many consoles you (re-)download something, how many license transfers and Home Console changes were done, and after what time these refunds were made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the pattern of your refund use matches too much for a "typical" marketplace-theft, where someone purchases a game, downloads it on a "Home Console", which is then disconnected from the web and sold along with the games, which are then refunded later,
 so the new buyer can play these "refunded" games offline, then that account will be banned for marketplace-theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for example if someone refunds 5 games during a 5 year period, using only one console, everything is fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you refund 4 games during a 2 day period, using 4 different console devices, there might be something fishy going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's not the amount of refunds alone that are a factor in the decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: Why are you asking for a two year old suspension? Unfortunately, you can only case review suspensions that happened in the past year.</p>

<h2>            KB3005628 keeps re-appearing in Windows Update</h2>
                    On a Windows 8.1 Pro machine and a Windows Server 2012 machine, Windows Update keeps offering (and installing successfully) the update for KB3005628. But if I check for updates, it appears as available again, and installs again. The Update History shows
 multiple successful installs for the update, so it's almost as if it's not detecting that it's no longer applicable. Is anyone else seeing this problem?<br />

            <p>My suggestion to anyone having issues with this update seemingly installing successfully (multiple times) and then still being offered as an "available update"&nbsp;the next time you check for updates, ..would be&nbsp;to simply wait for&nbsp;a (long?)&nbsp;while, and&nbsp;try checking
 for updates some time later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some time, this update stopped being listed as an "available&nbsp; update" for my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It had been installed successfully four times. I just waited a long time and eventually the update was no longer listed as being available.&nbsp; (I posted about this on another thread too.)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I bought FIFA 17 for XBOX 360 from the online store. After downloading it (through the FIFA 17 DEMO game), when I open it i got the following error message: "This disc region code is incorrect for this console". I have a european console. BTW, I can run
 the FIFA 17 demo game, but not the full game. I tried to play with the console locale settings and to download the game again, but it didn't work as well.</p>

<h2>            Part numbers &#47; models. Same spec &#61; different prices.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im considering to buy surface pro 4.</p>
<p>When i was searching internet shops to buy one, i found two same spec devices but with different prices (about 100-150£ difference). I wonder why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only one difference is a part number code, but i couldnt find explanation why this part number code change the final price of the device. Specs and whole units are the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>I7 8gb ram 256gb ssd - CQ9-00002 vs su9-00002&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I7 16gb ram 256gb ssd - th5-00002 vs th2-00002&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted microsoft to ask what makes these surfaces different in the final price, and they've said, its because there is a keyboard included into the more expensive one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked shops, spoke to sellers and unfortunately thats not truth.... And nothing is included, but also they couldnt give me the answer either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone knows why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards LJ</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell, the Microsoft engineers are the one's "with the know" and the rest pick up information the same as all of us - guessing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did right to get on the forum to ask before spending a lot of money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the information regarding the "Surface" line of devices and what offers they have are on the Microsoft Store web site.&nbsp; If you do not see a bundle offer, you only get the tablet, pen, and power supply, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you see an offer for something, check the main web site to see if an offer is available.&nbsp; Right now, there is a bundle on the Pro 4 that the "Answer Tech" may have confused it with.&nbsp; You are looking for the tablet itself.&nbsp; Go to www.msn.com on your
 browser and there, click on the "Store" menu item on the web page.&nbsp; It should display the web store for your country and will display the current offers.</p>

<h2>            Possible Solution for Windows 10 Mail Live Tile Not Functioning&#47;Updating Properly</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I want to make it clear that this solution does not fix any possible errors within the application itself.&nbsp; Obviously, if you're receiving error messages or think there might be problems with the app itself, you should use traditional troubleshooting
 (i.e.; System File Checker, ScanDisk) to find and correct those problems.&nbsp; This is more&nbsp;of an observation that I made whilst working in both Windows 10 Mail and Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that upon switching my default app for email&nbsp;in Windows Settings from Mail to Outlook 2016, I no longer received any pop-up notifications for new mail and also the live tile for mail in Windows Start Menu would not show any new mail.&nbsp; I, of course,
 checked the appropriate settings within the Mail app, live tile and Windows settings to make sure I didn't set anything wrong.&nbsp; All was good there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there was an immediate change in my notifications when making the switch in my default apps, I decided to test my theory and switch the default email app
<strong>BACK </strong>to the original default app, Windows 10 Mail app.&nbsp; Upon making this switch, all notifications starting working again.&nbsp; I tested this by using my Gmail account to send an email to my Outlook.com account and waiting for the notification.&nbsp;
 As soon as the email hit my&nbsp;inbox, my PC showed me the pop-up notification, I heard the "Ding!" from my speakers and clicking the Start button showed one new email on my Mail live tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that all of this happened without having to have the Mail app open.&nbsp; I noticed that when I had Outlook 2016 set as my default, and had the program open, I would receive the pop-up notification and the "Ding!" but no live tile update.&nbsp; Also of
 note, when I pinned Outlook 2016 to start, thus creating a tile, it was not possible in the traditional way (meaning:&nbsp; right click on the tile and seeing the option, "Turn live tile on/off") to have this Outlook 2016 tile show me updates for new mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum this up (if you read this far, thank you for your patience), if you have both mail and Outlook installed on your Windows 10 machine, you can leave the Mail app as the default for email in order to receive the notifications if you so desire.&nbsp; Up to
 this point, Outlook 2016 works just fine for me with these settings without the need to make it the default app.&nbsp; Also, when opening Outlook, it doesn't ask me about making it the default app.&nbsp; The only minor inconvenience (if you can call it that) is that
 anything mail or calendar related will use the mail app instead of Outlook as the default.&nbsp; You will still have to manually&nbsp;open&nbsp;Outlook to perform these tasks as it&nbsp;will not be the default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions or need clarification on something I wrote, please feel free to respond to this post.&nbsp; I hope this will help some of the people who might be experiencing this situation.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 won&#39;t load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kewl munky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t load</h2>
                    The other day I did a hard shutdown because windows 7 was taking forever and just sat at the shutting down screen for a while. Well the day after when I tried to load back into windows it wouldn't. All it would do is go to a blank screen when it should
 have brought up my prompt menu to choose between win7 and vista, let me choose one and then go to a blank screen, and sometimes after choosing windows 7 it would go to the starting windows screen and just sit there. I let it sit there for over an hour once
 and nothing happened. I tried repair mode but it sat at the starting windows screen, tried safe mode but it would sit at the screen showing the files it was loading, and I even tried to reinstall but after it loaded the files it would just sit at the starting
 windows screen as well.<br />
<br />
I finally decided I'd try and see if I could install Linux and I successfully installed Ubuntu but after I had Ubuntu installed I tried to see if I could get windows 7 installed at it did the same thing as before. I also tried Vista but after the screen where
 it says microsoft corporation and has a loading bar it would go to a blank screen.<br />
<br />
I also have two hard drives so if something went wrong it had to have happened to both. Does anyone have any idea of what the ____ is going on?

            I figured it out yesterday. I booted up an Ubuntu live CD and a friend ran me through some disk checking tools and we figured out one of my hard drives died. So I just unplugged it and away I went.

<h2>            PC clock keeps going to GMT &#40;even though I keep setting it to GMT-7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>For a couple of weeks now I am noticing that the PC clock (Win 10) keeps "resetting" to the GMT / UTC timezone each time I reboot, and also overnight (even if the PC has been left on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran various virus software: No issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no other associates issues I am aware of (Bios for example) the PC is performing just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm in chrome my Calendars time stays correct even though the PC clock has "reset" to GMT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Right click your clock and select Adjust date\time.
<br />Make sure Set time automatically and Set time zone automatically is turned off.
<br />And turn off the adjust for daylight savings time if you have that.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work it might be your internal CMOS battery on your motherboard is failing.

<p>My Windows Explorer is freezing up lately.&nbsp; I log on, have no other applications open, and select "My Documents". I then get a blank white window.&nbsp; I've the gone to Task Manager to find that Explorer.exe is "not responding". When I look at Processes in Task
 Manager, it says that Explorer.exe is taking up 50% or sometimes more of my CPU.</p>
<p>I then have to shut down the process, and log in again.&nbsp; <br />
How do I fix?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If this is a PC remove ALL power and reseat the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible)<br />
- actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clear the vents and ensure the fans are working. For<br />
a laptop about all your can do in reseat the memory, clear the vents, and ensure the fans are working.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Error while installing Visual Studio 2010 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twinbird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error while installing Visual Studio 2010 Professional</h2>
                    I have recently re-installed Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit version) on my computer. I had Visual Studio 2010 Professional installed before (exact same setup, with no issues installing VS 2010). However, this time when I try to install VS 2010 Professional
 I&nbsp;receive&nbsp;the following error: "Setup Failed. There were errors during setup. Although some components were installed successfully, errors were detected." And on the side it tells me "The following component failed to install: Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
 Professional - ENU."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not sure what to do. I downloaded the program from the Microsoft DreamSpark website (for free, as I am a student - no product key required) twice to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with the download. I ran Windows Update so my system is up to
 date. I have antivirus disabled during install. I tried burning to a DVD and&nbsp;installing, mounting the ISO file to a virtual drive, and copying the files to my HDD to run the setup from there. I also ran the setup as administrator. No matter what I do it always
 gives me this same error, it makes no sense.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Here is the error log:</div>

<h3> giantduff  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Device Not Recognized&#58; one of the USB devices connected to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it</h2>
                    <p>Original title: iPhone 4S USB connections failing - Win 7 64 bit desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up until a week or so ago, my iPhone had no problems connecting to my desktop via USB 2.0.&nbsp; Now I have started getting this message: "USB Device Not Recognized: one of the USB devices connected to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize
 it."<br />
<br />
I tried several different USB ports.&nbsp; Two USB ports gave me the same message.&nbsp; One of my USB 3.0 ports did not recognise the thing at all.&nbsp; The second USB 3.0 port recognised it, but intermittently: every two seconds or so the connection dropped out, then came
 back on, then dropped out again.<br />
<br />
I plugged in an old iPhone 3G, and it worked perfectly on the USB 2.0 ports, and on the 3.0 port that had been intermittent with the iPhone 4S (the other 3.0 port didn't recognise it).<br />
<br />
The iPhone charges just fine when plugged into the wall.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It seems to be a compatibility issue between the 4S and my desktop, but a recent issue only. Maybe recent software upgrades are responsible (I had been overseas for a month, and updated all software on PC and phone when I returned, though have not updated any
 PC firmware).&nbsp; I have seen suggestions online that similar issues with other phones and PCs are related to inadequate USB power output.
<br />
<br />
How can I control - or even monitor - USB power output?<br />
<br />
How can I determine if there is a hardware problem on the motherboard?<br />
<br />
I will also ask Apple whether there may be any fixes at the phone end, but if Windows can give me a way to solve the problem, that would be good.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span> <span>Hi,</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the following methods and check if it helps.</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Uninstall and reinstall USB driver</span></strong><span><br />
Uninstall the driver from Device Manager and scan for new hardware to install the driver again.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how:</span></p>
<p><span>First, please disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Start</b> button, type
<b>devmgmt.msc</b> (without quotation marks) in the Search bar and press <b>Enter</b>. Click
<b>Continue</b> if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, double click to expand
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, right click on the Host Controller, click
<b>Uninstall,</b> and click <b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>. <br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> If it does not install the drivers automatically, go to manufacturer’s website download the latest drivers and install it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Update Chipset drivers</span></b></p>
<p><span>Do visit the below link of the manufacturer for updating the drivers. You may refer to the below link and use the steps to automatically check if any updates are required on your computer -<br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/detect.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/detect.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
You may check for the chipset drivers in the device manager following the below provided steps- Also check if you are getting any exclamation (!) or cross marks with the devices (chipset) listed in device manager –</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong><span>System and Maintenance</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>System</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click
<strong><span>System</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong><span>Allow</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now you may expand the option
<strong><span>Display Adapters</span></strong>. Here you will get the Intel Chipset listed which you may right click and open
<strong><span>properties</span></strong>. Here under the driver tab you will find the drivers listed. You may update or install/uninstall the drivers from this window.
</span></p>
<p><span>Check if it works after performing these steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to perform BIOS Update if the above steps didn't work.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning</span></b><span>: Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it is possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly. Updating BIOS should
 only be done if necessary (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Make MLB 2k13 backwards compatible&#33; Us Xbox FANS need some type of REAL baseball&#33;</h2>
                    <p>we have no baseball game to play and we haven't since 2012. If EA and 2k are not willing to produce a new baseball game for Xbox one the least Microsoft can do is make the 2k baseball games back wards compatible. You don't know how many Xbox players would rejoice to that</p>

            <p>It sure would be great to have an official baseball game to play on the Xbox One. Great suggestion here. Please head over to the Feedback forums to vote on this idea. This way Xbox/Microsoft will see the demand to make the 2k part of the backwards compatible program in the near future. Found a couple you can vote on now. I hope this makes the program soon.

            Why doesn't Microsoft or 2K or EA care about its customers? Do they want to see the Xbox go out of commission? Do they want everyone to revert to PS4 because of a baseball game? I
<strong>[Mod Removed - Inappropriate]</strong> l don't. But I <strong>
[Mod Removed - Inappropriate]</strong> want a realistic baseball game that RBI Baseball game is
<strong>[Mod Removed - see Guidelines]</strong>. Whoever came up with that game should be slapped in the back of the head. Then asked What
<strong>[Mod Removed - Inappropriate]</strong> were you thinking? The game is dumb and boring. Atleast with 2K you felt like you were a part of the game and could be actually in the game as yourself if I do recall and they would call out
 your name. I liked all that. Plus more commentary and all that good <strong>

            Were you able to update the version of your windows 10? It appears that these download bugs are caused by the OS version users are running. We suggest you install Windows 10 in order to properly update Forza Horizon on your PC.<br />

Let us know how it goes.

<p>I finally had to reinstall Windows 10 to find that I had a Trojan virus called Win32/Dorv.Binfn. It was discovered by Windows Defender after reinstallation of Windows10. I previously was using McAfee antivirus software instead of Windows Defender. Just before
 discovering that I had a problem with my computer I was getting odd error messages on the Xbox Game Age OF Empires Castle Siege. First it was saying "your purchase could not be completed". I hadn't made any purchases recently.&nbsp; Also I had been attacked by
 a player and when I tried to view his castle (in game) It kept tripping me offline. Same thing happened when I tried to counter-attack this player back, it tripped me offline. Then I started getting the message that my game version was out of date. That's
 when I couldn't get the game to update and The game wouldn't start. It only repeated the error message that my game was out of date. I uninstalled the game and tried to reinstall it without success. I started getting all kinds of problems after that. Slow
 restarts, unnecessary crashes, etc. .</p>
<p>My McAfee antivirus program took about 4 hrs. to scan my PC and supposedly found two problems that it fixed. Still had problems though, so I reinstalled Windows 10 and enabled Windows Defender as requested by install program. Defender found the Win virus
 and quarantined it. I incinerated it and everything seemed back to normal. I started getting the error message "your purchase could not be completed" again. I suspect that the player mentioned previously is involved in the virus infection of my PC. What do
 I do now?</p>

<p>I tried but couldn't get anywhere on Xbox site. All they want to do is sell me a new Xbox system or other product. I couldn't get any help from the Game site or Game forum at all. I think one of the players is hacking and giving virus. I have no way to delete
 the suspected player, or even ban them. Now what? I enjoy the game but don't know what to do at this point.</p>
<p>As usual, I didn't get any worthwhile help from the forum here on on the game site.</p>

            I also have a similar problem. I uninstalled Xbox Live using some code in a Windows App I reinstalled it and I couldn't sign in. It showed an error code 0x406. Any way to fix this? I used Powershell to uninstall Xbox Live.

            <p>Hey there, Russian! I'm very sorry to see that the game does not have the option to switch the language! It appears that the game only supports English and Spanish according to the Overview on the <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/Product/Mass-Effect/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024d5307e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mass Effect</a> page. If you would like to request the game be support in Russian, I suggest reaching out to <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BioWare/EA</a> to see if they may implement that for you. :)</p>
<p>I hope that I was able to clarify things for you! If you have any other support questions, do not hesitate to make a post explaining what you're running into and troubleshooting you've completed! :)</p>

<p>It's got some of the old fun stuff back&nbsp;from San Andreas like the parachute and APC. Its defo worth the money, I'd say it’s the most worthwhile DLC on LIVE.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's worth it.</p>
<p>I personally enjoyed it much, much more than the main game.</p>
<p>You downloading it or buying the disc version? Got the disc version myself as it also comes with the Lost &amp; Dammed dlc plus it plays independantly of the main game that way (I have since traded in GTA IV)</p>

<p>Not to mention it comes with an extra radio station, Vice City FM. It's probably the best station too.</p>

<p>Yeah it's pretty awesome. A lot more fun than the original story, I thought, and some of the stranger missions made me laugh more than anything in the main game. Definitely worth it.</p>

<p>Well I bought it, only got to play for a little bit before. Hitting golf balls at a guy on a driving range? Dancing as you walk through a club? First impressions... I like it!</p>

    <title>&#34;Try closing other programs using the Webcam&#34; when trying to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron98  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Try closing other programs using the Webcam&#34; when trying to open webcam</h2>
                    <p>Original title: WebCam</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an HP TouchSmart with a built in Sonix webcam. If I run Skype I am unable to start the video because I get a message "Try closing other programs using the Webcam".<br />
The other program that uses the Webcam is Cyberlink's Youcam. If I close Skype and open Cyberlink I get a similar message.
<br />
I obviously don't try to run both programs at the same time, but I don't know how to find out which program the computer thinks is using the Webcam.<br />
Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
