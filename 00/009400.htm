<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We will have to check the Product Key before reinstalling Office 365. In order to check if the Product Key is correct, login to your Microsoft Account.<br />
&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Login to your Microsoft Account with your Microsoft Account Credentials and check if your Office 365 edition reflects on the My Account page. The URL for the Microsoft Account webpage is:
<a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a>. Microsoft account credentials would be your Outlook.com or Hotmail.com or Live.com email account which you have used for the Office 365 purchase registration.</span></p>

</p><p>If your My Account page reflects your version of Office 365 - then follow these steps to remove the remnants of Office and install Office 365.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to un-install Office remnants from your computer, you will have to install and run the Office 365 FIXIT tool. Please run the tool even if you do not have Office 365 showing in your list of programs at present ‚Äì as there may be remnants of a previous

<p>Once you have completed running the FIXIT follow these steps to delete the <strong>
Office 15</strong> folders.</p>
<ul>
<li>From Windows Explorer please navigate to the following location: <strong>C:\Propgram Files\</strong> or
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\ </strong></li><li>Make sure to delete the <strong>Microsoft Office 15</strong> folder. In case you are able to delete the folder then right-click on it and click on
<strong>Rename</strong>. Rename the folder as <strong>Microsoft Office 15 old. </strong>
Ignore these steps in case you are not able to find the Microsoft Office 15 folder in the above mentioned location.</li><li>Once you have completed running the FIXIT and deleted/renamed the Office 15 folder be sure to restart your computer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Now try logging into the My Account page and install Office 365.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Check if you were able to download and install Office 365 successfully. Once this is completed check if Office 365 prompts you for activation. If yes, proceed with the steps on screen and activate Office 365.&nbsp;After this is completed please check if you can
 open Outlook 2013 normally. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Edge not appearing in background apps, cant play youtube video and lock screen</h2>
                    <p>-Win Phone 10 latest version (all rings) same bug</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Open Edge, do browsing</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Go to start/settings/privacy/background apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge doesn't appear in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Locking the screen while playing a youtube video/playlist in Edge, causes it to stop.</p>
<p>The browser suspends...cant add to background app list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only workaround is to install UCBrowserHD which does appear in background app list, allowing me to play a video and still lock the screen to listen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a really basic usage case and very disappointing it doesn't work and can't be worked around................<br />
Any ideas anyone?</p>

    <title>Windows Phone 8.1 MAP Uconnect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave.drouin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 MAP Uconnect</h2>
                    <p>I have a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee with UConnect.&nbsp; I'm looking to get a Windows 8.1 phone.&nbsp; My concern is voice texting.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Uconnect site, it says the phone has to have the MAP Bluetooth profile for it to work. My current old Motorola Android phone
 works and supports MAP. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, all the stars seemed to come together yesterday, I thought.&nbsp; HTC came out with the HTC One (M8) For Windows (8.1).&nbsp; Since the HTC One (M8) for Android supports the MAP Bluetooth Profile, I assumed the Windows version would.&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; Not in the description
 as supported on the Verizon site for the Windows version.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a lot of chatter in forums that say it works, it doesn't, it's Windows Phone's fault (no matter what version), it's Uconnect, it's HTC, etc.&nbsp; Does anyone have any factual information on if this would work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following are the differences in Bluetooth profiles for the HTC phones from the Verizon site.&nbsp; Don't know if they are accurate.&nbsp; It almost looks like it's Windows that doesn't support MAP (From the forums).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows<br />
Bluetooth¬Æ 4.0 Bluetooth¬Æ Profiles Supported: HFP, A2DP, AVRCP, GAVDP, AVDTP, AVCTP, OPP (Vcard, Music, Album, Cal), PBAP, GATT<br />
<br />
Android<br />
Bluetooth¬Æ 4.0 Bluetooth Profiles Supported: HSP, HFP, A2DP, AVRCP, GAVDP, AVDTP, AVCTP, OPP (Vcard, Music, Album, Cal), PBAP, FTP (Server Side only), HID, PAN (NAP Only), MAP<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>So what's your question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, different devices support different Bluetooth profiles. This is normal and true for almost every device out there. There are many to choose from. it's no-ones fault if two particular devices don't overlap. it just means that Jeep and MS and HTC didn't
 get around a table and discuss what they were doing, they just released 2 different products to do two different things. There is no legislation requiring them to work together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MAP is one method of sharing text messages between devices. this means the car can compose a message (by voice) and then forward that to your phone to be sent as a text message (SMS) it's there to provide people with dumbphones an ability to text from their
 cars, by the car doing the message composition, or text to speech conversion, on phones that can't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that WP already has such speech facilities built it, you're better off using a hands free profile, and simply feeding the audio into the phone for processing, rather than using a separate profile for voice calls, text messages, and possibly music,
 or other, I can't see a reason to increase the cost, or complexity, for the sake of a one trick pony profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to have text messages read out to you, and dictate them back, then you can do this already without MAP. If what you actually want to do is send and receive text messages via MAP, then no, you can't, but I can't see what the difference is.</p>

<h2>            How can I add an Admin Managed Add-in to Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We tried deploying an Add-in to the Office 365 Admin Centre using&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/publish/centralized-deployment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">these instructions.</a>&nbsp;We are running Office 365 ProPlus and tried this with
 builds 1704, 1703 and 1701. Our Exchange mailboxes have been set-up to allow OAuth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we open the 'Insert', 'My Add-ins' dialog and select the 'Admin Managed' tab, we only see 'No add-ins currently available'. We have tried selecting users, groups and everybody as the 'Enabled' group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also noticed that when clicking 'Refresh' a SOAP request gets made to:</p>
<pre><code>https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx</code></pre>
<p>This seems to request the Add-in catalog because it contains:</p>
<pre><code>GetPrivateCatalogAddIns </code></pre>
<p>We also see that the page responds with an 500 Internal Server error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can we do to fix this issue?</p>

<h3> hoibo  say:</h3>
<h2>            PPT 2010 - embedded video - but slide will not advance to next</h2>
                    <p>In PPT 2010 (Win 7 Pro 32 bit), I have a "kiosk" type of show with 50 slides.&nbsp; In the show I have embedded 3 videos on three separate slides at certain points in the show.&nbsp; On slide no. 15, the first slide with video it plays and on stop advances to the
 next slide.&nbsp; On slide no. 30, the second video plays through to the end, stops and advances to the next slide.&nbsp; On slide no. 40, however, the third video plays to the end but the slide itself will not advance to slide 41.&nbsp; The timings on slide 40 are set just
 the same as every other slide, .75 second.&nbsp; It seems like the video itself isn't terminating in some graceful fashion in order for the slide which encloses it to receive back control and continue.&nbsp; I took out the video and slide 40 advances.&nbsp; So, it seems
 like it's the video itself that isn't fully completing or putting the slide itself back into focus.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In producing this show, I had to take the three videos and convert them from .AVIs to .WMVs in order to get them to work.&nbsp; I've looked all over with the Video Tools to see what setting(s) are missing, comparing slides 40, 15 and 30.&nbsp; I don't see any differences
 in these three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who can give me some suggestions for where else to look, please?</p>
<p>

If you've not had it long it should be well within the time allowed to return it.

<p>Hello SandeshYapuram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's my pleasure to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. Does Get-User &lt;some identity x&gt; and Get-ADUser &lt;some identity x&gt; fetch the same user?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/users-and-groups/get-user?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Get-User</span></span></a><span style="font-weight: bold">

<p>
</p><p>2. If I say Get-User then where is the user fetched ? Exchange or Active Directory?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Shortly answer is Exchange.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If I say Get-ADUser then where is the user fetched ? Exchange or Active Directory? (Pretty much sure its Active directory)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Shortly answer is Active Directory.</span></p>

</p><p><span>The answer is no.

    <title>ACCESS 2106 download link 32bit version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> berndstoeckl  say:</h3>
<h2>            ACCESS 2106 download link 32bit version</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Access 2106 and paid.</p>
<p>I have a WIN10 64bit machine and but a 3rd party software that is 32bit that requires a 32bit ACCESS to work with the access database files.</p>
<p>I downloaded the 32bit ACCESS runtime so it works but I would also like to open the databases.</p>
<p>The automatic download always does the 64bit version which complains about the 32bit ACCESS RUNTIME installed that I need for my software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get an installer of the 32bit ACCESS 2016??</p>
<p>
</p><p>The telephone support in Germany is dead 30 minutes in the waiting line.</p>
<p>The switch board ladies in Unterschleissheim are are telling me the cannot help me if I am not able to tell them exactly which number I had pressed in the FIVE submenues of the support hotline computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If you are downloading a fully licensed version, you no longer need the Runtime. So uninstall the Runtime before you install the full Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real question here is whether you are going to work on the design of these apps to share with others. If so, then you should be using the same version of Access that the other users use. But if this is a 3rd party app, then they are probably distributing
 it as an accde so you can't get into the design anyway. The Runtime should be all you need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know that a fully licensed ACCESS 2016 replaces my runtime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own software that is created with a C++ compiler from Embarcadero is 32bit, all my drivers for my hardware are so.</p>
<p>My programmer cannot easily create a 64bit as even some of the drivers of the hardware are only availaible 32bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here we go again:</p>
<p>Whenever I download the installer it tells me to remove the runtime.</p>
<p>Which I did of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then it installs 64bit only without asking my for a choice as it is so wonderful smart and detects my win10 64bit system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I have a fully licensed ACCESS 2016 and my software does not run anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stuck</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how in the name of the lord do I get a 32bit ACCESS 2016 installed on my 64bit Win10 environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the licensed full ACCESS on the same PC as the software runs to open the encrypted databases and edit it for troubleshooting on my development system.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that the phone and email is associated with the other account hence, you are not able to use it to create a new Skype account. Were you referring to the account that needs to be reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, you can try the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Login to the <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype diagnostic page</a></strong><br />
2. Enter your <strong>Skype Name</strong> and press <strong>Continue</strong><br />
3. Click on <strong>Reset Password </strong>under the Sign in button and choose "<strong>I forgot my password</strong>" on the next page<br />
4. Enter the code shown on the screen then press <strong>Next</strong><br />
5. You will be asked to choose a registered email or phone to receive the reset code</p>
<p>6. Check if the email or phone is on the security info list. If you cannot identify any of the registered contact on the list then please choose "<strong>I don't have any of these</strong>"</p>
<p>7. You will be asked to provide a working email address</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expect a reply from the account recovery team regarding your request within 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

            I figured out what is wrong with the Bing bar, if I disable protection mode Bing bar works again, I am not sure what that is about.

<p>If the Free Studio available in <font color="#000000">Programs and Features, uninstall it and check the issue status.</font></p>

<h3> rafisher1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Here we go again with the forced update</h2>
                    <p>I am so sick of this crap.&nbsp; I am running the latest Classic version and absolutely cannot use the horrible for desktop V8 garbage version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I start my computer the following appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88afb436-d8ca-440e-8d56-64190e215c87?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88afb436-d8ca-440e-8d56-64190e215c87?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The former trick was to make a folder called SkypeSetup.exe, but no this horrid routine deletes that and downloads the executable that then puts up this message.&nbsp; The other trick to turn off Skype Update Service doesn't work either because it is no longer
 there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever is in charge of the Skype project should be taken out and horse whipped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have twice dutifully sent in my feedback as to what is needed including screenshots for a desktop version, so yes I do get to complain, not to mention that I am a paying customer with a calling subscription and online number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will somebody please tell the Skype incharge he or she is not making friends.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, how to stop this annoyance?</p>

<p>Nonsense.&nbsp; Deleting the application installer and making a folder named SkypeSetup.exe worked just fine until a few days ago, so someone decided to antagonize the hell out of us.&nbsp; So don't even try to tell me there is no way to stop the popup. That is complete
 GPBS - Gold Plated ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My patience went a long time ago.&nbsp; This new development is recent, so why did the idiots programming Skype change it so it would be so annoying.&nbsp; Do you really want desktop users to go find a new service.&nbsp; Line looks good and sets up almost the same as I
 use Skype on my desktop.&nbsp; And why couldn't there be a desktop version in addition to a new mobile oriented version, which is what v8 is.&nbsp; Line, Signal, Viber, and WhatsApp all have a desktop version, but Skype - oh noooooo.&nbsp; If the V8 eventually becomes unable
 like the classic desktop is then okay, but I haven't seen any movement toward that yet so why do we have to put up with this annoyance when just a few days ago we did not?&nbsp; There is no reason for it except someone decided forcing us would make us more friendly
 and want to recommend us to the world.&nbsp; Don't you realize that the more you antagonize us, the more we flee?</p>

<p>Not enough information for my feeble brain.&nbsp; Please add more information and I will try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I am trying two other paths.</p>
<p>I remembered a program from a decade ago called ClickOff and it actually installed and is running.&nbsp; I set it to close automatically the popup.&nbsp; Not sure if it works yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to figure out what you were talking about, I looked at windows firewall, but could not figure out&nbsp;how to make a new rule to block SkypeSetup.exe.&nbsp; I searched online how to block an app from downloading and found this command that I ran as administrator
 in Command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=SkypeSetup dir=in action=block program=D:\Temporary_System_and_User_Files enable=yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the firewall list and it is there, but again I have not tested it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Well this worked after a restart that usually triggers the download of SkypeSetup.exe and the annoying prompt to update.&nbsp; I will report back if the download and popup returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Find where SkypeSetup.exe downloads to&nbsp;(C:\ Windows\Temp), note the path, and delete SkypeSetup.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Right click on Win 10 Start Menu icon, click on Command Prompt (Admin) or PowerShell (admin), and paste in this command at the prompt. If Win 7 or 8 run Command Prompt as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. At the prompt type - netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=SkypeSetup dir=in action=block program=[Path to where SkypeSetup.exe downloads to like C:\ Windows\Temp] enable=yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example my command was:</p>
<p>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=SkypeSetup dir=in action=block program=D:\Temporary_System_and_User_Files enable=yes</p>

            Unfortunately, there's no way to download your text messages to your computer from the My Phone website.&nbsp; However, you could sync the text messages back to your phone and then use third party software like<a href="http://www.jeyo.com/companion.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Jeyo
 Mobile Companion</a> to sync your text messages to your computer.&nbsp; Once there you can export the messages to a file that you can work with.

That is the monthly amount for a zune pass (accessible on xBox.)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As NSILMike suggested, that looks like a Zune Pass subscription.&nbsp;You can cancell the subscription&nbsp;either from Zune.net or from your Xbox console by going to your account information and selecting Manage Zune Pass. If you wish to get in contact with support
 you can do it from here <a href="http://gethelp.live.com/en-gb/Pages/zune.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Excel 2010&#58; Concatenated URL broken when saved to PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graham gold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010&#58; Concatenated URL broken when saved to PDF</h2>
                    <p>I have a small application built in Excel 2010 with cell formulae plus some vba subs and a vba function that is called in worksheet cells.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One column has a formula in each cell that builds a hyperlink using a base URL, variable part, fixed part, variable part.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works great, until... I save the print area to PDF using the inbuilt functionality in Excel 2010.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The generated PDF shows hyperlinks that look OK but the link actually only takes you to the first part of the concatenated URL (the base URL).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eg this link: <a href="https://www.support.unisys.com/common/epa/macro.aspx?path0=a-s&amp;path1=ple&amp;path2=web-select&amp;SELECT=PLE-PLE-TO-IC+eq+MCP-054.1A.117&amp;TITLE=PLE(s)+released+since+IC:+MCP-054.1A.116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.support.unisys.com/common/epa/macro.aspx?path0=a-s&amp;path1=ple&amp;path2=web-select&amp;SELECT=PLE-PLE-TO-IC+eq+MCP-054.1A.117&amp;TITLE=PLE(s)+released+since+IC:+MCP-054.1A.116</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would be generated by the following formula: =HYPERLINK(CONCATENATE("https://www.support.unisys.com/common/epa/macro.aspx?path0=a-s&amp;path1=ple&amp;path2=web-select&amp;SELECT=PLE-PLE-TO-IC+eq+",D1,"&amp;TITLE=PLE(s)+released+since+IC:+",C1))
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The saved PDF displays the hyperlink label as: <a href="https://www.support.unisys.com/common/epa/macro.aspx?path0=a-s&amp;path1=ple&amp;path2=web-select&amp;SELECT=PLE-PLE-TO-IC+eq+MCP-054.1A.117&amp;TITLE=PLE(s)+released+since+IC:+MCP-054.1A.116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.support.unisys.com/common/epa/macro.aspx?path0=a-s&amp;path1=ple&amp;path2=web-select&amp;SELECT=PLE-PLE-TO-IC+eq+MCP-054.1A.117&amp;TITLE=PLE(s)+released+since+IC:+MCP-054.1A.116</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the actual link takes you to: <a href="https://www.support.unisys.com/common/epa/macro.aspx?path0=a-s&amp;path1=ple&amp;path2=web-select&amp;SELECT=PLE-PLE-TO-IC+eq+" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.support.unisys.com/common/epa/macro.aspx?path0=a-s&amp;path1=ple&amp;path2=web-select&amp;SELECT=PLE-PLE-TO-IC+eq+</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how to get it to create the correct hyperlink in the PDF? Or is this a Microsoft bug(or Adobe)?

            I think because the link is so long that page line are being inserted into your hyper link. &nbsp;When generating the pdf click on options and specify Ignore Print Areas.
<div><br />
<div>This might require you to structure the document in a different manner, but my guess is you require an uneditable active file and this should do the trick.</div>
