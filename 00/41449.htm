<p>Contacting Xbox support sadly won't do anything for your issue. Its likely the achievements are glitched. I suggest checking out&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.xbox360achievements.org/&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox360achievements.org/
</a>. Their usually really good at telling people if achievements are glitched and so on. Still, if you wish to contact someone about it I would suggest contacting Rockstar games support about it as their the company that makes the game.</p>

<p>I did contact Rockstar they wont reply is their anyway you guys could unlock the achievement for me as xbox support said that every thing on my side is in order and that the achievement should be unlocked for me is this an ambassador or an actual member
 of the enforcement team </p>

<p>Xbox Support can't just go around and unlock those achievements for you. Have you made sure those achievements aren't mentioned as glitched? I do remember that there are some sort of problems with Bully. If clearing the system cache, recovering your gamertag
 or removing the saves and starting all over again don't help then you're more than likely just not able to get those achievements.</p>

<p>After doing some quick research, sharp dressed, dual nebula, and the champion do not seem to be glitched. Just make sure you have completed every requirement. Mission accomplished doesnt always pop right away for people, "If you have completed all the missions
 from Freshman to Graduate and the achievement still hasn't popped then save your game, shut off your xbox and then reload the game. It will pop up then." Sadly, perfectionist is glitched. Please read through this thread for help

www.xbox360achievements.org/.../13569-PERFECTIONIST.html</a> </p>
<p>As stated xbox360achievements.org is an awesome site for achievement help. <a href="http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/bully-scholarship-edition/achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox360achievements.org/.../achievements</a></p>
<p>For smackdown vs raw, 5 hall of famers should work, but other people have had problems with bonus collector.</p>
<p>I know this info does not give you these achievements, but I hope that this information atleast helps ease the annoyment.
</p>
<p>All I can add is that you go back and make sure you have absolutley completed every requirement for the achievements. Also check websites like xbox360achievements.org. Hope I helped a little.

    <title>How do I preview images in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marym302  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I preview images in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In previous versions of Windows, you could right-click and select Preview. That option has disappeared.
</p>
<p>I am not referring to the Preview Pane - which is useless, that's just a slightly larger version of the thumbnail.
</p>
<p>I already checked the Folder Options, and the 'View icons' is not selected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the 'Slideshow' option, which is similar to the Preview option, but you can't select one image. The Slideshow option forces you to start with the first image in the folder - which is not helpful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I preview a full-size version of one image?</p>

    <title>Endless Corrupt Files and Troubleshooting. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenplunkett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Endless Corrupt Files and Troubleshooting.</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my SFC /Scannow command, run from Powershell Admin found corrupt files it was unable to fix.&nbsp; I expected The Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /Restorehealth command to take care of it.&nbsp; Instead it reported "error 0x800f0906" and said it lacked the files
 to repair the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up error 0x800f0906 in a Dism command.&nbsp; It suggested a repair that started and stopped services, a</p>
<p><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></p>
<p><strong>cd %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution</strong></p>

<p><strong>cd %systemroot%\system32</strong></p>
<p><strong>ren catroot2 catroot2old</strong></p>
<p><strong>net start cryptsvc&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It also suggested Windows Update was malfunctioning and that I should fix it from The Troubleshooting screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did, and SFC /Scannow came up clean and Dism&nbsp;/Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth reported error code 0x800f081f instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used The Dism&nbsp;/Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup and The Dism&nbsp;/Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase Commands.&nbsp; I then used The Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth Command and it reported "No component store corruption
 detected."&nbsp; I thought I was in the clear, but &nbsp;Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth keeps reporting it found and repaired files and The Troubleshooter keeps reporting it's fixed problems in Windows Update.&nbsp; Probably not the biggest deal in the Windows
 world&nbsp;but a little unsettling.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            I ran it both in standard mode and safe mode.&nbsp; It seems to do some good but those two problems remain. &nbsp; When run in Safe Mode it reports it cannot fix "problems installing recent updates."&nbsp;&nbsp;In standard mode, it reports "service registration is missing
 or corrupt", "Windows Update Error 0x80070057 (2015-06-03-T-05_32_29P) and "problems installing recent updates" as all fixed.

<h2>            Windows 10 resolution is locked and greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Hi; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a gateway netbook LT40 model. Once I upgraded to Windows 10, I am no longer able to adjust screen resolution. I was able to do so in Windows 7, but now in Windows 10 it is locked at 1024x600 and greyed out so I cannot change resolution. I have
 tried Display1_DownScalingSupported, but I had to create this because it didn't exist in Windows 10 registry. Can anyone please assist? Thank you.
</p>
<p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I Thank you, Wanikya &amp; Dyami Team ZigZag, for your reply and suggestions. However, I tried what you suggested with no positive results. I still cannot change the resolution. It is still greyed out and frozen at 1024 x 600. I don't understand why
 Microsoft would not allow someone to decide what resolution they want. This way I have no choice but to use my computer at the frozen resolution setting. I need some assistance. Someone please HELP!!!!

    <title>Can I hard drive damage the console&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awfrigate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I hard drive damage the console&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>So my Xbox 360 died and I needed to retrieve the profiles and saved games on the hard drive. Since I had an older Xbox 360 I took a flash drive and my hard drive to my friend who had a working Xbox 360. So I meet up with him and I see he has it powered on
 and functioning. So we turn it off, carefully put my hard drive in and then 3 red flashing lights appear. I was wondering if my hard drive could have caused this problem? My friend Xbox was old, 2006 was on the manufactures date, but my friend tells me he
 hadn't played his Xbox for 2 years and it was in working order when he left it.We tried booting it up with his hard drive, no hard drive, and all the easy support fixes from the Xbox site and nothing worked.</p>
<p>So can a hard drive damage cause 3 red lights in consoles?</p>
<ul>
<li>3 red rings is hardware failure right? </li><li>Can hardware and/or software issues on a hard drive cause these problems? </li><li>If so i get my hard drive diagnosed and repaired? </li></ul>
<p>I'm planning on purchasing a new Xbox 360 slim and maybe a transfer cable (http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/Transfer)</p>
<p>Has there been any cases where hard drive data is damaged and either irretrievable or damaging to another hard drive?</p>
<p>Is it safe to move my data from my old drive to the slims one?</p>
<p>If anyone with insight into the matter could put my fears to rest I would welcome it.
</p>

<p>If the HD is not plugged in all the way you may get error lights. &nbsp; Make sure whenever you plug a HD on a 360 the power is off and the HD is connected tightly.</p>
<p>If you received error lights after connecting a HD to a 360 power the 360 down remove the HD and re plug it in. &nbsp;Unless the HD it's self is damaged there should be no error lights. &nbsp;If the HD is damaged you will have to get a new HD.</p>

<p>Three flashing red lights means that the Xbox 360 console or its power supply has a hardware problem. &nbsp;Have a look at this link, this should help -

<p>Great Vid I Have to stop watching them though, they make me wanna hop in a time machine and skip to when I can have the game in my hands. My only concern is the flash suppressor for the mid range sniper they were talking about. That will further encourage
 people to camp and do nothing productive for the team.</p>

<h2>            stuck on &#34;choose keyboard layout&#34;, when running a new clean install of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I see that hundreds of people around the world have had this very same problem.</p>
<p>Windows 10 asks you to select the keyboard language, but it shuts down the USB drivers so we have no way to select.</p>
<p>Can't Microsoft fix this? &nbsp;How can this be so complicated? &nbsp;Where is Bill Gates when we need him?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want to reformat my computer with a fresh copy of Windows 10. &nbsp;Why is this so complicated? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to go purchase an old mouse that plugs in the old way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm no expert, but I had this same issue when trying to install windows 10 from the ISO / DVD or USB Stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was able to still select the keyboard layout and continue the install by using the "TAB" key to move around to the different places you would normal click with a mouse and then use the ENTER or SPACE Keys to select the items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once install fully, the mouse worked fine after.</p>
<p>
hope that helps</p>

            <p>Hi! &nbsp;I really appreciate your input and your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that since both my mouse and my keyboard are plugged in to the USB ports, neither one works so I can't use either one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am going to try and get an old mouse or keyboard and see if that will work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So strange that Windows 10 would dictate the use of this old technology, but what ever!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I still don't understand how there can be so many smart people at Microsoft and they don't have their program to where it reads the USB port.&nbsp; So many people are having this same problem.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry to jump-in so late. It seems that the ISO file that you have (<em>File for your clean installation of Windows 10</em>) is working a little different. I suggest you to re-download a new copy of ISO for Windows 10. Refer to these links:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File).</strong></em></span></a>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Windows 10 Media Creation Tool.</strong></em></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just follow the instruction for each link. If the issue is persistent, check a newer keyboard and let us know how it would go. Considering the fact that Windows 10 is
<em>new</em>, it will work best with new and Up-to-date hardware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to update us.</p>

<p>Ok with the new DLC coming out Rockstar promised to return Undead Overrun to the original settings. Maybe I have only played under the new settings.
</p>
<p>what exactly are the differences just so i know when the update is released with the next title update?</p>

 running program list. It will keep telling me some application are running. This problem makes my computer run slow and graphics display will always&nbsp;run&nbsp;slowly&nbsp;cutting itself&nbsp;through display moments but my PC&nbsp;computer never lost any information.&nbsp;How can I
 solve this problem

<p><span>Hi Mosea,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This happens if your memory is not being recognized by your computer completely. When a memory of a computer has generated errors, your computer’s processing system will function
 in an unusual behavior. Thus, your programs that running high RAM requirement will be affected. To make sure that your computer is in a healthy state, it is imperative to scan and detect these hardware issues as early as possible.</span></p>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition</h2>
                    I own the Java PC version of Minecraft and have already redeemed my code for Minecraft Windows 10 Edition, the store says I own it, but the install button is grey and above it says:"To use this app, you'll need a&nbsp;device with more features. For details,
 see Additional info." My processor is x64 based and I'm on an Alienware x51 R2, running Windows 10. Why can't I download?

<p>
</p><p>I already own the Java version of Minecraft and I just installed Windows 10,</p>
<p>I signed in with Mojang to redeem my code for Minecraft windows 10 Edition and the install button is grey saying that my code has already been redeemed... I looked through my purchases but nothing... \</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also i cannot sign into the windows store app. when i click to sign in and choose 'Microsoft account' option and after i click it the box turns grey and disappears... I am now unable to sign into the windows store app and cannot redeem my windows 10 MC code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly.. so far i am "LOVING" Windows 10... (I say that sarcasticly) I much prefer Windows 7 to be truthful..</p>

            Hi, Well, after a while (a day or 2) I had checked again and it allowed me to install it, and for what I know, I didn't do a thing to change it. The only thing I can think of to help you, is to install any updates Windows has, to do that, go to Windows
 Update, which you can get to by clicking the start button at the bottom left side of your screen, then click settings, scroll down, click Update &amp; security, then click Windows Update, it should search if there is any available updates. Also keep in mind that
 your processor has to be x64 currently to play the game. To check what your processor is, click the start button, click settings, click System, then scroll down and click About, and next to System type, it should say whether it's a x86 or x64 processor. And
 if you currently own the PC/Mac version of minecraft. Go to your Mojang account (if you have one) and log in, and under minecraft in your games, it should have a "Claim your free copy" under "Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta". Clicki

            Awesome, glad it's working, hopefully everyone will have it working soon, I think the game is really good, I've noticed cool things like when it rains it gets foggy, it's mostly noticeable if you have it on high render distance.

            I have made a lot of changes to my computer.&nbsp; I know how to take ownership and set permissions for individual folders.&nbsp; I am asking if there is a way to do this Globally (the entire computer) for all files and folders.<br />
I have enabled the Administrator account , but this does no good since this account can't find essential system files.&nbsp; I wonder if reinstalling windows would help.<br />

            To my knowledge, you would have to do this manually, by creating a new user and then migrating all their data over. Users should still be able to login to the system even if the domain no longer exists.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unsuccesfull  installation of OEM Windows Home Server 2011 - Network devices continually not found&#47;installed</h2>
                    Attempted to install OEM Windows Home Server 2011 to custom built server with ASUS M489GTD Pro Mobo and AMD Phenom IIx6 1055T processor. Installation (3 attempts) would not complete when network devices were unable to be found. Have read a number of User
 group locations and found siginficant amount of discussion on similar type problems. Looked for and copied name brand NIC and USB device drivers but installing to WHS 2011 was unsuccesful. Have since succesfully installed Windows 8 Consumer Preview onto the
 server using "Device Manager" to find installed drivers located in relevant folders and C:/ drive. Question: would a "best case" plan be to try and do a fresh install WHS 2011 onto my server or to do an "upgrade" type install which might retain the driver
 folders/files? Thank you

            I don't think you CAN register a Surface Pen. Support (and the physical retail Microsoft Stores) have been good about replacing defective pens from what I have seen with just the purchase date and receipt. If you go to
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us</a> - scroll the page and select Accessories - you can get support for the pen if you follow the prompts.

            XP Home doesn't have the Group Policy Editor. You can set restrictions in XP Home with either Doug Knox's Security Console or Microsoft's SteadyState.<br />

                    <p>Hello nataku885. I am subhash chaudhary from india. I am also facing the same problem with Skype as you. I use to do skype daily with my friend for 2 hours. So for the comfort i use to run skype in the background with little video windows on the corner of
 mobile screen and also use my phone for multitasking. I have a android mobile. Oneplus 3 but after i update my skype few weeks ago. I am facing the same problem as you . Like after pressing home button while on Skype call my Skype stop working. Same things
 also happens with my friends in spain or Europe. Means this is clear that skype dont wants his user to use skype is background or while multitasking to reduce to load on the &nbsp;skype server. Skype is really bad now. I also try other applications like googel
 duo and other videos calling application for Android but they are not working in background also. Now i am waiting for the Skype to provide update and let us enjoy the Skype while multitasking and in the background also.&nbsp;</p>

Permissions can be set for individual users, groups of users, or for a specific computer. Usually, this message appears if you are using a network to which administrators have applied permissions for specific users and groups, or if you are accessing a resource
 local to a specific user's computer, but are blocked because of local permissions that have been set by that user. If you cannot open a resource on a file server or other computer on your network, you will most likely need to review your user account settings
 to determine whether you have the necessary permissions to gain access to the resource. If you do not know whether you have the necessary permissions, contact your network administrator or the owner of the computer with the shared resources.<br />
<br />
Usually, this message does not appear if you are using disk drives formatted with a FAT or FAT32 file system. Drives formatted with NTFS, HPFS, or another file format that provides the ability to apply permissions, are capable of forcing this message.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, the computer that grants users access to a network can lose the information that is used to authenticate a specific user. When this happens, the only option available is to turn your computer off for thirty seconds, and then restart your computer
 (you must turn off the computer to clear the cached information in the network card). Restarting may reset the authentication information that is used to grant you access to the network. If this does not work, you must contact the network administrator to
 have your account reset. It is also possible that the network administrator has disabled your account.<br />
<br />
There is also the possibility that the file you are attempting to open is restricted through Information Rights Management (IRM). IRM is an alternate form of file restriction access that allows creators of a file the ability to limit editing, copying, printing,
 or forwarding of content. If the file is restricted and you require access to its contents, you must contact the creator or owner of the file to request that they add your user ID to the list of users who are allowed to access the file.

<strong>How do I go about restoring the permissions on any or all of the backed up and restored files? I tried rebooting as suggested above but no luck.&nbsp; Please advise a.s.a.p. Thank you.</strong>

<p><span><span><span>Hi<span>&nbsp;
</span>Mike-E-Boy,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Is your computer connected to any domain or server?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have few steps which might help you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method 1</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can follow the steps given below, to restore the backed-up versions of files.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Backup and Restore Center by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
System and Maintenance</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Backup and Restore Center</strong>.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click
<strong>Restore files</strong>, and then follow the steps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: If you use the Complete PC Backup function and you would
 like to restore the files to another computer, this computer needs to have the exact same hardware in order for that system to boot. Since a Complete PC backup consists of an entire system, including the device drivers specific to that system, restoring that
 backup to a system with different hardware will result in many errors.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method
<span>&nbsp;</span>2</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>Try to take ownership of the folder.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To do this,
<span>&nbsp;</span>follow the steps given below:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span> Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership
 in windows explorer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>2.</span></strong><span> Right click on file or folder and select
<strong>“Properties”</strong> from Context Menu.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span> Click on
<strong>Security tab.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>4.</span></strong><span> Click on
<strong>“Advance”.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>5.</span></strong><span> Now click on
<strong>Owner tab in Advance <a href="http://www.blogsdna.com/2159/how-to-take-ownership-grant-permissions-to-access-files-folder-in-windows-7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span><span>Security Settings </span></span></span></a>.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For User windows.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>6.</span></strong><span> Click on
<strong>Edit Button and select user</strong> from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group and click ok.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>8.</span></strong><span> Now select User/group and click apply and ok. (Check “Replace
 owner on subcontainers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>9.</span></strong><span> Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>10.</span></strong><span> Now Owner name must have changed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>11.</span></strong><span> Now click
<strong>Ok to exist from Properties</strong> windows.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Once you have
<strong>taken the ownership of file or folder</strong> next part comes is <strong>
Granting Permissions to that file/folder or object</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method<span>&nbsp;
</span>3</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can follow these steps, to give permission to files and folders:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span> Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership
 in windows explorer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>2.</span></strong><span> Right click on file or folder and select
<strong>“Properties”</strong> from Context Menu.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span> Click on
<strong>Edit button in Properties</strong> windows Click ok to <strong>confirm UAC elevation request</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>4.</span></strong><span> Select user/group from permission windows or click add to add
 other user or group.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>5.</span></strong><span> Now under Permission section check the rights which you want
 to grant i.e. check <strong>“Full Control”</strong> under the <strong>“Allow”</strong> column to
<strong>assign full access rights control permissions</strong> to Administrators group.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>6.</span></strong><span> Click
<strong>Ok for changes to take effect</strong> and click ok final ok to exit from Properties window.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Accidentalmente rasge mal mi c&#38;&#35;243&#59;digo de 2 d&#38;&#35;237&#59;as de xbox live gratis y de GOW 1 que venia con el GOW judgment</h2>
                    
<p>El problema es que cuando tome el codigo de regalo, intente rasgarlo para liberar las letras y poder canjearlo pero no pasaba nada, luego vi que al tomar de un extremo a otro este hacia que pudiese ver el codigo, pero era demaciado lento y dificil. Luego
 vi que habia debajo de eso como un plastico, pense que era para liberar el codigo de una vez, pero este se rompio y de lo roto solo encontre unas cuantas palabras pero no todas. Si alguien me podria decir como recuperarlo se lo agredecerias mucho.</p>
