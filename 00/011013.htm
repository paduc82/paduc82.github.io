    <title>Nokia 6102i PC SUITE not recognizing phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 6102i PC SUITE not recognizing phone</h2>
                    I opened the latest version of PC SUITE and clicked "Get Connected". I went through the wizard till I got to the part that said now connect your cable to the computer than to your phone. It has been on that page for 15 minutes. When I don't use PC SUITE
 the computer doesn't recognize it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            What type of connection are you trying to get ? With cable ? Is it Nokia original or unofficial ? Did you get separate drivers with the cable ?

            I just installed PCS for my 6102, and it worked fine...that is, the NEW version worked fine. Here's what I did:<br />
<br />
I unplugged the phone from the USB cable before I installed the program (ver. 6.8).<br />
<br />
I restarted the pc, then plugged my phone back in. The app came up automatically, and found my phone.<br />
<br />
That's it...hope that helped.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
1. Open Windows Device Manager (you can find it from: Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Device Manager)<br />
2. Open Modems and Ports<br />
3. Connect your phone<br />
-&gt; What change you can see in Device Manager (and is there any conflict)?

            I can be mistaken, but both the 6101 and 6103 are only able to connect with a CA-42 cable, so I assume that the 6102i will also only be compatible with a CA-42 cable.

            I have a 6102i and cannot connect to PC Suite. My internet connection is broadband and I have NO Modems/Ports selection in Control Panel.<br />
<br />
I have tried every connection, and sequence possible and I get nothing after the Get Connected, plug in cable and phone. I have tried it dozens of times.
<br />
<br />
I only have one Com Port to choose from COM 1. I still have an error in Device Manager "USB Serial Controller" has an asterik. I have downloaded the driver and tried installing it about 20 times, it doesn't work, period. Now what?<br />
<br />
I have verified over and over again that the 6102i uses the CA-42. Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me.

            You have my sympaathy, but some encouragement ..--&gt;<br />
since I have suffered similar issues with a 6021<br />
<br />
I feel that this softwrae is not too good to be honest.<br />
I have just installed <br />
NPCS 6.81.13, <br />
run XPPro 2002 SP2, <br />
&amp; use the CA42 USB(?) cable.<br />
Also ran PC suite cleaner in attempt to remove all traces of the previous version, before loading 6.81.13<br />
<br />
Now, on reboot with the phone connected, i get a new hardware found message, looking for a -<br />
PCI simple communications Controller, Windows can't install it, so presumably its part/consequence of the NPCS install but I can't see where to find the relevant software on the Nokia site, and given I installed as instructed by the software, find it a bit
 bemusing! <br />
&gt;&gt; ANY help with this please?<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, an encouragement then - I do find that my PC does find the phone, but the occurence is random to say the least! I think there are several conditions that will facilitate the connection -<br />
Reboot PC, and give it a few mins to 'settle down' (3-5, make a coffee or something)<br />
Attached cable, BUT ensure Phone is active, no screen saver - front page offering menu, battery &amp; signal state<br />
<br />
<br />
I also spotted in other posts, similar issues with struggling to get the setup correct, not finding the phone today when it was found Ok yesterday, so maybe the software is just not up to the job?

            It is useless to point to the software when the CA-42 cables are non-original, "not clear who manufactured" thingies.<br />
<br />
CA-42 should include firmware inbedded in the cable to modify the phone (which communicates as serial port device) to PC USB port.<br />
It seems to me that many of the cables barely do the job. Simple solution is to get original Nokia CA-42 cable.

If you are responding to my post, it is the Nokia cable, everything (except my PC) is Nokia supplied.<br />

            Ditto on the problem, with me, too.<br />
Everything is in place, installed correctly, appro. cable, phone on, etc.<br />
My pc recognizes a usb/serial device but can't find the driver, and PC Suite tells me my phone is not connected.<br />
<br />
Basically, PC Suite is not seeing my 6102i.<br />
<br />
Please share any solutions, such as the tip about the Nokia cable v generic ones. (Not the solution in my case.)

<h2>            Lumia 640 xl video not saving if bigger than 10 seconds</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the default Microsoft Camera App. When I start recording a video, it shows the ghosted timer counting the seconds up. Then when I touch the stop icon on the screen, the recording stops but the video is not saved. By experimenting, I found that
 it saves videos if they are 9 seconds or less.</p>
<p>My software is up to date. I have tried switching the phone off. No change. What should I do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>Yes, I tried holding the down volume and off button to soft reset. No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The videos (less than 10 seconds) are saving to the SD card. I changed this to the Phone. No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed it yesterday when I tried to take some videos of my children's Sports Day. One of those precious events which you want to capture forever. One of those events that you never get the chance to capture again because the moment has passed. One of
 those events when you hope to be able to depend on technology that you paid a fortune for to be able to do the basics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no updates available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of your suggestions before I posted the query. I also looked at "a hard reset" but getting all my information off the phone before doing that looks like a nightmare. I read an this forum that the "Cloud" is not reliable for doing this, so I'm
 not going to risk losing contacts and vidoes using that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I could download some other Camera App from the store, but then I lose the fancy Lumia camera stuff that I paid for, and I think there must be a solution to this problem before I do that.</p>
<p>
Thanks for trying to help, please continue.</p>

<p>Just a wild guess as this sounds like a "limititation" placed&nbsp; when&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>using
</em>another APP also&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No doubt you have checked setting for the camera app</p>
<p>e.g&nbsp; MMS and or say other SNS app do they have a setting that&nbsp; limits the Video ???</p>

<p>Hi Phillip,</p>
<p>Thanks for getting involved, I'm at my wits end with this useless phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have the standard MMS and SMS features that came with the phone. I haven't changed any settings on these to my knowledge, and I have checked but can't find any setting which refers to the length of a video or a size limit. Do you know where this would
 be, if it exists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took your advice and downloaded the "Microsoft Lumia Camera&nbsp;App" Up until now, I have been using the "Microsoft Camera App" which came as standard. Sadly, I am getting the same results. Videos of 10 seconds or more are not saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to have to do a Hard Reset unless someone knows how to solve this specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe Ian Sal will come back on Monday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>............anyone else got any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read my response to your first answer, where I said "The videos (less than 10 seconds) are saving to the SD card. I changed this to the Phone. No change".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also now tried a different SD card, this makes no difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm surprised that I am not getting any sort of error message. It's as if the App "thinks" that it is saving the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? Should I move this question to another category, where different experts are reviewing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Anyone else got any suggestions?Thanks.</p>

            <p>iOS devices have a built-in Email app. &nbsp;You can create an account pointing to your Outlook.com mailbox in that app. &nbsp;I'll have to check again, but I believe you can find adding accounts under the general Settings icon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. &nbsp;Tap Settings, then "Mail, Contacts, Calendar", then "Add Account". &nbsp;Select either "Outlook.com" or "Hotmail". &nbsp;Enter your Outlook.com credentials. &nbsp;Tap Save. &nbsp;Remember that if you have two-step verification enabled, you'll need to generate an app password,
 if iOS doesn't ask for a code.</p>

            You are absolutely right. Office for Mac does not support RTL languages. There is no fix, no options. You just need to wait to see if RTL support is available in a future release.<br />

<h2>            OneDrive for Business shows error when I click on Open Folder</h2>
                    <p>Our company environment consists of OneDrive for Business clients installed on Win10 systems. Couple of users are complaining that their OneDrive client crashes when they click on "Open Folder" button on OneDrive client from the taskbar.</p>

<p>Hi DeepParikh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Do you mean <strong>Open your OneDrive-xxx folder</strong> works well on your computer but run into the issue on end users' computers?
</p>
<p>2. For those users who encounter the issue, does the issue occur after restarting OneDrive? I mean if it's a random issue or can be reproduced every time when user click
<strong>Open your OneDrive-xxx folder</strong> (after crashing, restart OneDrive, click the Open folder button, it crashes again).
</p>
<p>3. For the article mentioned in your thread, do you enable conditional access in Azure AD for your tenant?
</p>
<p>4. Are these computers domain joined? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Yes on my computer it works fine, on end users computer it run into issues</p>
<p>2. I've restarted onedrive , re-logged it, reset onedrive, re-install onedrive but issue still persists. I noticed onedrive on user system is automatically upgrading to higher version&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">18.151.0729.0001</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">3. Yes, one of the MS engineer suggested me to try
 this fix, but still issue persists</span></p>

<p>Hi Deep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my side, OneDrive version is 18.151.0729.0003. It can open the synced folder from sync client without problems. My understanding is that this issue seems to be more related to system level.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the result for the following options on one affected computer:</p>
<p>Option 1. Perform <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean boot </a>to see if there are some software conflicts. </p>
<p>Option 2. Use local admin account sign into that computer, set up sync with that user's account. Check if click Open OneDrive-xxx folder will cause crash. It let us know if the issue is related to corrupted user profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you mentioned the suggestion from MS engineer. Do you open a service request with Microsoft support? If yes, could you share with us the support ticket number in my
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a>? We want to check the status of this service request. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Password no longer requested in Windows 10</h2>
                    Years ago I protected my Outlook 2007 e-mail with a password to access it. It has always worked when opening the Outlook 2007 program until I installed Windows 10. What do I need to do to get the password working again in Windows 10? Anyone else had this
 problem?

<p>
</p><p>You'll need to clarify "protected my Outlook 2007 email with a password". There is no such thing as protecting Outlook itself via a password. There is the option to protect a PST file with a password (ignoring individual email account username &amp; password
 fields)</p>

            <p>It is my recollection that I protected a PST file with a password. In other words, Outlook 2007 was configured (Windows 7 Pro) to start with the Inbox as the displayed item. Since installing Windows 10, it still starts with the Inbox, but no longer requests
 the password to display the Inbox. Sorry if I wasn't clear in my original question!

<p>
</p><p>(Just for the record, I have a laptop which uses Office 2010. I have never been able to get that system to require a password before opening the program to display the Inbox. I protected the .pst file with a password, but it never seemed to work in the four
 years that I have been using it. I have noticed that MANY other users have the same complaint. The answer is always the same. Protect the .pst file with a password, but it doesn't make any difference.)<br />

</p><p>There is one important item when you password protect a PST file - the checkbox for "Save the Password in your Password List"</p>
<p>
</p><p>- if it's unchecked, Outlook will ask for the Password immediately when it launches every time. Theory being that other people have access to your computer so don't want to make the data accessible</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If it's checked - you will not be prompted for a password after the first time it's entered. Theory being you simply want to protect against someone else making a copy of the file and trying to access the data on another system.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 operating system no longer detected</h2>
                    <p>Old title: W10 operating system no longer detected</p>
<p>I have a fellow Insider with a problem.&nbsp; An attempted fix did not work and the Dell desktop is a paper weight now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC was in the upper tier on Insiders.&nbsp; However, it started to run real slow and it got to a point where it was basically unresponsive.&nbsp; The PC is W10 Home but being unresponsive, was limited as to what was available.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a W10 Home at 10285 in my stable so I used Media Creation Tool to download the ISO and make what I figure is a bootable USB.&nbsp; This USB kicked the PC back to life for a day or so but it again became real slow and then unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB will now start an install but in a few minutes it fails as if the hard drive cannot be found.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point in time, there seems to be 2 basic questions -</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Should this USB be a proper device to trigger a clean install?</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; What methods are available&nbsp; to gain access to an unresponsive hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no issue with loss of&nbsp; data on the hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; A format of the hard drive would not be an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Dell 8300 with i5 processor and came to life as a W8 and does not lack resources.&nbsp; The PC should have digital Entitlement having come over from W8.1 in the normal way.&nbsp;&nbsp; My HP fleet has&nbsp; the F9 key that will trigger a Recovery from BIOS.&nbsp; Not sure
 if the Dell BIOS has this same feature.&nbsp; The Legacy setting is at default of Disabled which should match the W8 platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a fellow Insider here that would really appreciate suggestions on how to get his sole PC up and running again.</p>

            1. 10285 is what mel sent me. Basically what happens is that it just says unable to install after a few minutes of trying. So when I tried to delete or format a partition from the installation segment it says unable to delete or format... So yesterday
 evening I tried it in command prompt Ann it just hangs there trying to delete and I continuously get 0% completed so I'm really not sure why or what is going on. Thank you for your time and help gentlemen

<p>Yes, as Lee has just stated, this PC was at the latest Fast Build release when things went sour.&nbsp; Based on a dead PC with no other PC available to Lee, I mailed off a bootable USB.&nbsp; In my stable, I had a Pro and an Enterprise at latest Build on Insiders
 and W10 Home at public build.&nbsp; In order to match Lee's Home edition, I used the Media Creation Tool with my W10 Home to get the latest public release which is 10285.&nbsp; I told the Media Creation Tool to prepare an USB which is supposed to be bootable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Lee's PC accepted the USB and his PC most likely has 10285 Home now installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC worked for a day or so with this install.&nbsp; This is the O/S that now fails on another Clean Install attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lee's PC should have Digital Entitlement.&nbsp; I think the main issue now is to just get this PC going.&nbsp; There is no concern about data loss and there should be no concern about activation.&nbsp; The next major step for this PC could be a new hard drive but no way
 of knowing if it is a hard drive issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to format this hard drive using BIOS?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any other way to format or verify this hard drive without access to an operating system.&nbsp; This is a Dell PC.&nbsp; On my HP, I can get into a pretty heavy diagnostic routine on the major components
 of the HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All suggestions appreciated by Lee and me.</p>

<p>No, I'm on the Fast Ring build 14316.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that I have a list of all the Insider releases.</p>
<p>We went from 10240 (the RTM build released to the public)</p>
<p>to 10525.</p>
<p>There was never a 10285 Insider build released to the Insiders.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a leaked build.&nbsp;<br />

            Okay well I'm not sure what build it exactly it is I'm just going off of what you said and I believe that's what it was cuz it sounds familiar... Doesn't mean it's entirely accurate could be missing a digit or off a digit but regardless it's pointless
 it is on the bill that came out last week or the week before

<p>Anthony, thank you for your reply. Unfortunately, the solutions do not apply. I had hopes when I saw "<span>You frequently change recurring meetings." as a scenario in the second one. However, all the solutions apply to someone sending
 appointments to attendees and the problems that occur with changes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My problem has something to do with the how the recurrence populates the calendar during a sync. Even though I delete the occurrence on both my desktop and phone, it's back on both calendars after syncing. Something about the
 sync tells it to follow the original instructions for the recurring appointments and it ignores deletions. As I said, it works if I just change the day or time of an occurrence. I just can't delete one...</span><br />

            I'm not really sure how a screenshot is helpful here?? First, will be the calendar without an appointment on it and next the appointment is there after syncing with no clue or information about what happened. Everything that is happening here is hidden,
 "behind the scenes". Again, I believe it has something to do with how/what sync views at the "master" instruction. A similar thing happens if I go onto the desktop calendar and change the end date or number of recurrences for a recurring appointment. Changing
 it on the desktop will cause it to "go back" a change any previously modified dates or times - as though you were imputing the recurring appointment for the first time. However, I figured out for this situation, if I instead, change the recurrence on my iPhone,
 is presents me with the option to choose "save for future events" and it doesn't make any change to past events. I've not found a similar fix to this problem.<br />

<p>Still no helpful answer to my problem. I'm not working with a corporate server so there is no server to delete from. My problem is occurring somewhere in the sync process of Outlook on a desktop with iTunes and the iPhone. I don't have knowledge of the inner
 workings of that process and think that it will require someone who does to solve it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that if a single appointment, within the recurring appointment series, is cancelled on both the iPhone calendar and the Outlook calendar, the change should be recognized/retained. As I said, if instead of deleting an appointment, I just change the
 day or time, there is no problem - that works - when I sync the change is retained. But delete an appointment and sync, it is back on the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I'm just adding "cancelled" to the text of the appointments that I want to delete. Definitely not the ideal solution but at least appointments that weren't kept aren't being added back to my calendar creating a nightmare for me if I have
 to look back a couple of months to see if an appointment actually took place.<br />

<h2>            Access returns &#35;FUNC&#33; and IsError won&#39;t trap it</h2>
                    <div>I am trying to trap an error in Access 2010 that returns "#func!". It is the MID() function that is causing it. My formula is:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mid([tblItem Master]![szSKU],InStr(1,[tblItem Master]![szSKU],"-",1)-1,1)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If the "-" doesn't exist, InStr returns zero, and that throws the MID function into a tizzy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am ok with returning an error, but IsError() doesn't see #Func! as an error, it just lets it pass.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really don't want to see if InStr returns a zero first and wrap that in an if statement because the forumula above is actually a part of a much larger function and an wrapping the thing in an iif() statement makes it way too long - as the above function
 is repeated in the large formula with minor tweaks to the other variables.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to trap #func!?</div>

            Yeah, that is that whole <i>"</i><i>I really don't want to see if InStr returns a zero first and wrap that in an if statement"</i> thing because the above function is a fraction of the overall statement and has to be repeated several times.

            <p>What do you WANT this to return if there is no hyphen? One option would be to tack a hyphen on to the Instr so the error doesn't arise:</p>
<div>Mid([tblItem Master]![szSKU],InStr(1,[tblItem Master]![szSKU] &amp; "-","-",1)-1,1)</div>

            The lack of a hyphen is meaningful in that I want to exclude it from the results. Basically, I am only interested in results that have a letter before the hyphen. No hyphen or a number before the hyphen get excluded. Because I am running these other tests,
 having to test for a hyphen is a bit of a pain. I was originally happy it threw the error thinking iserror() would recognize it and allow me to exclude it. Iserror(#func!) though just returns #func!.

            <p>When things start to get long and potentially complicated I like to write a vb function that behaves exactly how I like.</p>
<p>Here's an example that's based on what I think you're after:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Function ExtractLetter(Param1 As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Param2 As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RtnLetter As String) As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
On Error GoTo ErrHdlr</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RtnLetter = Mid(Param1, InStr(1, Param2, "-", 1) - 1, 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExtractLetter = True</p>
<p>Exit Function</p>
<p>ErrHdlr:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExrtractLetter = False<br />
End Function</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND here's a little test&nbsp;routine to show it works:-</p>
<p>Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Dim MyLet As String</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ExtractLetter("1234", "1-2", MyLet) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Extracted: " &amp; MyLet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Invalid call to ExtractLetter"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you remove the - from "1-2"&nbsp;ExtractLetter returns FALSE and the test prints "Invalid call to ExtractLetter"&nbsp;otherwise it just&nbsp;reports the letter it extracted.&nbsp;HTH</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks JohnMartin. I already had written another custom function because i needed to count letters in the item number as well, as the number of letters is meaningful. I will do the same here.
<div><br />
<div>I guess I am just surprised Access gives you no way to trap #func! as an error. I think this is the first error in Excel or Access I've had that IsError() totally ignores, and I figured I must be doing something wrong.</div>

 really need it so bad.

            <p>All three paid-for consumer editions of Office 2010 (and for that matter, all other special customer and volume licensing editions of&nbsp;Office 2010) come with PowerPoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only edition of Office 2010 without PowerPoint is Office Starter 2010, and that is not a "paid-for" product per se, in the sense that the consumer does not buy the product at retail, rather, it is installed by the computer manufacturer.&nbsp; (And FYI Microsoft
 recently discontinued Office Starter 2010.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that leaves us confused, as you stated that your&nbsp;"...installed or purchased.."&nbsp;edition of Office 2010 does not have PowerPoint.&nbsp; Best guess at this point is that you just bought a new computer, you clicked on the Microsoft Office 2010 entry in the Start
 Menu, and when the Office 2010 dialog came up that gives you these choices...</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I already purchased Office 2010</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Go online to purchase Office 2010</p>

<p>Then when there was no PowerPoint, you tried again and chose #1.&nbsp; "And when I try to enter the product key, it stated that it's not valid......" means that in desperation, you entered the product key on the Windows Certificate Of Authenticity (CoA) on the
 bottom (or side if a desktop) of the computer.</p>
<p>The product key on the Windows CoA is for Windows, not Office. It will NOT activate Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to have PowerPoint you must purchase a license to use it from Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft prices individual stand-alone Office programs at about the same price as it charges for Office Home and Student 2010 which has Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote,
 so if your usage of Office will NOT be for commercial or nonprofit purposes then it would be more economical to buy Office H&amp;S 2010, either in the 1-PC license form (cheapest) or the 3-PC license form.&nbsp;

    <title>Having very similar problems with Outlook attachments - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having very similar problems  with Outlook attachments</h2>
                    <p><span>I am having the same or somewhat the same problem.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>I had outlook 2003 and office 2007. I've upgraded to Office 2016 about 2 weeks ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I sent an email the in March 2015 with a word&nbsp;attachment to someone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I needed to open that attached word doc, do an edit and save. Than send a new email with the new saved word doc attached send.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The problem I have is I cannot open any word doc attachment in outlook on my computer with Outlook 2016. But any word attachment I've sent in outlook 2003 seems to have issues
 opening.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When I go to open the attachment this is what happens:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It comes back with a box that states Sorry, something went wrong and Word was unable to start (22). I press the OK button and it opens to read:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This error message can appear for several reasons.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The document may be corrupt or damaged. Use either the
</span><strong><span><span>Recover Text</span></span></strong><span> converter or the
</span><strong><span><span>Open and Repair</span></span></strong><span> feature. Both are available from the
</span><strong><span><span>Open</span></span></strong><span> dialog.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have the same problem with an old excel.xls file from 4\9\12 I had attached and sent. Newer emails in 2003 with Excel seemed to work????</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now this is where it gets more crazy. I tried a PowerPoint as a pps attachment in an old sent email and the popup asked what program I want to open this .pps in. I selected the
 PowerPoint icon and it says “Sorry, PowerPoint can’t read C: Users\bla bla\Naturial_Word.pps why?</span></span></p>

            <p>
</p><p><span>You help was somewhat helpful but I need more. I now have Windows 10 and Office 2016 Home &amp; Biz, below is a picture of an attached word doc I sent out on 3/23/15 with Outlook 2003 and Word
 2007. Since File Explore does not work in Windows 10 in is another problem.&nbsp;I needed to find this file. I remembered I sent it as an email&nbsp;attachment so&nbsp;I searched in Outlook 2016&nbsp;found the email and attachment and selected open. A windows pops up with the
 second picture below. Why will it not open in Word 2016?!</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I tried a combination of your solutions. Because I have not uninstalled Office 2007 yet I opened Word 2007 and tried the attachment in the email again. 1st try it didn't work. I tried a few
 more way to open it in outlook 2016&nbsp;and had no success.&nbsp;I had left&nbsp;word 2007 open and on the&nbsp;2nd try of selecting the down arrow\open the document opened in word 2007.&nbsp; Yahoo it worked.
<strong><span>Well not really I purchase Office 2016 with word 2016 and I want to delete office 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>If I do&nbsp;uninstall office 2007&nbsp;it seems like I can't get to my old files (attached)&nbsp;created in&nbsp;Office&nbsp;2007
 of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to open up and work in office 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>
You</strong> <strong><span>need to give me a better fix because keeping office 2007 in somewhat redundant and if I should keep it to open old attachments then why do I need Office 2016?</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looking for a better fix please!</span></p>

            If you are trying to access data that is on another drive that was from an old PC, and the libraries were located in the default locations, you would have to take ownership of those locations before you could access those files<br />

            <p>The problem you are encountering may be related to a graphics issue. (I know, they sound totally unrelated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are still experiencing this problem, to workaround this issue you can temporarily disable hardware acceleration in Word:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Boot Word</li><li>on the File menu, choose Options, Advanced</li><li>go to the Display section and check "Disable hardware graphics acceleration"&nbsp;
</li><li>Shutdown and start Word again and (hopefully) this problem should go away.</li></ul>
<p>The underlying cause will be fixed shortly (or may already be fixed on your machine), so only do these steps if you have to to avoid the problem you were reporting. (Disabling hardware acceleration will probably noticeably slow down some operations in the
 Office products).</p>

            <p><span>Hi Doug,</span></p>
<p><span>That worked perfectly in Word. Thank you.
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Although once I checked the Unblock box that area disappeared from that window. I could not go back it appears to uncheck Unblock.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you noticed, I had the same problem with Excel. I did the same per your instruction and the Excel document will not open. Actually doing a check mark to Unblock and then opened the Excel file messed
 with the Excel program to the point where the whole top of Excel ribbons or tabs were missing. I had to go to my task manager to exit out of Excel because it had no selection buttons of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span>This presented another question how can I go back and do an uncheck to Unblock since it disappeared once I selected Unblock? I could not find the selection in any of the buttons or tabs. I figured
 I would set Excel back to the way it was since it would not open the attached doc in Outlook and messed with Excel big time.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone have additional suggestions for my original problem for Outlook attachments that are Excel and will not open. Plus, how to I reverse and uncheck Unblock in Excel since that selection disappeared?</span></p>

</p><p>Make sure that the status is online showing the green circle on his/her profile before making a call. You can also try sign out and sign in back and try to make a test call again. If you can capture any error message that would also help us isolating this
 case. Let me know any updates. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Onenote importer does not organise by notebook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erkko autio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onenote importer does not organise by notebook</h2>
                    <p>When I try to import my notes from EverNote, the OneNote Importer says: "We could not find your Evernote notes." Even though they exist in C:\User\*username*\Evernote. So, I follow the option: "Alternatively, you can select an exported Evernote file (.enex)".
 I go to Evernote and select all notebooks. Then I export. Then I choose the file in OneNote Importer. Then I wait for one hour. Then the transfer is complete. Then I open it in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: I get about 1 000 notes, organised under tabs: "1-100", "101-200", "201-300" and so on. That is, they are NOT organised in notebooks. Very useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course OneNote Importer does not allow me to tell it where it could find my Evernote notes, stupid enough as it is not to be able to find it on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How difficult can it be to design software products that actually work?</p>

            <p>I have about 15 notebooks in Evernote. I try to import them to OneNote 2016 (Win 10) using OneNote Importer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, ONI does NOT find my Evernote notebooks on my computer, although they are in C:\Users\*me*\Evernote\Databases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it tells me to select an exported Evernote file (.enex).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select all my Evernote notebooks and press export. I make sure all my notes are indeed transferred to the .enex file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose the .enex file in ONI and press Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A sign in with my work account (or Personal, does not make a difference).</p>
<p>
</p><p>ONI tells me: "Here's how your content will be organised in OneNote... ...Notebooks to notebooks... ...pages to pages..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I press Import and wait for one hour for the notes to be imported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then open them in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what? There is only one big notebook containing some 1 000 notes. No "Notebooks to notebooks". Simply one big notebook with 1 000 notes, "helpfully" organised in tabs: "1-100", "101-200" etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very unhelpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In ONI there is the option to "Use Evernote tags to organise content in OneNote". This does indeed organise by tags. But no notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line. This software is useless. </p>

<p>Hi Erkko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, organizing notebooks in OneNote has to be done manually, since the Organizer feature has not yet been designed for OneNote. Adding this feature in the application is a great idea. Of course, we don't want this idea to go to waste. As such, we
 strongly believe that this needs to be heard in our <a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know. </p>

<p>My printer HP 1050 J410 worked fine &nbsp;with windows10. Now after disconnecting it from the PC several times the system changed to another pre-defined printer (Bullzip and after the windows printer). I was able to change again to the HP printer but the system
 changed it again.</p>
<p>I reinstalled all the software without any result.</p>
<p>Now it is giving me the information that the PC is not connected to the printer what is not true. Changed cable and USB plug.</p>

    <title>After June 2014 Update, Xbox Video no longer accepts PlayTo requests - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> monroe  say:</h3>
<h2>            After June 2014 Update, Xbox Video no longer accepts PlayTo requests from 8.1 desktop</h2>
                    <p>I used to stream video to my Xbox one from my Windows 8.1 desktop by right clicking on a video file in Windows Explorer, then choosing Play To -&gt; XBOX.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the June 2014 update of my Xbox One, this no longer works.&nbsp; The PlayTo application launches, and eventually reports an error code 0xc00d0013 ("Device did not respond").&nbsp; The Xbox video app on the Xbox never starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny thing is that everything works as expected for audio files.<br />
<br />
Also, things work as expected if I use the Metro Video app to perform the Play To (using the Devices charm).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried many many things without resolving the problem.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstalling and reinstalling the Xbox video app</li><li>Changing networks</li><li>Removing and adding the Xbox device on my desktop PC.</li><li>Disabling and enabling PlayTo streaming in Xbox Settings =&gt; Preferences</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Media Player via the "Add or Remove Windows features" control panel applet.</li><li>Stopping and starting WMPNetworkSvc</li><li>Killing the MDEServer.exe (Play To Server) process.</li><li>Disabling IPv6 on my network adapter.</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling my network adapter.</li><li>Hard power cycled the Xbox.</li><li>Trying different video formats: .AVI, .WMV, .MP4</li><li>Sacrificing a goat.&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Just kidding... no goats were seriously harmed while troubleshooting this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that audio files work as expected leads me to believe that the network connection is fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact&nbsp;that video streamed from the Metro video app works fine leads me to believe that something has changed with respect to how the WMP-based PlayTo application on the desktop interacts with the Xbox Video application on the Xbox after the June 2014
 update.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing else has changed on my system or network since video streaming was last working before or after the June 2014 update was applied, except for any&nbsp;patches applied by&nbsp;Windows Update to my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this problem?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox Video Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely appreciate all the details you've provided so far.&nbsp; There's one thing I'd like you to look at, which can cause similar problems to this.&nbsp; Open up Control Panel, and head to this location:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel -&gt; Network and Internet -&gt; Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Advanced sharing settings -&gt; All Networks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what changes you may have already made here previously, you'll want to try changing around some of the sharing and streaming options found there.&nbsp; Specifically, make sure Media Streaming is actually turned on, and you may need to toggle Public
 Folder Sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if any of this makes a difference!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Kevin J S</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yup, Media Streaming is on, and I've turned on Public Folder Sharing.&nbsp; Still no luck.&nbsp; Audio streaming works just fine, so I don't think the network/streaming settings are wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that I can think of that changed is the Xbox June update, and any Windows Updates that may have been applied since this was working a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Thank you for checking.&nbsp; I haven't been able to duplicate this here, so I'm wondering if something just didn't update correctly for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to try would be to reinstall the Xbox Video app on your console.&nbsp; To do this, from the dashboard with the Xbox Video tile highlighted, press the Menu button (the one with the 3 lines on it).&nbsp; Select Manage App, and it'll show some details about
 it.&nbsp; With the big green square highlighted, press Menu&nbsp;again and then select Uninstall.&nbsp; Once uninstalled, we want to clear the system cache.&nbsp; This can most easily be done by powering off the console, and then unplugging the power cable from the back for 30
 seconds.&nbsp; Then plug it back in and get signed back on.&nbsp; While the console is off, restart your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's functioning from within the app but not from within file explorer, if those steps don't fix the issue we'd want to have you get in touch with Windows support.&nbsp; The also have forums here on the Microsoft Community, or you can try contacting their
 live support.</p>

            <p>Having the exact same problem, also since the June 2014 update. No settings have been changed in this time and I have tried streaming from different devices. This is becoming frustrating, especially since I still can't plug in an external hard drive to play
 content. Has there been a solution to this problem yet?? Un-installing and then re-installing isn't working and is starting to become tedious. Considering the xbox one was supposed to be taking over our living rooms, the ability to play videos should surely
 be a top priority.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried streaming through the "play to" function and also on a Linux machine, both of which worked without any problems before updating the xbox one in June</p>

            <p>Since this seems to be happening to more than one person, I'd like to get a bit more information so we can look into this further for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you installed all Windows updates on your PC?</li><li>Does this work through the Xbox Video app on the PC?</li><li>Are the PC and Xbox One on wireless or wired connection?</li><li>What country are you in?</li><li>Is the content on the primary harddrive or an external drive?</li></ul>
<p>Please keep in touch!</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Yes all updates installed on Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Play To&nbsp;&nbsp;works through the Xbox Video App on the PC, just not WMP-based Play To.&nbsp; Please note that music playback DOES work through the WMP-based PlayTo; just not video.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem its likely not the network configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Wireless connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5Ghz band.&nbsp;&nbsp; Netflix streams in SuperHD format to the Xbox without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Canada</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Content is on an internal SSD HD mounted in the computer case and plugged into a SATA port on the motherboard.&nbsp; All Intel SSD Toolbox and SMART diagnostics are clean for the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This feels like there is a protocol / video format negotiation failure occurring.&nbsp; I'm not aware of any recent changes in the WMP-based PlayTo backend, so I am assuming that the issue is with the DLNA/PlayTo dispatching/negotiation on the Xbox/Xbox Video
 app.&nbsp; Since the Xbox video app doesn't even start up when I try to initiate the session, I'm inclined to think that the dispatch mechanism that would otherwise start the video app and hand off the socket connection to continue the format negotiation is broken
 somehow in my configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-M</p>

<h3> goldfinger100  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing an exclusion</h2>
                    <p>How do I delete an exclusion that was added to see if it fixed a problem?? I find how to add an exclusion, but nothing on howm to delete an exclusion that is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Never mind. I just found it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You just click on the exclusion and remove button will pop up. Click the remove button and a confirmation screen will come up, click it and the exclusion will be removed.</p>
