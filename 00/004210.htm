<h2>            Windows Phone App on Mac &#40;running Yosemite&#41;, does not recognize Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>My mum gave my son her old Nokia 610 and I'm having problems syncing it to my Mac. &nbsp;I've previously synced it (when it was my mother's phone) but when I try now, I connect the phone, a very quick bar completed as if the app is in the process of recognising
 the phone, and then nothing. &nbsp;The phone doesn't appear in the &nbsp;navigation pane of the app.</p>
<p>The only thing different to before is the update on the Mac from Mavericks to the Yosemite Operating System.\</p>
<p>I've tried deleting and reinstalling the App, but it makes no difference,</p>
<p>Any advice or ideas would be very welcome.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            Since it doesn't seem like Microsoft will be updating their app soon, I have created a fix myself. I hope it will work for others, too. You can find more information here:<br />

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Word Online will automatically set the default file name to document(document1, document2, etc..) and save it to OneDrive for Business library when you create a new Word file in Word Online. With auto save feature, any changes you made will also be saved
 automatically. There is no need to manually go to File &gt; Save As to save a copy(Doc1 as in your scenerio) to OneDrive for Business again.</p>
<p>Let us know if there is any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<h2>            How to see the market place in English&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason the market place is localized (most likely based on IP address - since OS &amp; Browser Settings are en-us&nbsp;) and I couldn't find away to change the language back to English. When traveling to other countries, the language should not be changed
 based on the IP address, since the whole page does not make any sense otherwise.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to choose the language used for market place?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answers advance.</p>

            I'm having the same problem, phone is all english and be-nl settings, I'm in the flemish part of the country and my provider is flemish only, there is no way to mistake anything about my phone as being french, neither software or IP adres, yet it persists
 giving me both app and descriptions of apps in french.<br />
<br />
If it would at least default to english I wouldn't have a problem with it, but french? I'm fluent in the language, but if you know any of the situation over here, you'll know that there is one thing everyone in this nation gets pissed about and thats getting
 the other sides language shoved in their face in places where the other language has no business.

            Currently there is no&nbsp;direct way to change the Marketplace website between different languages. Site localization is determined through a variety of methods which include reverse IP lookup, browser/OS language settings, and/or the Live ID and the registered
 billing address (if signed-in).<br />
<br />
One method you can try would be to change the browser language (which you indicate you have done), clear all cookies, restart and go to the Marketplace site. This should override the market detection logic.<br />
<br />
When Marketplace rolls out online shopping via the Marketplace website (Coming Soon). There will be a language/locale selector on the site which provides the functionality you are requesting.

            Well, I can tell you here and now the detection logic is flawed, seriously flawed.<br />
<br />
Like I said, there is no possible way to detect my phone or location as french, other then generalizing belgium as french.<br />
<br />
Belgium is 60% dutch, 30% french and 10% other (german, english, ...) speaking.<br />
<br />
Defaulting to french for all of belgium is unacceptable. At least set it to default to English untill the time comes that we can choose the language ourselves.<br />
<br />
I utterly hate apple and thing Google phones and appstore are just like everything google is, perpetual beta, which is really fun for ITers like me, but unacceptable for reliable business tools.<br />
<br />
But if this is the way Microsoft launces their marketplace for mobile, with 3 major showstopping errors, there's no way I'll let any of the 40 WinMo users in my company use the marketplace for anything for a long long time.<br />
<br />
Error 1: Defaulting to languages that are completely wrong.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I would love to see you guys put Spanish on US Phones by accident, you'd have riots on MS HQ's doorstep, but hey, lil ol belgium doesn't count anyway does it<br />
<br />
Error 2: Can't install apps where you want.<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
WinMo devices are typical to having very small internal storage capabilities with SD extensibility, installing to internal by default is just a big nono, most of the internal storage is needed for basic operations of the WinMo phones, like for instance caching
 email attachements when opening them. We deal with large PDF's and ETS/KNX projects and on average, only one of those projects can be stored on an average WinMo phone's internal storage.<br />
<br />
Error 3: Marketplace should have been launched with primarily the professional world in mind.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Letting that be its main drive and then later also cattering to consumers. Microsoft has always delivered quality products which are prefered by the bussines world and with that seep trough to employers/consumers, because they are used to work with the apps
 and technology at work and school.<br />
<br />
You can enrol WinMO phones into an ADC domain but can't really do anything usefull with that function. Nothing a reset of the phone can't undo in a heartbeat that is.<br />
Adding Marketplace functionality to SMS, RIS or as another package altogether, allowing bussines to enrol WinMO Phones in the domain and managing both the buying and installation of the softwares to the phones trough Marketplace and launching it like that primarily
 would've been the smart way to go imho.<br />
<br />
It would've rooted the use of WinMO in Business Microsoft environments giving it all the time and cash it needed to mature into having use for consumers and fart app developers.<br />
<br />
Thats my 2 cents on the subject.

I mistakenly thought your initial post was asking about modifying the display language of the Marketplace website rather than the Marketplace phone client. While the information posted about the website is correct, it will not address the problem that you and
 TheMaTrix are experiencing on your phones. <br />
<br />
I have passed on a description of the problem and the Marketplace team is investigating. I will get back with more information shortly.</p>

            Thank you Ronn, hope they fix it soon.
<div><br />
<div>Also, I can understand Microsoft is probably wanting to get into Google's vibe of releasing Beta online apps and letting them mature, but Google has it rooted into the very core of the firm to be like that and alot of the apps like Google Earth and Gmail
 are actually bought technologies that already had a&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;stable and full featured product to bring.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If MS wants to go that route with certain apps, be carefull which ones to release like that.</div>
<div>Guys like me, who spend ample time on XDA-Developers and just for fun buy licenses for an OS to upgrade a device like my HTC Touch HD, while it ruins any warranty on the device.</div>
<div>But most consumers will never flash or reset their phone, and are scared&nbsp;senseless of the thought of installing software on their phone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So you really have to go the Apple route to make this Marketplace concept&nbsp;successful if you won't use the tried and true MS Release method of releasing in Professional environment and then letting the technology seep into the consumer markets.</div>
<div>To do it like apple, you really do have to see your mainline customers are complete idiots that can't do anything themselves (but don't do the same as apple by treating them that way also :p) your app and technology doesn't need to be fast or all that
 stable, but fixing a problem with it should be just a restart of the phone away.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another thing you really don't have to go and do like apple is allowing the marketplace to be flooded with Fart Apps and the likes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Asif the general Apple consumer isn't retarded enough, they arm them with worthless apps that annoy the ____ out of everyone after the 2nd time you hear it used.</div>
<div>Not to mention there are a couple thousand other shitty apps with even less functionality.</div>

            Hi,<br />
sorry for not following up the conversion immediately - " mistakenly thought your initial post was asking about modifying the display language of the Marketplace website rather than the Marketplace phone client." - actually the first post was for the actual
 web site, haven't tested the phone client.<br />
<br />
I have en-us OS + Browser settings are en-us... but I'm not getting the marketplace website page in English.
<br />
<br />
"Registered billing address" - well - invoice address has nothing to do with the language I understand.<br />
<br />
"There will be a language/locale selector on the site which provides the functionality you are requesting." - this settles it. At that time, I'm able to understand what's on the page. Thanks for support - I'll be waiting for the language/locale selector.

<p>Again, I agree with the Matrix. Associating languages to places is a nonsense. People travel, they want a service taylored for their use, not the other persons in the neighbourhood. I do not want anybody to decide for me that if I live here, then I must
 be speaking this language. Europe, but probably the entire world is far too complex to simplify like this.
<br />
<br />
It is not even about special (and to often misplaced) sensitivities of Belgium, is about being global, rather than feudal.<br />
<br />
Allow anyone to chose his language, at least in the free space of Internet.</p>

Network status</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And I can't read it. I can view it only by clicking reply or forward. I also don't know if I get new emails. When I checked the network status it says Ok, but I doubt it. Does anyone know why this is happening and how to fix
 this? I registered an account with outlook, because I loved what I saw on youtube ... and now this problems the first and second day...</span></p>
<p><span>Please help.</span></p>

            The solution given here is a red herring. It's making out that this is a user problem and a stock answer for many problems.
<div>But I do all these on a regular basis and I also have the same problem but this meesage occurs at differnt times,</div>
<div>What I also find is that I get the message when I click SEND but the email does go as on my club email list I also am a recipient and on receiving the message, I click send again and get told Outlook cannot complete this request multiple times, but then
 it promptly goes and completes it and I've sent the same email out 3 or 4 times.</div>
<div>It's happened a couple of times on me so now I send, and when I get the message I just wait and see if the email comes in to my inbox, which it does.</div>
<div>So MS, please don't always ask us to do some jiggery pokery to try and fix problems that are most likely down to your system and software.</div>

                    I've seen something that says to launch Skype then to go into Tools then Options, but I don't have that on the version I've got, it only seem to have Settings and I can't find anything in there about turning it off.&nbsp; I'm on Skype version 12.1807.264.0

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Skype UWP does not have an option for the app to automatically launch. As there’s no option for the Skype for Windows 10 UWP to be on the start-up or
 never been present in the Startup tab. Windows apps are not managed the same way as a Win32 application. The classic Skype for Windows Desktop is a Win32 application, Skype UWP is not. If you close your computer without signing out of the Skype UWP application,
 then on next computer boot, Skype will auto run in the background.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure that you sign out on the app and close the app properly. Try to sign out and reset Skype UWP and check on it again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To reset Skype UWP:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Open the Start menu and click Settings.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click Apps &amp; Features.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Locate and click Skype from the Applications list.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click Advanced option.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select Reset.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title>Calls cutting in and out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calls cutting in and out</h2>
                    <p>I use skype 7.40 on win10. I've been doing so for years. I'm a paying customer with a skype phone number.</p>
<p>Recently, my calls started cutting in and out. During the call there will be multiple times when nobody hears me and I don't hear them. The interruptions are only a few seconds long but it's making it impossible to talk to anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I followed previously mentioned instructions for re-installation in great detail with no avail. I don't understand what's going on.</p>

<p>I'm not having any issues connecting to skype. I'm not having issues sending chats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is on OUTGOING calls only to phone numbers. When I get an inbound call there is absolutely no issue. I have tested the same phone numbers with Hangouts and Google Voice and on outbound calls I get absolutely no problems with those services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is not my connection at all, it's definitely Skype. I'm going to try and turn off my skype phone number caller ID and see if it's an issue with that. I'll report back.</p>

            Cant remember if 6680 lets you do this but other symbian 60 handsets do/did...<br />
Nokia phones receive items via bluetooth into the messaging inbox so you need to go into message settings and change the messaging memory from phone to memory card.

<h2>            I don&#39;t want to change my password&#33;</h2>
                    I don't want to change my password!
<div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an account from school and when I loggin, it made me change my password, saying that it had expired or it was the first time entering (witch is not the case) but the thing is, I DON'T want to change the password, ever! I don't have the memory
 for that and I get that changing the password is more secure, but you just can't force everybody to chage it all the time, literally... And it's been kinda a pain for me, let me have that kind of flexibility to choose if I want to change or keep it... I had
 to install the authenticator app to just stop asking me security questions and it's still stupid to have that app... anyway, I don't want to change the password and I can't enter my account, don't say to click windows + r and type things because I already
 did and It did not work, or just say that it's for security because this is a bit too much, just simply just let me keep my old password. Every month I have to keep with this problem, every time I loggin there's always a problem or something and I'm sick of
 it. I want to loggin to be able to download word to do some work and I can't because it's forcing me to change my password, thanks a lot microsoft and your security!</p>

    <title>Word Quick Parts doesn&#39;t work properly in SharePoint Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mohammad al sammarrai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Quick Parts doesn&#39;t work properly in SharePoint Online</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are trying to use a Word Quick Parts to view the&nbsp;<strong>Start Date </strong>
document property in a template file within a document set, but the date/time that is displayed, when viewing the document in Word Online, is one day off. However, when viewing the document in Word Desktop, it shows the correct time/date. We checked SharePoint
 Online server time and it was correct, yet, in Word Online the quick parts doesn't display the date/time correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, some other quick parts don't work properly as well, we have a committee dropdown&nbsp;field where the editor could select a committee among the available ones, but the quick part that is linked to that field shows the first committee in the list
 regardless of what committee have been chosen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know what is the workaround for these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

1.Which part of the Quick Part function did you use?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed the "Word only" requirement, and it's no issue to us that it's only possible to insert or edit them in Word, the issue is that when viewing in word online, it shows the property, but the value is changed (e.g. if it's a drop down list property,
 word online will show the first option in the list, regardless of what value the property is set to). This makes the entire feature useless, because people will see a different value depending on how they view the file. Again, it's not an issue having to use
 Word to modify these properties, but Word online should at least display the correct value, rather than an incorrect one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing the sample file with us through the private message.</p>
<p>After doing test with it, the committee filed display correctly on my side. So, to move forward, I’d like to confirm the following:<br />
1.Are you uploading those files to OneDrive for Business library or SharePoint document library?<br />
2.Try upload the issued file to different SharePoint site so that we can determine whether the issue is related to the specific site.<br />
3.Try to use different browser.</p>

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">In order to reproduce the issue, you'll need the full setup that we have on our SharePoint site, which is:</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<ol>
<li>We have a document library that allows the management of multiple types</li><li>We have a&nbsp;<strong>"Document Set</strong>" as the type of content to be created within this Document Library</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>Document Set&nbsp;</strong>takes its values (columns) from the hosting Document Library</li><li>Documents and files created or uploaded are organised under their unique&nbsp;<strong>Document Set&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>take (<strong>sync</strong>) their values (document properties and metadata) from the hosting&nbsp;<strong>Document Set</strong></li><li>Files' metadata are like; Committee name, Meeting Number, and Meeting Date</li><li>We have added a word file to the document set to be used as a default template when creating the set. And within that template, we used Quick Parts that show the values of some selected document set's properties (metadata), such as the Meeting Date and
 committee name.</li></ol>
<div>So the process we follow in order to create a complete document set are:</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<ol>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Document Set (we call it Meeting Papers)&nbsp;</strong>from the&nbsp;<strong>New&nbsp;</strong>button in the document library</li><li>Fill in the required fields by the&nbsp;<strong>Document Set</strong></li><li>Then we upload or create the required files into the created&nbsp;<strong>Document Set</strong></li><li>After that, all the created files and documents take its properties and metadata from the hosting Document Set</li><li>A word template is created and its quick parts should show the selected committee name and the meeting date.</li></ol>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Our issue:</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">We have&nbsp;<strong>Meeting Date&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Committee&nbsp;</strong>required fields for the Document Set to be created, and after filling these values and viewing the created word template in&nbsp;<strong>Word
 Online</strong>, we often find that the date and time are not correct (usually appears 1 day off). Plus,&nbsp;when we try to edit the document in Word Online it, sometimes shows the wrong committee name.</div>

            <p>Hi Mohammad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing the information with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your latest information, I’ve done some test and found out the root cause of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, since the image you uploaded is missing, I’d like to confirm whether you are referring to the situation below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Meeting Date in the Document set is set as below (I created a new document set in my SharePoint environments):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/977c5d70-844c-471f-8ffe-155bf1e543af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/977c5d70-844c-471f-8ffe-155bf1e543af" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we open the document in Word Online, it will change to a different </p>
<p>one:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b077b20d-88e5-4cf5-a780-2d0d93747f18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b077b20d-88e5-4cf5-a780-2d0d93747f18" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, this issue is cause by the different time zone in Word Online and SharePoint Online environment. In my test environment, my SharePoint Online time zone is Pacific Time while the default time zone of Word Online is GMT. This will cause the inconsistence
 of time between SharePoint Online and Word Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bad news is, it’s not feasible to edit the default time zone of Word Online. Given this situation, I would suggest you share your ideas with our Word Online team via the link below. Features will be updated based on users' constructive comments.<br />
<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/271331-word-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://word.uservoice.com/forums/271331-word-online</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround:<br />
1.Login to the document library.<br />
2.Create a template file and download it to the local computer. Ensure the template file have all the fields you needed.<br />
3.Go to Library Settings&gt; Meeting Papers&gt; Document Set Settings.<br />
4.In the Shared Columns section, uncheck Meeting Date.<br />
5.In the Default Content section, upload the template file we just created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this way, every time when an end user creates a new document based on the document set we modified, it we create a file with the requested fields and it will display correctly in Word Online. However, this will cause the Meeting Date column in the document
 set has an empty value in it and the Meeting Date value will be different between the files and the Document Set. Users need to manually edit the Meeting Date value in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Fraser</p>

<h2>            new nokia mp3 play while phone function off</h2>
                    To eliminate the need to have a phone and a mp3 player, I'm looking for a new phone, preferrably Nokia brand, that allows use of mp3 playing while phone function is off.<br />
Highly useful for air travel....have Nokia not realised this yet?<br />
I am interested in the new 6233, does it do this?<br />
<br />
Even better if it could connect/transmit to car stereo or hifi, thus elimintaing need for additional mp3 player/car cd changer.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how/where to find this information about nokias, and/or where to make such suggestions to the manufacturer?

            The 6630, 6680, 6681, 6682, N70, N90, 9500, 9300 and 7710 are all phones with stereo output MP3 player capability and an offline profile ("flight mode").<br />
<br />
Of older phones one that also qualifies is the original N-Gage (not the N-Gage QD).<br />
<br />
Of upcoming phones announced but yet to be released, phones that qualify are also: N71, N80, N91, N92, 3250 and E70, at least + probably also E60 and E61.<br />
<br />
That's 18 Nokia models in total to choose from, and there could be more, too, as these are only those that I know. ;)

Where and how can find this online for future models?<br />
And if so, what is this feature known as, "offline profile"?

            Hi smurph,<br />
<br />
all phones mentioned by petrib above are Symbian phones.<br />
<br />
My recommendation is to wait for the 6233 and check if it has this 'offline profile'.<br />

            Yes thanks, but how can I check if a phone has this offline profile available, The details nokia post does not include this!<br />
Do any nokia models read the ID3 file tag, and playing of a full album/playlist or sguffle from a selection?<br />
Again, is so where can i find this out?<br />
<br />
Excuse my ignorance, but what is a Sytmbian phone, and what are the advanatages/disadvantages?

            Symbian is a high-level software operating system that Nokia uses in many phones (the, so called, smartphones).<br />
<br />
The Symbian based Nokia phones come in two major "families" of phones; the S60 (or "Series 60") phones, the Series 80 phones, and then the 7710 (which was initially part of "Series 90", but its development was discontinued).<br />
<br />
Read about it more on, e.g.,<br />

<br />
and<br />

<br />
To complete the picture, the remaining phone "families" of phones by Nokia are "Series 40" and "Series 30".<br />

            However be careful if you are used to a fully competent MP3 player as you might not view a Nokia phone as being up to your standard.<br />
<br />
Firstly watch out as I can't find any information that tells me which Nokia phones are capable of reading the different ID3 tag versions. You know the tag that tells the music player artist, album information. As an example my Nokia 6680 using the music player
 from the N90 doesn't read ID3 v2.2 tags, which many podcasts use.<br />
<br />
Secondly watch out as I can't find any information that tells me when Nokia will include support for syncing with a mainstream music catalogue application (Windows Media Player, Real Player, iTunes)<br />
<br />
Thirdly watch out as I can't find any information that tells me when Nokia will support Microsofts WMA file format.<br />
<br />
Without these three items answered it is difficult for me to suggests that a device is a good "MP3" player.<br />
<br />
My current device is a Nokia 6680, and it is a great Device. But it can't sync and play the native file format of a mainstream PC based music catalogue software (i.e. Microsoft Media Player)
<br />
<br />
I hope that somebody can set me right on my facts as I really want my Nokia 6680 to live up to both its potential and my expectations.

            hi Bernie, have you not heard of WMA plus? its an application that supposedly allows playing of wma's on a 60 series phone.

            Yes, checked WMAPlus out. The demo sounds good, a definite help in the convergence.
<br />
<br />
One downside seems to be that WMAPlus uses a different id3 tag version to the Nokia Player. Having changed all my tags to id v2.3, WMA Plus gets them all confused. I haven't had the time to check out what id3 version works best for WMAPlus.<br />
<br />
Also, whilst I don't want to sound too picky, I would personally prefer using Software. Nokia should provide WMA support as an upgrade.<br />
<br />
The other thing that Nokia could do is provide a driver for Windows that enables Microsoft Media Player to see the Phone's memory card as a drive letter hard drive. That way the music transfer could be done without taking the memory card out of the phone and
 putting it into a USB stick for placing into the PC.

            Hi Bernie!<br />
<br />
This isnt useful to you right now, but the N91 will actually have compatibility with Windows Media Player 10 when it is released.<br />

            you mentioned about connecting to your car stereo.<br />
<br />
If your stereo has aux leads you could buy the nokia music pack. this would allow you to use most 'pop port' nokia phones and you get a 256mb mmc card

<h2>            OneNote 2016 &#34;Make Text in Image Searchable&#34; no longer enabled by default</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first installed OneNote, any image I inserted would have "Make Text in Image Searchable" set to
<em><strong>English (United States)</strong></em> automatically.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, it's always set to
<em><strong>Disabled</strong></em>.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried ticking, restarting and then unticking "<em>Disable text recognition in pictures</em>" and restarting and also tried an Office repair (full, online repair).&nbsp; I believe (although this may not be the reason) that this started happening when I set
 my proofing language to English (United Kingdom), which is not a language option for Make Text in Image Searchable, but I've subsequently changed this back (and removed British English from OneNote altogether), but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CAN manually select the image and enable individually, but this is frustrating and time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

</p><p>I am contemplating buying either a lumia 950 or 650 unlocked and not through my carrier.&nbsp; I am at a point where I can move my mobile number to any carrier and I no longer want long term contracts and inflated pricing.&nbsp; My current phone is a lumia 925 and
 because I'm currently on att I was not even given the latest updates to the OS as att determined they did not want to be bothered with MS.&nbsp; Do the newer Windows 10 mobile phones receive updates like windows 10 pc's or are the updates pushed through the wireless
 carriers?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible causes why you encountered this issue in Outlook is <strong>
a corrupted email profile</strong>. To better assist you, we need the answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you have multiple <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Overview-of-Outlook-e-mail-profiles-9073a8ac-c3d6-421d-b5b9-fcedff7642fc?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#bm6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
email accounts in Outlook</a>?</li><li>Did you make any changes on your computer prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you <strong>switch to another email profile in Outlook</strong> and see if the same issue with a folder will occur. To do this, simply follow the steps in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Switch-to-another-Outlook-email-profile-be3b617f-3f64-43d3-9037-8313b431803c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Launch Day Disaster</h2>
                    <p>Okay - I tried launching W10 on my old desktop today. It's been running so well on my laptop lately, I thought I would give it a try on my desktop which is &nbsp;an 7 or 8 year old&nbsp;HP with AMD Athlon dual core CPU and NVidia Graphics driver which was running
 W8.1 quite nicely. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well the W10 installation went smoothly and everything looked fine on&nbsp;the dektop&nbsp;except the GUI images were all stretched and distorted. Then almost immediately, I got BSOD error and restart. &nbsp;Some kind of message about an "unexpected kernel trap error.
 Fortunately I had backed everything up before embarking on this process. But&nbsp;nevertheless I have had to do a clean install with a day 1 version of Windows 8 Pro and build forward from there. Pain in the a__.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I wont be trying Windows 10 on my HP again any time in the near future.</p>

</p><p>I quite happy to wait thanks. Windows 8.1 is nice mature software by this point, and I have no problems with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the complaints pile up, MS will need to provide drivers for W10 eventually. This experience is worse than the synaptics problem, where at least I could roll back the driver and keep going. This failure occurs right after I start up, so there&nbsp; is no
 opportunity to do anything before I crash again. If I thought that Nvidia drivers might&nbsp;solve &nbsp;this kernel problem I might be tempted to try.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really crappy software that fails in this way. When it works it looks nice. Looking at all the great reviews on the web today, kind of reminds me of the old lipstick on a pig analogy.&nbsp;

<p>From you table I can see noting in Y26 so I suspect some rows are missing</p>
<p>You do know that COUNTA is used to count <strong>all</strong> entries while COUNT is used to count

                    <p>I.m no PC whizz but can do most actions on PC.##</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bouhjy new laptop. I also bought latest office bundle. What ever document (word / excel, etc), when I try to send via email, (usinf share tab as there is no longer a send function) I get mail message saying no associated email programme so go to default
 to add association. I did this and cannot findn anyway to associate email programme. Is there a fault with my word install or is there some way I can fix this.##</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone throuhj all preferences, options, etc and cannot find any explanation for this. I have not altered or removed any settings either. Just turned system on and loaded ms office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>nb. I've had several PCs before and never had to associate email progrmame before I could email</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set outlook up - by just switching on I meant I set system up Inc. Email accounts. &nbsp;I can and do send emails via outlook and bt mail. So I definitely have outlook working which is why I don't understand why word doesn't recognise it. I've checked word
 and outlook set up options, etc. They seem correct. On prior pcs when word / office loaded I did not have to do anything to configure email - it just accepted emails could be issued direct from freshly typed word, &nbsp;does t</p>
<p>his make issue more confusing?</p>

            I don't know of anything else to suggest other than you take the issue over to the Outlook forum and to save repetition, detail for the folks there the steps that you have already tried.

    <title>Outlook 2013 moving e-mails, no rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guroose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 moving e-mails, no rules</h2>
                    When I set up Outlook 2013, for a time it was prompting me to "save" a process when I did it often. I keep Outlook organized with subfolders and move my e-mails to these as they arrive. &nbsp;Outlook detected this and asked if it should do it every time an
 e-mail arrived. In some cases, I said yes and now those emails automatically show in a subfolder as they come in. &nbsp;This is great, and I love it, but I have one going to the wrong folder and I need to correct. &nbsp;But it is not in rules and I can't find where
 to correct this. &nbsp;I would also like to do others, but I am no longer prompted. &nbsp;Any way to turn this back on? Feels like server-side rules, but this is a personal account, so not sure how to get to "Exchange server" rules.

            Doesn't seem like it but...Does this happen even if you start Outlook in Safe Mode? (hold down CTRL while you click the icon) See if this helps:

            Perhaps I was unclear. &nbsp;The emails are moved before I ever start Outlook. &nbsp;I never see them in the Inbox, either on my PC or my Android phone. &nbsp;This is happening server-side, but I cannot find where so I can correct. &nbsp;E-mails are moved to subfolders on
 the server. &nbsp;But there is nothing in my rules. &nbsp;Where do I find the rules that govern this behavior and correct.

            <p>Riddle solved. &nbsp;There are two sets of rules, one in the Outlook client and one from the browser(Outlook.com). &nbsp;Since I always use the client, I could not find them. Logged on to Live, and there they were. Not sure who thought this was a good idea, but I
 should have the same set of rules either way.</p>
