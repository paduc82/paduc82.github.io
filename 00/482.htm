            <p>Wouldn't be at all surprised if its Norton causing the problems. MANY of the Antivirus vendors dont update their software to run on Beta OS's. By your own post Norton was playing up previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only problem I've had with two different computers both with 14328 is one of them the start menu wouldn't open, after a reboot its working fine now, all programs working 100% and even several different programs at once it was rock stable.</p>

<p>Hi Bren</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not ready for beta?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having problems is what a beta&nbsp;build is all about. If this build did not have any problems, then it would be a Release Build. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a recent change to the way Preview Builds are released to the Insiders. Those who are using the Fast Ring for the earliest release will be seeing more bugs than in the past, They will be getting the previews at the same time the Microsoft employees
 get them for testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also made the following change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They created a <strong>Release Preview Ring</strong>. This is the latest and most stable build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a production system you are using, you might want to start using the
<strong>Slow Ring</strong> or even better, the new <strong>Release Preview</strong>. The Release Preview will allow you to use the released build (10586.xxx)&nbsp;but still allow you to&nbsp;see most of the new feature upgrades&nbsp;before others who are running the release
 build.&nbsp;(<strong>Redstone</strong>).</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Just to quickly recap the changes we‚Äôve made to rings for Insiders in 2016:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p><span><span>We introduced the new Release Preview ring last week which is for Windows Insiders who want to stay on the Current Branch (currently builds based off of Build 10586), but continue to receive early access to updates, application updates, and driver
 updates. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p><span><span>This is a great option for people who want to get updates early but not go all the way to installing full preview builds. Because the Release Preview ring offers updates to the Current Branch, it is only visible to devices on the Current Branch
 (Build 10586). </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are on a newer build, flights to the Release Preview ring won‚Äôt be applicable to that device. The easiest way to go between the Development Branch to the Current Branch is to use the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 ‚Äì this means these builds may include more bugs and other issues that could be slightly more painful to live with. So if you‚Äôd like to change your ring to stick to more stable builds you can go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced options
 and under ‚ÄúGet Insider Preview builds‚Äù moving the slider to the Slow ring.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Bren</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I was just responding to the title and content of your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One&nbsp;of the reasons for a larger amount of bugs in Builds 14316 and&nbsp;14328 is the result of the changes I described. The Fast Ring will be receiving the new builds much earlier than before. This means more bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will continue in future Fast Ring Builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason that these changes were made was due to a large number of Insiders complaining about the slow pace of new builds being released to insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was also the reason they added the new Release Preview option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>How to find a folder in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georox  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to find a folder in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>In my Outlook 2016 I have a large multi-level structure of folders where I save my messages. Now I'm looking for a particular folder which I accidentaly moved to an unknown location. Since I know some text of the messages stored in that folder, Outlook easily
 finds the messages and also tells me the name of the folder where they are, but it does not give me any indication about the folder position.<br />
In previous Outlook versions I could solve this problem by searching for related messages and Outlook showed the folder position of the messages in a tree-view.<br />
Does anybody know how to achieve the same result in Outlook 2016?<br />
Thanks in advance.Gianni</p>

<p>I'm not sure why either.&nbsp; However the workaround that I use.&nbsp; Is to use zip up the files into one archive.&nbsp; Which saves on the size of the email, so keeping the mobile data cost down.&nbsp; Pocket RAR or HTC ZIP, will do the job nicely.&nbsp; If your device doesn't
 have a archive program pre-loaded.</p>

    <title>word-wrap ignores trailing spaces&#59; workaround&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeu2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            word-wrap ignores trailing spaces&#59; workaround&#63;</h2>
                    Word-wrap seems to ignore trailing spaces in each line when the cell is right-aligned.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround or an option that I overlooked to force word-wrap to display the trailing spaces?<br />
<br />
The problem can be demonstrated with the formula ="abc*" &amp; CHAR(10) &amp; "xyz" &amp; CHAR(32).<br />
<br />
However, my actual formula is of the form =mytext(...), where the mytext function returns a string of the form "abc*" &amp; chr(10) &amp; "xyz" &amp; chr(32).<br />
<br />
I want "xyz" to be (roughly) aligned with "abc".<br />
<br />
I say "roughly" because I know there are issues with proportional fonts.&nbsp; Assume that I use a non-proportional font such as Terminal or Courier New.<br />
<br />

<br />
That results in a boxed-? in my region (US English), not a trailing space.&nbsp; See the image below.<br />
<br />
I wrote:&nbsp; "Is there a workaround [...] to force word-wrap to display the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
trailing spaces</span>?".<br />
<br />
But aha!&nbsp; I can use CHAR(160) at the end.&nbsp; I guess there is a use for non-breaking spaces (HTML &amp;nbsp) after all :-).<br />

                    <p>We operate BCM2010 with&nbsp;Outlook 2010 and on some machines we upgraded to Outlook 2013 and upgraded to BCM2013. But I have just purchased a Surface Pro and installed Outlook 2013 but can't find an easy way to install BCM2013. I have tried installing BCM2010
 but it is incompatible and I can't find a BCM 2013 install, I can only find an upgrade.&nbsp; I don no really wish to re-install Outlook 2010 in order to install BCM 2010 and then upgrade both back to 2013.</p>
<p>Is there an easier way?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This doesn't appear to work. The link shows&nbsp;a 32 and 64 bit version of BCM2010 install and not BCM2013. I choose 64 bit and run the program. I see a dialog explaining that no previous version is installed and nothing else happens. The dialog makes sense
 since I have no BCM installed at all.</p>

                    I have a parameter query in which the user enters a search string to return only those records where the specified search string text appears in the field.&nbsp; I would like to be able to highlight that search criteria text in the resulting report, something
 like you see in Acrobat when you search for text.&nbsp; I'm not well-versed in VB, so how could I do that?

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Warning Message, Email to large, limit size to 20MB</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2013 (Not the cloud version) running on a Windows 7 Operating System.&nbsp; I have started receiving the following Outlook Warning Message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your IMAP Server wants to alert you to the following:&nbsp; Email is too large, limit size to less than 20MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an IMAP email account hosted with Go Daddy with unlimited mail box storage.&nbsp; I can send and receive emails with no problems.&nbsp; This message keeps popping up multiple times approximately every 10 minutes even if I'm not sending email.&nbsp; These messages
 will keep popping up while Outlook is open.&nbsp; I had a 23MB &amp; 16 MB file I had received over a month ago stored in my email folders but&nbsp;the problem with the warning messages just started.&nbsp; I deleted both of these large files and I still keep getting the wearing
 message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called the MS Tech support line and they were not any help.&nbsp; The tech kept insisting the problem was to two large files I mentioned above that I have since deleted.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me the cause of this problem and how to turn this warning message off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            MS Projects 2013 - Summary task dates not updating after resources added</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really could use some help. I have created a new project in MS projects 2013. I created a new project with a new calender etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did first was to enter in all the tasks and summary tasks and left the duration's at 1 day for each task. (All tasks are automatically scheduled)&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did then was add all the resources into the respective tasks. (I have a breakdown of the resources for each task given to me by our QS. This breakdown includes total hours for each work resource per task eg, Task 1 has a total of 205hrs work for concrete
 labour'er etc) What I did was instead of entering the duration manually, I added all the resources to each task and then added the work to be done which in turn changed the duration for that task. Problem is now when I update the unit amount of a resource
 the specific task duration changes but the summary tasks do not change.</p>
<p>The "Update project after ever change is turned ON". I have tried to start the same project from scratch three times with different settings and still always end up with a crazy duration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please if anyone has any Idea why this is, I would really appreciate any help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ryan</p>

            <p>What you have done is quite a common way to approach it if you have the work for each resource and you want to force a duration.</p>
<p>However, what I don't like about the approach is how people get the work estimate to start with. I am supposing that, as you say, that you have the work per resource per task. Sometimes you get given just the work per resource or just the work per task.</p>
<p>I always prefer to start with the durations, link the predecessors and successors so that you get the critical path network right, then assign the resources, and then the work per task and the work per resource are calculated as an output, not an input.</p>
<p>Anyway, to come to your "problem" about the summaries, provided the tasks and the summary are all auto-scheduled, and provided calculation is on, there is no reason why the summaries durations should not reflect changes in the durations of the tasks. Are
 you sure the summary is not working? Can we have see a screenshot? </p>

<p>
</p><p>To add to Trevor's excellent answer, the default Task Mode for every new task in Microsoft Project 2010 and 2013 is Manually Scheduled.&nbsp; I suspect all of your tasks are Manually Scheduled tasks, including your summary tasks, which would explain your problem.&nbsp;
 Select all of your tasks and then click the Auto Scheduled button in the middle of the Task ribbon.&nbsp; This might just solve your problem.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply! Attached Is a screen shot of some tasks with the resources and the summary tasks that clearly do not add up. As you can see all the tasks are automatically scheduled and calculation is on but summary tasks do not calculate correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with you about the approach. I am new to the MS Project program and I do prefer to enter the duration in and then let the resources be the dependent variable etc. The reason I used this approach for this project is that we have already submitted
 the quote so for the program cost to add up to the initial boq I figured this would be the best way. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. But yes I did change all tasks to automatically scheduled once I started the project. The problem came in once I added resources and the duration became dependent on the resource working hours. See screen shot of my response to Trevor.</p>

            Pardon me for bumping in, but I think you are confusing how summary task durations are calculated.&nbsp; For task 43 (Masonry) the duration is not the addition of 4.26 days (task 44) plus the other subtasks.&nbsp; It is the span of time (in working time) from the
 start of the earliest subtask (August 24) to the end of the latest (March 3).&nbsp; My guess is there is something a miss with your calendar as I am having trouble understanding 4.26 days spanning from August 24 to October 22.

<h2>            Cannot install 16226 because of 16215 failed to install.</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to install 16226. When I go to Windows update it says, "A restart is required to finish installing: 16215.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That install fails due to "Inaccessible boot error." I ran&nbsp;wushowhide.diagcab to hide that update. When I rebooted Windows Update is still trying to install 16215.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove 16215 from Windows Install. Another option is to do a clean install of my current preview which is 16199.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have another option?</p>

<p>move to subfolder</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>test by performing a 'run now' on inbox.</p>

<p>Hi kingstonUK(1),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the move to subfolder rule doesn‚Äôt work well, we recommend that you create a new Outlook client rule to move the emails to the specific subfolder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the new rules still doesn‚Äôt work, we recommend that you run <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365</a> and choose <strong><em>Outlook &gt; Other problems &gt; Email &gt; My email rules aren‚Äôt working right
</em></strong>to solve this problem. Also, you can try using the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Quick Repair</a> to repair your Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since you are an Office 365 user, we recommend that you upgrade from Outlook 2013 client to Outlook 2016 client for a better user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

Don't worry about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There have never been there.</p>
<p>BTW Vista fixed this problem--by completely removing the tool that you are using.&nbsp;&nbsp; No tool--no bug when you use it.</p>

<h2>            Getting a refund...or not</h2>
                    I purchased a one month Microsoft Office subscription in September of 2013, and it was cancelled prematurely before the one month was up. When I tried to contact the support for the issue, it took them over a month to finally respond, and when they did,
 they said the issue was resolved and my subscription was over. They then proceeded to bill me for three additional months when I did not have the service. I called twice, and both times they said I would get my refund, and get my money back that they wrongfully
 took from me. They said "it would be there in 48-73 hours". That was well over a week ago, and I called again last week and they said the same thing. I have been wrongfully billed for a service they wrongfully cancelled four months ago and they will not give
 me the refund I rightly deserve. They promised the refund within a designated time, and they have fallen through on their promise. I have been neglected as a customer and Microsoft has broken every promise they made to me. The

<h2>            Outlook is not searching properly after windows update</h2>
                    <p>My outlook 2010 used to be able to deliver accurate results but after windows update recently the search results became pointless. It will display all emails and I have to scroll down to find emails with the highlighted keywords. I have tried everything
 and nothing seems to work eg. rebuild the index, check and uncheck windows search, create a new email account, check and uncheck index search on features... I even contacted the customer support from Microsoft and they couldn't solve my problem. Can someone
 please help! Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are seeing this error below when searching then this is an issue that was caused by the June Window Security updates.&nbsp; The Windows Team has developed a fix and it will ship in Windows Updates on 6/27. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since its a security update we don't recommend removing them but understand if you need your search working. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>These are the ones I know of but I see Evan above has&nbsp;4022719 for Windows 7 SP 1 version.&nbsp; I suspect that KB is causing the issue.&nbsp; If you try removing it Evan let me know and I will add to my list.</p>
<p>KB4022726 in Windows 8.1&nbsp;<br />
KB4022715 in Windows 10&nbsp;<br />
KB4022725 in Windows 10 &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. For your info, below is the outlook message I have received. It doesn't look like your error messages above.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38da8742-a1a9-4816-90fc-9e61fafb19ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38da8742-a1a9-4816-90fc-9e61fafb19ce" /></a></p>
<p>In that case, do you think the fix which will ship on the 6/27 will solve the problem? A few of my colleagues are having this problem as well. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received the fix. Will update it later. Hopefully it will solve my problem. Would you suggest that I update the May, 2017 Preview of Quality Rollup for .NET Framwork 3.5.1, 4.5.1..... and Update for Window 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2952664) as well?
 Thanks for your help!</p>

            As far as I understand, the purpose of alias is to have alternate address for the same user (not other people). Every person in the family should have their own account / password. You can link those accounts, forward mails from one to other if you want
 the whole family to be able to use each others accounts without entering password and read emails.

<h2>            How to attach multiple files in Windows Phone email</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know if this tip has been discussed/shared before, I&nbsp;did a quick search but&nbsp;could not find anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;still cannot attach multiple files within the email client while replying or composing a message.&nbsp;But thanks to the
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/files/762e837f-461d-4847-8399-3526f54fc25e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Files</a>&nbsp;app, you can send multiple file attachments in a single email. All you have to do is,&nbsp;selecting multiple files, tap on the share icon&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f9232978f-1570-4de2-839a-e55f443047e3%2fmaps-icon-share_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&nbsp;and
 use&nbsp;any defined email address to&nbsp;share the files. You can even attach an entire folder, just&nbsp;press and hold the folder name, and select Share option from the menu.</p>

            <p>Hi HaroonZia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook app currently only allows attachment of pictures.<br />
It's a basic design in Windows Phone that an app is only allowed to store, access and use files in its own protected storage. This sandboxing of apps is a security and integrity measure, so the Windows Phone developers have to consider very carefully, even
 when they make an exception that no third-party developer is allowed to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is relaxing this approach and allow apps to do more since WP 8.1, e.g. the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/files/9wzdncrfj3pl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Files app</a>&nbsp;is designed to access files that are stored outside of other apps, and as a consequence it is able to copy, move and share what it can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I can do is suggest add votes and comment to the Uservoice forum:<br />
<a href="https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2282574-enable-document-attachment-in-emails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2282574-enable-document-attachment-in-emails</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other suggestions to improve the handling of attachments, e.g.:</p>
<p><a href="https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2281161-delete-edit-original-message-when-reply-forward-th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2281161-delete-edit-original-message-when-reply-forward-th</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- or create your own specific suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Phone developers monitor the uservoice forum and I expect changes in Windows 10 based on suggestions found there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- <br />

<p>Hi HaroonZia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook app currently only allows attachment of pictures.<br />
It's a basic design in Windows Phone that an app is only allowed to store, access and use files in its own protected storage. This sandboxing of apps is a security and integrity measure, so the Windows Phone developers have to consider very carefully, even
 when they make an exception that no third-party developer is allowed to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is relaxing this approach and allow apps to do more since WP 8.1, e.g. the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/files/9wzdncrfj3pl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Files app</a>&nbsp;is designed to access files that are stored outside of other apps, and as a consequence it is able to copy, move and share what it can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I can do is suggest add votes and comment to the Uservoice forum:<br />
<a href="https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2282574-enable-document-attachment-in-emails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2282574-enable-document-attachment-in-emails</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other suggestions to improve the handling of attachments, e.g.:</p>
<p><a href="https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2281161-delete-edit-original-message-when-reply-forward-th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/2281161-delete-edit-original-message-when-reply-forward-th</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- or create your own specific suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Phone developers monitor the uservoice forum and I expect changes in Windows 10 based on suggestions found there.</p>
<p>

<p>Dear Hans!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I thank you for your detailed reply and with all respect, I totally disagree with this reason of restricting the access to the files on the Lumia device due to the security purpose concerned to developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a technical / programmer type of guy but I think &amp; <strong><em>Strongly Suggest</em></strong> that "<em>At Least</em> full access to the files on
<em>OneDrive</em> can somehow be assigned to the&nbsp;<em>Outlook app&nbsp;</em>by Microsoft Programmers &nbsp;to attach
<em>Every Type</em> of file with <em>Every </em>email (new as well as forward emails) because
<em>OneDrive</em> does not contain any <em>S</em><em>ystem Files." Moreover&nbsp;</em>I believe that this suggestion can not be
<em><strong>Impossible</strong></em>&nbsp;for the programmers to execute and roll out in some update. In this way the system files (OS files) will also remain inaccessible by developers as you mentioned in your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a fan of Microsoft &amp; this is the very first time I have been feeling disappointed as my favorite OS does not allow me to use the Outlook email for my business / professional use where as I have been able to use the email app of Android with full access
 to attach all type of files to all types of emails (new &amp; forward emails).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the option to vote for this feature's addition is concerned, I have done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this requirement of adding multiple type of files to all types of emails will be available soon in some OTA update.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have looked at your file but we need more information to&nbsp;understand what is&nbsp;the problem.
</p>
<p>Can you please give an example of one cell: tell us what it should return.</p>
<p>We are unfamiliar with terms like stamps value.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>By the way:</p>
<p>1) the heading in column T says 20%+5% but the formulas use 45%&nbsp;as in &nbsp;=+P473*45%</p>
<p>2) the + symbol in this (and many other formulas) is totally unnecessary - however, it does not cause an error.</p>
