<h2>            Password Reset With 2FA</h2>
                    I have 2FA on my Outlook account, unfortunately my phone got destroyed and I lost my password.<br />
<br />
I went through the password reset giving some old passwords, contacts and subject lines. And I believe it said they would reset it in 30 days.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to see the progress of this request? The email I connected hasn't receiving any updates.

            No there isn't a way to see progress as you'd need to be able to log into the account which is blocked. You'll just have to wait the 30 days and see what happens.<br />

<p>What I am trying to do is combine all the information in column C, found in-between changes in Items (column D) or in-between the Yes in column B.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I want to concatenate the information in cell E3.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this example I would want a formula that I can copy down in column E that would produce in cell E3 ‚ÄúThe data is messed up and needs to be combined‚Äù.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Cell E9 would produce ‚ÄúYep It‚Äôs wrong‚Äù.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then in cell E12 the process would start over again combining everything in column C until I either have a new item number in column D or a Yes in column B.</p>

<div>So, just to clarify:</div>

<div>- column C has the text bits</div>
<div>- column D has numbers and blank cells</div>
<div>- column E is the final target</div>

<div>E2&nbsp;=IF(ISNUMBER(D2),INDEX(F3:F100,MATCH("yes",B3:B100,0)-1),"")</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you don't start the formulas in row 2, you need to adjust the cell references. Note that the formula in E2 references F<b>3

            Sorry, I created the formula with the data in column C instead of column D and forgot to adjust it.
<div><br />
<div>Here is the formula for F2 again:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=IF(ISNUMBER(D2),"",TRIM(F1)&amp;" "&amp;B2)</div>
<div><br />
<div>And here is another formula for E2, which looks at the "Yes" in column A.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>=IF(ISNUMBER(D2),INDEX(F3:F100,MATCH("yes",A3:A100,0)-1),"")</div>

<div>If you have the text spread over more than 100 rows for one item, adjust the ranges accordingly.</div>

            LAN Networking has been botched and borked as of Vista, and I don't expect it to get better, but only worse.
<br />
While it sort of works on AD Domains it's sucks big time for workgroups,&nbsp; <br />
the XP and older network stack was much better for usability and configurability,
<br />
eg. I can stick a 9x box on my LAN and look at any NT 3.1, NT4, Win2K, and XP box simply by making the 9x box a member of the workgroup, and logging in with the user name and password of any administrative user account on the box i wish to access.

<h2>            Open, Close, Save, ....events with Office web apps Word, Excel, and PowerPoint</h2>
                    Do events like Open, Close, Windows Activate, Save, SaveAs, and other events found on Office Desk apps like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint exist in the Web version of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint? If not is there some techniques that would emulate these events?
 The reason I ask is because I have Word and&nbsp;&nbsp;Excel files saved to a OneDrive or&nbsp;Office 365&nbsp;SharePoint that have Protection applied to them&nbsp;and saved. To edit them I need to&nbsp;unprotect them when I open them but there isn't any event that I can catch and handle
 and unprotect the file. The same applies to putting protection on a file.&nbsp;

            <p>VBA isn't part of the web apps, so you couldn't use VBA event handling. &nbsp;And the apps run on a remote computer that (unless you're hosting them yourself) you wouldn't be able to install other software to respond to events (assuming the apps expose any),
 so I'm fairly sure you're out of luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll probably need to download the files to your desktop, edit there (where you *can* trap events), then upload back to the cloud after saving.</p>

            <p>Thank you Steve. I am know VBA is not&nbsp;part of Web app and I develop VSTO addins where we handle events. The issue is we have customers that use Office 365 and naturally&nbsp;they want our products to work on Office 365. I am in discussions with MS about work
 arounds or self development of something that will catch something in the Office web apps that our Office apps for the web could interpret as a specific type of event.&nbsp; I am told&nbsp;generating events is not currently on the roadmap of Office Web apps. I know
 this is issue is concern for more people and development groups than just me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again Steve</p>

            <p>The answer to my question is that there isn't any Office Applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) events like Save, Saveas, Open, Close, etc. on the web versions of Office applications. This is a big handicap for&nbsp;products I work on that and that our customers
 purchase. We and our customers are big users of Microsoft Office products and our customers are embracing the use of Office 365 and they want our Office products to be compatible and work with Office 365 and to do that we need the same type of events like
 Save, Saveas, CLose,&nbsp;Open, and such just as found on the Office client applications. I cannot stress enough that it is very important to me and many, many more developers and companies that are using Office 365 that these same Client Office events are available
 on the Web version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft MVP and engineers see my posting and contact the Office product group, Owners as this is an important issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Difference between Page break and page break before&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Word, what is the difference between </p>
<ul>
<li>a Page Break (CTRL-Enter or on the Layout Tab, Page Setup group, Breaks, Page Break)</li><li>and page break before function (Paragraph dlg box, Line &amp; Page Breaks tab, check box)</li></ul>
<p>except that the Page Break shows up when in Show mode, where as the other never does.&nbsp; Do they not do the very same thing?</p>

            <p>Yes, more or less, they do the same thing in that they both cause a new page to be started - the case of the Hard Page Break (CTRL+ENTER), immediately after, and in the case of the Page Break Before attribute, immediately before the paragraph to which that
 attribute is applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Page Break Before attribute is particularly handy when applied to a Style - such as the Heading Styles, when it is desired that they always be the first thing on a page.</p>

            <p>Here's one more difference, although less common than the other things that were mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the paragraph after the page break (typically a heading) has background shading, and you insert the manual page break in such a way that it's part of the shaded paragraph (i.e., no paragraph mark after the page break), the shading will appear at the bottom
 of the preceding page:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eea93d26-b55a-4255-ba8f-a58f7b2ac49a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eea93d26-b55a-4255-ba8f-a58f7b2ac49a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If instead you apply Page Break Before formatting to the shaded paragraph, there's no extra shading:</p>

                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really getting frustrating - this is compounded when the MS Support SPO Technical Team come up with a stupid answer and can't be bothered to ask the man at the top!!</p>
<p>For e.g. Term Store items:</p>
<p>
</p><p>L1 How to get help</p>
<p>---L2 Help Zone</p>
<p>--------L3 IT Self Service</p>
<p>-----------L4 FAQs</p>
<p>
</p><p>The furthest the Local Nav displays is L1 and L2 --&gt; L3 and L4 is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>O365/SharePoint Online as of today and I do not want to modify the MASTERPAGE as per MS recommendations. The worst thing about all of this is I used to make the mods in MasterPage in SP2010 for a similar issue - MS, pull your finger out, looks like you're
 regressing!!</p>

            <p>Hi Thrilled2Bits,<br />
<br />
The managed metadata navigation levels displaying in the SharePoint teamsite depends on Control‚Äù V4QuickLaunchMenu‚Äù property ‚ÄúStaticDisplayLevels‚Äù in master page. To show third or fourth level managed metadata navigation, we can just edit StaticDisplayLevels
 to 5. Here are some detailed steps to change the property value: <br />
<br />
1. Go to the SharePoint teamsite and click Settings icon like a gear &gt; Site settings &gt; Web Designer Galleries &gt; Master pages and page layouts.
<br />
2. Select seattle.html and download a copy as below: <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e2288b1-0ba4-478b-a0da-4edd127bfb2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e2288b1-0ba4-478b-a0da-4edd127bfb2d" /></a><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f03e41a-d352-41a8-9162-810cbff45c90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f03e41a-d352-41a8-9162-810cbff45c90" /></a><br />
3. Rename the copy and open it with Notepad.<br />
4. Find the Control‚Äù V4QuickLaunchMenu‚Äù property ‚ÄúStaticDisplayLevels‚Äù via pressing Ctrl + F and change the value to 5.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928b19e1-f267-438f-bafe-3f2305882174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928b19e1-f267-438f-bafe-3f2305882174" /></a></p>
<p>5. Save it and go back to Master Page Gallery. Click FILES &gt; Upload Documents &gt; Save.
<br />
6. Select Publish Major Version &gt; OK to check the result. <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fda04e4d-d862-49d7-9732-cf2199811bfa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fda04e4d-d862-49d7-9732-cf2199811bfa" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>I would like explain that there is no other easier methods to control the managed metadata navigation levels in SharePoint teamsite. Given the situation, we can also submit feedback to our

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something happened with the file and now when we go to open it it gives us the error message
<em>"The file format and extension of ".xls" don't match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe. Unless you trust its source, don't open it. Do you want to open it anyway?"</em></p>

</p><p>I say yes but all the information is gone. There's nothing there. I have looked all over the net to find an answer to this issue but cannot find it. Is there a way to recover this file?&nbsp;</p>

<p>That message is <em>supposed</em> to appear when either an .xlsx file has been renamed as .xls,
</p>
<p>or when a .xls file has been renamed as .xls</p>
<p>
</p><p>or, read the above but replace .xlsx with .xlsm....</p>

</p><p>I would have a go changing the file extension to see if it fixes it.</p>

            <p>Did you try the advice offered above?</p>
<p>i.e. first try changing the file extension.</p>
<p>In Windows Explorer, do Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View tab &gt; ensure "Hide extensions for known file types" is
<strong>Un</strong>checked. (if you can't see the Tools menu, do Organize &gt; Layout &gt; Menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now re-name the file, try &nbsp;.xls&nbsp; then &nbsp;.xlsx&nbsp;&nbsp; then&nbsp; .xlsm</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each rename, try opening the file and see if the issue goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, refer to the link provided above&nbsp;by AhmedAbdel Kader:</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Finally, I opened the file through LibreOffice. &nbsp;Before the opening the file, you will be asked to choose the appropriate format. &nbsp;You can try different format until you see the correct file. &nbsp;After that you can copy all the information to new Excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download LibreOffice for free from the link below&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,</p>
<p>

            Hi...Few organizations block email attachment for security purpose. I presume it is blocked by your organization. I experienced the same in our organization. I then sent the same to my personal email &amp; downloaded to check &amp; it didn't happen in my personal
 email. Feel free to reply for further support...

<h3> randy street  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prorate Help</h2>
                    <p>I have a prorate formula of sorts that prorates based on a 30 day month. Apparently my mind at this time is not assisting me in figuring out how to make this prorate based on a daily basis, meaning either 30 days, 31 days, or even 28/29 days (Feb)...however
 many days are in the current month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have thus far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IIf(([New_Resident]=Yes),IIf(Day([Lease_Begin_Date])=1,"n/a",([Resident_Rent]/30)*Sum(30-(DatePart("d",[Lease_Begin_Date]))+1)),"N/A")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and this is in an ACCESS 2003 report text box :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>You can calculate the number of days in a&nbsp;month by using an expression like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DatePart("d", DateSerial(Year(Lease_Begin_Date), Month(Lease_Begin_Date)+1, 0))</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Just replace the 30 in your expression with the DatePart function call:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IIf([New_Resident]=True, </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIf(Day([Lease_Begin_Date])=1,"n/a",</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[Resident_Rent]/DatePart("d", DateSerial(Year(Lease_Begin_Date), Month(Lease_Begin_Date)+1, 0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;DatePart("d", DateSerial(Year(Lease_Begin_Date), Month(Lease_Begin_Date)+1, 0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (Day([Lease_Begin_Date])+1)</p>
<p>&nbsp; , "N/A")</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR, you could put the DatePart call in the form's record source query and use that calculated field's name in place of the 30 in the text box's expression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For prorating the end date, use the same DatePart&nbsp;function call or calculated field name&nbsp;in the end of lease prorating calculation:</p>

<h2>            Leaving an annoying group in the Microsoft Outlook App for Mac does not seem to be an option&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently tried to leave some groups that were sending spam emails but I use Microsoft Outlook in the app on my Mac, and I could not find a button to leave. I know how to leave on the web but it has not synced for an hour now and I don't think it will sync.
 They're just really annoying so it would be great to get some help with this issue!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Jett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, if you've already left the group on the web, you'll no longer be a part of the group and won't be able to access the files or other data.</p>
<p>And this operation will sync to the Outlook app. However, if you choose to follow up a group, even you've left this group,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">you
 are still a member but no longer receive all group conversations in your personal inbox. Instead, you'll only receive replies to your posts, messages where you're mentioned, and events in your personal inbox. For all other group conversations, you'll have
 to go to the group inbox to see them. See&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Follow-a-group-in-Outlook-e147fc19-f548-4cd2-834f-80c6235b7c36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Follow
 a group in Outlook</a><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;for details.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To check whether you've left the group successfully, please log to <strong><a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a></strong> and check if there is any group showing in
<strong>Groups</strong>(under the inbox).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the group you left doesn't list there, it should be synchronization issue. Please restart Outlook for Mac to&nbsp;reconnect your account and see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please&nbsp;use <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517">Contact

<h2>            cant uninstall&#47;reinstall apps after sd card failure - windows 10 phone</h2>
                    <p>hi all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>the sd card containing most of the apps for my lumia 640xl stopped functioning. After inserting a new one i wanted to reinstall the apps but the store still considered the old apps to be installed. I tried to uninstall the old apps but without any success...only
 got an error 0x8000000e. Is there any way around this, im considering a hard reset but only as a final option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>So even though you "install" to an SD card there are still pieces installed in main memory. Small that it is, it still shows you have the app installed although there is no access to it. If it were my device I would hard reset and start fresh. That will
 clear up the issue, give you a device like it was brand new and you will be off and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would NOT install from a backup but rather do a fresh install then you will only add that which is most important. As long as you use the same Live ID all your contacts and calendar info will return and if you have used auto backup of photos to OneDrive
 then you will have pretty much everything that is most important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my thoughts...</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Since getting a new computer with Windows 7, I have been experiencing problems with gridlines (not borders) not printing.&nbsp; The problem seems to occur randomly.&nbsp; It does not always
 happen.&nbsp; It does seem to happen more (maybe) if&nbsp;I've&nbsp;had Excel open for a long time and have been doing a lot of changes to a spreadsheet.&nbsp; However, this may have nothing to do with the problem.&nbsp; And, remember, this is about GRIDLINES not printing.&nbsp; This has
 nothing to do with BORDERS.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Solution is to save, exit Excel, restart Excel, reopen spreadsheet, and then print.&nbsp; This always solves the problem.&nbsp; However, it is very frustrating, as well as wasteful of paper,
 to have to go thru all these steps to get the gridlines to print.</font></span></p>

<p><br />
Yes, the gridlines show up in print preview.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the link to Windows 8, however, as stated in my original post, I have a Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will try a different printer the next time it happens.&nbsp; However, I don't&nbsp;understand what that is going to accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated in my original post, the gridlines will print with my current printer after shutting down Excel and restarting Excel.</p>

<p><span>Symbian is in the late stages of it's "death" now so naturally app releases will reduce.&nbsp;</span><span>Given the facts that they'll be no new symbian devices, developers switching to other
 platforms (like Android, Windows Phone and iOS) and Nokia outsourcing support to a 3rd party for symbian devices it's safe to say that new releases will be few and far between now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />
Now may be a good time to consider a switch to Nokia's current devices (the Lumia range) where new apps and games are being released daily.<br />

<h2>            Word 2013 Office 365 Does not Display ribbon menus</h2>
                    Hi, I had 2013 working then it stopped. No idea why. Removed all software installations. Office 2013 installs however word and excel do not display all the menu items. the File - options menu cannot be found anywhere, so I can't try the 'graphics accelerator'
 option. I have tried this with 2 video cards, an old 5 year old one and a new one. Same problem. I have used the fixit tools, the repair tools, manually checked installation directories, renamed the normal files. and still not working.

<h2>            Outlook 365&#58; moving emails from Inbox to another folder will cause next email to open small window, not maximized</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the subject suggest: I encountered this problem before but just now was able to pin-point what triggers it.</p>
<p>When I move an email from Inbox to another folder (regardless of the folder that the email is being moved to or the method of moving - keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks), when I open the next email in the Inbox, it opens in minimized window, not maximized.
 I have to manually maximize the window and it is saved so all next emails are opened maximized, until the next time I move another email from inbox to another folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why is that and how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The problem "shows" only after I actually move the email (after CTRL+SHIFT+V) to the other folder. If I just open the Move dialogue and then close it without moving the email, and I double click an email, it will open normally in full/maximize window.</p>

<p>Hi sbi1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to post your concern in community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, you have encountered this problem after you moved an email from the Inbox from the other folder. I‚Äôve done some tests and tried to reproduce your issue, using the Shif+Ctrl+V mode and moving emails directly,
 however the expected scenario didn‚Äôt happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In view of this situation, it may be a client related issue. We can analyze this issue from following aspects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exclude the add-ins cause for this problem. You can <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
open Outlook in safe mode</a> which disables add-ins to check the result. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is fixed, click <strong>Options</strong> on the
<strong>File</strong> menu, and then click <strong>Add-Ins</strong>. Select <strong>
COM Add-ins</strong>, and then click <strong>Go</strong>. Click to clear all the check boxes in the list, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. Restart Outlook. If the issue doesn't occur, start adding the add-ins one at a time until the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, try to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repair your Office</a>. Or you can update your Outlook to the latest version to check if problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If nothing changed, I‚Äôd like to collect more information form you here to make a further analysis.</p>
<p>You Outlook version. Just click File &gt; Office Account, then you can get it in Production Information.</p>
<p>The type of your account. POP/ IMAP/ Exchange/ Other?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if it‚Äôs convenient for you, you may share a video capture to me so I can know your situation better. For your privacy, you can upload it via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/thread?id=98e3384b-f429-4f99-b4f4-26321403384b">

<h2>            Unable to sync work email account</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Yoga 900 with Windows 10 and am unable to sync my work email/calendar to the laptop.&nbsp; I have a Surface 3 with the exact same settings as the Yoga and am able to sync without difficulty.&nbsp; Not even the IT department can figure this out
 (which is rather frustrating to me).&nbsp; My error message is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your device does not comply with the security policies set by your email administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AllowDesktopSync: 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Error code:&nbsp; 0x85010013</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Does the above error message suggest there is a setting I can change to fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>I have the same issue. My Desktop and Laptop cannot sync email with same message and error code as the first one to post here. BUT, on my 8" Nuvision tablet (running windows 10) and my Windows Phone 950xl (running windows RT) can sync email and calendar
 for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I have 3 computers - a desktop, a laptop, and a tablet- that all run windows 10, and only 1 (the tablet) is able to 'comply' with company policies and sync email/calendar? What is also even more strange is my PC and Tablet are running Windows 10 Pro,
 and the tablet is only Windows 10 home (with no drives encrypted, yet can sync work email/calendar)</p>

<h2>            Need outlook.pst viewer.Windows 10 with WMDC&#40; Windows Mobile Device Center&#41;will not support WM6.1 Smartphone sync</h2>
                    <p>I need a way to view all my contacts with notes in my new Nokia 8.1 windows phone . A simple outlook.pst viewer would do.</p>
<p>You may ask why do you not upload to outlook.com.</p>
<p>In my situation that did not work . Outlook 2007 contacts will not migrate without loss to Outlook.com people .</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was the way I tested it </p>
<div>
<p>After installation of windows 10 on my computer, I discovered WMDC ( Windows Mobile Device Center), no longer support any Wm 6.1 smartphone synchronization</p>
<p>I&nbsp;had no choice to upgrade from an HTC Wm6.1 smart phone to a Nokia WP 8.1 </p>
</div>
<div>I installed OUTLOOK connector hoping all my contacts and agenda would seamlessly migrate to PEOPLE and sync with my new&nbsp; NOKIA windows phone WP8.1.</div>
<div>from a test batch of 130 contacts only 37 ended up in PEOPLE .</div>
<div>In the "contact note fields" a lot of &nbsp;information was missing.</div>

            Being able to view or even better read &amp; write to a .pst file would be useful. So if there are any developers out there (hint: Microsoft) why not give it a try.

            Verizon has announced it will. Haven't heard the others pipe up. Pretty sure AT&amp;T won't. I think their linup is settled with the Nokia and HTC units they made available today.

            <p>Hi AOStechlacky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure you have installed the latest <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive App</a> on your tablets.</p>
<p>After you open the PDF file, click the yellow edit button as shown below to open the PDF built viewer.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3984a9e1-b092-4320-84c1-2f1499bdc7a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3984a9e1-b092-4320-84c1-2f1499bdc7a6" height="78" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>On the black function bar, you can choose each of them to make some changes to your PDF file: Note, Free-form: Scribble, Textbox and Highlight.</p>
<p>Regarding the underline feature, you need to use Free-form: Scribble function <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aabc9855-4e76-4ebc-8d7c-a6d673208cdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
