<h2>            add &#39;transpose&#39; to right click</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use the function 'right click', 'paste special', 'transpose', 'ok' frequently.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to add the transpose option directly to the right click, or a keyboard shortcut or similar? &nbsp;I tried using CTRL Y (repeat) but it doesn't work as there is a copy in between.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I also use copy, paste special, unicode text frequently as well. &nbsp;Could I combine both stages into a macro, or a quick button?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I copy from chrome (HTML), and then paste the result as unicode text, transposed into an excel sheet. &nbsp;At the moment, I do the operation in two, slow processes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div>Hi Vijay,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your fast reply. &nbsp;I have managed to add transpose to the quick access toolbar so now I can type ALT+1 to transpose. &nbsp;It is a sort of help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I need to CTRL+C, then ALT+1, so the left hand movements are more troublesome than using right-click. &nbsp;Is there anyway to have ALT+1 (or transpose) now added to the right click menu?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there anyway to combine the following process into a quicker process?:</div>
<div><br />
<div>copy selection from chrome (HTML)</div>
<div>Switch to Excel</div>
<div>paste special as unicode text</div>
<div>copy selection</div>
<div>paste special as transpose (or ALT+1)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,<br />
Andy</div>

            I don't think it will be possible to convert it as a right click menu but as a &nbsp;alternate you can change it as right HAND option.
<div>So instead of putting Transpose at 1 in short cut menu, move it to 9th position, by including some other commands. So once it is at 9th place, then you may use Alt from your right side with 9. &nbsp;</div>
<div>So your CTRL+C will require left hand while Alt+9 will require right hand, may be that is little bit more convenient.</div>

<br />
<div>thanks vijay. &nbsp;except my right hand is for using the mouse, so again it doesn't really speed up the process. &nbsp;So far I am getting used to CTRL+C and ALT+1 which is certainly quicker than the previous method.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wonder if a macro could 'paste special unicode', 'click on the adjacent cell' and then 'paste special transpose', all saved into the quick command ribbon (as an ALT quick key)?</div>

            <p>It's easy to add a control to the right-click menu and then have that control run a subroutine which does the Paste Special... Transpose. Paste this code into a Module in the VB Editor:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub AddToCellMenu()<br />
' Added July 2016: Adds the 'Fill Down' button to the Cell Context Menu<br />
' This is the ony way to modify a context menu<br />
&nbsp; With Application.CommandBars("Cell")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Controls.Add Type:=msoControlButton, ID:=372, Before:=5 &nbsp; &nbsp;' Fill Down Control<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Controls("Pick From List...").Delete &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' I've never ever used this !<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Controls("Clear Contents").Delete &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;' Easier to use the keyboard<br />
' Added Feb 2017. Paste + Values &amp; Paste + Transpose on Right-click Cell Menu<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With .Controls.Add<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Move Before:=4: &nbsp;.FaceId = 526: &nbsp;.Caption = "Paste Values": &nbsp; &nbsp;.OnAction = "PasteValues"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With .Controls.Add<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Move Before:=5: &nbsp;.FaceId = 1813: .Caption = "Paste Transpose": .OnAction = "PasteTranspose"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp; End With<br />
' Un-Rem this line to return the Cell context menu to default<br />
' &nbsp;Application.CommandBars("Cell").Reset<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does a few other modifications to the right-click menu, i.e. adds the 'Fill Down' control, which I use quite a lot, and removes a couple of controls which I never use. Rem-out or delete these lines if you don't want these modifications. This moves the
 original 'Paste Special...' to the bottom of the list - change the '.Move Before:=' number to adjust where the controls go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then need to add this code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub PasteValues()<br />
&nbsp; On Error Resume Next &nbsp; &nbsp;' In case there is nothing in the Clipboard to paste<br />
&nbsp; Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlValues<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub PasteTranspose()<br />
&nbsp; On Error Resume Next &nbsp; &nbsp;' In case there is nothing in the Clipboard to paste<br />
&nbsp; Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlValues, Transpose:=True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously if you want only the Paste Special... Transpose function then remove the Sub PasteValues and the code which adds this control. I prefer to paste values when I paste transpose but if you don't want this then remove 'Paste:=xlValues,' from Sub PasteTranspose().</p>
<p>
</p><p>You only run Sub&nbsp;AddToCellMenu() once to add the controls. This will only work in the workbook the code was pasted into. If you want it to work in any workbook the you'll have to make it an Add-In. There's loads of information on how to to this, e.g.&nbsp;http://www.cpearson.com/excel/createaddin.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .FaceID defines what the icon looks like. You can find what icons are available at&nbsp;http://skp.mvps.org/faceid.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works in Excel 2000 but I assume it'll also work in later versions. Hope this helps !</p>
<p>

    <title>Office 365 2016 Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trthseeker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 2016 Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>On Feb 23 Microsoft started sending me notices on features of 2016 Office, and I 'X' them out, as I had not decided on what I wanted to do, after updates last year and it let me wondering how to default back to what I had, I did not know how to change my
 fonts, as Calibri was not my choice; Times Romans was, but there was no information on how this new update hid the way to change the default. I found the instructions wrong, so not wanting all the wasted time, possible I do not need 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we lived the nightmare of; "reserve for Windows 10" ate up my memory, until some kind soul wrote a program so we could get that back and out of computers.&nbsp;I never wanted it, but again the obnoxious pop ups, I reserved it. This time I "X" out the pop
 ups as I still had to March 19 to decide, but Microsoft decided to make that decision for me, as that is their control system, and&nbsp;update me to 2016
<strong>without my permission.</strong> Here is the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore and all went back after spending 2.5 hours on the phone with sales and a representative who did not chat/type in legible English; who would not, or could not help me in technical support, as sales could not explain what happened, as
 he assured me that it was not automatic. REALLY? </p>
<p>
</p><p>After calling to&nbsp;Tech support, I got a great guy, Ron, and when I did a system restore, all was well until today. I thought maybe this will come back, as the restoration did not give me back what I had. I showed 2016, but the spinning had stopped and I got
 my former "Save As," system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Office is 2016 might be nice for corporate folks, but I have a home/personal and I do not need One Drive, although I highlight "My PC," or try to, and I have to wait and wait, I don't believe Office 2016 is for Windows 7 or you have a lot of bugs to fix,
 as the trails were not fixed for those operating on Windows 7 or this is happening to a lot of people. I believe that One Drive is what is causing the problem,
<strong>as saving a file just spins and searches and I have to wait and wait. What is going on? It will finally appear after waiting, but that is not what I wanted, and Office 2013 was great for me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to alert me, my email is different from my account with Microsoft so for a notification; how would that take place? It was set up for me by Geek Squad, and I am a Comcast.net; not outlook.com the prefix before the @ is the same.

<p>If that is working and you feel that you need to manually download latest signatures try executing the following command : "%programfiles%\windows defender\mpcmdrun.exe" -signatureupdate -http</p>

                    I would like to switch back and forth from HTML email and text-only viewing methods so I can proof our marketing emails. Is there a way to do this in Outlook for Mac 2011? Thanks!<br />

            As far as i know it can be done only if the emails being sent to you are in plain text, i am not aware of a setting where you can view all emails in plain text in outlook 2011.<br />
I would suggest you send feedback to ms and see if that changes later on.<br />

<h2>            Any restriction if I use two licenses, both Home and Business, of Office365 for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a MacBook and Office 365 for business at work. The license model is 'Business Essential'.
</p>
<p>By the way, I'd like to use my personal Office 365 for Home also in my MacBook with some reason.</p>
<p>Is there any restriction on this usage? Isn't it allowed to install Office 365 for Home in MacBook used for work even though Office 365 for business is licensed already?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be no restrictions but what is your need to have 2 licenses installed at the same time, throw some light on your need . and Office 365 home and business can be used at the same time but I think there may be issues while working with 2 licenses
 at the same time with files. </p>

            <p>It's simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Any document I and/or my colleagues at work created is accessed through <em>
Business Essential</em> account. But, my personal documents are accessed through <em>
Home</em> account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <em>Business Essential</em>&nbsp;doesn't provide Office apps. But, <em>Home</em>&nbsp;provides them. So, if there is no restriction on using
<em>Home</em> together with <em>Business Essential</em>, I could use those apps to edit/view documents created at work. If not, I have to ask our IT manager for switching from
<em>Business Essential</em> to <em>Business or Business Premium. </em>Probably he doesn't want to do because the most common use case is to use Office apps at Windows PC and Office 365 for
<em>Business Essential</em>. We have only few employees working with Mac. :-(</p>

            <p>There are two concepts to understand here 1) product activation 2) access to online documents</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) To activate the Office 2016 for Mac product, you need to use a license that has 'client rights'. In your case, this can be satisfied with the Home account. Once the product is activated, you get full functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) As part of activation, we automatically connect you to the OneDrive service associated with the account you used to activate (which is what most people want). In your case, you want to also&nbsp;add a 'Connected Service' (this is done by clicking on your account/name
 in the File|New dialog where you normally choose which template/file to open. You can add a new Connected Service of OneDrive for Business that refers to your Business Essentials document storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technically, the Mac client will be just using the 'Home' license in your scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

</p><p>I understood how <em>Home</em> ans <em>Business Essential</em> licenses can work together at my Mac.</p>
<p>By the way, isn't this scenario violating the license agreement of <em>Home</em>? That's my concern.</p>

            Understand that different features will be available depending on which version you are using. For example, the 365 license will let you use PowerPoint's new Morph transition but the business license will not.

<p>Just want to know if newly manufactured batch of Lumia 535 stilll contains the touch issues? Many of my friends was pretty amazed because of the way it looks and of course the Microsoft name on it. But I told them that it has serious touch issues. Imagine
 if this phone work flawlessly I'm sure many of my friends would buy and would recommend to their friends and friends of friends and domino effect. So sad.</p>

            I confirm that the update did not fix the sensor useless , sometimes you can not even answer the call or enter a PIN unlock code.<br />
Write to someone sms impossible , phantom touches everywhere. Better to call than to spend half an hour on one word<br />

<p>There is no solution as of now and no update from Microsoft after the first update. The issue is not resolved, it'll be like the Lumia 1520. You have to live with it. Newer batch has got no such issue because they have rectify the hardware</p>

</p><p>So far windows update seems to have respected my choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC with Win10 preview hasn't been turned on for almost two weeks now. When I booted it up today it rebooted automatically after updating disregarding my choice of scheduling the restart</p>

<h2>            How can I download a trial version of Access without downloading the rest of the Microsoft package &#40;ex. excel, word etc&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I have Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010 which does NOT have Access, but I would like to try it out. Can I download just the Access or do I have to download the whole thing to try the trial version? If I do have to download the whole thing will it
 interfere with the current version of Microsoft I have?

            Hi<br />
<br />
Have you tried starting Outlook with the /reset folders switch?<br />
Check his folder structure. Might it dragged off into some other folder<br />
If you use Go|Folder does Sent Items show up in the drop-down list?<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Launch MFCMAPI | Click Session | Logon and Display Store Table </li><li>Choose Outlook profile | Double Click on Mailbox - username items </li><li>Expand Root Mailbox | Expand IPM Subtree | Click on Sent Items | </li><li>Look for properties named "PR_ATTR_Hidden,PingTagAttributeHidden,ptgAttrHidden&nbsp; and verify the "Value" is "false/true"
</li><li>True = Sent Items folder is hidden</li><li>&nbsp; False = Sent Items folder is not hidden.</li><li>If the value is "TRUE" | Double click on it | It will open PropertyEditor </li><li>Verify if "Boolean" is check? if yes, then uncheck it and click OK </li><li>Then verify the value again, it should change from TRUE to FALSE after uncheck the BOOLEAN</li></ol>
<p>you can also try opening Outlook in safe mode and check if you are able to view the mails. To do this,<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Windows key+ R key and type Outlook /safe-&gt;click ok. Now check if you are able to view the emails.</li><li>If Outlook safe works fine, try to disable add-in(s) from File-&gt;Options-&gt; Add-in(s).</li><li>Click on go for COM-Add-Ins and clear the check box for all add-ins close and restart Outlook</li></ul>
<p><br />

<p><b>If same issue post your query in OUTLOOK forum for help</b></p>

<p>Hi ShaneA,</p>
<p>Are you the only&nbsp; group member who encountered this issue? That is to say, do any other members of the OWA group who are using the Outlook 2016 client have the same issue?<br />
Is your Outlook 2016 client up to date?</p>
<p>Besides,&nbsp; if you are able to use&nbsp; Exchange Online PowerShell, please follow the steps below to get the OWA group memberships to see if you are a member of the group:<br />
1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Run the command:<br />
<strong>Get-UnifiedGroupLinks -Identity "Human Resources Department" -LinkType Members</strong></p>
<p>Replace&nbsp; â€œ<strong>Human Resources Department</strong>â€ with the email address of the OWA group.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Thanks for the correction. The command runs now after &nbsp;and i can see my Name with recipient type as UserMailbox along with many other group members.
</p>
<p>I checked on two other group members using Outlook 2016 and they also do not have the experience as me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>hi shanea,</p>
<p>thanks for posting back.</p>
<p>i have reviewed the whole thread and would like to move forward on the case with the following details:<br />
1. i have sent you a private message to collect the affected email account (no password) for further check. you can read the private message via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations<br />
2. i understand you are currently using the latest version of outlook client, would you mind providing the version number like 16.0. 6741.2042 then so we can perform further tests? you can get the information in
<strong>file</strong>&gt;<strong> office account</strong>&gt; <strong>update options</strong>.<br />
3. have you tried <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a new profile</a>&nbsp;as aaron mentioned in the initial post and just set up your office 365 account in it? this is to rule out the possibility that the old profile is corrupt, etc.
 so please try it when you have time if you havenâ€™t. <br />
4. since two other users also donâ€™t have the experience of groups in the outlook client, i have sent you a private message which contains my test account. please configure it in the outlook client and test if you can see the<strong> test</strong> group i created
 as below:</p>

we are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h2>            I have phantom email address going out with email I send</h2>
                    I have two email addresses that are part of Outlook.&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (the problem) and another *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
<br />
I have a Droid Razr with Verizon that is tied into these accounts.<br />
<br />
About a month ago, and extremely old email address that had never been used on this computer started traveling out
<b>(hidden </b>- *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) when i send an email using *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; the recipient of the email does not see dennisdegen@rocketmail in the incoming email.&nbsp; They only see *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; When they reply to my email they get :
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delivery to the following recipients was aborted after 1 second(s):</p>

            Dear Mia, <br />
I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
Thanks for your question! <br />
<br />
More or less the both file extensions are doing the same: store a synchronized copy of your mailbox information on your local computer. The .nst refer that the account is an O365 account.
<br />
If you want to learn more about .pst here: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/introduction-to-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-222eaf92-a995-45d9-bde2-f331f60e2790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/introd...</a> <br />
Here about the .nst: <em>&lt;Link removed. Article is pushing a commercial program&gt;</em><br />
<br />
I hope this helps! <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />
Kristina <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which operating system are you using?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How many computers are connected in your network?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is your computer on Domain or Workgroup?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any recent changed made on your computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This occurs when two computers on the same LAN network end up with the same IP address. When this occurs, both computers end up not being able to connect to network resources or
 perform other network operations.</p>
<p>This problem, though rare, can occur because of the following reasons:</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Two computers are assigned the same static IP addresses
</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>One computer is assigned a static IP address that falls into the DHCP range for the local network and the same address is assigned to a computer by the DHCP server
</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>A laptop is put into sleep mode and then turned on while connected to another network that uses the same IP address
</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you have multiple network adapters, it is possible for a to have an IP address conflict with itself
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to resolve an IP address conflict</b></p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>There are a few ways you can go about fixing this problem. Iâ€™ll start with the simplest and move on.</p>
<p>a)
<b>Renew IP Address</b> â€“ You can release and renew the IP address for your computer using the command prompt. Refer to the steps provided below:</p>
<p>Click on the "<b>Start</b>" button and choose "<b>Run</b>."</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type "<b>cmd</b>" in the box and click on "<b>OK</b>." A window with a command prompt appears. It resembles the old DOS operating system.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type "<b>ipconfig /release</b>" and press "Enter." This releases your computers current IP addresses.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type "<b>ipconfig /renew"</b> and press "Enter." This assigns your computer a new set of IP addresses.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>"Exit"</b> and press "<b>Enter</b>" to close the window. You computer now has a new IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps from the article provided below and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Change TCP/IP settings</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-TCP-IP-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-TCP-IP-settings</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p><b>Update firmware</b> â€“ In some rare instances, the actual DHCP server can malfunction and assign more than one computer the same IP. In this case, it is best to try and
 update the firmware on your router.</p>
<p><b>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></b></p>

<h2>            Published Calendar not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a published Calendar which is not updating all those who have access to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Office 2010 Professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that the fix for this is to go into Account Settings and change the account on the published Calendar, then log in with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to change the account on the Calendar it says, even before it asks me for username and password, "Something went wrong and we can't sign you in right now. Please try again later.".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already tried disabling Windows Firewall and AV. Not sure what to do here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Runtime Error 13</h2>
                    <p>I have a runtime error 13 type mismatch error on every excel sheet i am trying to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just migrated from Windows 10 to a IMAC with El Capitan OSX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a easy Bill excel sheet to make bills for my customers, and a bigger sheet for makin my dayli in and outs of cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sheets are working without any problems on windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i thought i buy the brand new office for mac to have no problems with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now NONE of my sheets, even one with a simple macro that only makes a sum is working. All of them say runtime error 13....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded office on my windows pc to the same version, the new office 365, opened it there, tried if it works, it does, and saved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then sent it to the Mac again, but the same problem still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone a suggestion?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IÂ´m quiet angry, because if i would have known that, i would not have bought the whole office package for mac....</p>

            By every sheet, do you mean every billing sheet or really EVERY workbook? What about new workbooks? If Easy Bill is a commercial Excel package, you may need to contact the authors to make sure that their macros will indeed work on Excel 2016 for the Mac.<br />

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ment EVERY sheet i tried. My englisch is not so good, maybe you call it workbook. I meen every file i tested it with. In another forum i saw somebody talking about a problem with the date format. So i changed the date format in the bill, or maybe you call
 it invoice form. And now it works...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too bad that i can not change the date format on the other "workbook" because it is programmed by a company, and the guy who made it is hard to contact...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occured NOT on files that i made with the mac, only when they were made on PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway for the reply.</p>
<p>

            <p>I am not programmin vba by myself. The file is made by a coworker of my tax-company.</p>
<p>I can not reach the guy who made the file/programmed the code....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevermind... I changed to numbers, downloaded a new file that fits my needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just funny that an excel file made by a actual version of excel, is not compatible with another new excel version, just for another system...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing annoying me isthat i bought microsoft office for make, and dont need it at all now, because all my old files dont work at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would have been good if there was a testversion, so that would have saved me 99,- â‚¬...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we can close this case, there is no solution anyway, it seems, because i will not learn to change the code just because of that...</p>

<h2>            Function Arguments dialog box loses focus during vlookup on a different workbook - Excel 2016</h2>
                    Upgraded today to Office 2016.&nbsp; When conducting vlookup between tabs within the same workbook, focus remains on the function arguments dialog box.&nbsp; When conducting vlookup against a different workbook, lose focus on the box and since the box is "before"
 the last location, must [Alt]+[Shift]+[Tab] to get focus back on the dialog box, else Alt+Tab through all open programs or switch to mouse.&nbsp; I did not have this issue in Office 2010 and suspect it's not the intended UX.&nbsp; Could not locate an "option" that would
 change this experience.&nbsp; Suggestions?

<p>Hi Marian, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges that you are having when you try to use the VLOOKUP function in Excel 2016 may be related to some settings that you need to configure first to have the formula work as expected. However, since you mentioned that you just upgraded to the latest
 version of Excel, it is also possible that the Excel application itself is having issues. At this point, we have a few options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we may run the online Office repair tool to make sure that there are no underlying issues with Excel. To do this, check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for the procedures. If it turns out that there are no issues within the application, we can then conclude the first possible cause of the issue which is the settings of the application. If that would be the case, we highly suggest that you visit
 our <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Excel/ct-p/Excel_Cat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel Community</a> forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have any other concerns, donâ€™t hesitate to let us know.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>After further comparison in functions from Office 2010 to Office 2016, within my team, we found that the Excel Function Arguments box is
<strong>not </strong>a separate window in 2010, though it is in 2016.&nbsp; Of note, when that window is created now, it is placed in order
<strong>before </strong>the active window, and has focus.&nbsp; This is what necessitates some additional keystrokes for those of us who actively avoid using a mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we preferred function when it was integrated with the sheet on which the vlookup started (so it never actually lost focus), I believe we have discovered a few ways to retrain ourselves to make more effective use of the new functionality.&nbsp; I will take
 consolation in that emailing a spreadsheet no longer holds both Excel and Outlook hostage...while perhaps not directly related, makes up for the small loss.</p>
