            <span>Hi GerryMurphree.<br />
1. Do you get any error message when you try to install the driver?<br />
<b><u><br />
</u></b>I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer and check if the drivers are available for windows 7.If the drivers are not available for windows 7, I would suggest you to install Aver media EZMaker usb video converter in compatibility mode. The following
 link will help you to install in compatibility mode.<br />

            <p>I downloaded another driver purported to be updated, it failed to install with the same error as the original , "The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)"</p>
<p>when the device is plugged in, the device manager creates a device under "other" with a yellow troubleshoot icon on&nbsp;EZMaker&nbsp;USB2.0.&nbsp;&nbsp; when using the troubleshooter it tells me that the driver cannot be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when installing the new driver I used compatablity settings for XP service pack 3 and ran it as an administrator.&nbsp; result was fail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original disc when used, fails with the same error and will not continue.&nbsp;&nbsp; It installed</p>
<p>ok on my original XP SP3 machine and worked perfectly,&nbsp;it installed the driver then installed 3rd party software ,but will not work on new Windows 7&nbsp; when researching the Avermedia
</p>
<p>site I found no driver .&nbsp; any solutions ?</p>

<p>Hey people who know things xbox and are willing to help,</p>
<p>So I have had this problem for probalby a year now. I would not really call it a problem. More like annoying. Anyways, Ill be playing my game. I will go downstairs to do something (get food, drink, etc). I have a tendency to turn my tv off every time I walk
 pass it (to save electricity, be green, stop global warming. you know, the usual.). When I do, my xbox will stay on. When I come back and turn my tv back on, the xbox will restart. I have looked through the settings on my tv but do not really see anything
 that would cause it. I have a magnavox 32" tv. Connected to the tv are a ps2, n64, super nintendo, and a game cube plus xbox 360. connected to the xbox is an hdmi cable going straight to the tv and an Official xbox adapter that gives me an optical audio port
 which I have my turtle beaches earforce DSS and my turtle beach headset connected to. Only xbox uses hdmi. all other consoles are using the RWY cables. Any suggestions such as tv/ xbox settings to look into would be nice. Again, this is not that big of&nbsp;a problem
 so do not try to tell me to send it in to get repaired.</p>

<p>Hey Lance,<br />
<br />
That is kinda funny. Do you have another HDMI able television we can use to test this out? We want to isolate it to either the console, or the TV.
<br />
<br />
Let us know, and we can go from there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It might be a long shot but I have another suggestion.</p>
<p>It sounds like you have a lot of stuff drawing a lot of juice, most likely from one outlet. I don't know what else you have hooked up but it might be possible, especially in houses with older wiring, that you're drawing too much power from one outlet and
 causing a brownout every time you turn on your TV. If the power drops enough it could make your power supply to cut out for a very short period of time and cause your Xbox restart.</p>
<p>I'd suggest plugging your Xbox into a different outlet on a separate circuit if possible and seeing if it stops.</p>

<p>It happens with my xbox as well when plugged into a certain TV set.</p>
<p>With one TV I have the xbox wont power up properly until the TV is switched on. It will also reset if I turn tv off and on again.</p>
<p>With my main TV though I can switch the TV off whenever I like.</p>

<p>Sadly, the only other HDMI tv is the same model as the one my xbox is connected to (thats what happens when sams club has low price tvs). I tried unplugging everything else but the tv and xbox. that did not work either. This did start once I got this tv.
 It is probably some setting I have on. Do you know if there is a setting that would connect the xbox and the tv like that?

<p>I wonder if the frequency used by the TV remote, to turn it on, is causing the problem. It may be close enough to the one used by your wireless controller that when you turn on the tv, it turns off the xbox.

<p>Most people never think about this but have you updated your TV to it's latest firmware? Almost every TV with a USB port is capable of updating it's firmware. Updated firmwares contain bug fixes (such as restarting your Xbox) or additional features.</p>
<p>Find your model number and type it into the search box on the following webpage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.magnavox.com/support/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.magnavox.com/.../download.php</a></p>
<p>You should be able to find your model number on a sticker on the back of your TV. Don't use the model number(s) in your manual because manufacturers usually use one manual for several models so it might not correspond exactly with your TV.</p>

<p>On some HD TV's there is a feature that, when connected to a device with HDMI, will "communicate" with that device. An Example of this is like my setup. I have a Blu-ray player connected via HDMI. &nbsp;When both TV and Blu-ray player are off, and I only turn
 on the Blu-ray Player, they both turn on. It works the same way vice versa when I turn off my TV. &nbsp;I would go into your TV settings and look for a setting about HDMI "communication" and turn it off. Your TV might be telling your Xbox to "Turn on" and the Xbox
 takes that as a command and "Turn itself back on" by restarting.</p>
<p>Hope this helps...</p>

<p>It's called Fun-Link but I don't believe the 360 supports it. I have a Fun-Link TV and it doesn't interact with my 360 at all though it works with my Blu-Ray player.</p>
<p>I guess it's worth a try though.</p>

<p>OK, so I went into my TV settings and I found all this stuff that turns HDMI components on and off.&nbsp; I disabled them, but still had this problem.&nbsp; I went into the "console settings" on the XBox and turned off "device discovery", but I STILL had the problem.</p>
<p>Then I found the following from another forum:</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Certain televisions and receivers have "power control" over hdmi connected devices, I used to experience the exact same thing on my old receiver until I upgraded to a new one, and stopped using the component connector to get
 optical audio out.</em></p>
<p><em>here's a quote of a quote I found on google, seems to be exactly what your issue is:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Here's a quote:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;"I have the same problem. It's actually the Xbox... Question are you using AV cables to get Optical audio? I'm using the Component AV adapter sliced up for just the Optical output and HDMI. It restarts when I switch components.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From what my understanding is, the Xbox automatically detects when you switch to and from HDMI . And if you have the AV cables hooked up also it switches to the next connected mode which is: Component. The problem is the
 Xbox requires a restart when it switches modes.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;If i take off the Component AV adapter, and just have HDMI the Xbox will not restart."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did just what this guy describes: I'm using the XBox's component out for the audio but I'm using the HDMI cable for the video.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Problem solved.</em></p>
<p><em>OK,</em></p>
<p><em>So it looks like your option are either:</em></p>
<p><em>a. use only component</em></p>
<p><em>b. find a receiver/television capable of decoding audio over hdmi.</em></p>
<p><em>c. if you're already using only hdmi, simply unplug the a/v cable on the back of the 360</em></p>
<p>So this worked for me, for some reason when I originally hooked up the TV, I have an HDMI for video, then I have another optical audio cord that is connected to the A'V adapter (the one that has an optical output).&nbsp; I really have no idea what I was trying
 to do with this set-up, it's probably because I wasn't aware that audio goes through the HDMI cable when I first bought the TV (which still doesn't make sense, but who cares).</p>
<p>So what is happening is that when I turn off the TV, or turn to another input, the XBOX thinks that I am switching to component, which requires a restart.</p>
<p>The fix was simply unplugging the component block out of the XBOX and letting audio go through the single HDMI cable.</p>

<h2>            How do I create a password reset disk for windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have two HP laptops, both have been upgraded to windows 10 I set one machine to use a local account, but It does not except my password.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other laptop has a Microsoft account and it does log in.&nbsp; I do not have a password reset disk and there isn't
 any entry on the user accounts page of my working machine to create one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I create/obtain a reset disk to reset the password on the machine that does not work???</p>

<p>Hi Abdullah,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>1. Before configure the hybrid mode from on-premise SFB 2015 control panel, we need to enable federation to allow communications with Office 365 SFB Online.</p>
<p>Here is a blog which contains detailed steps: <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2015/12/24/step-by-step-skype-for-business-2015-hybrid-configuration.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2015/12/24/step-by-step-skype-for-business-2015-hybrid-configuration.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong># Step 1</strong></p>
<p>Note: it seems that the first command in this blog (<strong>Set-CSAccessEdgeConfiguration</strong>) is not correct. I find another article about configuring the federation:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205126.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205126.aspx</a></p>
<p>Please verify this.</p>
<p>2. Verify External communication is enabled in Office 365 Skype for Business admin center -&gt;
<strong>organization</strong> -&gt; <strong>external communications</strong>.</p>
<p>If both settings are checked, please let me know the detailed steps you have done to deploy hybrid, or the instructions you’re referring to? So that we can check if the steps are correct.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have changed the privacy &amp; online safety settings multiple times but to no avail. What am I doing wrong?</p>

            Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
Another way to access your emails online is by signing in through <strong>https://mail.live.com</strong>. Regarding with your concern, we need to validate if this has something to do with the Windows 10 update that you recently applied on your computer. Since
 you're using Firefox, we suggest that you use another web browser on your computer like the Microsoft Edge. This will help you to check if you can access your account on the same computer.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.

<h2>            Skype paid for calls to a landline drop after 15 seconds approx</h2>
                    <p>I have used Skype for years to call landlines abroad (paid calls), I have plenty of credit but recently on this computer the sound cuts off at my end after 15 seconds or so, I understand that the other part can hear me but I get nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another computer in the same office using the same internet connection, ISP etc it works fine so it seems to be something in my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a dell precision 3610 with xeon processor and 16 GB of memory and latest version of Skype for desktop on windows 10 with the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed and reinstalled Skype but it has made no difference any suggestions???</p>

<h2>            snap function</h2>
                    Whenever I use snap, the size of my open windows never fill the available space. They are automatically minimized to where I could fit 9 of them on the screen if I wanted.&nbsp; Two never fill the screen. Four never fill the screen. If I resize them and select
 show windows side by side, they revert back to a smaller size. Frustrating. Thank you for any help. I do have all of the settings for snap turned on.&nbsp;

            Hi SunkRock, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a fellow user.
<br />
<br />You could try the keyboard shortcut Windows Key + Left or Right arrow, to see if the Snap function makes the windows resize to half of the screen. Windows Key + Up arrow will maximise the screen, so see if that works too.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try clicking Start and typing Multitasking. Select Multitasking Settings, then try turning off or on the settings in that window to see what effect it has on your window snapping.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

            Thank you for the suggestions. I appreciate the time you took to reply. I have tried turning off/ on the settings in several combinations but results are the same. Windows key and arrow combos snap, but size is still small. There must be some setting I
 am missing? I do not know if it ever worked. Just started trying after the latest updates. Thanks again.

<p>I've finally found a solution for my problem.</p>
<p>There is an incompatibility with some NDIS devices and Windows 10 Version 1709. Microsoft is aware of this and is working on a fix.</p>
<p>As a workaround the following steps helped me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disable the "netsetupsvc" service with "sc.exe config netsetupsvc start=disabled"</p>
<p>2. Uninstall the device from devmgmt.msc.</p>
<p>3. Reinstall the device by telling devmgmt.msc to "Scan for hardware changes"</p>
<p>4. The device should reappear, but it won't work yet.</p>
<p>5. Find the device's registry key, and add three DWORDs named "*IfType", "*MediaType", and "*PhysicalMediaType" set to 6, 0, and 0xe respectively (the registry entry your searching for is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\ you'll
 find a GUID for all network drivers there and an entry for the Remote NDIS driver)</p>
<p>6. Re-enable the netsetupsvc with "sc.exe config netsetupsvc start=demand"</p>
<p>7. Disable &amp; re-enable the device in devmgmt.msc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope, this helps anybody having those issues too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've edited my first post with the question and added a more detailed description and a little script to make this more easier to do even for normal users</p>

<h2>            Is Windows 10 compatible with Canon PIXMA MG3522 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-in-One Printer</h2>
                    Because Windows 8/8.1 wasn't compatible with my Dell 926 printer, I kept my old laptop with Windows Vista just for photographs. Well, that pc took a dump and I am ready to buy a new printer. Now I'll download the Windows 10 program and want to know if
 the printer I have chosen to buy will be compatible with it. WHEW!

<h2>            Windows Updates fail &#38; &#36;&#36;PendingFiles on drive root</h2>
                    <p>After a rebuild of my machine I did a fresh reinstall of Win 10 Pro on my SSD (standard C:\)&nbsp;<br />
I then created symbolic links for the following directories and files to my WD Black (D:\)<br />
<br />
C:\Users --&gt; D:\Users (Directory Symbolic link)<br />
C:\ProgramData --&gt; D:\ProgramData (Directory Symbolic link)<br />

C:\Program Files (x86) --&gt; D:\Program Files (x86) (Directory Symbolic link)<br />
C:\Windows\Installer --&gt; D:\Installer (Directory Symbolic link)<br />
C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution --&gt; D:\SoftwareDistribution (Directory Symbolic link)<br />
C:\ pagefile, hiberfil, swapfile .sys --&gt; D:\ (symbolic links)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I run Windows Update, it fails with the generic 'we couldn't install the updates, blah, blah, blah... and the following event is logged in eventvwr:<br />
<br />
<strong>Event ID 20</strong><br />
Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80070011: Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3213986).<br />
<br />
A few seconds before the WU event is logged, this one is also logged, and I can't tell if they're related.<br />
<br />
<strong>Event ID 10016</strong><br />
The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />
{6B3B8D23-FA8D-40B9-8DBD-B950333E2C52}<br />

to the user NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE SID (S-1-5-19) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.<br />
<br />
After the updates fail, there are a number of $$PendingFiles dropped on the root of D:\<br />

            <p>I've had this issue with KB3213986&nbsp;- 'Couldn't install updates, reverting changes...'.</p>
<p>I managed to solve it.</p>
<p>I'm not using symbolic links, but I changed the registry values for the Program Files/Data directories from the C to D drive.</p>
<p>Temporarily changing them back (and suspending Bitlocker for good measure) successfully installed it (it would go up to 20% then reboot beforehand).</p>
<p>After booting I changed back the registry values and everything seems to be in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your situation, I suggest you temporarily remove the symbolic links for SoftwareDistribution, Installer, and perhaps for Program Files/Data, hopefully allowing whatever's going wrong to disappear, then re-add them after you try to update.</p>

            As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you disable the driver signature enforcement by following these steps:
<br />Click Start.
<br />
<br />Click the Power button.
<br />
<br />Hold the Shift key and click Restart.
<br />
<br />Choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />Click Restart again.
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, press F7 on your keyboard to select Disable driver signature enforcement. Your computer will now restart automatically.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists after disabling the driver signature verification, disable Secure Boot temporarily in your computer's UEFI/BIOS. You can contact your computer's manufacturer or check the device manual for the steps on how to do this.
<br />
<br />Important: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. 
<br />
<br />If you can't find the toggle to disable Secure Boot, a firmware update for the UEFI/BIOS may be required. This can usually be found in the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />After disabling Secure Boot, boot normally into Windows and check if you can install the programs. If you're successful, boot back into the UEFI/BIOS and re-enable Secure Boot since this is an important security feature.

<p>Why is it that this update fails over and over? Why is it that the problem has not been corrected without having to sign up on here to get an answer? 00009C48 update failed over and over. Is Anyone in charge awake? Must I call and be put on hold for hours
 in India to get this resolved? What is so different about this update that it doesn't&nbsp; install like any other?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    I'm having troubles connecting a second monitor to my laptop, I'm using a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter and a DisplayPort to VGA adapter. I have checked that both of them works. My laptop just won't detect the monitor.

            Thanks for the help, but isn't&nbsp;<span>Mini DisplayPort just a smaller of&nbsp;</span><span>DisplayPort with the same pins&nbsp;so the adapter shouldn't affect the signal&nbsp;in any ways? Maybe the VGA

</p><p><span><span>Are you running Spybot with Teatimer enabled?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation
 of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal mode. Disable other security software whilst you are
 doing scans. </span></span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/confirm/</span></span></a>

<p><span>Hello Gerry</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your assistance with this inquiry.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I did follow your advice. I also tried a couple of things I thought of myself. I managed to install Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I reset my Ideapad to its factory state and I tried to install Windows 10. I chose to keep the existing settings and files. The installation failed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried again and I chose a clean installation. I did not keep my existing settings or files. Windows 10 installed and it is now running well. I think there must have been some issue
 with the legacy software which came with the Ideapad. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I found a very useful site with drivers for my Ideapad at the following link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><a href="http://www.driverscape.com/manufacturers/lenovo/laptops-desktops/s10-3/4456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.driverscape.com/manufacturers/lenovo/laptops-desktops/s10-3/4456</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The main driver that I needed was for the synaptics touchpad. I installed it and it is working well. The ideapad has accepted all of the other drivers that come with Windows 10. My
 sound, display, and wired and wireless internet connections are working well. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best wishes</span></p>

<h2>            Trim recorded DVR clip</h2>
                    
<p>When i have saved e.g. the last 5 minutes recording of the game via game dvr, how can i trim the clip e.g. to only have the 3 minutes i actually want.</p>

<p>I tried using upload studio, but after trimming it only gives me the option of uploading to a website not to same back on the xbox one.</p>

<p>Is there a way to trim the video and then either save as a new file on the console or ideally overwrite the 5 minute clip.</p>
