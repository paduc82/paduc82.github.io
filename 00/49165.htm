<h2>            Can&#39;t change Sleep Mode settings</h2>
                    I have windows 10 on my desktop. In Power and sleep settings no matter what i do, it keeps resetting every evening back to sleep after 1min. I have changed reg settings and made custom power settings, but nothing works for more than a day or two. Getting
 very tiresome!

            Hi Darrell.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> Adjust your Display, Sleep and Hibernate settings in Power Options:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>
<br />
<br />Try changing your Power Plan.  If only one or two is listed, right click Battery icon in System tray at right end of task bar, choose Windows Mobility Center, under Battery Status choose dropdown to add another Power plan
<br />
<br />If your Power Options settings are set correctly then the next suspect is the screensaver which is mysteriously setting a 1 minute timeout to blank Screensaver when some Themes are chosen. Check that now at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen &gt; Screen Saver Settings.
<br />
<br />This could also pertain to an issue of Unattended Sleep Timeout setting in Registry.  See the Marked Answer here for what has worked for others:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-keeps-going-into-sleep-after-1-minute/787e8cea-32ce-4ea0-a281-13c32a75352d?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Whenever modifying the registry, first set a System Restore point:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Power. This may resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try resetting your power plan to default settings:

    <title>Reward Points issued instead of Gift Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> handsome jake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reward Points issued instead of Gift Card</h2>
                    
<p>On 8/3/15 I pre-ordered Rare Replay and it was to come with a 10 Dollar Gift card. After placing the order I&nbsp; received a conformation e-mail and this was at the bottom.</p>
<p>"Rare Replay for Xbox One - Additional Product Information:</p>
<p>Your $10 Xbox gift card code will be sent to email address associated with purchase within 10 days of game being shipped."</p>
<p>I pre-ordered a game off the Microsoft Store online and never received the 10 Dollar gift card for pre-ordering. After working with support online I found that this was issued reward points and not the gift card I was expecting. I was planning on using this
 in store or on-line. If there is a way to use points in either of these place I'm unaware.</p>
<p>Please help. Why did I get points and not a gift card? Can I use points in store? What do I need to change so that I am issued a Card and not points for future purchases.</p>

<p>You received the rewards credits because you are a rewards member. While the promotion is running, you will receive those credits instead of the gift card. You can only use the credits to make purchases from the Xbox Live store (digital purchases)</p>
<p>The offer is only valid on up to 3 pre-orders. So if you've pre-ordered anything else, you will most likely get the credits again. The only way to ensure you won't receive the credits, is to make the purchase using an email address that is not attached to
 your Rewards account.</p>
<p>For future reference, it's best to post in the Rewards forum for assistance with the program -

From the issue description, I understand that you want to know if can self re-register dhcp/dns. I will be glad to assist you on this issue.<br />
<br />
1. Which operating system is installed on the computer?<br />
2. Which devices are re-registering the dhcp/dns?<br />
3. Are you connected to domain?<br />

The issue seems to be on the domain. If you are connected to domain, then I would suggest you to contact your system administrator for support.</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            security event viewer IPSec services</h2>
                    Hello, this&nbsp; is my first post. I have XP home version 2002 with service pack 2 and 2.0 GB ram. The question I have is about a message in my security event viewer. I am a newbie, so I am nervous about this message I don't understand. It is as follows: date:
 "3/7/2012, source:security, category: policy change, type: failure aud, event id: 615, user: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE, computer: home. Description: IPSec Services: IPSec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the machine. This
 can be a potential security hazard to the machine since some of the network interfaces may not get the protection as desired by the applied IPSec filters. Please run IPSec monitor snap-in to futher diagnose the problem."&nbsp; My computer got infected 2 years ago

            &gt; Who is the NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE and why are they the user on my computer?<br />
<br />
This is not a "real" user.&nbsp; Rather, it is an authentication used by the Windows OS to run specific services on your computer.&nbsp; Every computer contains this authentication.<br />
<br />
&gt;Also what is the IPSec monitor snap-in, where do I get it and how do I use it?<br />
<br />
This is a Microsoft Management Console (mmc) snap-in.&nbsp; To use it:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "mmc"<br />
When the console windows appears:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; Add/Remove Snap-in -&gt; Standalone (Tab) -&gt; Add (button) <br />
Click on the snap-in you want then:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Add" -&gt; Close -&gt;&nbsp; OK<br />
The plug-in will then appear in the window.&nbsp; Explore if you desire.<br />
<br />
From my experience, the event you describe is fairly normal and does not necessarily indicate that there is a problem in this area.&nbsp; The event viewer is normally filled with "errors" that can be considered to be fairly normal.&nbsp; If you are having shutdown problems,
 I recommend that you start here (don't let the word "advanced" scare you off):<br />

    <title>Requirements for Cortana&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanlavigne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Requirements for Cortana&#63;</h2>
                    <p>According to this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.bing.com/search?q=why+isn%27t+cortana+available+on+my+windows+10+pc&amp;filters=guid:%22c5e29e75-7375-4ed7-8c09-e6baf8ca78cc%22%20lang:%22en-us%22&amp;form=S00028</p>
<p>
</p><p>the requirements needed for Cortana to be available are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Choose a language from the list of available languages. Done, English (Canada) is chosen and set as default. I am assuming this is equivalent to Canada: English, as seen in the 'Regions and languages' tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Select a country or region setting that corresponds with the Windows Display language. Done, Canada is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Check speech language setting. This is one is set to English (United States). I have no other options. Do I need English (Canada) as the selected speech language? When following the instructions of the 'Language packs' tab, I can only proceed to step
 3. Under the 'Speech' section, I can only select 'Settings' but not 'Download' as is specified in step 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Windows 10 for several months now. However, I do not seem to be able to receive this feature although the requirements seem to have been met (albeit I am not certain for #3). Also, I do not think I have the November or Threshold 2 update applied
 to my system. My system seems to only update Windows Defender every once in a while and that's about it. My current system build is 10240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be welcome,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Canon Imageclass D320 All-in-One Printer not installing in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>My new Windows 7 laptop is unable to install a driver for the Canon ImageClass D320 Printer. The plug &amp; play utility in Windows 7&nbsp;has been unsuccessful in finding a driver for the D320. I have the installation disk which came w/the D320, but it's also failing
 to install a driver. (That installation disk includes drivers for only Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 9X, &amp; Windows Me.) The Canon support site @

 Perhaps&nbsp;the D320&nbsp;needs a 64 bit driver???</p>

<p>I am using Firefox as my Internet browser.&nbsp; However if I&nbsp; use exactly the same link using Internet Explorer 9 I don't see any Windows 7 drivers.&nbsp; If I use Internet Explorer 9 and change it to Compatibility View I can see all of the drivers.&nbsp; (To do that

<h2>            Skype ConnectMe 1200 no longer working&#33;</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_other-skype_connect/suddenly-unable-to-connect/46668934-3f89-41a0-9e2c-7cedf29c402e" title="Split from this thread">

<p>
</p><p>Skype ConnectMe 1200 no longer working!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Skype 10-digit (U.S.) phone number still responds to callers with voice mail but the ConnectMe 1200 has increasing reliability problems receiving or placing calls. This has been a serious and ongoing problem. Meanwhile, costs for the service (about $60
 per year) continue to accrue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Understandably Skype cannot be counted on for 911 emergency use but for business or security purposes it can be cost effective. And, of course, there is the "sunk cost" of printed stationery and business cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Skype taking this issue seriously? Rightly or wrongly many customers regard Skype as more than a toy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Skype "support" options seem to result in endless loops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>For a console to "recover" a gamertag it has to download it, since Microsoft keeps the basic information from it in their servers (achievements, gamerscore, etc.). If you're not connected to internet, you can't recover it.

<p>try these steps out. This normally helps when people cant recover their profile.</p>
<p>1. Turn on the console</p>
<p>2. check your storage to see if there is still a save file for your profile</p>
<p>3. if it shows something there, delete it. (only the profile, not items tied to it) If not, just go to the next step</p>
<p>4. clear cache</p>
<p>5. shut down console, wait 5 minutes and turn it on again.</p>
<p>6. clear cache one more time</p>
<p>7. recover/download your profile.</p>
<p>It has worked for a lot of folks who had this same issue...so I hope it works for you.</p>

You have to close the session to move to a different system, as far as I know.<br />
&nbsp; <br />

<br />
So you closed the session (changing it basically to MASTERED format) so it was no longer LIVE and you could not read it on the Windows 8 machine AFTER closing the session?<br />

            I inserted it into the laptop it works on, right clicked and selected "close session", then waited for the icon to disappear from the notification bar. then I tried it in my new laptop, where it still came up a a blank disk.<br />
<br />
also, thanks again for your help<br />
<br />
**Edit** <br />
<br />
I've just realised what the problem may be.... the laptop I have been trying to "close session" on it the laptop it was created on. it was then used in my girlfriends laptop most recently. I guess i need to "close session" on there, not the one it was created
 on, it it automatically closed session when it was first ejected.<br />
<br />
does that sound likely?<br />

    <title>Xbox 360 wired controller not connecting to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 wired controller not connecting to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello. I need some help on this issue. I have been trying to connect my controller to my Inspiron ONE2330 (which is a Windows 10 Home desktop, 64-bit, powered by DELL) and is not working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have read the support pages from Microsoft and Xbox and everything I did came with no luck. It says that all I have to do is plug it in, but just doing that is not helping me at all. When I plug it in, I do hear the sound for when something is plugged
 into the USB ports, however, nothing is happening. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked the Device Manager and saw "Xbox 360 Wireless Controller via Play &amp; Charge Kit" under Xbox 360 Peripherals. I believe that all the drivers that I need are installed (xusb22.inf) but when I open the game I want the controller to work in
 (the game in question: A Hat in Time), it would not input the buttons I pressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I have deleted and reinstalled the controller from my PC repeatedly but still no luck. I have also checked from the joy.cpl panel and my controller does not even show up. Is there a way I can fix this?</p>

<p>This is why.&nbsp; The wireless 360 controller is always wireless, it can't be turned into a wired controller.&nbsp; The cable can only charge the battery, it doesn't send data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use your wireless controller you need an Xbox 360 gaming receiver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sandro!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. This is entirely possible as long as the following criteria is met: Games in your library are Xbox Play Anywhere games and you sign into the same account used to purchase these games on the Xbox App for Windows 10. Here is an article
 on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Install Games on Windows 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally here's a link for XPA Games: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/xbox-play-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Play Anywhere</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this info helps, thanks again.</p>

            <p>Like what was said on the earlier post, you can use a computer that is running on
<strong>Windows XP</strong> and convert the <strong>.bkf</strong> files to actual files. For example, if you are trying to recover a photo or an image, you can save the file to the
<strong>Windows XP</strong> computer as a <strong>.jpg</strong> file and then transfer it to the
<strong>Windows 10</strong> computer that you are working on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand the challenges that you are experiencing in recovering your backup files and we would appreciate you posting your comments and suggestions using the
<strong>Windows Feedback</strong> application on your <strong>Windows 10</strong> computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Its the Network Card controller, nothing special. You can't see the speed of the card in Speccy, and it has mulitple reasons, first of all it depends on which network your connected too... Depending on the router the speed could be higher or lower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see the current transfer rate by opening network and sharing center and then clicking on the Wifi connection. (Taskbar &gt; Wifi icon &gt; Right Click &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Then click on the blue link with your network name)</p>

<h2>            Problem with usb flash drives in windows vista</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div>My laptop, running with windows vista cannot read most of my usb flash drives. All my usb ports works fine with other devices (usb hard drives, mouse/ keyboard, cooler etc) and my flash drive works perfectly on other computers with windows xp/ vista/ 7.
 My flash drive does not appear on "My Computer", neither on disk management. I get the same with a new usb hub, i bought but this one I didn't try it on other computers. I have tried run the "microsoft fix it" for this kind of cases but without any luck. I
 have unplugged all the usb devices, uninstalling all the usb drivers, restart, install them again but still no luck. Please help as I am driving my self crazy with this thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks in advance </div>

            Hi Anil,
<div>Thanks for your answer.</div>
<div>Regarding your questions, please note the following:</div>
<div>1) When I connect my usb flash drive on my laptop I can hear the beeping sound that is plugged in but I cannot see or access my flash drive.</div>
<div>2)I don't receive any error messages at all when I connect it on my laptop.</div>
<div>3)No changes were made before this happens for the first time.</div>
<div>4)My laptop is Acer Aspire 5738 - Intecore Duo T6600@2.2GHz - 4GB RAM - Running with windows vista x32 (service pack 2)</div>
<div>5) The fix-it I ran was the one with file name "MicrosoftFixit.Devices.RNP.2327754969598830.5.1.Run.exe" - version 3.5.0.41.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried all the solutions you have offered me above but still it doesn't work.</div>
<div>I have to say once again that my flash drive is working (tried it today as well) in other computers (never tried in MAC though :) ) and all my usb ports in my laptop are also running great with other devices.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I ran the fix-it in the <b>Method 1 </b>you proposed above, I get the following error message:</div>

<p><strong>What to expect</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft actively analyzes all error reports and prioritizes them based on the number of customers affected by the error signature contained in the report. When a report is submitted, Microsoft will try to determine the cause of the error, categorize it
 according to the type of issue encountered, and send you relevant information when such information is available. However, because error reports do not always contain enough information to positively identify the source of the issue, Microsoft may need to
 collect a number of similar reports from other customers before a pattern is discovered. Although Microsoft might not be able to provide a solution for your particular error at this time, all information submitted is used to further improve the quality and
 reliability of our products.</p>
