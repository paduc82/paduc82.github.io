<h2>            C&#43;&#43; Visual Runtime Error&#58; R6025. How to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    So I have been playing Skyrim through Steam since the beginning of this past summer and have had no problems. &nbsp;Then about a month ago, roughly a week or two before Christmas, I have started getting this error. &nbsp;I have not downloaded and mods or the like
 and my computer was running the game fine up until this point. &nbsp;Now the game is only playable for 5-10 minutes before I receive this message followed by a crash. &nbsp;This error has occurred outside of the game before, however has not occurred in about 3-4 months,
 and only appears now while in the game. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            It sounds like MS Visual C++ has been corrupted somehow.&nbsp; Skyrim uses C++ 2010.<br />
<br />
- You will find an installer for Visual C++ 2010 located in Steam\ SteamApps\ Common \ Skyrim Folder.<br />
- Find the folder called VCRedist.<br />
-Run the installer in this folder - vcredist_x86.exe .&nbsp; <br />
-You will get a window asking if you want to Repair or Remove. Choose either.<br />
Repairing should be all that's needed, but if you continue having problems after a repair<br />
run the installer again and choose Remove. <br />
This will uninstall C++ 2010, and when you run the installer the next time you will have a clean install.<br />

            Thanks, I tried this and at first it seemed to work but now it just seems to&nbsp;prolong&nbsp;the crash by about 10 mins. &nbsp;I tried both repairing and&nbsp;re-installing. &nbsp;Neither&nbsp;have resolved the problem.

            Because the game only has the installer for x86 I assumed it uses the x86 version. If you are<br />
running Win7 64bit check in <span style="font-style: italic">Programs and Features</span> to see if you have Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x64&nbsp; installed. If not install that as well.
<br />

<br />
Is Skyrim the only game causing problems ? <br />
While the following&nbsp; may not seem to relate to the error message, error messages can be misleading.<br />
- Run temperature monitor on both the cpu and graphics card to verify they're not overheating.<br />
- I haven't encountered any problems with Skyrim, yet, but previous Bethesda games were prone to corrupt games saves. If it's possible, roll back<br />
to a save from before the problem started and see if you get better results. If not we can discount<br />
a corrupt save.<br />
- Then we have the forum favorite - Clean Boot. It is possible something else is interfering with<br />
C++, so I would first try disabling my Anti-Virus. If that doesn't help move on to troubleshooting<br />
via Clean Boot to verify if there are other programs or services conflicting.<br />

            It is best to start a new thread with full details of your problem, but -<br />
Give some more details about what is, or is not happening.<br />
Also be specific about what you have done to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Were you also able to play the game up to a certain point ?<br />
If you have not been able to play the game include your system specifications with graphics
<br />
make and model.<br />
<br />

 not resolved: after 15-20minutes of play, game suddenly freezes with R6025 error.<br />
<br />
I checked everything on my pc: video driver, heat, ram, hard drive, viruses/malware, overall system health, Everything checks out good.<br />

I looked all over the internet. I have been unable to find a fix for this problem.<br />

<br />
I just built a Hearthfire home last night as well (Dawnstar) and have had the problems ever since as well. 125 hours+ logged of play (I just got the game a few weeks ago). I wasn't having the error whilst I was building the house, only after I've gone to play
 through other quests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows compatibility center says the scanner is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win7/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Pacific%20Image%20Electronics%20PowerSlide%203650%20Scanner&amp;vendor=Pacific%20Image%20Electronics&amp;Locale=1033&amp;ModelOrVersion=PS3650&amp;BreadCrumbPath=Pacific%20Image%20Electronics%20scanner&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;tempOsid=win7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same query. I am using a Microsoft Surface 2 laptop. It was working fine until wifi tab and settings went missing the other morning. In Device Manager - Network Adapter - "Marvell AVASTAR network controller or Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A
 Wireless Network Adapter" are missing. I am accessing internet through a usb adapter and I updated windows, but still these adapters (Marvell AVASTAR network controller or Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A Wireless Network Adapter) are missing, and wifi won't work
 without the usb adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>System SKU: Surface_Laptop_2_1769_Consumer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I reset the device after Microsoft customer care asked me to do the same, but still the same issue.</p>
        </p>

<p><span><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. Do you receive any error message while installing Windows update?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. What is the KB number of the failing updates?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. Which security software are you using on your computer?</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Refer the steps to check KB number of windows updates:

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Click <strong>Status</strong> to sort by status, and then look for any updates that have a status of "Failed."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right-click an update that has a status of "Failed," and then select

            <p>Hi Jasim :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will not lose your personal files if you upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 (since you cannot upgrade from Windows 8). For more information, see the article below which explains what you'll keep when you upgrade to Windows 10, depending
 on what version of Windows you are running.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 Keyboard Randomly Disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>I've been using a Surface Book 2 for several months now.&nbsp; Over the past three weeks I've started having trouble with the keyboard and trackpad where it will randomly stop working.&nbsp; That is, input on the keyboard or trackpad doesn't register on the screen.&nbsp;
 The computer is not freezing up as I'm able to still able to use the touchscreen to continue working.&nbsp; Sometimes the keyboard/trackpad will start working again after a few seconds, other times it won't, in which case the fix involves disconnecting the screen
 and reconnecting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed there's no dust or anything in the data port between the screen the screen and the keyboard.&nbsp; Also, when this occurs there's no indication on the screen that the keyboard is disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of fixes, I've tried two things:&nbsp; 1) I went into settings, selected "Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices", then removed the Surface Keyboard.&nbsp; It automatically re-installed.&nbsp; 2) I also re-imaged the machine.&nbsp; Neither has helped resolve the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. Some of the possible reasons why your Surface Book 2 keyboard randomly disconnects may be due to software or hardware components of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that there’s no dust or anything in the data port between the screen and keyboard. However, there are some tiny objects or particles that may lodge in the connectors which may not be visible, but can cause problem with attaching and detaching
 the display, hangs or crashes, or other errors.&nbsp;In that case, we recommend that you clean the connectors as per instructions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Detach the <strong>Clipboard </strong>from the <strong>Keyboard</strong>.</span></li><li>Use a fresh swab to clean<span>. (Use 95% isopropyl alcohol or higher if possible.) Clean the silver pins on both faces of the three connectors located on the top middle surface of the keyboard hinge. Rub the cotton swab back and forth vigorously to clean
 the pins. Use a fresh swab surface to clean each of the connector faces (six in total).</span></li><li><span>After you're done, make sure the pins are dry and that there are no cotton fibers on the connector. Reattach the
<strong>Clipboard </strong>to the <strong>Keyboard</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we recommend that you run the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. This toolkit
 will install all the available updates for your device and check for any errors and fix it.&nbsp;You may refer to the article for more information and step-by-step guide on how to run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly make sure that the <strong>Clipboard</strong> and <strong>Keyboard</strong> are securely attached. The Detach key flashes a green light if the
<strong>Clipboard</strong> and <strong>Keyboard </strong>aren’t connected properly.
</span>Push the Clipboard down onto the Keyboard with moderate pressure to attach the Keyboard more securely.</p>
<p>

<p>I have had my Surface Book'2 for 5 Days and this happens a lot. I feel it is software related not hardware as this is a brand new unit. I have just done a Windows update (From Microsoft) and for the last hour it has worked without an issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am due to swap this for an ASUS at the good guys on Tuesday but if this one is fine Id rather keep it as its a lot of work moving to a new computer. If Microsoft could confirm that it was software related and that they have fixed it then Id be happy to
 keep it. If not, Im taking it back</p>

<p>I'm not sure what Studio Mode is, but 3 Days ago I did a Windows update and the problem has vanished. Perhaps run through any available updates and see if that fixes it. Otherwise I love this computer. The keyboard is the best I have used.</p>

<p>Studio mode is connect them together reversely and lay it down as a tablet. I've tried every possible way to fix this issue including updating, calling MS, re-installing OS and re-installing related drivers, unfortunately, not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beside this issue, the CPU often throttled to 0.4ghz for no reason randomly. So I had to return it yesterday.</p>

<h2>            After windows update, apps won&#39;t load on windows 8.1</h2>
                    I had access to all my apps, but after windows updated, the apps no longer load. I didn't install anything before they stopped responding, nothing that disallowed me to use them in any case because I was still able to use the apps after the install. The
 only restore point I have is the installation of that software. I can click the app, but it is just a colored screen and then it goes to the desktop after a few seconds or when I click on the screen. When I go to the side to show the app, it shows the app
 in small but when I select it, it comes up black. I don't know how to fix this.

It was a win 8.1 upgrade from the app store. The software was AVG TuneUp 2014. I didn't have a problem with the app store or other apps after the install and use of TuneUp, but suddenly, all the apps, including the store, failed to load or show the load screen.
 I had issues with the app store before the update to 8.1. A microsoft tech did help to get it where I could download the update to 8.1. Since then, there had been no problems with any app. Like I said, suddenly after an update to 8.1 it stopped working.

<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When (exact date, preferably) was Win8.1 installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Which was installed first, Win8.1 or AVG TuneUp (any version)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Is AVG Anti-virus (free or paid) also installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em>s since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;AVG PC TuneUp (and any other&nbsp;registry cleaner)&nbsp;has
<em>EVER</em> made to the computer? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When (exact date, preferably) was Win8.1 installed? <b>Just before the new year. After christmas.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Which was installed first, Win8.1 or AVG TuneUp (any version)? <b>Win 8.1 was installed first</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Is AVG Anti-virus (free or paid) also installed? <b>It is a paid program but everything worked even after it was installed and used.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em>s since you bought it?
<b>McAfee firewall, not anti-virus</b></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)<b>&nbsp;Not that I am aware of.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;AVG PC TuneUp (and any other&nbsp;registry cleaner)&nbsp;has
<em>EVER</em> made to the computer? [1] <b>I recently undid <i><u>EVERYTHING</u></i> AVG did, but it still didn't change the way my apps reacted. They still don't work.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Win8.1 was neither offered or installed via Windows Update.<i> <b>
(Win8.1 installed through the APP Store, not windows update. It was windows updates that I believe affected the apps. Windows update continues to work even after the FREE upgrade from the app store.)</b></i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The bold above are my answers to your questions. AVG does more than clean a registry. I installed it because of the OTHER advantages that it offered, like defrag, since I couldn't get the one in windows to work. It also allows me to increase computer performance.
 Those are the reasons that I got it.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen problem with Windows 7 Home Basic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shyam sathyanathan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen problem with Windows 7 Home Basic</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron N4110 which came pre-installed with Windows 7 Home Basic which I have been using for more than 2 years now. The problem started appearing first when I updated the Internet Explorer 9 to 10. The system suddenly shows a blue screen
 and restarts by itself when I run Explorer for more than a few minutes. At first I ignored this problem and switched back to Google Chrome. And I did not get much problems other than the tabs freezing in Chrome after this. Then about 5 months ago I bought
 a new Bitdefender Antivirus and had similar problem while installing it. Before the completion of the setup a bluescreen appears and restarts. But after the restart Bitdefender appears to work fine. (I uninstalled it very soon because I was using Bluestacks)<br />
<br />
Then recently I tried updating Bluestacks and after the update it said that my display drivers were out of date and I need to update them. So I just followed the wizard there and updated just my Intel Display Driver (I have on board Intel graphics and a dedicated
 AMD Radeon graphics card). Then when I restarted my system the display was fine till the login screen but was unreadable once I logged in. So I thought there was a problem with the driver and tried different drivers from Dell website none of which I could
 install because I could not remove the installed driver. So finally I tried reinstalling the OS and installing the display driver from my Resource Disk I got with the laptop, after the restart the bluescreen appears and keeps on restarting. If i restore it
 to the point before the driver was installed everything is fine (not everything obviously).<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me with this?<br />

            Some system corruption may have occurred between updating IE, yes. Whether it was during that specific upgrade itself, some form of OS corruption itself between then, etc, is unknown. Given you've tried various different nVidia driver versions, we can
 try a clean install of the OS for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1. A clean install with nothing but the latest drivers, Windows updates (minus Optional updates and irrelevant ones such as IE, etc), and NO 3RD PARTY SOFTWARE SUCH AS ANTIVIRUSES is a great way to rule out hardware aside from the diagnostics I've listed.<br />
<br />
2. If you are on a clean install of Windows and you're BSOD'ing with *116's after a latest video card driver install, the problem is hardware and the laptop will need to be serviced.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>The controller is assigned to the gamer profile when you start the console and sign in. &nbsp;If that controller&nbsp;dies and you grab the other one, the console can't&nbsp;assign it&nbsp;because your profile already has a controller assigned to it. &nbsp;IE: only one controller can be assigned to each gamer profile at a time. &nbsp;So, your best bet (when a controller should die, that is) just swap the battery packs instead of the controller all together. &nbsp;It saves a bunch of time and you don't have to mess around with controller reassignment.</p><p>Another option, if your controller dies mid game, just wire it in until the match is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, you can safely swap controllers or battery packs without killing your K/D... if its FPS your playing, anyway. &nbsp;Hope this helps!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>

<h2>            HDMI to secondary monitor prevents makes computer unresponsive.</h2>
                    <p>On my ASUS Q501LA I have been having an issues with HDMI. When I connect my secondary monitor to this notebook via HDMI it seems that initially, there are no problems. That is until my display turns off, either manually or automatically from the display-off
 timer. When this happens, the primary monitor (attached to the notebook) turns off first, followed a few seconds later by the secondary monitor connected via HDMI. No problems yet, until I attempt to use any input devices to turn the monitors back on. There
 seems to be no response from the computer at all. At this point, nothing can be done and I'll have to reboot with the power button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is nothing plugged into the HDMI port when the display turns off, then I have no problems bringing it back up. Also, if the HDMI is in use, and I try to move my mouse just after the first display goes out and before the second display goes out,
 I can also bring it back up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a Windows refresh and initially, it seemed that the problem went away. &nbsp;I therefore suspect that it must be Windows 8.1 causing the issue since it seemed to have started happening again after updating.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
To add to Andre's good advice :<br />
<br />
COA stickers usually do have&nbsp;a product code as Andre said. Check it carefully and it
<br />
may only have a bar code.<br />
<br />
Images of COA stickers :<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=coa+sticker&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1003&amp;bih=602&amp;prmd=ivnsfd&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dsniTd6cCYndiALP3OSfBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQsAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=coa+sticker&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1003&amp;bih=602&amp;prmd=ivnsfd&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dsniTd6cCYndiALP3OSfBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQsAQ</a></p>
<p>If your COA sticker does not have the product code then save it in a safe place and also
<br />
extract the Product ID and Key from your Windows Installation and save it as well (in
<br />
several locations).<br />
<br />
Use one of these to recover it from your machine :</p>

            You use it in case you need to reinstall Windows 7 on your laptop. <br />
<br />
Make sure you write down the product key on your COA and store it somewhere safe, since ware and tear can cause damage over time.<br />
<br />
Don't put it on your laptop, just store it somewhere safe where it can be easily found in case you need to reference it.<br />

<p>I appreciate your response, but I already did what you said couldn't be done &amp; it worked fine. Since you &amp; others may want to know how I did this &amp; made it work, here are the steps:</p>
1) Boot to another drive (or pull drive &amp; mount as USB drive). You need to have access to the drive while it's not running the OS.<br />
2) *** NOTE *** Make sure you're doing this step to the correct drive!!<br />
From command line, navigate to the NON BOOT hard drive &amp; do "attrib -SHR boot.ini" (Remove System, Hidden, Read Only attributes).<br />
3) Modify boot.ini with WordPad changing both entries to "partition(1)".<br />
4) Save boot.ini (If you cannot save file, make sure you did #2 correctly).<br />
5) From command line do "attrib +SHR boot.ini" (Set System, Hidden, Read Only attributes).<br />
6) Move boot.ini, NTDETECT.COM &amp; ntldr to C:\ (You may need to set Windows Explorer to be able to see system files).<br />
7) Download Partition Master for free from here:<br />
http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm<br />
8) Install Partition Master &amp; run the program.<br />
9) Set C partition to Primary partition.<br />
10) Set C partition to Active partition, which also sets other partition to non-active at the same time.<br />
11) Apply changes. Shut down system.<br />
13) Put the drive back where it belongs. Boot up to the correct drive!<br />

<h2>            Taskbar icons are blank for some apps</h2>
                    <p>I have problems again with Windows 10, even though I really like it. This time, my icons are messed up when I open some apps. There are blank sheets and no matter what I do, they won't change.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from my taksbar. From left to right, the apps I opened are Store, Groove Music and Mail. There are other apps that behave the same.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Download Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 Completely</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys, I recently purchased Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 from the XBOX Live Store. The problem I have is during the download... our internet connection is quite slow, however when the download gets to 74.1% it stops... If I restart the download after a minute or so it stops again...&nbsp;</p><p>I have tried cancelling the download and starting again, however it just gets to the same point and stops.</p><p><br /></p><p>Is there anything I can do to get past this point... without fully installing this game all you seem to be able to do is play the Prologue. For the last 3 days this has been very frustrating.</p>

<h2>            HTTP Error 405.0 - Method Not Allowed on IIS 7.5</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a page that makes an AJAX POST request.&nbsp; It works on non-IIS servers only.&nbsp; IIS 5.1 reports error 500 - Internal Server Error.&nbsp; IIS 7.5 reports the above error.&nbsp; I have checked the
<span>applicationhost.config</span> file and found the StaticFile handler has an * in verbs, which I 'assume' means all verbs are valid.</p>
<span>applicationhost.config</span> file and found the StaticFile handler has an * in verbs, which I 'assume' means all verbs are valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this while searching the MS site: 'Send the POST request to a page that is configured to be handled by a handler other than the StaticFile handler (for example, the ASPClassic handler).'&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; I have not done any special configuration,
 only the standard install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I have to do to get IIS to run the AJAX POST request?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for any and all help,</p>
<p>

<p>There will probably be some folks coming along who know more about this than I but the problem seems to revolve around your network streaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have one older driver (2010) which appears to be a packet sniffer.&nbsp; It may be related to Avast but I don't know for sure.</p>

<p>Also, the minidump files show the&nbsp;vsdatant.sys as&nbsp;a potential culprit:</p>

<em>*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <strong>
vsdatant.sys</strong></em><br />
<em>Probably caused by : NETIO.SYS ( NETIO!StreamInvokeCalloutAndNormalizeAction+60 )</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The vsdatant.sys is a ZoneAlarm driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be a clash between ZoneAlarm and Avast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your situation seems to be similar to&nbsp;what reported in the following topic:</p>

<p>
</p><p>In that topic it was reported that uninstalling ZoneAlarm&nbsp;appeared to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you may&nbsp;benefit from updating the Realtek&nbsp;NIC driver - you may be able to use the Windows 10 driver in the following link (Version 10.018)</p>

<h2>            Snipping Tool</h2>
                    I used to use the snipping tool to take snips of receipts&nbsp;online or other things I wasnt&nbsp;sure I'd be able to get back to. I used it for record keeping all the time. Then it disappeared. ThenI found snip, which is being discontinued. Where is there a snip
 tool so I can take a shot of just part of the screen? I am really frustrated.

            I personally use Onenote which sits in my system tray. Just configure it, right click and take screenshot (Bonus is notes taking). This comes free with MS Office or can be downloaded (free of cost) from <a href="https://www.onenote.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onenote.com/download</a>.
<br />
<br />Let's come back to you losing snipping tool. 
<br />
<br />It should be found under Start button &gt; Windows accessories. If you are not able to find, then you can use below link for some options to find it.
