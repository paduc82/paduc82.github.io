            <p>My install also fails at data migration. You know, the infamous "Getting Reddy" phase after "Getting Devices Ready". However, I checked my programs &amp; features section and found no Symantec software. Another software must be doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the OS sends you the log file of that upgrade failure. If not, I am happy to send you a log file if you can tell me where it is.</p>

            <p>I'm experiencing the same problem as you.</p>
<p>Never had SEP installed on my PC, only Avira AntiVirus. I already tried</p>
<p>
</p><p>- deinstalling Avira</p>
<p>- turning off Windows Defender</p>
<p>- disabling all startup programs &amp; services (except Microsoft products)</p>
<p>- removing all external devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still the same error, updating is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already had this issue with the previous Preview Build, all I could do is to clean install it via a newly downloaded ISO (which removed all my programs and files, of course).</p>
<p>I'd prefer avoiding this step this time.</p>

            &nbsp;I also have a Lenovo E520 which could not upgrade from 9926 to 10041 either from system update or from a downloaded version. I eventually found that my System Drive partition(I don't mean the installation partition) was too small. After resizing the partition
 with Paragon Partition Manager 10041 installed successfully.<br />

            Yes, mine failed at about 20% with a "Cannot install". I stress it was not the install patition which had plenty of space - around 90Gb of free space but the System drive which was the partition that was too small. When I increased that, the install worked.

    <title>Why does it take FORVER to open any MS Office 2016 App&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancyf2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does it take FORVER to open any MS Office 2016 App&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased MS Office 2016 for Mac and loaded it back in April. My apps were so slow in opening that I took the computer back and they gave me a brand new one (I thought it was the computer). I loaded the software again and it was a little better but still
 slow compared to my pervious versions. I recently was so frustrated after months of waiting for each app to open, then waiting to type, switch between the apps or just save a documents that I was screaming and cursing. I took the computer back to Apple (just
 to make sure AGAIN it was not the computer) and we loaded up a whole new operating system and my computer worked awesome for DAYS without the MS Office software. I was in heaven! As soon as I loaded the software and tried opening the apps it went back to being
 SLOW! I need Excel and Outlook for work but this is crazy. I know it is the MS Office software. PLEASE help me fix this! How can MS sale a product that is working so poorly?

            I am using version 15.24 of Word. It seems to slow down even more when I have Outlook open so I stopped using it for now and working straight from internet for email which is not what I want. All updates have been installed for Office 2016.

            <p>I have 15.25 which is 64 bit but is still slow starting up. Often taking up to 1 minute to 1-1/2 minutes to start. Here some Reasons I suspect causing the &nbsp;Slow startup issues.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Older Computers using a&nbsp;standard&nbsp;hard drive as opposed to new Solid State Drive (SSD).</li><li>Using Hard Drive that is less than 1 TB.</li><li>If using Standard&nbsp;Mechanical HD speed&nbsp;should not be less than 7200rpm.</li><li>System RAM needs to be a Minimum 16 GB.</li><li>Number of Fonts in System.</li></ol>
<p>I fail on all but item 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think starting with El Capitan System. Applications and systems are tuned to use SSD's or equivalent type Hard Drives. Because the large physical size of the software to have enough room to load a&nbsp;program and have an adequate&nbsp;working room (Scratch Disk),
 you&nbsp;<span>need a Minimum of 1 Terabyte&nbsp;of space to work efficiently.</span></p>
<p>Also because of Software application size. You need a Minium of 16 GB system&nbsp;Ram and if Computer would accept it 32 Gigabytes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Once program Starts up applications work reasonably fast.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Another issue is the new security system Apple uses called "Sandboxing."&nbsp;All components of the application are "compartmentalized" in containers, so any one part that is affected by Malware does not affect the rest. &nbsp;Using this type system also slows down
 operation. However,&nbsp;Microsoft also has a security&nbsp;system to deal with Malware. Though Microsoft security system works differently, it also slows down Application processes as well. &nbsp;So because the world is so insecure because there are people in the world
 whose passion is to make life miserable for others, to heap destruction. We have to live with Software that larger and works slower, to have security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your computer, although your fusion drive is 1TB. Mechanical Part is 5400-rpm, which is very, very, slow. But I am not sure they make a&nbsp;Fusion&nbsp;Drive with 7200-rpm or 10,000-rpm Mechanical portion. The way &nbsp;Fusion&nbsp;drive is supposed to work, the system
 and any Files that are continuously used&nbsp;should migrate to the SSD section of the Drive.&nbsp;And the mechanical&nbsp;portion is supposed, to store unused or under-used files.</p>
<p>So if your computer is brand new, It might take several days to move everything around, so it works efficiently.&nbsp;</p>

            You need the 25 character product key and an installation file. MS no longer provides 2003 installation files (they want your money for 2010), here are some places you can look to find it:<br />
<br />
<div>
<b>I Need Installation files/CD for pre 2007 version of Office, What Can I Do</b>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Find a friend (new or old) who has the right CD and is willing to lend you the CD. Unlike the very "old" DOS days when there was a signature file on the floppy, there is nothing unique on the CD to identify it. The uniqueness is provided
 via the Product key you use to activate it. So, you can borrow a CD without threatening their installation/activation.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ask at work if they have an installation CD you can borrow. There are often old disks "hiding" in storage rooms</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you or a friend has a HUP installation, give it a try: http://office-watch.com/t/n.aspx?a=1453&amp;z=12 : (PS Let me know what happens if you do)</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Try to find a local "PC Computer Club". There is almost certainly a geek or three with disks you could borrow.</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Find a small local computer store or repair business. They often have old versions of software because they are still supporting customers using them.</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the small repair business they may have old computers that customers had upgraded from that include OEM Office that you could now use</p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You could buy it online. Be very careful who you give your money to</p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Try websites like Kijiji or Craig’s List to see if you can borrow or buy it</p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Try getting one from MS (if it works, please post back here, there are many interested people who would like to know that MS is still providing that kind of support) Replace MS Hardware and Software

    <title>Change license professional plus &#62; Office 365 small business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hugo ahlenius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change license professional plus &#62; Office 365 small business</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have had so much problems getting the streaming "integrated office" Office 2013 Office 365 Small business installer working, so I downloaded the .img for Office 2013 professional plus (with a 60-day trial key) off technet instead.<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can set this to run off my Office 365 subscription license instead of the trial key?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<h3> peterforduk  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Online Library View Grouping - Bugs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a site collection administrator on a corporate SharePoint online site. One Library in a sub-site has a default view that is grouped by a date column. The behaviour of this view sees frequent issues for multiple users in multiple browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Files frequently but unpredictably appear in incorrect groups - even though they show the correct grouping column value. This can be resolved by refreshing the browser window.</li><li>Clicking on a group header consistently takes you to an incorrect filter and returns no results. For example. Clicking on the group "24/05/2019" takes you to the url "[library url]?useFiltersInViewXml=1&amp;FilterField1=Report_x0020_Date&amp;FilterValue1=<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">2019-05-23</span>&amp;FilterType1=DateTime&amp;FilterOp1=In"
 where [library url] is the full library URL. The header for this page is "[library name] &gt; 2019-05-23". Manually altering the url to "[library url]?useFiltersInViewXml=1&amp;FilterField1=Report_x0020_Date&amp;FilterValue1=<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">2019-05-24</span>&amp;FilterType1=DateTime&amp;FilterOp1=In"
 causes the expected files to be displayed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The view is only grouped by the date column descending order, default expanded, there are no filters. Item limit is 30, "<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Display items in batches
 of the specified size.".&nbsp;</span>Several columns use conditional background colors.<br />
</p>
<p>Both issues have been seen in Microsoft Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><span>Hi Peter,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your message in this forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the second issue, you can go to Site Information &gt; Site Settings &gt; select Regional settings under Site Administration &gt; then select the correct time in Time Zone, please keep the set of Time Zone in SharePoint Online consistent
 with the time zone of the local computer server.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the first question, to better to understand your situation, I want to confirm the information below with you:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Do all the libraries in this sub site have the same problem? You can create a new library to check if the same problem will occur.</span></li><li>
<span>Do all the sub-sites and sites have the same problem?</span></li><li>
<span>Could you provide the screenshot of “Several columns use conditional background colors”?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Peter,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your detailed message and screenshot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tested it with the screenshot you provided and it works fine. As steps shown below:</span></p>
<p><span>I created a custom column “Report Date”, then I added the different date in Report Date, then I click Edit current view and set the group by the column Report Date, I can find the correct files with specific date. As shown
 below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ba3d1f5-c17c-4a3f-8667-f2dcc0af39f9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ba3d1f5-c17c-4a3f-8667-f2dcc0af39f9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So to better to help you, I want to confirm the information below with you:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>You mentioned “after the user has been using the library / view successfully all day”, does it mean the issue happened all days whenever users first open this view and the issue can be resolved by refreshing the browser window?</span></li><li>
<span>Could you provide the screenshot of your view setting? You can go to All Documents &gt; Edit current view and provide the all the screenshots of it. Meanwhile, please go to Report Date column setting and provide the screenshot of
 it.</span></li><li>
<span>Do the other columns have the same problem? You can create a new view with grouping by the other column to check if the same problem will occur.</span></li><li>
<span>At the same time, as I mentioned above, I would also like to confirm with you whether all the libraries under sub site and all the sites have the same problem.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Sukie</span></p>

<h2>            camera issue on Linux &#40;Fedora&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw couple of discussions with not really any solution working. I can see that this issue is here longer than enough.<br />
Anyway the problem is that the video is not vorking via skype. I mean I can't broadcast. For some reason skype (skypeforlinux-8.32.0.44-1.x86_64,Fedora 28 before it was Debian) wont work with Microsoft LifeCam VX-1000. Understand that it is old peace of ...
 But still it is working, just Skype has a problem. From certain time. <br />
So my question is how I can fix it.... reinstalling is not the solution which will work. Also older versions of Skype didn't work as I am regularly updating trough whole year and any of versions worked.<br />
It might be easier to tell me where is the problem. If some settings can help.<br />
Or I would like to know what camera will work for sure.<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>

<h2>            How to change the default team site in SharePoint Online</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My customer has possibly deleted on original site collection and has created a new one in its place - now when they select SharePoint from the Office 365 waffle menu it takes them into SharePoint, but into no-mans land - they have to select a team site from
 one of the links in the Quick Launch menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we specify a default Team Site for the users to land in when they go to SharePoint?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p>I don't want to install other antivirus programs. Windows defender is enough and ok for me, but today when I logged into my PC, It looked like this.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02da1591-d625-4ba8-997e-c7be855fc232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02da1591-d625-4ba8-997e-c7be855fc232" /></a></p>
<p>Nothing happens when I press restart now. I went to the advanced settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44cabac9-e21a-425d-a31e-71483e4192e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44cabac9-e21a-425d-a31e-71483e4192e4" /></a></p>
<p>When I try to turn them on, they just go back to off instantly. I found this in the regedit.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81444d63-cd85-4a23-b98e-22b85e85bbfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81444d63-cd85-4a23-b98e-22b85e85bbfd" /></a></p>
<p>When I delete that DisableAntiSpyware value. Everything goes back to normal, but it comes back after 5s and disables everything again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what to do, please help :&amp;</p>

Windows defender is enough and ok for me, but today when I logged into my PC, It looked like this.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/454d30a4-a2b4-42fa-89e5-758cbd05c7bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/454d30a4-a2b4-42fa-89e5-758cbd05c7bf" /></a></p>
<p>Nothing happens when I press restart now. I went to the advanced settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6250881a-505a-4269-9ef1-7d2e5ed6e0fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6250881a-505a-4269-9ef1-7d2e5ed6e0fe" /></a></p>
<p>When I try to turn them on, they just go back to off instantly. I found this in the regedit.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51d8530d-b848-4be5-9b38-a51a9db0e3d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51d8530d-b848-4be5-9b38-a51a9db0e3d8" /></a></p>
<p>When I delete that DisableAntiSpyware value. Everything goes back to normal, but it comes back after 5s and disables everything again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what to do, please help :&amp;</p>
<p>

Just modify the DisableAntiSpyware to 0 instead

            Make sure that there is an empty paragraph following the List of Figures before you try to insert the List of Tables. And make sure that you have selected the correct caption label (Table rather than Figure) for the list.

<p>What to do next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I left it there the whole night and nothing happened. So I used the machine's restart button and the installer reverted me back to 10041 with the error 0xC1900101 - 0x$0018. I've tried some suggestions coming from windows 8 (disconnect peripherals,
 use clean boot, update drivers, etc) to not avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if I have to stay to 10041 how can I prevent the new build from appearing as an update in Settings/Windows Update?</p>

<h2>            N8 C Drive memory low</h2>
                    
<p>My C Drive memory is low at 34.3 MB so I decided to try and clean it up even though all installs go to the E drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest file is SSOCLientsLogFile.txt which is 6.4 MB. &nbsp;What is it and can I delete it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What other files/folders can I get rid of? &nbsp;Grateful for any suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried using Nokia Suite to clear C Drive but it did nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should add that I have cleared cache and history from browsers, have no SMS messages stored and also have deleted all emails .....</p>

<p>applications, office, file manager,</p>
<p>long press on c,</p>
<p>details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have a look at what is using space on C</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common causes</p>
<p>If you have installed smart search beta it tends to greate 1MB log files every couple of days and not delete them,</p>
<p>this will show as documents,</p>
<p>if you look in c: they will show as folders named as dates in the american fasion</p>
<p>ie 20121220</p>
<p>these can be removed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other causes</p>
<p>if messages is over a MB then you probablyhave some lare email attachments temporarily stored on the phone,</p>
<p>why it stores email on C I don't know but clean out your mail box</p>

            The mailbox tip is much appreciated! Although, in retrospect, I should have seen this one. There is all quite a bit of latency between your mailbox server in the cloud and the one in your phone - I noticed some mails would remain in the client weeks after
 I cleared my inbox at hotmail or gmail. Thanks :)

<h2>            HELP&#33; Cannot access MS OFFICE Templates</h2>
                    <p>RE: WIN10, legal registered MS OFFICE PRO</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new laptop is a few months old. My only issue is I cannot access any online MS OFFICE Templates. I would sure love to have that back. I can access my on board templates, just not the online ones. Tried in both WORD &amp; EXCELL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I need to change some setting to allow MS OFFICE to use my internet connection, just not sure where to find the right place to make the change and how to do it.</p>
<p>would really appreciate help!<br />
<br />
(I've already read through all the fixes posted above, but none are for WIN10.</p>

<p>This answer is useless on a WIN10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I obviously saw all the previous answers to this problem before I posted requesting help. &nbsp;As you can clearly see when I typed this: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've already read through all the fixes posted above, but none are
 for WIN10." &nbsp;</span>Had this suggestion worked I would not have posted my question here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no such file path "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">File&gt;Options&gt;Trust Center&gt;Trust Center Settings&gt;Privacy Options" on a WIN10 machine in WORD &nbsp;that will allow me to proceed. This option to "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Let
 Office connect to online services from Microsoft to provide functionality that's relevant to your usage and preferences" does not exist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Can someone who knows WIN10 and can help please respond? And please, do not repeat advice given previously as it does not pertain to WIN10.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Nokia Lumia update not possible &#40;error code 80072f8f&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia update not possible &#40;error code 80072f8f&#41;</h2>
                    I'm trying to update my nokia lumia 1020 to firmware 3050.0000.133x.1001. This firmware should help the touch screen stability. The reason for this is&nbsp;that&nbsp;the screen touch functionality randomly stops (firmware 3049.0000.133x.1003, operatingsoftware 8.0.10328.78).
 At that time I cannot get the 1020 working. Randomly it starts working again. The error code I get is 80072f8f. If I try to update manually I get this code. Rebooting the system does not make it stable. I'm from the Netherlands and the new firmware should
 be available. Why do I have to wait until I get an update and is it not possible to install/download it manually myself (either on the 1020 or via the PC)? I hear from others that they can update their nokia(i.e. 820) via Zune but this software doesn't recognize
 the 1020.<br />

            <p>Hello RobertLansink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all there is no way to update Nokia lumia 820 using Zune, because it is not compatible and Zune simply will not see a device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, only OS can be updated officially, without causing future problems.</p>
<p>So the only update you can get to your phone is OS version. </p>
<p>Latest available OS at the moment&nbsp;is 8.0.10501.127 or 8.0.10512.142* </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reflash your firmware you need to contact your mobile operator or phone manufactorer. As they will install official firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To update your phone for the last available OS, contact you Mobile operator, as they send updates to the devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Maria</p>

<h2>            All contacts gone after Nokia PC Suite updated phone &#40;X2-02&#41; software&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed Nokia PC Suite for the first time today in order to backup my Nokia X2-02 phone.&nbsp;It showed me some notification for 'software update specific to my X2 phone' or similar. I clicked ok and it took a while and rebooted the phone and seems to have
 updated it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the device contacts and messages were&nbsp;erased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not see a notification that software update means the phone data is erased - or may be it appeared but I missed it. At least it could have performed a backup automatically before the format? Anyway, now I'm only left with the irony that the software
 I wanted to use to backup ended up erasing the entire data! :( :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading another thread, I tried 'restore' in Nokia PC Suite. (Backup &gt; 2nd option), there is no list of previous&nbsp;backups to restore from - I just installed PC suite so there are no older backups either!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are the contacts still stored somewhere? Is there a way to get the data? Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>In fact, it should have automatically backed-up data before proceeding for the Update ..</p>
<p>Assuming that the contacts were stored in the Phone memory and not on SIM, check under contacts settings whether the correct 'memory' is selected ..May be that the phone has reverted to SIM memory after the update ..</p>
<p>BTW, search for .nbu file on your PC .. If you find any, that should be where the data is backed-up.</p>
