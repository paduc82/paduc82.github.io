            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>For best results, use a flash drive or flash memory card with available space of at least double the amount of memory (RAM) in your computer, and preferably four times as much memory.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Give ReadyBoost 2 GB to 4 GB of space for best results on most computers. You can reserve more than 4 GB of space for ReadyBoost on most flash drives and flash memory cards.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can use a maximum of 32 GB of available space on any single removable storage device with ReadyBoost and up to 256 GB total per computer</span>.</span></p>

<h2>            Zzzzz Cannot Get My Computer Out Of Sleep Mode zzzzZ</h2>
                    Hi, Recntly My Computer Has Been Acting Up. When Its Idle It Goes Into Sleep Mode, Which Is Normal. It Used Kick Start Back On Immediately After One Touch To The Keyboard Or A Move To The Mouse. Just Recently Though, I Cannot Get It To Come Back On After
 Going Into Sleep Mode. The Tower Shows Its On But The Keyboard And Mouse Are Unresponsive. Everytime This Happens I Shut The Computer Off From The Tower (which I don't Know if its a good idea or not) For A Restart And That seemed To Be Working OK. Up Until
 A Few Days Ago That I Tried This Same Method, The Tower Turned On But The Fan Was Louder Than Usual And Wont Stop Running. It Just Continued On Until I shut Down The Tower. I Don't Know What This Means Or If I Needs Another Computer. I Did Use An Air Can To
 Dust Off The Massive Layers of Dust In And Around The Fans, But Its Still Doing The Same Thing. Any Advise??

</strong><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!<br />
<br />
<br />
May I know the version </span><span>Operating System you are running (Windows Vista or XP)?<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>This issue occurs because some USB mouse devices do not work correctly with sleep mode in Windows Vista or due to one of the below reasons:<br />
<br />
<br />
a. The computer BIOS is incompatible with Windows Vista, or the computer BIOS is outdated.</span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span>
<p><span>b. Incorrect settings are configured in the computer BIOS.</span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c. Incompatible power management software is installed in Windows Vista.</span></p>

<h2>            space marine, wont level up past 5 on live</h2>
                    
<p>ok, so i bought this dlc to boost me to level 6 instantly so i could use my black templar/space wolves armor, however the dlc didnt work and i manually leveled up to level 13, then all of a sudden one day i was level 5, i still have weapons that you cant
 unlock till after level 5 and i have the 2nd slot customized even though it says its locked. i should have been level 25 by now easily, i want justice!!!!!!! and a power sword. could i get this fixed and get some free stuff? this is really pissing me off.
 i've been trying to figure this out, being stuck at level 5 is rediculous</p>

<p>really? are you sure you cant get to level 5 without it? if so then thats a huge rip off forcing people to pay so they can get decent equipment online. the glitch stopped, but i still manually leveled myself, and when i was stuck &nbsp;at 5 i didnt gain any of
 the xp i should have earned. i feel like i deserve a free power sword or something</p>

<p>1) There is no DLC that boosts you to level 5. If you bought a hack of some kind... well... then you got what you deserved.</p>
<p>2) When you registered your "Elite Pass" for buying the game new (not used) which lets you level past 5, you put in a code... somehow your xbox did not register that you were an "Elite Pass" member, and it sent you back to level 5.
</p>
<p>Obviously you restarted the xbox or re-entered the code like any other DLC when this happens and it returned you to your previous levels.</p>
<p>3) To get the power sword download "Kill Team" and finish ONE level. Then log into "Space Marine" and check your loadouts.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Sound Stutter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doomelectro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Sound Stutter</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'am experiencing a very strange problem with windows 10 audio. The problem arises after updating windows to fall creators update which is version 1709. The problem is that the audio is randomly freeze sometimes with huge buzzing sound which completely mute
 my audio and turns back normal in 1-2 seconds. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens mostly when i use some other sound with currently running sound say i'am playing game and some popup shows which has sound and my sound got freeze with that buzzing sound and turns normal after a short interval of mute or i'am in game and someone
 use mic and sound froze or i'am listening songs and something else came like some popup notification sound or other sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed my apps are running fine in these situations but only sound is the problem for me. I'am using windows 10 from the beginning and this problem rise after updating to 1709 version till now 1809 version, before that i don't have any of these problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things i already tried : reinstalling audio drivers (completely), reinstall windows 10 completely (so many times), disabling enhancements etc. Please if anyone knows how to fix this problem. I tried almost everything on internet with no particular fix. I
 did saw people having same problem and i tried their solutions too, but no luck for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more details i'am putting this link. Please notice that i'am only having this sound issue in this video not complete windows stutter. Notice the sound stutter on 3 second in video but in my case apps or video was running fine at that time.<br />
</p>
<p>

</p><p>(Not my video)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!!<br />

            Would you like to update to 1809 which fixes many things. (You can always revert back to previous version within 10 days, if you don't like)
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to 1809 manually to have a successful upgrade. To upgrade to 1809, you should do following -
<br />
<br />A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Uninstall any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can install it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />You can press Update Now
<br />If update now is not successful, then best method is manual method which is below.
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10

<h2>            Quer ganhar 48 horas de Live&#63; Ent&#38;&#35;227&#59;o responda isso&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Bom dia, caro jogadores de todos os cantos deste país!<br />
<br />
Segunda-feira geralmente é um desânimo por si só, não é mesmo? talvez seja o começo de uma semana de provas para alguns, talvez o retorno de algumas férias, ou quem sabe, mais uma semana inteirinha sem jogatina para quem não tem tempo durante a semana e só
 joga aos sábados e domingos.<br />
<br />
Pois bem, quer se animar? Que tal <strong>ganhar 48 Horas</strong> de acesso a <span style="color: rgba(51, 153, 102, 1)">
<em><strong>Live</strong></em></span> gratuitamente?!<br />
<br />
Pois bem, antes de mais nada, esta promoção é válida apenas para quem não tiver assinatura na
<span style="color: rgba(51, 153, 102, 1)"><strong><em>Live</em></strong></span>; portanto se você já é assinante, fica para uma outra oportunidade. ;)<br />
<br />
Para ganhar o código de ativação (será enviada por mensagem privada) responda a pergunta corretamente. O primeiro que responder receberá o código por mensagem. Essa é fácil, hein...<br />
<br />
Pergunta: Em um famoso jogo <em>Beat 'em up</em>; durante uma das fases, é possível encontrar um personagem de um outro jogo famoso sentado logo ao fundo do cenário, em uma lanchonete. Qual é o jogo original e quem é o personagem visitante de outro jogo.<br />
<br />
Boa sorte!</p>

<p>Olá, <strong>Mohr</strong>, <em>Beat 'em up</em> é um estilo de jogo de ação/luta que começou muito tempo atrás e popularizou pelo fato de você percorrer caminhos com câmera lateral e sair "sentando o sarrafo" em capangas durante este caminho. Jogos como
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Final Fight</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Capitain Commando</span></strong>,
<em>Beat em up</em>. Meu primeiro jogo neste estilo foi <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>The Adventures of Bayou Billy</strong></span>, para <em>Nintendinho</em>. Se não estou enganado foi o primeiro jogo de Video Game a utilizar uma gravação de voz, a qual era a do narrador do título do jogo. :D</p>

<p>Hace un año compre la suscripción pensando que solo cobraria el año en si, no pagos periódicos.</p>

    <title>How to move the EFI and recovery partition in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunter jasinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to move the EFI  and recovery partition in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>First, Thanks for taking your time to read this (the only relevant information is probably in the second paragraph).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having trouble booting to the logon screen on my windows 10 computer and after calling Microsoft support they told me the best way forward was going somewhere, backing up all my data and doing a full reset (without keeping files) which I did do. Reset
 this PC didn't work so I downloaded the windows 10 tool disk off of their website and used that to try and reinstall windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason I was unable to install windows 10 because it said something like "the hard drive isn't GPT and you can only install windows onto hard drives with GPT". Then I called Microsoft support again to see if they could help me out and I was sent
 a string of commands to type into command prompt and for some reason one of the commands he sent set up my C drive to only use 200Gb. I told him that I have a one terabyte Hard drive and that I should set it up to use the proper 931 Gb instead of 200 Gb but
 he assured me I could extend it later. &nbsp;after installing windows and downloading drivers/moving files/etc. I have a problem which is that I cant extend the C drive using the unallocated space. I looked this up online and I think it's because the C drive partition
 is not next to the unallocated space partition, there is a recovery and EFI partition in between the C and unallocated space. My computer used the full 931 Gb before as the&nbsp; C drive before I reinstalled windows. Is there any way to move those two partitions
 out of the way so that I can extend the C drive using the unallocated space? At this point I'm willing to reinstall windows again just to fix this.</p>

</p><p>There are ways to move/delete those partitions (especially with third-party tools), but afterwards you'll probably need to repair Windows anyway with repair or setup media because it will most likely stop booting. If you have no problems reinstalling from

<p>Thank you i will do a custom install. Trying to extend it using the "diskpart" commamd did not work and third party tools to move partitions wouldnt work such as easUS for some reason and i dont have to redownload much so that seems like the best way forward.
 I didnt really know if i should delete the recovery and EFI partitions when doing another clean install but that tutorial helped me out. Thank you</p>

            1. The link for Minecraft is
<br />

<br />
<br />I just tested it and it is working fine.
<br />
<br />If you face problem, open your Microsoft Store App and search for Minecraft in that.

<p>I recently picked up Demon's Souls for the other HD console and I'm absolutely loving it.</p>
<p>Its spiritual successor is now coming to the 360. So who's getting it?</p>

            <p>Hi Manasa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I'm familar with the setup as I've successfully done it on my Win Phone 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tablet is Lenovo Tablet 2&nbsp;Win 8/32 Pro.&nbsp; The laptop is Lenovo Thinkpad T530 with Win 8/64 Pro.&nbsp; Both devices are part of the domain&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Win Phone (that works) I installed the certificate by emailing to a hotmail account and double clicking to install.&nbsp; However&nbsp;on the laptop &amp; the tablet, I&nbsp;installed the certificates manually via the MMS snapin, which is the approach to get them into
 the correct stores.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wondierng whether the issue is that the mail app on&nbsp; Win Phone 8 has an SSL switch whereas Wn 8 Pro 32&amp; 64 do not have the SSL switch?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>The fact that OWA also doesnt work on these devices with Win 8/IE10 (but works on the Win Phone 8 &amp; Win 7 laptops )&nbsp;has me thinking it is a certificate issue.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was attempting on, and off for a few days trying different suggestions from the forums to connect windows 8 mail app to our works Microsoft&nbsp;exchange mail, and found that after a number of failed attempts with various ways of connecting that it was
 successful after 2&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;updates where performed, and installed. After a power cycle prompted the updates, and they where completed, I was able to put in the same information that I had tried more than once before, and the connection was made without a
 hitch. It did prompt me to accept security policy upgrades which I accepted, and after that the connection was made done deal. I was working with a lenovo laptop/tablet running windows 8 32 bit&nbsp;operating&nbsp;system. good luck Tom...

            You can go to settings, system, storage, and change how we free up space. You can then select what you want to get rid of and clean.

<p>Try to get your Xbox console closer to the modem, so you can use an ethernet cable ONLY. If that still fails, try a different cable. And if that ALSO fails, I'd guess that the ethernet port of your console might be broken. :(</p>

            Hi Narmada
<br />
<br />5 ways to change the Windows 10 product key.
<br /> 
<br />METHOD 1: Change Windows product key through the configuration
<br />
<br />The first thing you will have to do is access the Windows 10 Configuration, which you can do using the keyboard shortcut: Windows + I key. Once the window has been opened, you should go to Update and Security&gt; Activation
<br />
<br />Once you have selected the Security option on the left side of the screen, on the right side of it you will see the activation status of your device along with an icon in the form of a key that says: Change the Product key.
<br />Click on this option and you will see how a new blue window opens in which you must enter the new product key you wish to use on your computer to activate the Windows 10 operating system.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />METHOD 2: Change Windows product key from the system configuration.
<br />In this case we must also access the Windows 10 configuration application using the keyboard shortcut: Windows + I key. Once the Configuration is displayed, you must do
<br />Click on the System option.
<br />
<br />When the next screen is displayed, you should look for and select the About option on the left side. This will make all information about the computer and operating system you are using, displayed on the right side of the screen. Scroll down until you find and select the option: Change the product key or update the Windows edition.
<br />This will take you to the end of Method 1 explained above, so you just have to continue with the steps already indicated.
<br />
<br />
<br /> METHOD 3: Change Windows product key from system properties.
<br />
<br />In this case you will have to open the Windows File Explorer. When the window is open you should look in the left part of it for the This Equipment option. Once located, you must click with the right mouse button so that the context menu in which you should select the Properties option will be filled.
<br />
<br />This will open a new window, and in the lower right part of it will show the option Change product key, next to a shield. After clicking on it, a blue window will open in which you will have to enter the new product key that we will use to activate Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
<br />METHOD 4: Change Windows product key by running SLUI.exe
<br />
<br />In this case we will have to use the search of Windows 10, that is to say in the search field we will have to introduce the term SLUI so that said option is shown among the search results. Once this is so, you must select that option.
<br />
<br />This will automatically show the blue window in which you will have to enter the new product key you want to use to activate Windows 10
<br />
<br />
<br />METHOD 5: Change Windows product key from CMD (Command Prompt)
<br />
<br />In this case the first thing we have to do is open the CMD tool with administrator rights, but you know how to do this, in the following link is shown step by step: How to run System Symbols as Administrator in Windows 10, 8.1 or 7.
<br />
<br />Once in the CMD interface, we must enter and execute the following command:
<br />
<br />Obviously in the command you must replace the text: xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx, by the numbers and letters corresponding to the new Windows key you wish to use to activate the operating system.

            Hi Narmada,
<br />
<br />Are you getting an activation error in Windows 10, if so, what error are you getting?
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />What version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Home, Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />What exactly is reported under Activation?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

            <p>If your Windows 10 is activated you can reinstall with the 64bit Media Creation Tool. &nbsp;Go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>and be sure to choose the 64bit version. &nbsp;Create a dvd or usb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a file backup to an external device. &nbsp;Do not do a system backup since that would simply restore the 32bit system. &nbsp;You will have to reinstall your programs and restore your files from the file backup. &nbsp;Insert the media you created and restart the computer.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a clean install. &nbsp;Migrating between 32bits and 64bits requires a complete reinstallation of Windows. &nbsp;When you see a screen offering you an opportunity to enter a product key, do not make any entry (you don't have a key) and click SKIP or DO LATER
 to proceed. &nbsp;Your computer is already registered for Windows 10 so it will activate as soon as Windows connects to the internet.</p>

            <p>Need to delete what you have and make a new install from a booted installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install">
Media Creation Tool</a>&nbsp;"32bit"&nbsp;to make yourself a bootable&nbsp;8gb&nbsp;usb thumb drive&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;DVD - 64bit Win10 'for use on another computer'&nbsp;&nbsp; with that small&nbsp; tool program - it will download a huge file :).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Match the Home or Pro version you have and it will activate with no keys needed as your machine is already registered with a windows server from your 32bit install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It will ask for key twice, think the first time there is a&nbsp;SKIP link&nbsp;... the next time there is a DO LATER link.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its very important you do not enter a key - or it will mess up your activation &amp; you'll be installing win8 and upgrading again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to boot from the media and do a custom install... best to delete all of your existing windows 10 partitions.. and install into that big empty space you make.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will make all the partitions it needs &amp; later you can shrink your C drive if
 you like in windows with the disk management program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to make a back up&nbsp;from in control panel&nbsp;including the system image before doing this...save to a non system partition or external drive in case things go wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus you will have access to your files if needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Good idea to copy those important files&nbsp;to onedrive or somewhere.&nbsp; Easier to copy back.</p>
