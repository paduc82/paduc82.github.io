<h2>            Please Help me Solve my Key Code Problem&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Office 365 University today. I came home to download it and I couldn't get pass step one. I put in my key code twice and tried it again but it said my code wasn't recognized or wrong. I didn't get to download my software and I don't know what to
 do. I followed the steps correctly by making an account because I didn't have one and I couldn't get off that page cause of the italic code I had to put in and it kept saying error. Please help me cause I paid a lot of money for this software and now it won't
 download and my key code doesn't work anymore.</p>

            <p>Unless you were able to associate the purchase with an account, it may not work.</p>
<p>So as of now where are you stuck, creating the account or downloading the product.</p>
<p>In any case you are better off checking with support on phone for these issues.</p>
<p>If you mention the country i can look up for the ms call number.</p>

            Hi I bought a new Windows 8 PC in South Africa. I bought it home to Zimbabwe and tried to buy office 365 on line. I was told not available in my country so I asked a friend to buy one in UK for me. I then tried to input the code and again even though I
 have paid a lot of money I cannot access my software. I now have a useless and expensive Office 365. MS is making it very diffiuclt for me to OWN their product. I called customer service who confirmed mine is a valid code and referred me to MS in Namibia.
 I have been unable to get through and on long distance they keepo me waiting for ages. In the meantime I am forced to continue with an unliscenced trial. This is driving me crazy. MS have taken my money and I have nothing to show for it except reminders my
 trial has expired.

            Hi.<br />
<br />
I'm encountering a problem with https://academic.getmicrosoftkey.com!<br />
<br />
I have a legitimate product key from the microsoft store. When I click "Install/Manage", I am directed to a "Setting Up Account" page with a wheel that constantly spins. However there is zero progress. The page is simply stuck there. I thought it was a problem
 that would be resolved after a while, but the same problem occurred again today when I attempted to install.<br />
<br />
Please help. I need the software on my PC asap. I have school work to do.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            I also have been getting this error code. I was on the phone with microsoft from 7pm to 1:25am trying to get a download for my new mac. &nbsp; Then 2 hours this morning. &nbsp;They are saying that the transaction is pending and they cannot do anything about this
 for at least 3-5 days. &nbsp; I threatened to call the BBB, write to Bill Gates, tweeted how the representatives cannot help at all. &nbsp;I purchased the key code through best buy and microsoft tried to blame best buy and I got that straightened out. &nbsp;Now they tell
 me this is a glitch they don't see very often and I am reading all the comments and complaints to find out that this seems to be more of a problem than I was to understand. &nbsp;Quick to take money but can't fix a simple glitch that has thrown my homework way
 off and I have never been more aggravated. &nbsp;Does anyone have any ideas&gt;

<p>According to this description, the Trojan <em>tries to steal your sensitive and confidential information.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><br />
I often see this issue with Defender but don't know the solution to that. This pg.<em> says
</em>it detects and removes the threat. Hmmm.... There are many other better anti-malware apps. However, read through this article and try MS Safety Scanner as suggested.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, check your installed programs for anything suspect and uninstall it/them unless you're unsure. Plus, clean out all your temp folders, TIF, Cookies with CCleaner.&nbsp;</p>
<div>You can download it here:<a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds
</a>I suggest the Portable version, unless you want Google Toolbar installed. I don't advise that. After installing CCleaner, and before running it, unselect Windows Defender in the list of applications. Other than that, you can run at default settings for
 now.&nbsp;</div>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that, I strongly suggest you post on one of these malware support forums. This is a serious infection You'll get help from specially-trained experts. The help is free.</p>

<p>OK, but you really should get on this and post on one of those forums ASAP. This is serious. They use special tools to locate and clean malware. They'll have you post log files for them to chk. They're experts at this sort of thing. There aren't any on this
 forum who do this sort of thing, and we're not really set up to do all that.</p>

<p>They're very good at guiding ppl step by step, explaining everything and answering questions you may have during process. Make sure not to post on more than one forum. Lots of ppl cross-post on multiple forums, not good idea!<br />

As an aside, you'll need to change ALL your passwords, for one thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>See Edit below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there's not much point in doing it before your system's clean. Another thing is, store all your passwords Offline in a safe place. Print them out, since something like this can locate them on your system. Get a password generator like Keypass&nbsp;<a href="http://keepass.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://keepass.info/</a>
 Create fairly long pw's, more than 8 chars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just use Keypass,&nbsp; myself, to generate random passwords. Make them long, but they're so secure you won't be able to remember them. That's why printing out is the way I do it. Yes, it's a bit more time consuming to have to look them up ea time you sign
 in, but it's worth it. I put them all in rich text doc, with two columns. Print an extra copy and keep in a different place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could purchase a good password mgr., if you want to go that route.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's good you got help so quickly. But I checked those forums, and you've posted on both of them. That's not&nbsp; good. :( I'd suggested to post on
<em>one</em> of them. You need to post a reply on the other one, which you aren't getting help on yet. Tell them you're being helped on Bleeping Computer, that you made a mistake.. Experts help on various forums, and that's frowned on. Two people can't help
 at once on same issue, and it wastes time of those replying.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Shoulin Brijmohan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry to know that you are facing an issue with having to repair and activate Office 2013 every day. I will be assisting you to resolve this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This generally happens if the original Office installation has not been installed correctly. In order to resolve this issue it would be best to uninstall the current installation – remove all
 the remnants of the software and then reinstall Office 2013. Let us follow these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to use the FIXIT from the following Microsoft link to un-install your current Office 2013 installation.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501/en-us</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once uninstalled make sure to restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try reinstalling Office 2013 again and check if this works to resolve your issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the same issue after Office requested me to update. Update didn't install correctly and sent just this error. I've tried to repair it online but next day became the same error.</p>
<p>Is really only way to reinstall Office and lost any customization?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Micro Stutter w&#47; Gaming Mode &#43; G-Sync in Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
                    When enabling the Gaming Mode in Rainbow Six Siege, it leads to micro stutter and more, which makes the game unplayable. When turning the gaming mode off, it works as usual. Not sure if it's because of G-Sync though.

            The stutter is gone now, however turning on the Game Mode ingame seems to change the mouse speed / DPI. It feels slower with Game Mode on.<br />

<p>Is that the reason why my "Windows10InsiderPreview.exe" file (on PC, Windows 7) doesn't do anything, and just takes me to Windows update with the message "Windows is up-to-date" ?</p>
<p>Or was the&nbsp;"Windows10InsiderPreview.exe" file supposed to actually install something?</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 for Mac Displays wrong number of Unread Messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris pleasants  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac Displays wrong number of Unread Messages</h2>
                    <p>I apologize if this has been asked and answered, but the only relevant items I could find were pertaining to Outlook for Mac 2011 and I don't think the solutions are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue where Outlook 2016 is showing me that I have 2 unread messages when I in fact have one 1 unread message. I've confirmed that I have no sub-folders with any unread messages and have displayed only my unread messages and there is only the
 1. I've even right clicked on the Inbox and chosen "mark all as read", in which case the 1 actual message becomes read leaving me with 1 phantom unread message. I've since marked my other message as unread again as I want to leave it that way for now. So I'm
 a back to 2 unread messages even though there is in reality only 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're connected to an Exchange server in the officer here, so IT had me sign on to a Windows machine and open Outlook there to see if there was something wrong at the Exchange level but the Exchange server correctly lists me as having only 1 unread message.
 So, I know the problem is on the Mac, but I have no idea how to solve it and neither does our IT department (I'm the only Mac user in the company so their Mac knowledge is limited).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fixes I've found with online searches all pertain to Outlook for Mac 2011 and seem to want to recreat an "Identity" but I assume the same fix won't work in this case as holding option while loading Outlook doesn't seem to do anything. Perhaps I'm doing
 something wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Solved. I did indeed have to create a new identity, but the method for doing so is slightly different for Outlook for Mac 2016. I went to the following link and found the method to accomplish this part way down:</p>

                    <p>Okay, I'm using Windows 10, and despite having installed another anti-virus/anti-malware/anti-spyware program (which I use frequently) Windows Defender won't deactivate. And has been causing many problems, by trying to run on it's own to update its database
 or scan, when I don't want it to. Causing my computer to crash from the processor not being able to handle it going with my other programs and such.</p>
<p>

    <title>Can cross-references be preserved in converting from Word 2010 to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woneil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can cross-references be preserved in converting from Word 2010 to PDF&#63;</h2>
                    I run Word 2010 under Windows 7. I often have need to make PDFs from Word documents and find that the Save as PDF function is, to say the very least, not an improvement over using Adobe Acrobat plug-ins in earlier versions of Word. Word's insistence on
 degrading images, even when it mendaciously claims to be producing a file suited for printing, is widely known and lamented. But I have another problem that is even more significant in many cases: Word's failure to preserve cross-references in converting to
 PDF. Specifically, (1) the links in the Table of Contents and Table of Figures are lost. (2) The links to footnotes and endnotes are lost. (3) Manually inserted cross-reference links are lost.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I suppose it's a forlorn hope, but I wonder whether anyone knows of a way to preserve the functionality of cross-references in converting to PDF – something short of manually inserting hundreds of individual links in the PDF file itself.</div>
                </div>

            <p>I'm not sure how much it will help with general cross references, but are you enabling the option to create bookmarks? When you select PDF as the save type, there is a button for Options. If you click it, you get this dialog.</p>

<p>It appears that, by default, the "Create bookmarks using" box is not checked. If you check this box, then at least you'd get the equivalent of a TOC.</p>

            Thanks. I should have mentioned that I do check the "create bookmarks" box, which does result in preservation of ToC links (and links in other tables such as a table of figures).&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>One mystery is that the "headings" radio button is checked by default when "create bookmarks" is activated, but "Word bookmarks" is grayed out and cannot be checked.</div>

            I've now found a solution, at some extra cost (and only for Windows)—the novaPDF plug-in for Word and Excel,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.novapdf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.novapdf.com/</a>. In the $50 Pro version you get almost unlimited control over the details of what
 is and is not included in your PDF output. I've had it for only two days and find myself using it constantly.&nbsp;

            I can't reproduce the issues you are having with preserving hyperlinks to cross-references. Assuming that the references are hyperlinked in the Word document, the links appear to work when saving as PDF too.

            The key is you need to use a PDF printer driver that supports the hyperlinks. As you've seen there are issues with the built in one.&nbsp; It certainly is limited when compared to Acrobat, which is the industry standard for PDF (just as Word is for DOC/DOCX
 format). <br />
<br />
Many of the free PDF Printer drivers also do not support hyperlinks, but there are some if you keep looking.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this fix will work for you too<br />

</span>
<p><span>This fix worked like a charm for me in Word 2010 with Acrobat Pro 9.5. Neither "Save &amp; Send to PDF/XPS" or printing to PDF (both under the&nbsp;File tab) worked. Here's what did work:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Word, click on "Save As" (also under File)</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under "Save as type" choose "PDF."</span></p>

<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click the Options tab. A new pop-up window will appear.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Uncheck "Document structure tags for accessibility" and click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Back on the "Save As" page, click "Save."</span></p>
<p><span>Doing this, all my hyperlinks in the Word footer (attached to thumbnail images) worked fine in the PDF.</span></p>

            Here's what I've done.
<div><br />
<div>I just made a very simple document in MS Word 2010 which contains one footnote, one endnote, one cross-reference to a figure in the document, and one cross-reference to a heading in the document. I saved it as a PDF using exactly, precisely the procedure
 described, with no deviations whatever. The resulting PDF did have links to the figure and heading, and did not have links to the footnote or endnote.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since my work requires footnotes and endnotes, that's no good at all for me. If it's adequate for other people I'm happy for them, but it's not adequate for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've made my contribution to the Romanian economy by buying novaPDF Pro which, in sharp distinction to the Microsoft standard, has a clear and simple interface, powerful capabilities, and reliable operation. I look forward to the day when there is meaningful
 competition for MS Office.</div>

            <p>I've found the problem is when the Figure or Table reference in the document is within a text box. When converted to a PDF those links do not work, no matter what boxes are checked in Word (I've followed all of the above suggestions, and then some). &nbsp;Take
 the 'Figure #: Name' out of a text box and they will become a hyperlink in PDF. I don't want them out of the text box because it messes up the formatting in Word. &nbsp;Any suggestions to fix that in Word, or will novaPDF overcome that issue? &nbsp;</p>

            How are you converting to PDF? In Word 2010, hyperlinked cross-references seem to work properly when using Word's built-in Save As PDF feature.

<h2>            Using MS Project 2016 for Ticket Management</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am Project/Program Manager looking for templates or guidance on how to use MS Project for ticket management. Our Program would be considered Change Management, and we work on hundreds of tickets in which the client puts in a request for firewall changes.
 We track each separate request in its own individual ticket. We are currently using Excel to track our tickets, but I am looking for a way to improve our current process. We have certain tasks that must happen on each ticket, and I would like to incorporate
 those tasks (with reminders) into our ticket tracking. If anyone has created a database/ template for using MS Project for ticket tracking, I would love to get your feedback on how to set this up. I am a complete Novice at Project, but I am a quick learner.
 I hope this makes sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>From what you have written, I would not use Project for what you want. It would not offer any real advantage over Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project is better suited to projects where all tasks are mostly related and deliver a common goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read what you have as basic support so try looking for support software. You would get much more relevant reporting metrics.</p>

<h2>            CK-300 carkit &#43; N95&#58; simultaneous listening to car radio &#43; calls &#43; navigation</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I just got the ck300 installed to my car using an ISO cable and the guy forgot to add the AUX-in cable. The result is that I only get calls coming through the stereo. No panic, at least I know why :-)<br />
<br />
However, this has sparked a question: How do I listen to the car radio, accept incoming calls muting radio (working), and get spoken navigation messages also muting radio when needed?<br />
<br />
I understand that when I get the Aux-in cable installed I will then have to switch to the stereo Aux-in channel and so cannot listen to the radio at the same time :-(<br />
<br />
Any help would be great!<br />
<br />
E.g. is there a way to force navigation messages down the phone mono channel and thus out over BT HFP rather than A2DP?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Leon

            This is a software bug and I understand that a fix is planned very soon so that navigation will come through the mono channel and mute the stereo like a phone call.

            Hi Leon<br />
As you can see here 
/discussions/board/message?board.id=accessories&amp;thread.id=10227 I'm having niggles with my N95 8GB/CK-300 set up too. The car is supposed to be going back in this week for more work and hopefully everything should be sorted. We can compare installs.<br />
However I did try an additional speaker and if you're willing to put up with that then you do get all the calls and nav sent through it.

<br />
How do you know of the coming fix. Are you in Nokia?<br />
<br />
What SW is expected to be updated? CK300, CarMenu or NokiaMaps?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />

<br />
Personally, I much prefer taking calls thru the stereo for both quality and also not having more junk in the car :-)<br />
<br />
I will be contacting my install guys today about the missing aux-in cable and lets see what they have to say.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<p>Hi I have a newly installed CK-300 which I'm using with my N96.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My installer was very anti-Nokia and said "Do you realise how **bleep** these kits are? Parrot are years ahead, you'll have nothing but problems with it, especially with music streaming" I was gutted, but I'd prepaid for installation so had to go ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in the first few days I am getting very clear calls through it and music is working but every 30 seconds or so the music stops briefly or breaks up abit then continues, like it loses the connection briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else had this? The software in the N96 is buggy so I'm wondering whether its that rather than the ck-300.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I'm fully up to date with the N96 software and can't update the CK300 because noone has the update cable or is able to get hold of it in the UK.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this is phone related rather than the CK-300. Music streaming is the one thing I have no problems with at all. Make sure you're running the latest version of CarMenu though.</p>

<p>You will need the&nbsp;latest version (1.4) software to get continuous music since the early versions had issues with streaming on certain phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you running car menu on the N96?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Scoobyman said theres a place in Nottingham which has a cable, do you know which it is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My installer was 'CW' (well known group, don't want to name names on here) and the guy didn't even agree that the ck-300 could be updated. He was very anti-nokia and said the Parrot kits was the one I should have bought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeh, I'm running Car Menu and the software in the ck300 is 1.2 so I guess thats where the problems lie, as you say, because its an early version of the software. Everything else is working fine, touch wood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in Oakham, but my business is in Leicester. There's a Carphone warehouse repair centre which is an accredited Nokia place on Welford Road there and a place called Phone City which is on the road where I drive in. I've emailed them to ask if they have
 one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often go to Nottingham so would be good to find out the place there which definately has one, I've heard alot of people say they were told about Nottingham but lived too far away from there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your help&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Phillips,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to clarify few things before we proceed:</p>
<p>How many email accounts are setup on Outlook and how are they configured (POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync or Exchange Server)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may remove and re-add the email account and check if it helps. To add an email account on Outlook 2013 follow the steps from the link below:</p>

            There is a good chance the error means that Outlook has encountered a corrupt message on the server which it cannot download. Who is your email provider, AOL, GMail, someone else? If it is a corrupt message, please see this thread for a method to use to
 locate and remove the offending message(s):<br />

<br />
I've experienced a message corruption issue with an IMAP account I have, and, while Outlook 2013's behavior was different for me in that it simply halted dead in its tracks instead of giving me an error message when it encountered a corrupt email, I was able
 to solve the problem by using the Webmail service this ISP provided to copy batches of emails to another folder which I created, delete the originals in the Inbox, then copy them back to the Inbox again.<br />

    <title>Has anyone had any luck successfully running NorthwindOleDb sample - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Has anyone had any luck successfully running NorthwindOleDb sample under Visual Studio 2005 &#63; </h2>
                    Hi,all. I can get the NorthwindOleDb sample compiled, but I get the "Error - Initialize database" message when I try<br />
to run the program using the Pocket PC 2003 emulator.<br />
<br />
I use the debugger and traced the root of problem at:<br />
"hr =CoCreateInstance( CLSID_SQLSERVERCE_3_0,0, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER,IID_IDBInitialize, (void**)&amp;IDBInitialize);"
<br />
<br />
I installed the SQL Server 2005 Mobile Edition with VS 2005. Any help will be really appreciated.<br />

</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sign in to Office and reactivate it with your account:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>a. Go to the Library folder and open Group Containers. Ctrl+ click each of these folders if present, and Move to Trash.</span></p>

<p>This is bad, bad advice! If you do this -- as I did -- you're not just fixing the Excel problem (yes, it did fix it), but you're also blowing away all your Outlook messages and settings! I retrieved the data from backups, so managed to recover. But this
 advice is quite simply not good!</p>

            Beware "<span>UBF8T346G9.Office" contains all your Outlook "on my computer" folders. I tried this but lost all my local email folders so had to reinstate "</span><span>UBF8T346G9.Office".
 Then the excel problem came back. I will just live with it unless someone can identify a safer way to remove the Excel issue.</span>

    <title>Office 365 - Wacky Excel Online printing... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 - Wacky Excel Online printing...</h2>
                    <p>I made some spreadsheets and downloaded to OneDrive so I could just open in Excel online browser and print.&nbsp;I was able to use Ctl-P to open print dialog and print. with much clicking I was able to print. Now it seems this no longer works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome - Now when I use Ctl-P a different dialog box comes up for "Print Settings" I have to change to "letter" and "fit to one page" When I hit print the document does not print and a dialog comes up "Microsoft Excel Online" "Done printing"&nbsp;"Didn't&nbsp;print
 correctly?".&nbsp; The document does not print at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer - I had not been using IE so I updated to the latest IE and tried with different results. Under IE I am able to print but its all wacky! I hit Ctl-P and the&nbsp;"Print Settings" comes up at the same time the windows printer dialog box comes
 up. If I just hit print there it prints out the current view with the IE menus and everything. So I hit cancel&nbsp;and change to "letter" and "fit to one page", and hit print. Two different Print dialogs come up in succession and I am able to print.
</p>
<p>Whew. </p>
<p>So now I don't use ctl-p and &nbsp;I just hit the print button in Excel and change the Print Settings and hit Print, wait one, two and hit Print again.</p>
<p>I'm tired just explaining it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives.&nbsp;I use Chrome, can I get it to work again in Chrome?</p>

<p>Hello Douglas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shortcut key for you to print Office Online files is
<strong>Ctrl+P</strong> on both Chrome and Internet Explorer. You will see a single window on Chrome for Print Settings where you can select your preferred Paper Size, Print, Page Orientation, and Scaling. This is the normal way to print your Excel online file.
 While in Internet Explorer it will give you 2 windows, one for <strong>Print Settings</strong> and the other one is for
<strong>Print using system dialog</strong>.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8e08d81-7c51-487b-bf56-6d5f1ba420bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8e08d81-7c51-487b-bf56-6d5f1ba420bb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can send us a screenshot if you have other options or windows using Chrome when you use the shortcut key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to use the <strong>Print using system dialog </strong>in Chrome? Try to press
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+P</strong> for you to have print option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll give you further assistance if needed.</p>

<p>No, this is not it. Ctrl+Shift+P prints but it’s a screen shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chrome - &nbsp;It seems to be something that has changed in the way it works. For months, I hit Ctl-P and several print dialogs would come up in succession. Click, click click.. it was annoying but it did print. Now the “print settings” comes up, I have to change
 to letter each time and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">it does not print.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">IE</span> - I hit Ctl-P and the “print settings” comes and the Windows print dialog. If I just hit print it sends like a print screen to the printer. If I cancel the windows print dialog, change the “print settings”
 to letter and click print again, I get “Microsoft Excel Online “print preview”, and then a different Windows print dialog with print preview over it. And then I can print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not working right. It is a bug or something. It worked and now it does not work.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Migration issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickvia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Migration issue</h2>
                    <p>We are in the process of migrating users to the cloud but will be running hybrid environment with some mailboxes remaining on-site. I have a handful of users that after the migration, are receiving duplicate voicemail messages relayed from Unity 8.5x. These
 messages are showing up in the user's Sent Items folder and are where the user has left someone else on campus a voicemail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We temporarily broke the link between Unity and the Office365 to see if we could pinpoint the source of the messages, but they continued to propagate.&nbsp; Not sure if these messages are corrupted in some manner that prevented them from migrating initially or
 what. The migration batches completed for these users and all other mail functions are working correctly, just this duplicate vm messages issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed in looking at backups of local mail server (on-site) that I can see these messages located in the still present mailboxes of the affected users. My question is could these messages be coming from on-site server, and if so, why and can I stop
 it? Already had one user run out of space and having to run damage control on others.
</p>
<br />
<p>All users are running Office 2016 locally</p>

            Sorry for the delay in responding. It appears that this is a confirmed bug with multiple versions of Cisco Unity Connection. The engineers have no idea of why this is happening but apparently there have multiple cases reported.&nbsp; It appears that something
 in the migration to Office365 is causing some user's voicemail mailboxes to become corrupted. At this point, the only option is to delete the user's Unity voicemail mailbox and recreate it. At that point, Unified Messaging can be re-enabled and no further
 replication of messages has been seen.<br />

<p>An alternative way to connect your Nokia E7 to a Windows computer is through bluetooth. But I since assume you are also having problems charging the phone so the only recourse is to send it to a Nokia Care Centre for further device evaluation.</p>
