    <title>Outlook 2016 line space formatting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 line space formatting</h2>
                    I've seen this question posted in earlier threads (since closed), but no one seems to have found the solution. With an email created in html format (default), replies to it have added lines between paragraphs. Per some of the suggestions, I have opened
 a new email, than selected Paragraph within Format Text, and then checked "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style, clicked "Set as Default," followed by "all documents on the NormalEmail template." However, this does not "stick."

<p>I am unable to replicate your issue.</p>
<p>You fail to mention what type of mail account is used, pop, IMAP or?</p>
<p>And whether if OL is started in Safe mode, whether the problem is replicated?</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The accounts are IMAP. I have not tried starting in Safe Mode, but I strongly doubt that will change things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned, judging by the number of threads here and elsewhere, this is a long-standing Outlook problem and it has something to do with the way Outlook handles HTML.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Just to make sure, do you mean the famous double line spacing when exchanging mails with Gmail account?</p>

<p>That's entirely possible. I haven't checked whether this occurs only in replies from gmail accounts. But many times it's from business accounts, which I doubt are gmail.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize that's a known thing. Is there any fix if that's the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if not, are there other causes/fixes?</p>
<p>

<p>Well, an awful lot has been written about the double line spacing when exchanging mails between Gmail and Outlook. A search on "Outlook double line spacing" will show that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the matter you are referring to, which I am not sure of, note that I've tried many of those 'solutions', but I am afraid none of those 'standard' solutions worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An exception may be when using specific scripts. </p>
<p>Drawbacks of that is:</p>
<p>you need to find a good working (final version) of such script for your version of Outlook</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you also need to know how to apply / add it to Outlook&nbsp;</p>
<p>or use a Autohotkey script</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside of a 'script-solution', probably when you go into Outlook options&nbsp;</p>
<p>File -&gt; Options -&gt; Mail, then somewhat lower under 'Message format'</p>
<p>and deselect "Use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) ..."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>might solve your problem.</p>
<p>At least you could give it a try. Tagging that option again, will restore the previous situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drawback: the thin grey line, serving as 'message separator' will be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, IF... indeed this is the issue you are referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Holidays to you as well.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks Mike_884. The problem isn't actually double line space but <em>extra spacing between paragraphs</em>. Line spacing within paragraphs is OK. Is this a different issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent email I noticed this in was a reply coming from a friend's business domain address. Does that mean it can't be gmail related, i.e. can the backbone of a business domain email be gmail? I'm probably not stating that correctly. But I know,
 for instance, that a school I work with's email is actually gmail, though it doesn't have a gmail suffix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, 2 questions, I think...</p>

<p>In that case, to be honest, I am not sure.</p>
<p>You might wish to check your paragraph spacing, see screenshot.</p>
<p>(create a new, empty mail, put the cursor in the empty body, rightclick Normal Style, Modify, in Format dropdown select Paragraph).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also how does the linebreaks show, 2nd screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid, I can't be of any further help, am not so much of an expert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            Thanks again Mike_884. I'd done those steps, though without selecting Normal/Modify first. So maybe that'll make a difference, though I have my doubts. Here's what I see. (ignore the dark background setting.)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3320198-2184-48a6-85e3-7e5e71c85392?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3320198-2184-48a6-85e3-7e5e71c85392?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hope it will solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have a 2nd email account, then it may be helpful to send some test mails back and forth.</p>
<p>Obviously that only serves some purpose when the 2nd email account is a non-Outlook one.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsof Excel 2016 - Not coming as Default App in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded to from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 recently.&nbsp;I have installed Ms Office 2013 Professional version after the upgrade. All other applications were working fine expect "Microsoft Excel". Windows 10 is not recognising Excel 2013 for opening Excel
 files but rather using&nbsp; " Excel mobile app " a free app provided by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I have un-installed Ms Office 2013 and installed Ms Office 2016. Still the problem persists with Excel. It is not recognising Excel 2016 as default program for opening .Xslx files. I tried to manual select "Excel 2016" at Default app section under
 Settings in Windows 10 but to my surprise I am not able to see " Excel 2016 " as an option for set-up there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even under Excel 2013 I had problem with working on a data of 100,000 rows , If I apply filters in Excel file and then remove the them subsequently, excel goes in a freeze mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist me in resolving these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Revizor</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, Windows Security Essentials hangs when I try to update its definitions. I have searched your site for suggestions, and Step 5 of its suggestions is to reset the Microsoft antivirus update engine. It instructs us to navigate to program files\microsoft
 security essentials and run mpcmdrun -removedefinitions -all. However, that Microsoft security essential folder does not exist even though I know I have the application because I can open it. Earlier in this thread, someone suggests that that folder has been
 renamed as Microsoft Security Client. I have that folder, but now I am not sure if I should proceed because perhaps these are old instructions and I can do more damage than good.
<br />
I tried running Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (the free version) but it has a similar problem (it hangs when it tries to update its definitions). I normally only have Windows Security Essentials running, and resort to the Malwarebytes when I want to confirm that
 Security Essentials has not missed something.<br />
I was trying to update Windows Security Essentials started because I am getting strange behavior in Spider Solitare. It is not always responding to my click and drag actions and sometimes drops cards before I release. I don't experience similar behavior with
 other applications. It feels like my computer is infected but it is not being picked up by Windows Security Essentials.</p>
<p>How do I proceed? Is there a better virus protection program that I should be using? I am running Windows 7.</p>

<h3> donnayule  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am trying to uninstall Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 version from the Programs and features error message 1719</h2>
                    it will not uninstall, if I was to uninstall all the updates from Microsoft downloads, for the 2007 version, will I then be able to uninstall Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 from the programs and features, I know this would take a while, it would
 clear the computer. and may at that point uninstall. as I am also getting the error message on these updates also telling me that Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 update &nbsp;are not installed correctly with error message 1719.
<div>I have also tried twice to contact Microsoft Help office, and they have told me that they would be able to fix this, so far they have not been able to.</div>
<div>I feel that this would work. if I did not have the updates until I uninstall the program.</div>
<div>Can you let me know if you have had this problem before, also I have had the program installed for over a year and it was running very good, I am not sure</div>
<div>how this happened for sure. but I feel it would work. &nbsp;Also I do intend to install 2007 after it is correctly installed. &nbsp;as I do like the program very much. &nbsp;So if someone can contact back. I will also&nbsp;</div>
<div>contract Microsoft .com and just ask if they can hold the updates until I am able to uninstall the program that is not letting me uninstall. I am &nbsp;sure this is the reason.</div>
<div>I have worked on this for two days know, I am running out of time, as I have much work to be looked after so I can continuing work, I am getting behind, and I need</div>
<div>the program so I can continue, also I have been to one of computer shops where I live, and they where not sure why I could not uninstall they also tried to uninstall as well. As they have never come across this problem, and suggested I contact you at Microsoft.
 which I have on the help desk twice this evening.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I will leave it at that in the hopes that I will receive a reply. Also I must continue working on other project. as quickly as I can. Work is very important, and if you</div>
<div>do not have the programs it can slow you down. &nbsp;Everyone needs there job and more work, so we can continue.</div>
<div>My other option was to do a recovery that will take another few days, and &nbsp;that will take me even longer time is so &nbsp;important write know.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some one from the Microsoft help desk, suggested a Service contract as well. &nbsp;I know these are also important, but for the time being, I must fix the computer</div>
<div>myself. &nbsp;If anyone there has run into this situation, please let me know, as quickly as you can. &nbsp;I also know the technicians need to be paid for there good&nbsp;</div>
<div>work.</div>

    <title>No connection after PC Suite Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helpless---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            No connection after PC Suite Update</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
after I found no satisfying solution in this forum I desided to write this question. Maybe also other users experienced this problem:<br />
<br />
When I was running PC Suite Version 6.7.Re25 (WinXP SP2) there was no problem using the software at all. The mobile (6233) was detected properly via infrared / IrDa. Editing contacts and synchronisation operations where no problem.<br />
<br />
After updating to the new version 6.8 it is not possible to connect via infrared. The mobile is detected and identified correctly ("...mobile 6233 in reach..."), only the connection manager will not connect to the mobile anymore. The application does not crash
 or freeze, its only that showing the "waiting for connection" screen - and nothing happens. Pressing the abort-button still work.<br />
<br />
All the previous advises (reducing connection speed, repair installation of the connection manager and so on) did not work.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about uninstalling and using the old Version 6.7. Maybe time will save this problem.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know a solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />
<br />
Matthew

<h2>            Vector Objects to PowerPoint  on a Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm trying to get vector objects from Illustrator into my PowerPoint on a Mac. In some replies they say export the file as an .emf (did that), either place special as Enhanced Metafile (did that but didn't give me that option), or place the object and either
 ungroup it or right click &gt;break. In each case I do not have that option. Is what I'm asking not possible on a mac? Am I wasting my time?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.
</span><span>Once the EMF file has been placed, right-click the art and select Break.

            Both match and Vlookup will return #N\A if they do not find what they are looking for. As opposed to showing #N\A you can catch that error and return nothing or a message stating that the item being looked up was not found. You can use iferror to do roughly
 the same thing but iferror is more of a shot gun approach in that it makes no distinction in the type of error. That counts in Vlookup type formulas where it can be relatively easy to generate a #ref error by deleting columns and such. By far my preference
 would be to use ISNA instead of IFERROR.

            <p>I just want to cast my vote with Jim Thomlinson on being as specific in your error trapping as you can.&nbsp; While it is easier and faster to type</p>
<p>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A5,'Sheet 5'!A1:Z99,26,FALSE), "")</p>
<p>to ignore the #N/A! error you might expect, you won't ever see the #REF! error or #VALUE! error that may come into play for any of several reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While with </p>
<p>=IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP(A5,'Sheet 5'!A1:Z99,26,FALSE), ""),"No Match Found",VLOOKUP(A5,'Sheet 5'!A1:Z99,26,FALSE))</p>
<p>If one of the other error conditions creeps in, then you'll see it in the results.&nbsp; Of course the more typical way of using IF(ISNA()) is like this:</p>
<p>=IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP(A5,'Sheet 5'!A1:Z99,26,FALSE), ""),"",VLOOKUP(A5,'Sheet 5'!A1:Z99,26,FALSE))</p>
<p>to simply hide the #N/A! from view.</p>

<p><span>What happens when you click on

<p><span>Have you installed the
<b>Microsoft Office 365 Click-to-Run</b> based edition or MSI version of
<b>Office 365 Professional Plus Preview</b>?</span></p>
<p><span>If you have installed Office 365 Consumer Preview Click-to-Run edition then you do not have to activate, as it will be
 activated automatically.<br />
<br />
Whereas if you have installed Office 2013 Professional Plus Preview, then follow the steps to activate:<br />
. Open any Office applications.<br />
. Click on <b>File</b>, Go to
<b>Account</b> button and check if it shoes ‘<b>Product Activated</b>’.<br />
. If it is not <b>activated</b>, then click on <b>Change Product Key</b> under <b>
Activation Required section</b>.<br />
. Enter the <b>Product Key</b> and click on Install.<br />
<br />
Ensure ‘<b>Attempt to automatically activate my product online’</b> is enabled.
</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the steps provided helps in resolving the issue. If you need any further information, you can always reply
 and I’ll be happy to help you. </span></p>

    <title>My OneNote update included a VIRUS&#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amanda gardner  say:</h3>
<h2>            My OneNote update included a VIRUS&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <div>Sometime last night, I was prompted to update OneNote--I've been running 2010, and to my knowledge, I've never updated it. Being tired and distracted over OneDrive taking forever to sync the files I'd added, I allowed the update without thinking too much on it. It LOOKED legit, and my OneNote program has, indeed, changed slightly; it now shares characteristics with what little I've seen of the newer version being advertised. Unfortunately, a short while ago my antivirus program notified me that it had located a virus on my computer--a trojan identified by the name "TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen2," which was found in a file titled "Microsoft 15." I wasn't charged for the 'update,' but am unsure if it's legit or not, what with the virus it included. Anyone else have this problem, or know if the update was, in fact, legit? Hopefully don't have any long-term problems from this mishap.</div>

</p>
<p>The issue as, I see it is, does Microsoft own / support "<a href="http://www.OneNote.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.OneNote.com</a>"?&nbsp; If MS does own this website, is this site supposed to be sending out notices to upgrade to FREE new version of " OneNote Version
 14.0.7147.5001 (64-bit) "?? Next what it the new FREE version?&nbsp; Why would we Not&nbsp;get this new FREE version from Microsoft Corporation itself as we do all other updates??</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Pair BT Jabra BT3030 with almost any Nokia I have</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody.</p>
<p>I just received my brand new Jabra BT3030 Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>I wantet to use it with my N96 with Software version 12.043.098.1</p>
<p>That is impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't find the Jabra BT3030.</p>
<p>I tried the same headset with Nokia 6310i the 6680, the N73 and the E90</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only phone that can see the Jabra is the E90!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why only the E90 can see it?</p>
<p>I also used the Jabra BT3030 with a sony BT walkman and work fine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is an incompatibility between Jabra BT3030 and Nokia N series? I can't figure out what happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please help me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm waiting Jabra response since I contacted them too. But today so I have to wait next week to get news from them.</p>
<p>I hardly doubt they will give their device the giult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>see i too had this device in hand since i bought this for my brother</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>first of all the device is little bit confusing while the light status is too much to understand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>follow my steps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>firmly press the call button at the bottom and wait until it turn on and completly on like all the button should glow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>its default 4 sec</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then search the device with ur any nokia phone&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it should show pair with default 0000 and it should get connect and for ur info since this device has mutiple profile capability take care of it by switching off any other bluetooth arround it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thats it&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from deleting <strong>all data</strong> you have nothing to lose by trying three key depressed power on "hard reset" as a precursor to visiting a Care Point if outcome unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span>To check whether this issue is related to your Credentials, I'd like to suggest you remove your Office 365
</span><span>Credential</span><span>s and sign in your Office 365 account again to see if Word still keeps asking you sign in your password. You can follow the steps below to do that.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Sign out your account in webpage/Office.</span></li><li><span>Open File Explorer.</span></li><li><span>Type this path in the top path box: Control Panel\User Accounts\Credential Manager.</span></li><li><span>Remove all Windows Credentials that with ''Microsoft/MS/OneDrive"</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer and sign in your Office 365 accounts.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please have a try and let me&nbsp; know your result.</p>

            There is NO reason to use Expression Builder. Just paste the contents in. You need to use a MEMO data type. You can then view the HTML is use format a control on a form as RTF.

            Where would you set a query field to any type? &nbsp;For my purposes (a file upload to the web) there is no reason to have the data stored in a table. &nbsp;What I'm pasting is a product description in HTML code and it's the same for 800 DVDs. &nbsp;It's only use is
 in on a website and needs to be uploaded with the file to fill in the product description.

                    Thanks in advance.&nbsp; Mind-mapping software is essentially Visio w/ the ease of creating the maps; are there any Add-ins that exist to serve this purpose???&nbsp; All that I can find, are vendors who say that their software will import/export into a MS product...not
 quite what I'm asking for.&nbsp; Thanks, M.C.

            If you are still looking for it, you can use Insert "Shapes" and "connector lines" in any of the Office apps. But that is a slow and painful method.<br />
<br />
Here are some more links I've collected on the subject of mind mapping techniques in Office and external tools.<br />
<br />
But you can also adapt some of the "SmartArt" types to do simple mind mapping:<br />

<p>For those that want a great dedicated tool, I can recommend mind42.com. Online and a great tool.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to add a recommendation. Start by adding a “New Drawing Canvas.” (Insert -&gt; Shapes -&gt; New Drawing Canvas) It makes moving pictures and objects around SO much easier.</p>

            Ive been using Xmind for awhile. Its a standalone product though. I just saw that there is an Office add-in for a mindmapping app. However, looks like you need Office 2013 for it.

<h2>            Phonebook contact list limitations</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 820 Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my 'People' there are more than 50 contacts split into two 'Groups' of mostly business contacts&nbsp;and a few family/friends but I seem to be able to list a maximum of only 25 'members' in my 'Business' group, why is that? is there a setting to tweak and
 allow more?</p>
