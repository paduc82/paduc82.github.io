    <title>An issue with Instant Replay features for PC Gaming - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            An issue with Instant Replay features for PC Gaming</h2>
                    <div>So one thing I've been doing for some time now is listening to music via YouTube whilst playing a game. But since I got Battlefield V on PC, It seems that the instant replay feature picks up YouTube videos as well as in game audio and I don't know how
 to opt that out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It started with the Xbox DVR feature so I moved over to using Shadowplay as a workaround, but I still had the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So far, here's my diagnosis for the problem:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- As stated, the problem is not based off of the DVR program</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- As a test, I played a music file and it didn't pick up. Meaning that this could have to do with Chrome</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Changing the audio output so it's separate from BFV also seems to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One solution I thought of is to setup another audio output that would also go to my headset as a sort of relay. My theory is that if I setup a 2nd audio output to my headset, I can have Chrome go through that. It would still come out of my headset, but
 my PC will think it's a different device. However, I have no idea how to do that (or if it's possible).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How would/should I go about being able to prevent Xbox DVR and/or Shadowplay from picking up YouTube/Chrome. I just want it to pick up the game audio and my mic, nothing else.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Side Notes</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- I do have OBS and though it does allow me to opt out certain audio, it doesn't have an instant replay feature (at least not similar to Xbox DVR/Shadowplay)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- My headset that I use is a Turtle Beach Stealth 450 (amazing headset, by the way)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Just in case, my laptop is an ASUS ROG G751JL. Other than some better hard drives, my specs are mostly unchanged. (And yes, I am due for an upgrade, but that's beside the point) https://www.asus.com/us/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-G751JL/specifications/</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. I've posted this to five subreddits and two fourms at this point and not a single response.</div>

<p>Hi Gatlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to get clarity on this issue and assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the answers to the questions below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is the Xbox DVR picking up both the YouTube audio as well as the game audio?</li><li>Are you facing this issue only with Battlefield V game?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Before trying the below methods, play some videos on YouTube from <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> or
<strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> while playing the game and using Xbox DVR and check if you are facing the same issue in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try toggling the Exclusive Modes by follow the below steps and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>Sound</strong> icon from the
<strong>Taskbar</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>Sounds</strong> &gt; Go to <strong>Playback Device</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: <strong>Right-click</strong> on your speakers/headphones that are connected to your computer &gt; Click on
<strong>Properties</strong> &gt; Go to <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>: Under <strong>Exclusive Mode</strong>, you will see two options '<strong>Allow applications to take exclusive control to this device</strong>' and '<strong>Give exclusive mode applications priority</strong>', so check and uncheck these
 both settings and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a shot and let us know of any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>How can I change Windows 7 &#40;default start-up&#41; to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I change Windows 7 &#40;default start-up&#41; to Windows 10 after upgrade &#40;Freeze solution&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>While troubleshooting Windows 10 <em>random </em>freeze-up issues I came across the following glitch that MAY be a cause (and I'd like to fix it even if it ISN'T the cause).
<br />
<br />
My system startup indicates it's launching Windows 7 despite the fact that I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp;The choice drop-down in system startup shows only Windows 7, so selecting Windows 10 isn't an option. Windows 10 successfully launches without freezing, but
 freezing inevitably comes later/unexpectedly during the day. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your quick reply, Depika. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you installed Windows 10 in dual boot mode? <strong>no - used normal Windows install/upgrade</strong></li><li>What is the complete error message of this issue?&nbsp; <strong>no error messages</strong></li><li>Were you able to boot the operating system to Windows 7/ Windows 10 as you have mentioned there is no Windows 10 option to select?
<strong>the system boots to Windows 10 and I'm past the 30-day mark for reversing course - I'd love to get Windows 7 back</strong></li><li>Does the system freeze while performing any specific task on your device after booting to Windows 10?
<strong>no - system freezes randomly, sometimes when I'm working and sometimes when I've been idle. No particular program seems to cause the problem.I disabled power settings so system never sleeps. This helped a little to extend time between freezes for a
 few days.</strong></li></ol>
<p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> keys to open
<strong>Run </strong>command.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>msconfig </strong>and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the <strong>System Configuration </strong>window, click on
<strong>Boot </strong>tab, select the operating system as Windows 10 (Make sure you are able to see both Windows 7 and Windows 10).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, Set <strong>Time out </strong>to <strong>0</strong> seconds.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I had taken the above steps before writing</strong>, which is how. I discovered Windows&nbsp;10 was NOT listed under the Boot tab, but Windows 7 was.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In checking further I discovered that Dell is not supporting Windows 10 on my PC (Inspiron from 2011).&nbsp;I'm probably doomed unless you have some ideas I can try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I wish I'd gotten a WARNING that my PC didn't support Windows 10 before the install began.

            <p>SOLUTION: I was forced to purchase a new PC as no other solution emerged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: Removing Microsoft Office software extended the active period between freeze-ups by a few hours and helped avoid freeze during data transfer.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>My Wins 10 PC keeps waking itself up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Wins 10 PC keeps waking itself up</h2>
                    <p>I installed a Windows 10 onto my PC at the beginning of the year, but I didn't realize it was waking itself up until a little further into the months. I keep trying to search for ways to make it stop waking up, and I uninstalled one of the things on the
 list that makes it wake up. But I woke up today to see it turned itself on. This is getting annoying as, I don't need my computer to just turn itself on, waste my home's energy and do nothing. I ran powercfg -waketimers in the cmg but it says: "There are no
 active wake timers in the system." And nothing shows for the reason why the computer keeps waking itself up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the event log, not really sure how to upload it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82199908-9d2f-443a-85f7-781808aea74c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82199908-9d2f-443a-85f7-781808aea74c?upload=true" height="401" width="752" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have saved the system log into a file. Wondering if there are other things I can do to check what is waking up my PC?</p>

<h2>            Operation would change object type...</h2>
                    When I send an email it does indeed send, the recipient gets it quickly and without error, but I get an error message which reads<br />
"Sending email failed with an error: Operation would change object type, which is not permitted."<br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

Yes, I have two signatures<br />

            From what I was reading on some Google links try testing without Signatures.&nbsp; That is just a rough guess and an idea of mine.

<h2>            How do I get rid of desktop displays on the windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On my windows 10 HP computer I tried seeing how many desktops you could create. I ended up making the maximum (I think) of 716, but now I am unable to get back to the screen to disable the desktops. (I think this might be due to so many desktops clogging
 up the computer and making it slow). How can I reset the amount of desktops and/or set my computer to only have one desktop? Thanks.</p>

    <title>Changing Startup Password screen windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_gorf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Startup Password screen windows 8</h2>
                    <p>So I'm completely lost when it comes to this- and I've searched every forum I can think to. When my computer starts it asks me to choose a "Sign-in option"- and it just goes completely to **** from there. Let me explain-</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's two empty spots for text and two key icons beneath the empty text boxes. If I hit key icon #1, my computer asks for my Login Name and Password. The problem is is I
<em>don't have</em> one. If I do have it, then it's a complete mystery. I tried to change it a couple times (went to Settings/Change PC Settings, messed around with every damn thing in there) and
<em>nothing</em> works. There's no information that I can put in there that will let me use my computer. To make it more insulting it even auto-fills a horrible amalgamation of my first and last name followed by an underscore and three 0's. I never put that
 as my name or login name or computer name or anything. It gives me the feeling that my computer just glitched out and now thinks I'm a number it just made up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just hit key #2 and login that way, you're thinking? Ah, that'd be too easy. That one asks for my Microsoft account email and password. Which would be great except for the fact that it doesn't actually want my Microsoft account email and password. If
 I put that info in, it thinks on it for a solid thirty seconds and then tells me it's wrong. It isn't wrong. I needed that info to login to this site. It just doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to actually LOGIN and USE the computer, I have to hit change user from key icon #1, and THEN AND ONLY THEN will my actual login name show up and I can enter in a password to unlock my computer. It's a horrible and confusing system, made all the more horrible
 and confusing because it seems like I am the only user on Earth this has even happened to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any and all help, understanding, commiserations, or human empathy. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi! Thanks for replying. Sorry it's confusing. It's confusing for me too. I'm really unsure of how to be more clear. I can try to make a sort of textual flowchart I guess?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A-&gt; I start computer. When I get to the login screen, I get a "incorrect password/username" message, and when I hit next it take me to-</p>
<p>
</p><p>B-&gt; Two text fields (not sure if that's the proper word. Blank white bar where I'm prompted enter digits), one pre-filled with a string of gibberish (that I never told my computer) labeled "User Name". The second text field is blank and is marked "Password".</p>
<p>
</p><p>C-&gt; Directly underneath the two text fields are two side-by-side key icons. One is gives a mouseover of 'login with your username' or something to that affect; the other has a mouseover of 'login with your Microsoft Account'. The first key icon (username)
 is already selected, and selecting it again does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems to me are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1-&gt; The error message when I first startup my computer. The "wrong user name/password" dealie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2-&gt; The string of gibberish that it<em> thinks</em>&nbsp;is my username. It's a weird mix of my first and last name, punctuation, and numbers. The only other place I've ever seen it is (for some weird reason) in Civilization 4 where the game somehow thinks that's
 what my name is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3-&gt; When I hit the second key icon (part C above) I <em>can't</em> login. I know my Microsoft account email and password. I used them to get to this forum. They don't work to unlock my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4-&gt; When I 'sign out', rather than restart or shut down, I'm just taken to a screen that asks
<em>only</em>&nbsp;for a password. (or pin, if I mess with the settings) I'd really like this to be my sign-in method. None of the other ridiculous garbage I can't seem to be rid of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To whit, your links, while well-meaning, weren't useful. I don't need to change my Microsoft password, the problem is that my Microsoft password doesn't work. The second link, about trying to get sign-in w/out a password, is intriguing. I actually would
 rather have a password, but I'd settle for not having one if I didn't have to put up with the garbage the login screen currently gives me, so I thought I'd check it out. Unfortunately the guide on the link was not useful. There search for 'sign' came up with
 no results, and the guide did not list a workaround. The third link was a bit over my head, and I'm hesitant to mess with parts of the computer I don't understand that well. And again, would rather still have a password if given a choice. The fourth link (the
 FAQ) did not appear to have any relevant information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>I purchased a new Surface Book last week in the US and just arrived in HKG on business.&nbsp; When I plugged the supplied power adapter into the local 220V/50hz power, the touchpad behaves erratically and is unusable.&nbsp; Detaching the power supply from the computer
 solves the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem is almost certainly that you do not have an email program installed that can be set as the default email program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can compose the email message in the usual manner&nbsp;and attach the file, but to right-click&gt; Send, or use File&gt; Send to, &nbsp;to you will have to have a default email program installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mail App cannot be set as default email program, nor can web-based email services like outlook.com, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail, part of Windows Essentials can easily be synced with outlook.com and other web-based email services.</p>

    <title>Playing dvr-ms files in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caresrg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing dvr-ms files in Windows 10</h2>
                    I understand that I will have to kiss Media Center goodbye when I upgrade to Windows 10, and that's OK with me--I haven't used it in ages to record anything.
<em>However</em>, I'd like to be able to play the dvr-ms files that I did record. I can play them in Windows Media Player in Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center, but I just tested it on a Windows 10 machine and it plays sound, but no video. What do I need to
 do to be able to play these files? I'd like to upgrade to Win 10 as soon as I can.

            <p>I've managed to get Windows Media Player to play the dvr-ms and wtv files - try right-clicking on the file and choosing Open With - then find Windows Media Player and also tick the box which says 'always use this to open etc.</p>

            Some of the recordings are only allowed to be played back on the PC it was recorded on as they have a digital license embedded in the file. This is fine but because&nbsp;of this&nbsp;the dvr-ms file cannot be converted to a different file format even on the same
 PC. The only way I can see around this issue of supporting dvr-ms files&nbsp;is that Windows 10 had the Media Center dvr-ms playback software.

            <p>Here is my status:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I udes to have an old HP PC with Windows Media Center installed. When my kids were smal i took some videos and stored these in the Windows Media Center in the format dvr-ms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is no known Windows/Microsoft tool I can use to play back ot convert the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can go shopping and buy Wondershare or some other programs.... &nbsp;and pay 3rd party companies money to remedy Microsofts errors...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe they will add an APP at some time???</p>
<p>

            <p>Please read my earlier post! I have been able to successfully play dvr-ms files after upgrading to Windows 10 simply by using the included Windows Media Player! Try right clicking on the file you wish to play and choose Open
 With.....</p>
<p>Good luck! 😃</p>

            <p>Appreciate the suggestion as I agree this works for&nbsp;some&nbsp;video recordings.&nbsp;This will not work for recordings that were recorded via Media Center from TV/Cable/Satellite&nbsp;in which the movie was internally marked by the service provider as a "Copy Right Protected".
 The Media Center DRM recognizes this and only allows the program to be played back on the same PC that it was recorded on. When opening&nbsp;with another video playback software even on the same PC, it does not allow as it indicate it is "Copy Right Protected".
 For all other videos WMP can play the video back or it cam be converted with 3rd party software to other file formats such as mpeg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I think the only way around this is if Microsoft releases a media center playback only software application.</p>

            <p>It is January, 2016 and still no closer to answers about playing our WMC WTV&nbsp; files on Windows 10 with closed captioning.</p>
<p>I found when I PURCHASED Windows DVD Player, I was able to view my WTV files with Windows 10 Media Player.&nbsp; BUT, Closed Captions don't work and the player is crappy (no fast forward).<br />
So unhappy with Microsoft over lack of support for WMC product files in Windows 10.</p>
<p>BAD KARMA, Microsoft!</p>

            <p>Hi...</p>
<p>I have tried various "free" or $$-converters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one that does play and convert my dvr-ms files properly is "Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate"</p>
<p>(I hate to purchase programs with names like this :-) )</p>
<p>But - it works - at a fee of 50$......</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi guys, I have recently switched to windows 10 and on the whole like it. But as with everyone else here got really annoyed that having spent years building up my video collection 'legally' through wmc that I could no longer play any of it without the painstaking
 job of converting every file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, in the last week I have installed Kodi, in short not only does it play all my videos but provides much of the service wmc use to plus more. Im not a 'technical' but I cant see the downside in it. Its free , its legal and it does the job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a go.</p>

</p><p>system already shows that Windows is activated.</p>
<p>MGADIAG.exe shows the error shown - not valid</p>
<p>(but the report is a lot simpler than before)</p>
<p>I haven't had a single Windows validation popup since I did</p>
<p>multiple reboots early this morning, so it's been about 6 hours</p>
<p>of clear sailing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since mgadiag is still reporting an error something's not</p>

            <p>I got a few more windows invalid notices today, so I tried the command line reactivation procedure.</p>
<p>These commands each reported success, but I don't see a change in the MGADIAG.exe&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Nothing listed under the &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0x8004FE21 code at</span></p>

<p>seems meaningful to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Reinstall windows" as a solution is not viable - no windows disks, this is an OEM install,</p>
<p>it would be weeks of rebuilding anyway since I'd have to return to HP's original</p>

            <p>Exactly the same problem. Tried all of the above: sfc, powershell, checked registry permissions, system locale, switched to local account - nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other apps launch fine, just the store is not cooperating: shows a blue window with the store logo and a "swirly thing", then closes after two seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case, it's a T440S laptop, upgraded from Windows 8.1.</p>

            I had the same problem a couple of times running Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 3. It seems to have fixed itself after I went into start menu&gt;all apps&gt;Store and opened it that way. When I tried to click the LiveTile on the right of the start menu to&nbsp;open&nbsp;it&nbsp;the
 blue loading screen for the store would come up then just disappear.

Navigate your File Explorer to the following directory:</p>

            Have you enabled view hidden system files in folder options? I was able to access "app data" under my user name and followed the path indicated above to delete the cache.&nbsp; Once I did this I restarted my computer and I was able to open Windows Store.

<h2>            Samsung Notebook Pro 9 touchpad disabled on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>This morning my touchpad stopped working. Device manager says it is working fine and the driver is up to date. However,the driver ids do not show.&nbsp; I also checked for Windows updates, and the machine is up to date. This seems to be a common problem, but
 the older fixes have not worked for me. Any suggestions?</p>

            It might have been disabled accidentally manually. Look for a block icon symbol the function keys. Usually you have to press Fn + F1, f2 or f7 for example to renable it.

            Thanks for replying. I tried this but it was not the issue. It was a software thing. In the end, a&nbsp; Samsung rep remotely went into my machine and updated a bunch of things, which enabled the touch pad. Thanks again.

<p>
</p><p>I ran the command for disabling the administrator account and from the moment i close that cmd session im Unable to enable the built-in administrator account again. Whenever i try to do administratives tasks such as install software, change windows settings
 or&nbsp; even run the cmd as an administrator again, the UAC pop-up will only advice me that i have to be an administrator but it wont let me entered any credentials.&nbsp;</p>

                    The install seemed to work but the program cannot be executed.&nbsp; Control Panel verifies that software is installed (1.8GB) although the install program did not create a normal S&amp;T ICON and the software cannot be loaded even by clicking on the executable
 file in the program files directory. I installed/uninstalled the program multiple times.&nbsp; Turned Norton virus protection and firewall and Windows Firewall off. Rebooted over and over. Nothing worked.....<br />
<br />
---Error message is:"A removable device or network share cannot be found, The DVD is not in the drive or the installation of this application is corrupt.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make sure the drive you installed from is attached, the DVD is in the drive, your network is connected, or run Setup again from its original installed location. (5-40003-6)"<br />
<br />
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THERE IS A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM YET??&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is the built-in antivirus in Windows 8/8.1/10 and does NOT harm your Computer.</p>
<p>It protects your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice I give about these type of phone calls:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all have errors and warnings&nbsp;in our event viewer, which is another ploy they use to scare you</p>
<p>
</p><p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the only one who knows if you have given them Remote Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft does not contact you, unless YOU have made prior arrangements with them to do so.</p>
<p>There is a section in the link I&nbsp;am supplying you&nbsp;about this at the end of it</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried to install the update and when the computer restarts always says "We couldn't complete the updates, Undoing changes...". I have tried removing the downloaded updates in the %windir%/SoftwareDistribution folder but does not really helps...</p>
<p>How can I force the update to be installed? </p>

<p>I've performed a clean boot and tried to reset Windows Update components. After all, I tried to launch the troubleshooter and to install the update but I still got the same errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When resetting the WU components, I found some errors when registering BITS files with these dlls: mshtml.dll, shdocvw.dll, browseui.dll, msxml.dll, msxml3.dll, gpkcsp.dll and some more I don't remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to point that I am not able (since a couple of days) to shutdown my computer using windows shutdown menu. When I try it, it just go to the login screen. Maybe it is related with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: </strong>I have disabled Fast Boot as it seems it wasn't letting windows shutdown, now I can shutdown the laptop without any issue.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late answer. I have tried several things but any of them seem to work:<br />
</p>
<p>1. As I said the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Andre Da Costa solution does not help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Using this new link to start the PC in safe mode leads me to the same screen where there is no option for
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, so I cannot continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. I have tried using my Windows DVD to troubleshoot but dism.exe doesn't seem to be running good from there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. I've tried the Dism commands through my Admin Command Prompt and both of them return a positive result, telling me I have no errors in my PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Meanwhile, everytime I turn off my laptop the update attempts to be installed and continues failing. What else can I do?</span></p>

            I appreciate all the effort and help, but I wouldn't like to refresh my PC. There isn't any loss of personal data or programs, but many settings may be lost. I did it once, and really messed it up everything.<br />
<br />
Can you figure out any other thing I could do? I really don't know why this is happening.

<h2>            Microsoft Designer mouse not entering pair mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came back to my mouse after a weekend away. I noticed my mouse wasn't responding. I assumed that either the batteries had died or the connection had dropped out. I checked my bluetooth settings and I could see the device was paired. I then changed the
 batteries, this didn't resolve the issue. I then noticed that there was a small white light below the brake in the case for the wheel and buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to disconnect and pair the mouse again but now I can't make my mouse enter pair mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried these to no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these things actually explain why the mouse has a white light on top and will not enter pair mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The white light that you see indicates that the battery is not installed properly. Make sure that the batteries are not coming off and try to pair the mouse again.</p>
<p>If this doesn't fix the issue, please try contacting the hardware manufacturer for further assistance:</p>
