    <title>Which audio driver do I need&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacobfosterzo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which audio driver do I need&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I have a Sony Vaio PCG-71311M with windows 10 installed on it and for the past few days, I've had no sound on my laptop. Whenever I try troubleshooting, it never works, when I go on playback devices, the only device to show up is Digital Audio (HDMI)
 but it says it's not plugged in. Whenever I attempt to download any drivers (from Realtek and sites like that, they always say my hard drive or processor is incompatible, however, I did manage to download a Realtek audio diver, but when I tried to use it,
 it said it 'code 10' and I've been looking online, trying to find out how to fix it, but everything I've tried has ended up removing the driver from my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what do I do?</p>

            Thanks for replying, this first started on Friday evening after I tried to unscrew the back of my laptop to clean out the fan but I stopped as one of thee screws was too deep however I did try and force the back off but that did nothing, so I gave up and
 went back on my laptop and this started happened. I tried using the 'playing audio' troubleshooter but it was unable to identify the issue. The last actual activity I did on my laptop before this started was, I was disabling some of my apps from automatically
 starting up when I turn on my laptop using the task manager.

            <p>Thank you for getting back to us Jacob. As we have checked the <strong>Code 10</strong> error you are getting, it pertains mainly to hardware and device driver issue or to compatibility issues between hardware drivers and additional software that is installed

<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you update your device driver. Please follow the steps below:</p>

Driver</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click <strong>Update Driver</strong> to start the Hardware Update Wizard.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Follow the instructions to update the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please note that you may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website.
</span>Follow their installation or update instructions. Check the details below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If the device was pre-installed on the computer, visit the computer manufacturer's website.
</p>
<p>2. If the device was installed after the purchase of the computer, visit the device manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>3. If the device was pre-installed on the computer, and the computer manufacturer does not have an updated driver for the device, visit the device manufacturer's website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure that the device drivers that are being installed are compatible with your current Windows version and platform.</span>

 10 minutes to get it to stop once it gets really bad. It is preventing me from doing homework because I can't read the text. I have downloaded the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit as well as resetting&nbsp;my computer to factory settings and the problem has continued
 and has now begun to get worse. Is there anyway other way I can get this fixed and if not a replacement one?</span>

<h2>            Is Sonic 06&#39; Every Going To Be Backwards Compatible&#63;</h2>
                    The amount of hate I will receive for this question is unthinkable, yet I still wonder. The game was pretty sucky, being almost completely glitched and rushed, yet the game was fun to mess around with. I was wondering if they would ever ask SEGA for the
 licensing? It seems like a good game for memories. I know that Sonic Unleashed was just released as backwards compatible, which is great. I just wanted to know when it would come out, or if, for that mater.

<p>Hello Adriana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, ideas for <strong><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backwards compatibility</a></strong> cannot be submitted through our Xbox Ideas website as there are no longer threads dedicated
 for this type of discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For suggestions on what should become backwards compatible, it is suggested to reach out to the developer of the game or in this case the
<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter</a></strong> and Sonic the Hedgehog official website for partnering with our teams to bring such titles back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process is best explained as the developer team seeing a growing interest from its fan base to see a title return, and then working with our team to release the tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this information helps, and wish you the best!</p>

<h2>            Desktop shortcuts no longer work on PC windows 8.1 and Laptop Windows 7. They stopped working at almost the same time.</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm having a peculiar problem. I use google chrome on both of my computers. I recently lost all ability to put desktop shortcuts from google without them going straight to the Google search engine page.Also, when I do try and make a shortcut, the icon
 is the google chrome icon. I have spent around 4.5 hours watching Youtube videos and reading forums. Nothing has worked. It is so strange that both computers will not work using&nbsp; any of my shortcuts. It seams that the URL's have disconnected from the short
 cuts. I am about to lose it. The desktop icons and shortcuts are very important to me. THey help me do my job in an efficient manner. If I can't fix this I don't know what I'm going to do. Help!!!

            Still haven't been able to find a definitive answer as to why this is happening. Nor have I found a way to correct the problem of not being able to access the Daily challenges on Mahjong or Solitaire. Taptiles works fine.

            This is happening to me too (at least on Mahjong; I don't play the others). I did the clean reboot, the troubleshooting, etc. I haven't a clue what to do next. I'm glad I'm not alone at least.

<p>Hi SchizzleDizzle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! To troubleshoot the lack of sound in The Crew 2, try performing a hard reset or power cycle. Power cycling helps clear any residual game data on the console that could slow it down or cause common issues like this one. To perform a
 power cycle properly check out: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Power Cycle the Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            How do Original Xbox games get chosen to become backwards compatible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I found one of my favorite original xbox games, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast, the other day. &nbsp;Sadly it is not on the list of compatible games, although Jedi Academy is. &nbsp;What I am getting at is, is there any chance of this game being added to the
 list? &nbsp;I was very surprised by some of the games on the list, Jedi Outcast was very well received, and has very high ratings, 8/10-9/10s, and is not on the list, while one of the worst xbox games ever Drake, 2.7/10 is. &nbsp;Sometimes I just don't understand you

<p>It's a software emulator which as anyone whose used one before will tell you can be quite tempremental as to what games it'll allow to work. If it's not on the list most likely they couldn't get it to work with the emulator rather than not putting on there
 because they thought crap game x would be better received. They stopped updating it years ago so you've no chance of Jedi Outcast getting on the list at this stage.

<p><em>If it is a&nbsp;game you really want to play again and its an option for you the only choice would be to buy an original xbox to play it on. The good thing is they are extremely cheap to purchase now.<br />
Because as Vern says unfortunately no more games will be added to the BC list.<br />
<br />
Slightly off topic:<br />
It would be nice to see a similar Star Wars game come to the 360 instead of Kinect titles. I have nothing against Kinect as such but something seems to have gone wrong at LucasArts&nbsp;as good Star Wars titles on the 360 have been severely lacking. Why we have
 not seen 360 versions of KOTOR, BF, RC, , JK OWK, X wing etc etc etc makes no sense.<br />
And the Kinect game just looks like an on rails waveathon with rudimentary graphics.</em></p>

<p>Thanks guys, I assumed that was the case, and I agree completely with you GreyPilgrim, regarding the whole kinect, and LucasArts topic. &nbsp;BF, KOTOR, and Jedi Outcast have always been some of my favorites, and now Star Wars games just seem gimmicky.</p>

            Thanks for the prompt reply. Method one didnt work because win+r doesnt bring up the cmd prompt up long enough type anything. (There is a constant shift of focus, like some is pressing tab repeatively). Method 2 I was able to complete the steps and reboot.
 But unfortunately it did not help. Thank you in advance for your help

            Hello. &nbsp;I ended up calling Microsoft directly - and found that Windows 10 is NOT compatible with Norton Anti-Virus. &nbsp;Wish they would have told us that BEFORE the upgrade! &nbsp;The options were to delete Norton from my computer (which I didn't want to do because
 a) I already paid for it and b) it stores all my passwords) - or effectively uninstall Windows 10 by doing a "recovery". &nbsp;So - the guy on the phone walked me through the recovery process. &nbsp;After about an hour and a half, my computer is now back to Windows
 7. &nbsp;Again - Wish that Windows had mentioned this "issue" before the upgrade! &nbsp;Hope this helps...

    <title>DirectX 10 Mouse offset problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chippy94  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX 10 Mouse offset problem</h2>
                    Hi I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit edition. I have an intel i7 940 processor, 12 gigs of ram, and an nvdidia 250 graphics card. My problem occurs with games running DirectX 10. When I run a game like Crysis for instance. my mouse is actually
 down and to the right of where the cursor indicates it is. So for example if I want to select the first item in a menu, i need to move my mouse about an inch down and half an inch to the right of the menu button. If I play in windowed mode at 800 x 600 resolution,
 then my cursor and the actual location of my mouse are in sync. If I play at a higher resolution then the offset gets progressively worse until I can no longer select various options on the screen. If I run the game in DirectX 9 then the mouse problem does
 not occur. If I tell windows to adjust my visual settings to "best performance" then everything works normally even in DirectX 10. I gather that aero or transparancy is what is confusing things, but is there any sort of fix fo

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform the two listed methods below and check if&nbsp; that helps in getting the mouse pointer in sync.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>Try syncing the computer resolution with the resolutionof the game. It should resolve the issue. For example if you are playing the game at 1078*768 chnage the resoltuion of the computer to same and check.</div>
<div><br />
Change your screen resolution <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution</a>
<br />
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>Alter the Hardware Acceleration<br />
You can also try changing the hardware acceperation to medium and verify (You can try different)<br />
1. Right click on empty space on desktop.<br />
2. Go to Screen Resolution.<br />
3. Then click on Advanced settings and click on the tab "Troubleshoot".<br />
4. Set the hardware acceleration to medium. (here you will get the option only if your Video card support it).</div>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />Some things to try if your touchscreen doesn't work...
<br />
<br />1. Restart the computer. Sometimes that is all that it needs.
<br />
<br />2. Wipe off the display with a soft, clean cloth. Yes, sometimes it is just that.
<br />
<br />3. Go to "Start" and in the search box type "Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input". Choose the top result. In this new screen click "Setup" and follow the instructions.
<br />
<br />4. Go to "Control Panel" and then "Device Manager". Select the "Monitors" section and right click on your monitor. Check the information for the touch screen and make sure it is "enabled".
<br />
<br />5. Repeat step 4, but instead choose "Update driver software" from the right-click menu.
<br />

<p>I have found that the word "control" typed in the Win 10 search box opens a List where you can select " Devices and printers" which takes you to&nbsp; a display of printers where if I right click on "Epson WF- 3640", my computer, a list of print preferences appears
 that does contain the option of color or Black/Greyscale. This list appears to be close to the list of preferences that appeared when you clicked "advanced" when selecting "Print</p>
<p>in Windows 7. I did get this same list going several other routes . This was the shortest way I found which, in my way of thinking, is absurd. I am 80 years old and have to admit the reason I found this path was that I couldn't remember the way I got there
 most often. I guess they weren't selling enough colored ink, so they changed the way you got to select "Black/Greyscale". Love that EPSON.</p>

<h2>            Compaq nc6400 won&#39;t boot &#40;unrecoverable&#41; after updates</h2>
                    I have installed Windows 7 on this computer 4 times. &nbsp;Each time, after I install the "83 critical updates" it reboots, and goes into system recovery. &nbsp;System recovery is unable to fix the problem. &nbsp;I can't even use System&nbsp;restore&nbsp;to go back to a point
 before I installed the updates, because it "fails to complete successfully". &nbsp;Safe mode doesn't work, scan disk says system is fine, but when using /f flag it says, that it couldn't scan and the drive might still be corrupt. &nbsp;The drive looks fine, and scans
 fine on my other computer (Win7). &nbsp;This is extremely frustrating, to say the least. &nbsp;I have spent the entire day on this, and most of yesterday, and all I am left with is the possibility of installing Windows 83 times, to see which update causes the problem?
 (If it's the 83rd update, I guess that would be 84 times, including the four that I have already done). &nbsp;I guess I will just limp along without any "critical updates" but then, it do

            As I have stated clearly, I have done a "<u>CLEAN INSTALL</u>" of Windows 7 (about 8 times now).&nbsp; (In fact, I am starting with a brand new hard drive!)<br />
<br />
It does in fact have anti-virus on it now, but did not have it while I was troubleshooting the
<u>update problem</u>.&nbsp; (Thanks for the wild goose chase, though). <br />
<br />
In addition, I am sure that I know both how to install Windows 7 properly and maintain a clean system.&nbsp; As I have stated clearly and more than once,
<b><u>this is a problem with Windows Updates</u></b>.&nbsp; Your post, about getting blank pages in ie8 could not be farther from the problem that I am having.&nbsp; I DO NOT NEED HELP 'CLEANING A COMPROMISED SYSTEM'.&nbsp; This is/was a CLEAN INSTALL (on a brand-new hard
 drive)!!<br />
<br />
If anyone else would like to offer their help/advice, without hijacking the thread (this is
<u>not</u> a virus or spyware issue).<br />
<br />
I get very frustrated with the arrogance of many "Tech's" who assume that everybody else is stupid, and don't bother to read their posts.<br />
<br />
If you took time to read the post that I took time to accurately and thoroughly detail, you would find that your post is about as unhelpful as it gets.<br />
<br />
Thanks for jumping to conclusions and being arrogant enough to "no longer monitor this thread".&nbsp; You had the wrong ideas anyhow.<br />
<br />
Now I think that I will have to start a new thread, because this one's all mucked up.&nbsp; (As if I haven't spent enough time trying to figure out
<u>Microsoft's problem</u>).<br />

            1.) 8-28-12 (and previously 8-26-12, and 8-11-12 and 8-12-12 (four+ times))<br />
2.) AVG Free Edition (have used it for years with 200+ customers of mine- not the problem, as I even tested without any security software..)<br />
3.) The AVG?&nbsp; It wasn't uninstalled; since the 6th (or was it the 7th?) clean install, I hadn't gotten around to installing it yet.&nbsp; The computer was "unprotected" for maybe 2-4 hours total (during driver updates, and software installs). Which would again seem
 irrelevant, since it has happened the previous 5+ times, before I even got to installing any software..<br />
4.) I don't use McAfee or Norton. This was a clean install without any MFR-provided bloat-ware.&nbsp; I have since installed MS Office S&amp;E 2010, Quickbooks, iTunes, AVG, Quicktime, Adobe Reader, Flash, Chrome and Picasa. Computer works fine, because I have for the
 time being disabled all Windows Updates.<br />
5.) -----<br />
6.) No, Java has not been installed yet at any point in this troubleshooting.<br />
7.) Chrome is installed now, but has not been part of the troubleshooting (which was done on a "bare bones" clean install (with drivers from Windows Update, and HP.com ONLY).&nbsp; I did have to use a couple of Vista-64 drivers, which was recommended by HP.<br />
8.) I don't trust registry cleaners; I never use them. <br />
<br />
When I do a clean install- especially if I have problems, I stick to the Drivers and Microsoft Updates.&nbsp; That is how I know it's the updates and not any other software, because I have tried this several times with nothing but drivers and MS Updates... The drivers
 have all been verified by installing one-by-one and restarting after each (current working system is proof).<br />
<br />
Microsoft has even admitted to me that this is a "known issue".&nbsp; Does this give you any ideas?&nbsp; Anything to narrow down which update or group of updates would be helpful, since support has told me I just "have to install them 1 by 1" until the system fails
 and has to be either clean-installed again, or recovered from a backup image...which takes at least 2-3 hours.. Another thing that might help would be if I could restore boot capability (somehow) after this occurs.&nbsp; I have tried System Repair, System Restore,
 Startup Repair, Safe Mode, and&nbsp; chkdsk, I don't think there is anything else to do, except re-partition and re-install...do you?<br />

<h2>            Halloween Quiz.</h2>
                    
<p>Just tried looking for the new offers on my dashboard, came across the H'ween Quiz. Asks you a bunch of easy questions then at the end say's "Grab yourself a costume" Thought this meant a free one but it chucks me into the Avatar marketplace. Why take a
 quiz and get 5/5 for no prize? Lol.</p>

<p>yeah same here i feel a bit cheated .. i know a quiz is to test you knowledge but to say "grab yourself a costume" after is rather misleading... obviosly the wrong answers were from people seeing if it made any diference. as i did. and it does not....that
 makes the whole thing rather pointless..and anoying .......i want my free costume too</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Hardware and devices troubleshooter </strong></p>
<p>This troubleshooter&nbsp;checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly.
</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type control and press enter to open the control panel.</p>
<p>3. Type troubleshooting in the control panel search box and open it.</p>
<p>4. Click "view all" on the left pane.</p>
<p>5. Run the Hardware and devices troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall the device's driver</strong></p>
<p>If the device appears in Device manager, I suggest you to uninstall the driver and restart the compute and have Windows automatically install the latest available driver upon restart.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and select device manager.</p>
<p>2. Locate the device's driver and uninstall it.</p>
<p>3. Restart the computer and check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, download the latest driver from the manufacturer's website and check again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried 1 &amp; 2. Same error message. The manufacturer (Thrustmaster) doesn't support this particular wheel anymore, and had sent me a generic driver. They said I should contact Microsoft about the code 43 message. Seems a pity to put it in the bin because the
 os is new.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there are no available drivers for Windows 10, I suggest you to try installing the driver in compatibility mode by following the steps below and check again.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<strong> Right-click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select "<strong>Properties</strong>".&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" Tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Place a <strong>check mark</strong> next to "<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>" and select Windows 8
<span>&nbsp;</span>from the drop&nbsp; down list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Let the driver install and then check the functionality&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message you receive in the pop up before the computer goes to sleep?</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can adjust how long your computer waits before sleeping or hibernating—or prevent it from turning itself off altogether. But be careful. On a battery powered laptop, inhibiting
 sleep or hibernation can result in data loss if the battery dies. Here's how to prevent your computer from entering a power-saving state:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Power Options by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span>
 button, clicking </span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 clicking </span></span><span><span><strong>System and Security</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 and then clicking </span></span><span><span><strong>Power Options</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<span><strong>Select a power plan</strong></span> page, click <span>
<strong>Change plan settings</strong></span> next to the selected plan.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<span><strong>Change settings for the plan</strong></span> page, click
<span><strong>Change advanced power settings</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<span><strong>Advanced settings</strong></span> tab, double-click <span>
<strong>Sleep</strong></span>, double-click <span><strong>Sleep after</strong></span>, and then do one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you're using a laptop, click
<span><strong>On battery</strong></span> or <span><strong>Plugged in</strong></span> (or both), click the arrow, and then click
<span><strong>Never</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you're using a desktop computer, click
<span><strong>Setting</strong></span>, click the arrow, and then click
<span><strong>Never</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click
<span><strong>Hibernate after</strong></span>, and then do one of the following:</span></p>

<span><strong>Never</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>If you also want the display to stay turned on, double-click
<span><strong>Display</strong></span>, double-click <span>
<strong>Turn off display after</strong></span>, and then do one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>, and then click <span>

<p>Und wie TeQuila ja schon gesagt hat, muss es ja gehen, denn du bist ja auch auf xbox.com gekommen.</p>
