    <title>Outlook 2016 now &#40;Feb 16&#41; uses wrong &#34;Sent&#34; folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjl_satelliteinternet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 now &#40;Feb 16&#41; uses wrong &#34;Sent&#34; folder when using &#34;Send as Other Email&#34; &#40;which used to work in Jan 16&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've just got off the phone from Microsoft Office 365 / Outlook 2016 support after 2 hours and 45 minutes of them blaming this issue on the mailbox provider (Outlook) and claiming that as far as they are concerned Outlook is a third party thing that Outlook
 can't support.</p>
<ol>
<li>I have an Office 365 account - let's call that mjl at work.</li><li>I have an Outlook.com account - let's call that mjl at home</li><li>I have a mailforward - let's call that other at home</li></ol>
<p>This mailforward&nbsp;has been configured (since 2007 at least) pretty much like this advice
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016_preview-outlook/outlook-2016-send-from-outlook-alias-account/9d91fae2-3aaf-44df-81c7-7b67d9bd1221?auth=1">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016_preview-outlook/outlook-2016-send-from-outlook-alias-account/9d91fae2-3aaf-44df-81c7-7b67d9bd1221?auth=1</a> which is to have a POP3 account configured only to send, and send via mjl at home using
 mjl at home credentials to login to the mailserver.</p>
<p>So until Outlook 2016, I could send from other at home. Sent emails would (correctly) appear in the sent folder of mjl at home. This is the desired behaviour.</p>
<p>After Outlook 2016, this no longer happened. the emails would show up in the sent folder of mjl at work which is wrong. After Outlook 2016, I could no longer drag these sent emails into the correct mailbox folders because EAS no longer supported that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Jan, having worked out that it wasn't me going mad, this behaviour really was down to Outlook, I raised a support case which was solved in about 5 minutes by a nice lady who suggested I should use the From &gt; Other email address instead of the send-only
 account. I could go to the correct account (mjl at home), start a new email selecting From &gt; Other email address and entering other at home and then send it. This worked fine last month. The emails arrived looking as if they as been sent by other at home (correct)
 and were put in the sent folder of mjl at home (also correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now - still with me? - this correct behaviour has stopped. What happens is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send using the other at home account - emails recorded in mjl at work sent folder (wrong) and look as if sent by other at home (correct)</li><li>Send using From &gt; Other email address and mike at home account - emails recorded in mjl at home sent folder (correct) and looks as if sent by mjl at home (wrong - should look like other at home)</li><li>Send using From &gt; Other email address and other at home account - emails recorded in mjl at work sent folder (wrong) and looks as if sent by other at home (correct).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be no way to have both the correct send folder used and the correct outgoing email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having tested this exhaustively at the weekend, I raised another case with the details and just spent too long (maybe three hours over two calls and speaking to supervisor), their best advice can be summed up as "don't know" have you tried "x"</p>
<p>So far we have removed and added accounts, no change. They are now saying either to recreate a new profile and try again because it must be corrupt or have you another machine you can test. Or can you roll back to Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these are good suggestions in part because of time they will take but mostly because this is random "try this and see if it works" guesswork instead of proper troubleshooting. They have told me "we have many issues with Outlook 2016 so should be
 better to go back to earlier version". I have asked them if they had tried the workround suggested by Microsoft on the above link but no reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get "alias-type" (because I don't think this is exactly what Microsoft mean by "alias" in their context) accounts like "other at home" to work OK as they always used to do before Outlook 2016. I don't want to setup multiple "whoever at home" accounts
 because all the history is in the mjl at home mailbox folders and you can no longer move emails from one mailbox to another which I believe is a backward step introduced with the EAS now being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>No, the issue is not resolved.</p>
<p>After the post about PSR from Parth P Patel above and the info requested in the private message by Daniel, I followed both sets of instructions and provided the information requested on 23rd Feb. I have heard nothing since and still await response from Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Are there hidden areas in an email that might trigger what looks like a false positive in an instant search&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to figure out how Outlook on the web works regarding searching.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I search my inbox for the word "server" and I get several emails that contain the word server either in their body or in an attached excel file.&nbsp; This is all good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I get one that does not contain the word server and the email has no attachments.&nbsp; I've examined the email manually and also used CTRL/CMD+F to search the email for the word server, but no instance is found.&nbsp; It appears to be a failure of instant search--a
 false positive in the sear results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some sort of email header or other hidden information in the email object that would cause the email to be caught in the search, even though there's no visible evidence of the search word?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to believe that search works reliably!</p>
<p>

<p>One other observation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just forwarded two email to my gmail account.&nbsp; One contained the word <em>server</em>. The other did not.</p>
<p>Google mail search on <em>server </em>returned only the item that contained the word
<em>server</em>.&nbsp; The same 2 emails are both returned by Outlook--regardless of browser or if I'm using the Outlook desktop app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that says that Outlook must be seeing something in the false positive email that's not detected by gmail.&nbsp; Any idea what this could be? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Search function in Outlook.com scans the content of the email messages. It's possible that the email headers are included in the search result, giving you the scenario provided above. Are you using the old Outlook.com version or the new Outlook.com beta
 version? Have you tried searching between these two to isolate if the issue is happening on a specific version only?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if the search result shows the word "server" on the header of the email. In the
<strong>Reading Pane</strong>, click the down arrow on the <strong>Reply </strong>
button and choose: <strong>View message source</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response. </p>

<p>How can I tell which outlook.com I'm using?&nbsp; I just log into my account. No prompt to choose a version.&nbsp; In the browser at the top it says Office 365 and then Outlook.&nbsp; I can't find a reference to a version in the browser tab for outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can sync music with Window Media 10 or 11 but for some reason I cannot copy and sync the album art for each song or album (apart from only 1 record picture shows on the phone when i play music), although all the record art was automatically
 retrieved online by the Win Media player on the PC. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I explore the files on the phone, I see that the associated art is in the same subfolder as the music, but does not show on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get the album art to show in the player?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thks!</p>

<p>The fact that the grouping is by date in my example is irrelevant.&nbsp; To mirror my example you need to do four things:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Declare a variable in the report's module's declarations area, of whatever is the data type of the column by which the report is grouped.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; In the detail section's Format event procedure assign the value of the column by which the report is grouped to the variable.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; In the page header's Format event procedure set the return value of the Cancel argument to True if the value of the column by which the report is grouped does not equal the current value of the variable.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Set the ForceNewPage property of the group footer to 'After Section' to force each group to start on a new page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In principle the example you've cited works in a similar way to my current example.</p>

<h2>            To show comments in bibliography style</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to show comments to each citation when inserting a bibliography section in a document.<br />
<br />
Or maybe just import to to the office directory a ready made style in which the comments are activated to show.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried to make a copy of APA style which some changes, but i was not able to save the file. Even if i am able to save the file, I don't know whether those changes would be effective, anyway, because i am not an expert.<br />
<br />
Is there a simple way to just show the field comments in the bibliography section?<br />
<br />
Someone give a hand?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</p>

            There is no practical way of commenting individual entries in a Word bibliography. That's because
<span>a Word bibliography employs a&nbsp;<span>bibliography field and any time you do anything to refresh the field display (e.g. add/delete a reference, print the document), any edits to the field - which is what adding a comment to an entry amounts
 to - will be lost.</span></span>

<p>Hi, Antoneth<br />
<br />
No, not this one. I want to make a document with a 'commented bibliography', in which each source has a complementary note of what the source is all about. @macropod just below told me there is no practical way to publish comments in the bibliography section.<br />
<br />
There is a comments field which is not actvated in the edition dialog box of each source. It is a pity that it can't be activated as the other fields. In Brazil we have many books with a commented bibliography and it is a nice feature to have in a book.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much</p>

            An annotated bibliography, which is what you now seem to be describing, is something you'll have to create for yourself. You might start by inserting a bibliography field into Word to generate the basic bibliography, then convert that to text so you can
 make the annotations.

            It appears that EndNote makes this easier for the user, but it is possible to create a new citation style in Word; see
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/word/concepts/objects-properties-methods/create-custom-bibliography-styles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Edit data in table with unbound controls in a form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrt_mac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edit data in table with unbound controls in a form</h2>
                    <p>I think what I am trying to do should be very straight forward. I'm not new to Access but, it's been some years since I worked with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a form with several unbound controls on it. &nbsp;The user will fill in the controls with data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the user clicks the edit button, I want to edit the values in a table with the new values provided by the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be a three (3) where clauses needed, for example</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; edit field3 with value x, where field 1 = me.control1, and where field2 = me. control2. and where field3 = me.control3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful for any guidance on this. &nbsp;I am not very adept with SQL, and to do something like this in the past I used&nbsp;</p>
<p>rs.edit, I think, but it's been so long I cannot recall for certain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any assistance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>May I ask why you are using unbound controls. One of Access's major strengths is the bound form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use unbound controls you will have to have a way of knowing what the primary key is so you get the record you want to edit.</p>
<p>UPDATE myTable</p>
<p>SET field1 = Forms!myForm!control1,</p>
<p>field2 = Forms!myForm!control2,</p>
<p>field3 = Forms!myForm!control3</p>
<p>WHERE myPrimaryKey=Forms!myForm!control4</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how will the form get the primary key?</p>

            <p>The user will provide the primary key by selecting the product code to be edited on the unbound form.</p>
<p>Once the old value is replaced with the new value, I create a new record in another table called Inventory_Adjustment_Records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the code you provided above, is that all I need? &nbsp;I do not have to declare variables? &nbsp;Seems to simple to work. And maybe I am over complicating things in my approach. I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially what I am aiming to do is to have the user make adjustments to the "inventory_table", with values on the form. Then I use those same values to create a record in another table "Inventory_Adjustment_Record", so that we have a record of adjustments
 to inventory along with the reason date etc.</p>

            <p>First, you didn't answer Bill's question about why are you using unbound forms. While unbound forms have their place, they require the developer to write code to handle the I/O between the form and the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having data in multiple tables is not good design. If you want to have a history of transactions, then use a history table instead of having redundant data. You should be maintaining records of your changes and not storing the results of those changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code Bill gave you is a SQL query, not VBA code. If you want to run the UPDATE query you have to generate the SQL using VBA code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you don't know how to enter VBA code and generated SQL you really aren't ready to use unbound forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really suggest you need to rethink your database structure, design and workflow.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint &#47; OneDrive for Business access</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using the sharing of folders and files from OneDrive for Business and Sharepoint, which finally works quite easily to make the link from Explorer (not on the mobile phone but that's another gripe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have now noticed that whenever I share a folder there is a "Export to Excel" button on the webpage. When I click on that it creates a query.iqy file that outlines all of my folders tree - and I mean all, not only from the shared folder forward;
 not even the parent path to the shared folder; but really all my folders... This is first of all unacceptable, but secondly I have no idea what is the use of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should add that is not only the folders that are listed. It lists all the files, and creates links to them (although they are not accessible)</p>
<p>END EDIT]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of turning that off???</p>
<p>N</p>

<p><span>Hi N,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For disabling the “Export to Excel”, there’s no out of the box way to hide or disable it. However, based on my research, using code should help you achieve that. For such customization problem, you can go to our MSDN forum for dedicated help. Here’s
 an&nbsp;<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/c87301bd-3f2c-4079-8005-d8e48c69baab/hide-disabled-export-to-excel-from-ribbon-in-sharepoint-2013?forum=sharepointadmin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">example thread</a>. Hope it can help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If an external user wants to open the query file without signing in an account, there’s no content in the created workbook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unmanageable things can be like copying and pasting the data then share with other people. For example, if a user have permissions to open the query file, he can copy and paste the data into a new created workbook. Then share it with other people who
 has no permissions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Turn off &#34;fill effect&#34; of a shape &#40;drawing tools&#41;</h2>
                    Hello everybody,<br />
<br />
Here's my problem;<br />
I draw a shape in a drawing canvas and choose a gradient or pattern fill effect.<br />
Then I want this same shape to be filled by a single color without any fill effect.<br />
How do I get rid of the fill effect? How do i turn it off once it is activated?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

 card or proof of address. I have had this account for many years and it is the first time this has happened. I can't even remember setting it up as a child account. Please help, this account is very important to my business.</p>

            I have had the same problem, the only answer to this is to close the account. I can no longer log into Google chrome or Firefox. I am going to change my browser and I will then close my email account and then open a new one with another provider. As I
 understand it this is a US law which does not apply in the UK. I do not want to use a Credit card in order to Prove the age of a business account. This is a pain to do but it has to be done.

            hi mate, have you checked that you are up to date with the latest firmware for your device, and that you are up to date with the latest nokia system app updates from the Store? also try performing a soft reset, and disabling any unnecessary Background
 Tasks, Location/NFC/Bluetooth etc.

    <title>How long to retrive encrypted email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b. mitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long to retrive encrypted email</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone can answer this, I have searched TechNet and didn't come across the answer. If I send someone an encrypted email from my Office 365 account, they can successfully log in using an MS/work account or passcode and retrieve the email, so everything
 works. My question is how long is that encrypted email I sent available to the recipient? Does it become available after a period of time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p><span>Office 365 encrypted messages are not stored on Microsoft servers or in the cloud.</span><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"> They are kept on the

<h3> mrpumpkin9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t log into my MS account after reinstall.  &#40;insider&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My 10240 install had deteriorated (apps not working, could not get updates), so I installed the rtm ISO over the top of my previous installation (could not reset because of the inaccessible boot device loop bug, no 10240 ISO available).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwords, I could sign in with My MS account, access insider app, but could not activate the install.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ac42737-64fa-4a27-af94-a646a3392f10" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I deleted the partition, then reinstalled build 10074, and activated it with the original key.&nbsp; I was finally able to update that build to 10240, and it is activated.&nbsp; But I am still unable to sign in with my MS account for insider builds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In build 10074 I received this error</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26c33361-3d5e-4c93-ba23-da662e68f5e1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, yeah, it's the same PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade to 10240, hitting the insider "fix"&nbsp; button gave me a sign in option, but when completing the forms, nothing happens, no system account.&nbsp; One drive is there, so is my outlook account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a9ed91f-29a6-4bfa-9cbb-ffe1d1e0cdf3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So there I am with an MS account, but can't use it to rejoin the insider builds,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to the insider page and signing in</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4cf4b138-84c1-4499-88bf-d63bd47b308f" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I'm an insider, with an activated Th1- 10204 build who is unable to sign into the OS with my MS account.&nbsp; How can I rectify this?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            That's what I did the 1st time, skipped any Keys and just set up my account, it would not activate. However, even though I was able to sign into the insider app, I was presented with a "fix me" option for insider builds under update.&nbsp; That fix me only
 gave me the option to opt out of insider builds, which I did not do.&nbsp;

<p>the formula I'm trying to create would be in column b.&nbsp; If I were to verbalize the formula it would be like this:&nbsp; B2= the sum of C2:CFJ2, but only adding the values from the last year, which would be indicated in C1:CFJ1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in my mind I'm seeing something like A1-365, but I can't visualize the formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your concern about permanently deleting emails in Windows 10 Mail app, we'd like to ask if your email setup is IMAP. If your email is setup like this, email data stays on the server so deleting it can still be undone or restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're on IMAP, try changing it to POP3. You can refer to this link for <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-in-Mail-for-Windows-10-7ff79e8b-439b-4b47-8ff9-3f9a33166c60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
steps</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Thank you for response. I confirm that my ISP uses IMAP and is the main account and that extra account is Outlook.com. It is Outlook.com "Windows Mail", that I wish to delete mail permanently and not leave any E-mails lying dormant in my computer. Mail
 referring to my ISP is deleted by selecting "Delete", but are they also deleted permanently&nbsp;deleted? Windows Mail is what I use daily for reading all Mail.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Bob</p>
<p>&nbsp;In mail in the left panel click on 'More' then in the panel that opens click 'Deleted Items' there are some settings at the top which allow you to select All then delete. This deletes the deleted mail. This is the only thing I know of in mail that deletes
 deleted emails, which should mean that they are removed from your PC. </p>

            Hi RPG17A, I tried that sometime ago and thought mail had been removed permanently, this proved not to be the case. Mails in question are still prominent. You can delete mail, until you are red in the face, Mail will simply not delete permanently. The
 cause probably is Windows 10 programmers, have made it impossible by embedding deeply into the registry. It is apparent that Microsoft has a reason for making a solution unavailable to us to delete any mail not wanted. However, additional Accounts Mail can
 be deleted permanently using the procedure suggested. There must be many accounts, who have Mail&nbsp;not deleted on computers.&nbsp;

<h2>            Server Busy errors</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently we could deliver email to all MS domains - small issues here and there - but since MS has made some changes on antispam handling we keep receiving the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>451 4.7.500 Server busy. Please try again later from [our mail server IP]. (AS3114) or (AS3113) or (AS843)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We have asked several times for mitigation for the IPs having issues, without any success (the mitigation is done, but no change; blocks are still active).</span></p>
<p>We would like to know the following:</p>
<p>- What the error codes&nbsp;<span>(AS3110) or (AS3113) or (AS843) stand for? There is no documentation that could help</span></p>
<p>- These blocks are IP based /domain based or something else?</p>
<p>- What can be done in order to fix that issue? The IPs have good reputation in MS side (SNDS monitor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for the assistance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Like what you've mentioned, you're not able to send emails to Microsoft email domain.
</span><span>AS3110, AS3113, and AS843 are failed email delivery error codes. If Microsoft doesn't recognize if your email domain is good, it will block the IP of your email domain. For us to clarify your email concern, kindly

<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Who did you contact to assist you on </span>

<p>
</p><p><span>It is possible that the settings of your domain is not set up properly and that is why you're having an issue sending to Microsoft email addresses. We recommend that you follow the steps

<p>Nope, not solvable so far and no update from MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only "solution" so far is to stop sending for a month to MS through the blocked IP(s) and let it reset the reputation...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still waiting for an official answer. However there are reports that they changed the antispam filtering a while ago as well as moved the infrastructure to office 365 servers. So I dont think the errors came out of the blue.</p>

    <title>Saving driving routes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff.........  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving driving routes</h2>
                    In an earlier post, a contributor mentioned how to save a driving route to my personal saved map. However, when I right click on A or B the option to save pushpin does not appear. The program makes me right click somewhere on the route to add a pushpin.
 Then, the contributor said a "more info" option will appear, allowing you to copy and paste the url of the driving route to my maps - the "more info" tab does not appear when I create a driving route, only the option to rename the pushpin. Is there another
 way?

<p>Hi Jeff,<br />
<br />
Using Bing Maps, you will be able to see multiple map locations, get driving directions, view live traffic conditions and more. To get the URL of the driving route that you would like to save, kindly follow the steps below:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Bing </strong><strong>Maps </strong>on your browser.</li><li>Click on <strong>Directions.</strong></li><li>Locate the routes by pressing <strong>right</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>click
</strong>and use <strong>Direction </strong><strong>from </strong>and <strong>Direction
</strong><strong>to </strong>for the locations.</li><li>On the Directions screen, press the <strong>... </strong>and select <strong>Share</strong>. You will be able to get the URL for the routes that you located. Refer to the images below:</li></ol>

</p><p>Hi Nirmal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why a phone kept on freezing. To ensure that we resolve it properly, can you provide us with the following information?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes on your phone prior to this?</li><li>When was the last time you upgraded your phone?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far to resolve the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we recommend performing a soft reset on your phone to refresh some of its settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do a soft reset, press and hold the Power and Volume down button for 15 seconds, before releasing your hold. Wait for the phone to finish restarting and afterwards, check your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it keeps on freezing.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having 512MB Ram , you will find the phone to be slow only.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Backstage TaskGroup Tasks not working in PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've found a bug in PowerPoint 2016 (may be present in other Office 2016 programmes, I haven't checked), whereby custom xml customizations do not function correctly in the backstage view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a simple test file (link: <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4EE98EE7ACF32E0F!144&amp;authkey=!AIYU6NAwwrFPIBs&amp;ithint=file%2cpptm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4EE98EE7ACF32E0F!144&amp;authkey=!AIYU6NAwwrFPIBs&amp;ithint=file%2cpptm</a>)&nbsp;which works fine in 2013 but in 2016 the icon doesn't load and nothing happens when I click on the "button".</p>

<p>Here's my XML code:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;customUI xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2009/07/customui"&gt;<br />
&lt;backstage&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;tab id="tab1" label="Test" insertBeforeMso="TabHelp" <br />

<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;description="Shows a messagebox."/&gt; </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/category&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/taskGroup&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/firstColumn&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;/tab&gt;<br />
&lt;/backstage&gt;<br />
&lt;/customUI&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my VBA, in a module called modTestBackstage</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Sub Task1_onAction()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Hello from task 1"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has something changed in the way the coding is required for 2016, or is this a bug?</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            Are you up to date with the Office 365 releases? I had reported some backstage issues with&nbsp;PPT 2016 a couple of months ago and all&nbsp;of them got fixed in v 16.0.6568.2036 and one of them was the missing icon. Your presentation opens just fine with that release
 and I can see the '?' icon too.&nbsp;

<h2>            Problems sharing outside my organization</h2>
                    
<p>so far in my experience, it seems like it is only possible to share office 365 files (excel, word, powerpoint, onenote) with other office 365 account holders in my “organization” (which is a college). &nbsp;since this is a university account, onedrive for business
 is being used and a university office 365 account (not my personal microsoft account or regular onedrive which allows me to share with anyone just fine). &nbsp;i use onenote and excel heavily in my class, and i want to be able to share files with students &nbsp;(and
 they very often need to share with each other). &nbsp;in particular, i use onenote for them to keep electronic lab notebooks, which works really well when i can successfully share the notebooks with them. &nbsp;i have two students from another nearby college in my class
 this semester (we have an agreement among several local colleges that allows students to take classes at other colleges in the agreement), and i can't share onenote or excel (or any office 365 program) files with them.&nbsp; is there some way to add them to my
 organization’s network so i can share files with them? &nbsp; &nbsp;or is there a way to share outside of my organization that i am missing?&nbsp;&nbsp; i know i can share more widely with my personal microsoft account, but i would prefer to be able to use my college office 365
 account for all my teaching and research related work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;when i put a student's email address from the other college in to invite them to share, it says they are outside the organization and even if i go ahead and send it anyway, they are not able to get in.&nbsp; i have also found this is true with students who have
 an&nbsp;email within my college before they activate their college office 365 account.&nbsp; once they activate their college office 365 account, then i can share with them easily.&nbsp; the students from the other college activated their college office 365 account, but
 i still can't share with them.&nbsp; i don't see anywhere to change the options to allow me to share outside of my college.&nbsp; is there somewhere that i can change the settings so that i can share outside of my college?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b278adb-2420-4668-bede-addfc1272b79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b278adb-2420-4668-bede-addfc1272b79" /></a></p>
<p>and i also found this when i tried to check permissions within onenote:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3f23b9b-4334-452e-8c4a-9db3d20de9ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3f23b9b-4334-452e-8c4a-9db3d20de9ae" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my college’s office 365 admin tried for a few hours to change the permissions to allow me to share outside of my college, but he could not get it to work.&nbsp; he said “&nbsp;there is no way we can add this to our office 365 account”.&nbsp; this really limits my use of
 the onenote notebooks as lab notebooks.&nbsp; please make it possible for me to share outside of my college network without me having to use my personal microsoft account for work purposes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your admin will need to access the Admin area within O365 and access the "External Sharing" section.
</li><li>Here is a link to a great guide to help your admin get things set up properly
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.share-gate.com/blog/ultimate-guide-deal-with-office-365-external-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Definitive Guide to Office 365 External Sharing</a>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Finer Points:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>There are 2 types of external sharing - Your admin will decide which is best for the school
<ol>
<li>Users need authentication - Most secure and requires some hoop jumping. The great thing about it is that Microsoft handles the authentication for you. Read the next paragraph to learn more.
</li><li>Users DON'T need authentication - Least secure and speaks for itself but there are no hoops to jump through. Users will receive an invite with a link that ANYONE can use to access data
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Users Need Authentication:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>User will get an email with a link to the site </li><li>If the email address you used to send the invite is ALREADY associated with a Microsoft account then they are good to go!
<ol>
<li>They can simply log in to the site by entering the password they already use with Microsoft for the email address you used to send them the invite
</li><li>If their email address ends in @hotmail.com or @outlook.com then their email address should already be associated with a Microsoft account by default.
</li></ol>
</li><li>If the email address you used to send the invite is not associated with a Microsoft account then the user has 2 choices
<ol>
<li>Associate their current email address with a Microsoft account (the same email you used to send the invite)
</li><li>Create a Microsoft account association with a new Microsoft email - This may require you to send a new invite to their newly created address
</li></ol>
</li><li>FYI - For anyone who needs to associate their current address with a Microsoft account...the authentication is a 2 part process
<ol>
<li>Part 1: They will need to fill in their name, address, phone number and date of birth etc.
</li><li>Part 2: They will receive an email verification from Microsoft which will require them to click a link - This proves they aren't a robot.
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>I hope this helps and please mark this as an answer if it addresses your needs!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

            You cannot set the font size on your phone.
