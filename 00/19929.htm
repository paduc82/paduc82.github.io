If that doesn't work, try re-installing Starter:<br />

<span>Office 2010 Starter is only officially installed by computer builders. If you google skillfully, there are a few links to the installation files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Home users do not have access to the installation file so there are only 3 options for “re-installing” it.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>This document outlines the 3 options you have to “re-isntall” Office 2010 Starter:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Office Program Manager</span></li><li><span>Recovery Partition</span></li><li><span>Image Copy Backup</span></li></ol>
<span>Contents of the skydrive link</span>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N125</a>
</span></p>
<p>There is an option that allows users to re-install Office Starter without using the recovery partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It requires that you have the “Microsoft Office 2010 Program Manager” installed. If you go into Programs and Features dialog, look for the “Microsoft Office 2010” entry.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The link above shows how this entry appears in Programs and Features, and how to use it to re-install Office Starter.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Starter is Part of the Recovery Partition</span>
<p><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/products/office/Pages/office_2010_build.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/products/office/Pages/office_2010_build.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<p>Hard drive recovery is a requirement for distributing Office Starter 2010 . A hard-disk-based recovery solution enables Windows 7 to automatically recover from most known causes for unbootable systems as a result of loss or corruption
 of files. </p>
<p>This type of recovery will wipe out all of your installed programs and personal data files. Therefore, before starting this type of “repair” you should make a backup of your disk and make sure that you have the installation files and
 product keys for all of your applications.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Activate Starter - Activated at Factory, No Product Key</span>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-workspace-help/activate-office-2010-programs-HA010354227.aspx?CTT=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-workspace-help/activate-office-2010-programs-HA010354227.aspx?CTT=3</a>

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider not showing up the PIN login</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft<br />
<br />
I have a major problem now, my PIN login isn't showing in the monitor. As soon as i open my windows the screen just freezes before opening PIN login, then it returns to the main screen (clock date). I had a virus the last days and i had a theory. The virus
 might startup in the system boot and in order to remove it i had to disable all services and only keep the basics and needed ones for Windows 10. (Picture taken from my other computer Windows XP) This is the option!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f750282-134e-477e-b009-970db111800b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f750282-134e-477e-b009-970db111800b" /><br />

<p>I think you are saying that you have a paper weight PC right now in that it will not respond to any command.&nbsp; If this is the case, then you are very limited in what you can do.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hit this often and it is always easy to overcome -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Download the Media Creation Tool on another PC.&nbsp; Ask to prepare an USB which will be bootable</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Go into BIOS and change the boot order to USB.&nbsp; Each manufacturer can use a different method.&nbsp; My HP uses a hold down of the ECS key during the initial load</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; With the USB inserted, start the PC.&nbsp; You should see a lot of USB activity</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Select default for the partitions.&nbsp; This should load the USB to Drive C</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the USB when requested. I go back to BIOS and change the boot order to Drive C although it will likely default to Drive C is no USB present</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask for updates and you should get an up to date load of public build</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp; Your files and personal may survive.&nbsp; You will lose installed apps</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp; When you again have a working PC, then you can choose to go Fast Lane back to Insiders.&nbsp; My 15031 looks solid but you can choose to hold out until the next build.&nbsp; Your issue is not likely with 15031</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Been there, done that several times when I make my Insider a paper weight.&nbsp; This routine is fairly fast and gives you back a PC.</p>

<h2>            text message from Microsoft with verification code</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I started using microsoft hotmail, I got messages from a +44 number when I updated my account or needed a verification code to log on.</p>
<p>Lately I've been getting messages from a +675 number, is that a safe number? One day I kept getting verification codes even though I hadn't requested it. From various numbers all starting with +675. Ever since then I haven't trusted getting text messages
 from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though when i change my security updates I get a notification texts from a +675 number too.</p>
<p>I'm really confused.</p>
<p>When I check activities and units I'm logged on to it only shows my own, so it doesn't look like I've been hacked or anything.</p>

<h2>            Contacts list</h2>
                    The change to microsoft and latest update to windows 10 means that I only have a list of previous calls and no contacts. There are no drop down menus so I am unable to change anything and all I want are my contacts. Why do takeovers and updates cause innumerable
 problems? George

<p>why not plan the route offline? you can do this and it will show you the directions using the offline map data. in Maps, just Options &gt; Search address &gt; Options &nbsp;&gt; Search. select OK then Add to route. select Add new route point, add another one, then select
 Show Route. select Options &gt; Simulate if you then need it.</p>

<p>That is what I do.</p>

<p>It shows the route with a black line on maps, and numbers the turns, but does not show my current position as I navigate the route. If I chose to show my position, the route disappears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>well it needs the navigation licence to show you the current position. otherwise you cannot use it, besides even if Google Maps also provides real-time navigation (i.e. also tracking your current position as you drive along), you still have to pay for data
 usage charges through your operator's network. so while you can plan your route and see the directions and where you have to go, you cannot obtain real-time navigation without paying for it. this is the operating premise of every GPS system, phone or standalone
 unit.</p>

<p>Not entirely true. Nokia Maps that came with the N95 you were able to track your current position without the turnb-by-turn navigation. I used it all the time on my N95: Get it to plan my route, then used the Start Tracking option to track my current position
 along the planned route. It didn't give my voice instructions because i didn't buy turn-by-turn navigation. With the N97 it appears you have to buy the turn-by-turn voice navigation to get this feature that was free with Nokia Maps on the N95 - something which
 annoys me too&nbsp; </p>

<p>This feature which was in the early versions of Nokia Maps and was removed from later versions. If you did happen to update the version of Nokia Maps on your N95 you will also lose this feature.</p>

<p>Cjlim is correct, i lost that feature when I updated to V31 on my N82 :(. I must say it was very helpful. The removal of this feature is probably to get more people to buy the voice navigation license</p>

<h2>            Sync outlook mails error code&#58; 85002020&#47;8500201C&#47;8500201F.</h2>
                    <p>I am a Nokia Lumia 800 user. I also met this problem. I installed all the latest update from Nokia. But the problem is still there. The sync outlook mails error code: 85002020/8500201C/8500201F.</p>
<p>Among them, 85002020 is the most common. Can you tell me what mean is it?</p>

how did you determine which emails were causing the problem? was it a specific one or specific group of emails (maybe older than a certain date) that seemed to be involved?<br />

<p>When I got the sync error, I just logged in my web mail site, then delete or move the next email ( the one&nbsp;next to&nbsp;my&nbsp;newest mail on WP phone). Then&nbsp;sync&nbsp;will all right.
</p>

<p>The email&nbsp;is&nbsp;not specific one. If&nbsp;I move the mail back after the sync&nbsp;came back, this mail can be sync to my phone and read&nbsp;OK and normal.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had the same problem on lumia 950XL running the latest win 10 mobile 10.0.14267.1004 and the latest firmware. I solved the problem by changing the number of days to sync email from 2 weeks to 7 days in my email accounts. These MS support/Dev guys are useless.
 Looks like there seems to be a size/message limit on the Exchange Active sync Outlook client, it could be a bug too :-(</p>
<p>The Andriod Active sync client performs better even though it is not from MS, what a shame :-(</p>

    <title>How can I use an old Microsoft Macro that provides an AutoCorrect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewis d. eigen  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I use an old Microsoft Macro that provides an AutoCorrect Utility&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Thanks to help from the community I was able to find my AutoCorrect files and transfer them to a colleagues computer.&nbsp; Then I wanted to take the next step and create an app that will do this.&nbsp; Before trying to code this, I was informed by a colleague that
 in around 2000, Microsoft Support created several sets of Macros for different functions.&nbsp; One set was called "Macro9" and it contains an AutoCorrect Utility.&nbsp; I was able to search the bowels of the Internet and actually find a copy of Macro9.&nbsp; However, when
 I tried to run it, I could not as it was written for 32 bit machines and I have a 64 bit machine.&nbsp; I would like to try that AutoCorrect Utility as I think it will save me a lot of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a 64 bit version of Macro9?&nbsp; or</p>
<p>Is there a contemporary version of the AutoCorrect Utility in the Microsoft archives? or</p>
<p>Is there a newly programmed Microsoft AutoCorrect Utility?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, what do I have to do with the VBA coding to make it function on a 64 bit machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to one of the community members who responded to an earlier post, there is an existing Macro that allows saving and restoring the ,acl Autocorrect file.&nbsp; However this is very slow and converts the .acl to a Word Document, allows editing, and would
 restore the Word Document contents back to the .acl.&nbsp; I am looking for a utility that will allow be to append additional autocorrect files to the user's existing .acl file. and hopefully one that works with the existing .acl files and dot convert them back
 and forth between word and the .acl format.</p>

<p>However, what happens when there are two rows with the same labels in the first column but DIFFERENT correction terms?&nbsp; Does the first one get made, and the second ignored since the changed word no longer matches the label.&nbsp; I think I have to not only deduplicate

</blockquote>
<p>No, it works the other way around: If there are two entries with the same first column but different correction terms in the second column, the macro stores the first one and then overwrites it with the second one. (Your comment about the changed word no
 longer matching confuses the .acl file's contents with a document's contents: The .acl file can contain only one entry with a given "bad word", so adding another entry with the same "bad word"
<em>replaces</em> the first one.) There is no programming in the macro to ignore the second one. It's up to you to remove whichever table row is incorrect.</p>

<p>Lewis, thank you for compiling this documentation. I'll add a link to this thread in my web page for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to correct two misstatements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The add-in does not delete any entries from .acl files or from the Normal template. If you remove an existing entry from the backup document, the entry simply remains
<em>as is</em> in Word's AutoCorrect list. To remove entries from Word's list, use the Delete button in the AutoCorrect dialog.</li><li>If the backup document contains two identical rows, the Restore macro stores the first one and then stores the second one, but because they're identical it appears that the second one hasn't done anything.</li></ul>

<p>Hello Sundeep</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your Windows start menu, scroll to 'Windows Administrative' and left click.&nbsp; Then click on 'Services' and scroll page until you come to 'Bluetooth' and see if it (they) are running.&nbsp; Click on the 'Start' in the left column.&nbsp; If you want to ensure that
 all your Bluetooth options will continue to work after a shutdown or restart, double click each Bluetooth line and set to start automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If using Rich Text Form Content Control&nbsp;in Word 2013, it will display grey text "click here to enter text' after protect form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If user not enter any text in that field, it will still display "click here to enter text'&nbsp; message after print or save to pdf file. How to remove this grey message?</p>
<p>

<p>Not much you can do about that. If you are in for VBA there are some solutions, see this article from Grey Maxey:</p>

            about the same but the nimbuzz have it's own widget for the n97 i dont think fring has the one for n97 still using the old not sure....but i guess try for yourself and compare i havent tried fring since n95. Nimbuzz is pretty fast and is easy to use.

<p>I am having a problem with a Filesite addin for Outlook.&nbsp; After an upgrade the commands on the the ribbon bar for a specific set of Options commands.</p>
<p>I in the past (Office 2003/2007 past) you just deleted outcmd.dat and then on next launch Outlook recreated this stuff and life was good.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am looking for a similar type of solution for Outlook 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has to be a simple answer (so simple I cant
 find it!)</p>

            Worksite &nbsp;add in. &nbsp; Specifically when selecting that tab for worksite a set of commands are not available. &nbsp;Office 2007 you would delete outcmd.dat and at next start outlook would recreate the file and the commands would work. &nbsp;Was thinking there was a
 similar file. &nbsp;Repairing the app does not replace commands. &nbsp;&nbsp;

                    I put in the wrong password into one of my emails for outlook and it got blocked before I remembered and put in the right password.

<div>Problems:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-The only thing I remember about the personal information about this account is Email + Password.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-It's been a while since I been on this account. (Mostly because it was BLOCKED, and after trying for a bit I couldn't get access).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-I just used this as my side-email so everything not extremely important I put through this email, so it may not be extremely important but it is extremely annoying I cannot access this email anymore. (Mostly for past emails; passwords, account verification,
 etc.)</div>

                    I have a PST file that is currently about 600MB, down from almost an entire gigabyte after running the file compaction tool in Outlook.&nbsp; The TOTAL of all the folders is 15MB at a max.&nbsp; How do I shrink this bloated pig any further???

<p>Have you ever used any 3rd party search or organizer programs with Outlook? Many use hidden messages and can contribuate the large file size. You can get

<br />
at least 2 of my readers will know how much i just love outlook, I use it to sync my palm tx pda to the calendar. just checked the size of the pst file to be 589mb just with my emails, no calendar, this because I ran out of space and outlook did a wobbly and
 wouldn't let me use it - file corrupted(no jokes please), so I reverted to palm datebook, and updated my calendar, guess what size that datebook file is? it's a total(3 files) of 7.5mb!!! with my calendar going back to 2003. microsoft, you should be ashamed,
 it's only data!! all this because my pst file reached 2gb!! and ooutlook 2000 has a limit of 2gb anyway, are you listening microsoft, it's ridiculous, it's only data / really stupid I call it. no wonder we want not bloating software.

            <p>Hello mdpowers-slo,</p>
<p>The size of your pst file is not reflected directly by the size of the folders.</p>
<p>When you grow a pst file there is a allocation that occurs to allow for growth. As the file expands in size the allocation is also grown.</p>
<p>Then when the user decides to reduce the file size by deleting messages the size of the pst does not necessarily reduce in direct accordance to the deletion of the messages.
</p>
<p>The reason for this is again the file allocation size. Since the file was say 1 gb in the past, deleting messages and reducing the file size will not necessarily reduce it by very much because the file was once that size the allocation assumes that the allowance
 needs to remain in place to accommodate the user.</p>
<p>If you want to reduce your file size further you will need to create a brand new pst file and drag any contents you wish to keep to the new file and then go from there.
</p>
<p>Here is an article on managing pst file.</p>

<p>Dear Joanne, no we haven't tried your proposal. </p>
<p>The problem has been solved by moving the local parent directory for Sharepoint (server drafts location) to a correct location through Windows Explorer. It was confirmed by Office support that there is a bad, locked setting of the server drafts location
 in Excel and Word when you use Office 365 Business (where you even have no Sharepoint access) and have made changes to default Document folder paths/locations. The path becomes editable only when you have Office 365 Enterprise where you have a true Sharepoint
 connection.<br />
Regards</p>
<p>Ulla</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Sharepoint files in Office 365 Home</h2>
                    
<p>i installed office 365 home on my desktop. i already have office 2007 on my desktop as well.</p>
<p>in office 365 i can join our sharepoint site and open files with "excel online" but i can not right click the file and "open in excel"</p>
<p>the error message i get is: "sorry we couldn't open "file name".xlsx. there are several possible reasons:</p>

<p>i have tried with chrome, mozilla and ie with all the same results.</p>
<p>is it highly likely that the presence of office 2007 is the prob.</p>
<p>if that's the case it looks like i can't upgrade 2007 to create compatibility with o365 since o365 is already installed; but rather should just uninstall 2007?</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Office 365 is designed to work with the latest browsers and versions of Office. If you use old browsers and versions of Office that are not in mainstream support, Office 365 will be in reduced functionality status. For details, you can have a look at the
 following articles:<br />
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-system-requirements?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/office-system-requirements?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a><br />

</p>
<p>Given this situation, it’s recommended you use the latest version of Office in your machine if it’s possible or work online to avoid the conflict.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Internet Sharing and ActiveSync</h2>
                    
<p>WM Professional 6.1 and ActiveSync 6.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use both Intenret Sharing and Active Sync. When I plug in the USB to my device and laptop, it seems like they fight each other. The Internet Sharing screen comes up and tries maybe two to three different times to connect. I click disconnect and it finally
 goes away. Seems that when I want internet sharing, then activesync continues to come up. I always get which ever one I want to work - but it is&nbsp;a hassle. How are you supppose to select which one that you want to use? I just keep saying that I don't want that
 one until it finally leaves me alone.</p>
<p>And while we are on the subjec - by the number of posts - obviously activesync is finicky. Does anyone have any steps that might try to keep it from making me have to readd the device?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<blockquote>second part was not an issue. just asking if anyone has a primer for active sync. something to help trouble shoot and some how tos and whys.</blockquote>

Over the years, one of our moderators, Chris DeHerrera, has compiled a great list of FAQs for activesync (and WMDC) that you will find is helpful.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App doesn&#39;t sync with email accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaileshhembrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App doesn&#39;t sync with email accounts</h2>
                    I use&nbsp;two accounts in the Mail App in Windows 10- an outlook account and a gmail account. But neither of them sync with their email accounts. When I open either gmail or outlook in a browser I find lots of messages which I had already gone through and
 taken relevant action (delete, archive, etc. ). The folders created in the browsers don't sync with the Mail App and this seriously renders using Mail App a futile exercise. Anyone else having the same problem? Any solutions?

    <title>Recieving birthday reminders from unknown people - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recieving birthday reminders from unknown people</h2>
                    <p>I made myself an outlook.com email address for use with windows 8 and xbox live, and for some reason I've been getting birthday reminders for people I do not even know as I have not used this email for correspondence or added contacts to the account. The
 reminder emails give me the option to stop receiving notifications, however it'll give me this message: "Calendar Error - The calendar you requested could not be found. Please make sure you are logged in to the right account and have not deleted the calendar."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying and I'm ready to give up and make a new address of this cannot be fixed. Is there a way to fix this? Once again, these reminders are of people that are complete strangers to me and I have no reason to have these peoples' birthdays associated
 with my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            It is still happening to me! I've gone as far as marking it as junk mail and filtering out my inbox, but its still a prevalent problem!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Same issue here. I'm getting birthday reminders for people I don't know. These reminders are addressed to one of the email aliases I'm using (not the primary) but they definitely are not related to my contact list. It's been going on for months - I just
 never took the time to investigate.</p>
<p>Any solution would be much appreciated...</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
