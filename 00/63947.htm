    <title>Zer0 Unmasked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Zer0 Unmasked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure the many of you have found the Zer0 backstory audio logs scattered in Sawtooth Cauldron. As Angel points out, Zer0 is most likely not human, so what is he exactly? Note his physiology, did anyone else catch that he only has&nbsp;3 fingers on both hands?
 2 thumbs, one of which&nbsp;protrudes in a very abnormal fashion on his right hand. He maintains very good posture for a humanoid. Although Zer0 is slender, he's exceedlingly strong, which&nbsp;probably means that his muscle structure is very dense.&nbsp;His form of speech
 is also rather different than any other creature encountered on Pandora.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zer0 is remarkably similar to the Drell from the Mass Effect trilogy. He's slenderly built just like the drell. He has 3 fingers and a thumb per hand, the Drell have four fingers though two are webbed together. As the Drell evolved, it is possible that they
 would have lost one of the fingers, leaving them with just 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zer0 is an assassin, he enjoys an up close method of execution, or could do it at a distance. Zer0 must be a distant relative of Thane Krios, the Drell assassin from Mass Effect 2 and 3.... Perhaps not....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else have any ideas?</p>

<p>The Pumpkin King? Hmmm.... You may be on to something here. He could always pull a finger or two off; so many possibilities. Yeah, I knew it was Haiku, I'm just saying that it's also vastly different than anyone else on Pandora. Thane Krios is quite the

<p>There's a kind of weird theory flying around the internet that Zer0 is an Eridian (the people who built the vault) I don't know if it's true or not but there is one thing that we can agree on.... Zer0 is either an alien or one f'ed up human.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 says there&#39;s a problem with the drive for my ipod but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaylee 85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 says there&#39;s a problem with the drive for my ipod but wont fix it</h2>
                    I've been trying to connect my new ipod to my new laptop for months now but nothing I've tried has worked. When I plug into the USB port an error message pops up that says "There is a problem with this drive. Scan the drive now and fix it". When I click
 on this message to try and fix it another message pops up saying that Microsoft cannot fix this problem because it can't access the disk or it proceeds to the bring up the scanning and repairing window but freezes before it even begins. Someone please help
 me with this incredibly frustrating issue.&nbsp;

            <p>Generally speaking, you'll get that message that something is wrong with the drive if you just unplug it from the USB port without ejecting it first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you insert a USB device, an additional icon usually appears on the taskbar. If you click that, you should see a popup which says: Eject &lt;name of&gt; drive?. Click that question and Windows will dismount it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you simple remove it, Windows will detect that it wasn't dismounted properly which results in the message that something is wrong with it and to scan it accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with an iPod is that it's a different operating system to Windows. Consequently, Windows can't scan it properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you should do here is to install iTunes on Windows and then scan the iPod with that.

            The iPod typically keeps connecting and disconnecting every half-a-second. I reset it and was somehow able to get it to stop disconnecting. It still wont connect to iTunes, however.&nbsp;I went to My Computer and checked for errors but it came back with no
 errors found. Actually, I've tried two other iPods and neither of them connect properly. I contacted Apple support before even coming here and was told that it was a problem with Microsoft.&nbsp;

            <p>You can check that easily enough by doing the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and click Command Prompt (admin).</li><li>Type or copy/paste: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit Enter.</li></ol>
<p>SFC is an acronym for System File Checker and the tool will check the integrity of Windows system files for corruption. If any are found, it will attempt to repair the file using the DLL repository.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes though, SFC cannot repair files and you'll see a message to the effect that file corruption was found, but Windows resource protection was unable to fix some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that event, use the same command prompt to copy aand then right click and paste the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>When DISM runs, you won't see much happening in screen and for about five minutes, it'll just show a flashing cursor. But eventually, the figure of 20% will appear followed about 15 mins later by 100%. You'll also get a report on whether the tool was successful
 or not. </p>

            I followed your instructions and the command prompt came up with some errors. The errors were resolved and the iPod seemed to connect fine immediately following the repair. However, after ejecting the iPod and injecting it again, the connection problem
 followed as usual. I really don't understand what's wrong here. Should I have a professional look at this issue? I know Microsoft offers a paid service.

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and click Power Options.</li><li>Click the link to "Change plan settings" to the right of whichever power plan you have enabled.</li><li>Click the "Changed advanced power settings" link.</li><li>Expand the tree to USB Settings | USB selective suspend and change both to Disabled.</li></ol>
<p>This setting controls the USB driver. When enabled it suspends the driver if it determines that it's no longer in use. With a non-Windows device like an iPod, it may be taking too long to re-enable itself which results in the drive not being recognized properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are of course at liberty to contact Microsoft paid-for support if you wish, but there's no guarantee that they will be able to resolve the issue for you.</p>

            Hi Janetinaz2,
<br />
<br />What application are you typing the Alt Codes in?
<br />
<br />If you are using a Microsoft Office application, try typing the alt code, then hit Alt + X

<h3> fredtheweasel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update causes BSOD&#47;reboot loop</h2>
                    <p>I just installed the Windows 10 Anniversary update (September ?20 2016).</p>
<p>It took a VERY long time (?1 hour plus?)</p>
<p>At the end when it restarted, before I had the chance to log in it bluescreened with the message:</p>
<p>Your PC ran into a problem (etc)</p>
<p>(it displayed a QR code)</p>
<p>Stop Code: PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA</p>
<p>What Failed: FPWinIo.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened in a loop several times, until it gave up and offered the option to restore, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to go to one of my many restore points but it looks like the update wiped them all - none were found!!! There was no way to roll back the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It booted OK in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually figured out that fpwinio.sys is a driver for the fingerprint reader embedded in the touchpad on my Sager laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update the driver but windows told me the 2013 version was still the most up to date version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used device manager to <strong>disable the fingerprint reader</strong>. After that it restarted fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sharing this in case anyone else gets this problem, and also because there seems to be no way to roll back the anniversary update without a full reset.</p>

<h3> yelrishun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has my computer been hacked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having some very strange issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a website (Low Carb Friends) that I participate in every day.&nbsp; Normally I just stay logged in to it.&nbsp; Now I cannot log in.&nbsp; It will not accept my password.&nbsp; I've changed my password several times and have gotten new ones from them...nothing will
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just made a Word document today and put it on my desktop.&nbsp; I cannot open it.&nbsp; Nor can I open the Word icon on my task bar.&nbsp; Nor can I go into my documents and have it open up that way. &nbsp; I can open Word 2010, but I need to get into Word 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have WinPatrol and it has almost always worked fine for years.&nbsp; Now when I try to remove items in my start menu, it dims and then I get a message that it's no longer working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a Microsoft Security Essentials full scan, a Malwarebytes Anti-Malware full scan, done a System Restore, and run my C Cleaner.&nbsp; The Microsoft Security Scan did show there was a malicious item on there and I removed it.&nbsp; Malware scan showed nothing
 amiss.&nbsp; Things are not getting better...they are getting worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has my computer been hacked?&nbsp; What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw somewhere that it was suggested to wipe the hard drive and re-install the Windows 7 program, but then I don't think I could re-install my Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 that I paid for.</p>

 that I try a different anti-virus, which I did and it took care of the problem!&nbsp; He said he hated to see me reloading Win 7 because it is such a lot of work, which I know from experience that it is.<br />

    <title>Newest version of Skype for iOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emerald_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Newest version of Skype for iOS</h2>
                    <p>I just downloaded the newest version of Skype last night, and so far it looks horrible, it's like a combination of Facebook and Snapchat, I have seen some threads about this, so I know some will agree with me that I would be amazing if they could change
 the layout back to what it previously was. I do hope they will, and I have talked to Skype Live Support, concerning this, they say that they did a lot of security updates and therefore you can't change skype back because of the secruity risk. However, Skype,
 please change the layout back, why change a winning concept?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please add on what you think.</p>

<p>Can't change back because of security? That was likely off a queue card! What a steaming pile this one is. Literaly make it a toy for the kids, but steal all others ideas...and make it unusable at the same time. I Care not of any retribution from MS as I
 am a certified IT admin for a multi national. We went to O365 last year, and picked up a few Skype for Biz options. Last month we completely abandoned Skype for Biz. Today we will be dropping Skype totally. MS never listens.</p>
<p>Its like windows 10 on an IOS device. Nothing is clear. Half the options are glossy, useless forms of communication laziness. If you are a teenager looking for the next trending option, this might be it. But I suspect MS will do a very quick u-turn on this
 when they see the numbers drop off the cliff in a very short time. However, this may very well be the last time many users give MS a chance. They are playing with fire for the last few years and profits are up, but I suspect loyalty is not. I can only imagine
 what they will do to Outlook for IOS. It might not even collect mail any longer, and they will tell us that's what we want! Just when I thought nothing could be more frustrating then Windows 10...MS...you never fail to surprise and FRUSTRATE me. The only thing
 working out for me from MS is the shares I bought years ago at 24 bucks!</p>

<p>Well, if you're on a Mac and an iPhone, and are lucky enough not to have emptied the trash since the last update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Remove the Skype app from iPhone.</p>
<p>2. On the Mac, search for 'Skype' in a finder file window. The app was in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications on my machine.</p>
<p>3. On the Mac, drag Skype 8.1.46715.ipa to the trash.</p>
<p>4. On the Mac, drag Skype 6.35.54.ipa from the trash to the folder where you dragged 8.1.4xx from. (It may add a ' 1' to the end if you've got the previous version for the iPad in the folder, but it didn't seem to hurt, still showed up as 'Skype for iPhone'
 in iTunes)</p>
<p>5. Connect iPhone to Mac, open it by clicking on the phone icon at the top next to the pull-down list.</p>
<p>6. Select 'Apps' (just under 'Summary')</p>
<p>7. Scroll down to the Skype for iPhone app and click the 'install' button.</p>
<p>8. Click the 'apply' button at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the phone apps are updated, start the app on the phone. I had to re-enter my username/password, but I'm happily back at version 6.35 without all the comic-book colors, and I can set my status as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with Skype or MS, this worked for me, not warranted to work for you: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :)</p>

<p>If you pushed a backup to i-cloud before updating skype...you are golden. I had done this, and also had another iphone that had not been updated in a while. I used the other phone and did a backup with itunes, and restored to my daily phone.</p>
<p>If you have a backup in icloud reset your phone and setup from the icloud backup.</p>
<p>Grab your pictures etc before of course.</p>

            Agree with everyone that its a big step backwards. &nbsp;One question, if I go to an active chat, the interface shows a silly patchwork graphic that only takes up precious screen space. Can I get rid of these useless graphics in settings?

    <title>Windows 7 black screen with cursor in both normal and safe mode. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 black screen with cursor in both normal and safe mode.</h2>
                    Hello people, i've recently encountered a problem with my Computer. What happens is that it will boot up to the windows logo just before the login screen, then after that it will just stay on a black screen with a zoomed white mouse cursor. I am able to
 move the cursor but do nothing else, i have tried System restore, boot to last know good boot, and the other advanced f8 menu options. I have also tried safe mode but it just does the same thing with the black screen and mouse cursor. Also my bios screen i
 believe it is now loads way too fast than what it used to do, i'm not sure whats caused this before i turned if the Computer i believe i updated my Nvidia driver im notsure if it caused this or not but since i did that update my computer seems to have died.
 Any help will be much appreciated, thankyou for reading.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue (black screen) you’re facing could be related to drivers and could be resolved by updating the display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the article by <strong>Sharath Srinivasa replied on April 5, 2012</strong> mentioned below.</span></p>

            <p>Long shot:&nbsp; Use a System Repair disk to boot the system.&nbsp; If you did not make one earlier, you need to take a blank recordable CD to a working Windows 7 system that matches the bitness (32 /64) of your system.&nbsp; Start, All programs Maintenance.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is more likely you are going to have to do a re-install of Window 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.canadiantech.info/for-techies/re-build-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.canadiantech.info/for-techies/re-build-windows-7/</a>
</p>
<p>
Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; The Windows 10 reverting program just does not do the job correctly, and will leave your system
 in a state that you will not find satisfactory.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
Clean Install tip
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong>
</span></em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! Do you mind clarifying what exact error message is being presented when you're attempting to upload? Be sure to verify your Privacy &amp; Online Safety settings is adjusted properly to allow for uploads, you can use this article as a guide:

<p>If you mean privacy settings (because you said "allow") then you could be on a child/teen account or you have a suspension preventing you from uploading, I assume, video clips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go here to see if you have a suspension: <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Enforcement/ShowEnforcements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://enforcement.xbox.com/Enforcement/ShowEnforcements</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in a family group you may need to have an adult change some settings for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your adult account go here <a href="https://account.xbox.com/Settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/Settings</a> and click on the child's account and allow the option on the first page called
<strong>"Share stuff people make (Xbox 360: Member Content)" to everyone (must be everyone).</strong> Also, on the first page, "Others can communicate with voice, text, or invites" to Friends or Everybody. And on the xbox one/windows 10 tab the second option
 down, "Join multiplayer games", enable that. And then log out and in on the account in question on the console/device and that account can play online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to change the settings are on this page <a href="https://account.xbox.com/Settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/Settings</a> but child accounts will be redirected to another page about adding a child account to a family group - if your Microsoft account is an adult account you can see that page but any changes will not take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Xbox account can be a child/teen account while your Microsoft account can be an adult. You can not change the xbox account age in any way, that's permanent. The account will turn into an adult account when it reaches 18 (20 in South Korea and Japan).
</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) What exactly happens when you try to connect to the WiFi? Do you get any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Do you remember the KB Numbers of the updates installed on the computer that seems to have caused this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To identify the exact issue, I would suggest you to run the automatic troubleshooters and check if they provides any relevant information regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Run the Network and Network Adapter Troubleshooters</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 1: Run the Network Troubleshooter</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Network troubleshooter is an automated tool which can find and automatically fix some common networking problems. Follow these steps and run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Network Troubleshooter</em></strong>” in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click on “<strong><em>Identify and repair network problems</em></strong>” on the left pane of the window.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us also run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 2: Run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Network Adapter troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check the adapter in the computer for any known issues and provides the details and on how to fix them. Follow these steps and run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View</em></strong>
<strong><em>All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on “<strong><em>Network</em></strong> <strong><em>Adapter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>
<strong><em>as</em></strong> <strong><em>Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the troubleshooting report of both the troubleshooters and share the details with us. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue. If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Wireless LAN Drivers from the Lenovo Website</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 1: Uninstall the Device Drivers</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on “<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong>” from that list.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Search for the Network Card device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><em>Delete the driver software for this
 device</em></strong>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, please open the <strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong> again and then click on the “<strong><em>Scan for hardware changes</em></strong>” button. Check if Windows 8.1 detects the Network Card device and installs an
 appropriate driver automatically. If the issue still persists, then try the next step.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 2: Check Windows Updates for the latest drivers.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Updates</em></strong>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” from the search result.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” window, click on the link: “<strong><em>Check for updates</em></strong>” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8.1 driver, then try the next step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 3: Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer’s website:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Wireless LAN Drivers for this laptop model from the link given below using another computer having an Internet connection. After the download is complete, transfer the driver setup file to this computer, install it and then
 check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Latetia23 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Here are minimum system specs listed. As per that you are good to go. But you also need to check whether your Intel processor is a pass for Windows 10 or not. 
<br />

            Hi Latetia23 
<br />
<br />The newer versions of Windows 10 will not run on that system, you would be unable to get device drivers for the newer versions . . .
<br />
<br />You would be able to install up to Windows 10 version 1703 on that device and if you are, because of the amount of RAM you have (2GB) you should install the 32bit version of Windows 10 . . .

<p>See DaveM121's reply and let me add the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2GB is inadequate for running most programs under Windows 10 with acceptable performance Unless you do little more than e-mail and web searches, I would either upgrade to at least 4GB, or better, buy a new computer. A new computer that comes with Windows
 10 wouldn't cost too much than buying Windows 10 and needed hardware upgrades.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get into boot options in Lenova g580 &#38; I need to boot from USB drive</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi all ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have been having a nightmare with this laptop and things have just got worse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>see missing MSRPC file &amp; Critical Service&nbsp; Failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>As if I don't have enough problem I am now unable to boot into my BIOS and change the boot sequence. I have tried everything , f12 , f2 .f4,escape going to safemode, recovery ,advance startup ,troubleshooting ,advance options ,UEFI&nbsp; Firm ware setting&nbsp; ,restart
 to change&nbsp; UEFI firmware settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the laptop reboots I still can't get in the boot menu/bious&nbsp; thingy and it goes through the whole blue screen thingy again and eventually i.m able to get into safemode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried taking th battery out of the laptop and that didn't fix the problem and even tried the NOVA button and that brings up a small blue menu "Nova Button Menu " , with 4 options, normal startup , bios setup , boot manager and system recovery.
 But I have tried all these options and none of them fix the problem and I can't get int the boot menu , so I can load the USB stick first and run the mediarecoverytoolthingy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I can't run setup whilst in save mode I need to get the computer to boot to the USB drive and I have tried everything without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have changed some system settings accidentally while trying to fix my original problems, i ran alot of different program trying to fix my problems including scf scan /fixboot, windows boot manager , dism and boot options ect and perhaps I have changed
 something that is stopping me getting into my boot options on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. When in safemode&nbsp; the USB drive is showing up ,but I need to get it to boot from this drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back. The keys used to begin the BIOS setup depends on the brand and model of your computer. Since you can't get into boot options even when using a USB bootable drive, it would be best if you get in touch with your computer manufacturer
 so they'll be able to guide you in accessing and changing the boot sequence on your BIOS.</p>

<h2>            Windows Maps app on a Lumia phone with Windows 10 doesn&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Hello! I’d like to ask if there is any way to reset/reinstall/get working the Windows Maps app on a Lumia phone with Windows 10. The app doesn’t open, or, to be more precise,
 shuts down by itself immediately after opening. There are instructions on the web explaining how to reinstall the app on a PC but not on a phone (that has much fewer and simpler settings). I can’t open the maps app from the store either, since those attempts
 get directed back to the phone. And Windows doesn’t allow to delete the app in order to reinstall. Thanks a lot!</span></span></p>

            Hi, Normunds,
<br />
<br />Step 1:
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update and security &gt; Check for updates.  
<br />For apps, go to Store &gt; Downloads and updates &gt; Check for updates. Does performing a soft reset make any differences? 
<br />
<br />I believe it is By Design the Maps app cannot be uninstalled. It is integrated into the system. If Step 1 didn't resolve the issue perform a Hard Reset.       
        </p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Rogelio. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />You have tried to enter with a browser from the phone to this link and re-download the app:

            Dear Rogelio, thank you for the reply. I've tried this before, and it doesn't seem to work. When I click to install, it says that maps have already been installed on the device and nothing happens. I suppose it should be uninstalled first, but that is
 not possible, as the app is integrated in Windows.

<p>Dear Pat, thank you much for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Soft reset doesn't solve the issue. (2) the phone has run Windows automatic updates after the time when Maps stopped working. The phone is up to date and doesn't show any pending updates. (3) Unfortunately, I can't find any updates for Maps on Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I considered hard reset, but first wanted to find out if there is an easier solution, since hard reset involves restoring all of the personal content.</p>
<p>

            I have an Android phone. I go to Apps &gt; Select the App and Clear Cache 
<br />You might try that on your Windows Phone.to determine if it begins to open as it should.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, the only way is to perform a Hard Reset.

<p>I had same problem and I didn't test hard reset (maybe that help). Instead of hard reset I use
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Device Recovery Tool</a> for complete clean install to my Lumia 950.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tool download and install original, very old build. After restore disconnect phone from PC and connect it to your Wi-Fi, but do not connect it to MS Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It take 3 or 4 update round installing each released version one after another and end up to latest version 1709 (build 15254.544).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to do this (or hard reset) make backup first. </p>
<p>When all updates are done connect to MS account -&gt; Backup will restore your settings.</p>

<p><span>There are at least three devices that I would have to reinstall from scratch otherwise without any guarantee that the app will work afterwards. I must admit I cannot understand why they even disabled the

<p>I performed a Hard reset of my Lumia 950 and it did NOT help.</p>
<p>Regarding "an update to the app in the near future" you do realize that the official end of Windows Phone is going to happen at the end of 2019, so why would there be an App update.</p>
<p>I will keep experimenting and if I stumble on a solution I will post.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. So I guess everything would come down to using the Windows Device Recovery Tool, like Pauli O suggested.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do realize that the support for Windows Phone ends at the end of 2019, but I somehow hope that they will at least until then provide some updates here and there for stuff like that. Well, at least for this app.</p>

<p>Hi I am a bit wary of using the Recovery Tool so I instead installed a copy of Waze &amp; also GPS Navigation.</p>
<p>One or the other gets me where I want to go.</p>
<p>Please let us know if the use of the Windows Device Recovery Tool works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardest challenge now is deciding which Mobile Phone to buy when the "END" comes. I can't see myself with a Phablet strapped to my side and I am drawn to the (supposed) support of "Android One" but none of the phones match to my experience with my 950.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB4022727 always failed</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone !</p>
<p>I'm admin sys and network and I'm testing Windows 10 on my domain.</p>
<p>Windows try to make severals update but this one always failed&nbsp;(KB4022727) and it comes back every day. (boring by the way it's stupid to have to disable the service at every reboot to not be harassed. Only one should do it and we could forced them by WSUS
 like usual)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I've tried :</p>
<p>- Update on my firm network : Failed</p>
<p>- Update on free network withouth proxies, firewall, antivirus, everything open : Failed</p>
<p>- Install it manually : Failed even in safe mode.</p>
<p>- Check the log : Nothing found really clear.</p>
<p>I also do :</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow</p>
<p>- clean the DSIM update</p>
<p>- delete the update folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got enough space on my pc. (Around 167 Go)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My collegue has the same pc on our office, same configuration (except I've got a&nbsp; linux in dual boot managed by grub and there is no way I changed this)<br />
</p>
<p>I've disabled my antivirus just in case but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On linux, a simple line install everything and the logs are clear.</p>
<p>Why isn't that simple on Windows ?</p>
<p>Please, someone can help ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p />

            That is a cumulative update from June 13, 2017—KB4022727 (OS Build 10240.17443) 
<br />
<br />That update has likely been succeeded by newer cumulative updates. Why would you need to install it?

<p>In fact I don't need to install it the problem is, I'm in testing phase and everytime I started my pc, I've got this blue screen insisting for this update.</p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.
