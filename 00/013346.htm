    <title>Excel locks up every 30-90 second for 15-30 seconds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel locks up every 30-90 second for 15-30 seconds</h2>
                    Recently I have become frustrated&nbsp; when using Excel.&nbsp; In the process that I use, I have two Excel programs opened at a time.&nbsp; The second workbook is large and has many worksheets.&nbsp; I find the Excel workbook will lock up every 60 to 90 seconds for 15 to
 30 seconds.&nbsp; During these times I have opened Task Manager and have observed this lockup which will use 15% to 35% of CPU usage during the lockup.&nbsp; The memory usage will jump 20,000 to 50,000 K.&nbsp; This only happens when I am work within the workbook.&nbsp; I have
 disabled the Auto Save function with no changes.<br />
<br />
Please help me to clean this up.&nbsp; Please also note I have had Office 2010 installed, then uninstall 2010 and reinstall 2007.&nbsp; This appears to only be on my Home Office system and not on my Office system.&nbsp; I have Norton 360.&nbsp; I have check my system further with
 Glary Utilities, Malware Bytes and Spybot.<br />
<br />
I am loosing all my productivity.&nbsp; Your insight &amp; Help is much appreciated.<br />

            By "autosave" do you mean Office button &gt; Excel Options &gt; Save option &gt; "Save Autorecover information every ? minutes".&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the interval set there roughly the same as your problem interval?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In the same location, try turning ON "Disable Autorecover for this workbook only"<br />
<br />
Rather than turning "Autorecover" completely&nbsp; off, bump up the interval to 10-20 minutes or more.<br />
<br />
Do you have any images in the Workbook? Have they been edited? If there are, in the Advanced option scroll to the "Image size and Quality" section, turn on "discard editing data".<br />
<br />
In the Advanced options, scroll down to "formulas" section. Turn on "enable multi-threaded calculation" and "Use all processors on this computer."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You may also want to work through the following trouble shooting procedures to see if you can pin down the cause of the slowdown:<br />

<p><b>NOTE:<span>&nbsp;
</span></b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth addin installed. Various BlueTooth addins have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you
 have a BlueTooth add, disable it.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then try this more aggressive uninstall (followed by re-install) procedure:</p>
<p>Also uninstall Office Trial editions and any other Office-related programs such as "Office Activation Assistant" and any Office Viewer programs from the Programs applet in Control Panel. But you don't have to
 uninstall Office Starter if you have it. Then make sure to reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) after completing repair or uninstall.</p>

<p>Recently a couple readers wrote to me with very similar problems. One was having trouble getting Internet Explorer to run; the other, Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>In other words, a couple of Windows' own built-in tools were broken. (Note to Microsoft: That should
<em><span>not </span></em>happen. Come on!)</p>
<p>Usually, for situations like these, I recommend an end-run around the problem. Internet Explorer won't work? Install Firefox or Chrome and use that instead. Can't load Windows Explorer? Switch to any number of even better
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/212334/windows_explorer_explained_choosing_a_replacement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Explorer replacements</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn't really solve the problem. If you're hoping to fix your broken tool, you'll need to do a little trouble shooting. To start, I recommend switching to (or creating) another user account, then seeing if Explorer runs
 properly. If it does, you've narrowed down the problem significantly (and should consider "moving" to a new user account permanently). If not, well, back to square one.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a simple method of figuring out how deeply rooted into Windows the problem is. And that will help considerably as you Google-search for an actual fix (assuming there is one--sometimes these things can be resolved only

<h2>            VBA mailmerge runs fine from editor, fails from Word</h2>
                    <p>HI gang. What on earth would cause the code below to work just fine when run from the editor but consistently throw a 5922 (Word was unable to open the datasoruce) when run from the macro dialog?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Dim DS As String, SQS As String, sheetname As String</span></p>
<p><span>DS = "C:\Path\MyExcelFile.xlsx"</span></p>
<p><span>sheetname = "MySheet"</span></p>
<p><span>SQLStmt = "SELECT * FROM `" &amp; sheetname &amp; "$`"</span></p>
<p><span>ActiveDocument.MailMerge.OpenDataSource Name:=DS, _</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQLStatement:=SQLStmt, _</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubType:=wdMergeSubTypeAccess</span></p>
<p><span>ActiveDocument.MailMerge</span><span>.Destination = wdSendToNewDocument</span></p>
<p><span>ActiveDocument.</span><span>Execute Pause:=True</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even stranger is this: if I add a statement to limit the merge to only certain records, it
<em>always</em> works. Shouldn't the no-distractions merge be simpler??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried other Excel file (all of them small and uncomplicated); same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues appreciated.</p>

<p>I am surprised that coppergate bold is not in the home and student 2013 word</p>
<p>it was in the word software preceding word 2013&nbsp;and its in&nbsp;365 but then Microsoft wanted a yearly subscription</p>
<p>as for the PDF conversion, again it was in 365 </p>
<p>I save the built doc to" save as" location</p>
<p>then I click export </p>
<p>create PDF/XPS</p>
<p>then click publish</p>
<p>the prog then displays</p>
<p>"could not open file no program is associated with this file type"</p>
<p>I am flummoxed !! to say the least</p>
<p>I need both this font type and the ability to convert word to PDF for my website</p>
<p>thank you for your help</p>

            Hello Stefan 


I have looked at your link 


the font sizes in coppergate gothic bold that I need are 12 and 26 


not quite sure which sizes to go for in their list 


could you assist me on selecting these two font sizes 


but why in office 365 which I had( and have not gone for the renewal of the subscription) it had this font type on but yet student 2013 has not ? 


the earlier versions of word also have this font 



I have a website and have selected this font type for the build 


so its either revert back to the earlier word progs or pay these prices 



another issue 


I had upgraded to windows 8.1 


on the latest 8.1 update it completely corrupted my website build software and just for the **** of it disconnected my browser 


having had enough of 8.1 my website software had started to freeze up in mid build since I moved from 7 to 8.1 I threw the teddy out of the cot and went for a 27 inch mac 


Im using parallels software with windows 7 in this virtual desktop and up to press it

            <p>As I wrote, I don't think the font you are looking for is included with Word or Windows (not any recent version at least).<br />
<br />
Note that TrueType and OpenType fonts don't install particular sizes; you can specify the font size you want from within programs. In Word, to use a font size that isn't listed, just type it into the Font Size box (on the Home tab) and press Enter.</p>

<p>The headset earphones work fine. The online mic in the headset has decided to have an incredibly low pick, almost non existant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android 7.0, Skype version 8.18.0.8</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is phone wide effect even though I suspect Skype I cannot be entirely sure. If I unplug the headset/ earphones there is no problem.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If the audio input&nbsp;quality depends entirely on the microphone that's being used by the device.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, it works fine without the earphones.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You need to rename the mapi32.dll file to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>This file normally located at&nbsp;<span>C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Msmapi\</span></p>
<p><span>If you can't find it-&gt;</span></p>
<p>Open Explorer and Click on View and select Folder and Search options</p>
<p>Then check the option "show the hidden files." and apply.</p>
<p>After that, go to advanced search and type mapi32.dll and select include hidden and system files.</p>
<p>Once you get the file, rename it. Then Launch Outlook.</p>
<p>(if prompted insert the Office 2010 disc)</p>

            <p>Hi Nellie,<br />
<br />
Yes, we can't use Office Online without OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>Currently there is no <a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/products?tab=O-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 subscription</a> which includes Office Online but has no OneDrive for Business. And we assign only Office Online license to a user, SharePoint Online license is needed.<br />
Actually, when we create a document in Office Online, it has to be saved and kept in somewhere and it's OneDrive for Business library by default.</p>
<p><br />
If you don't want to enable OneDrive for Business for users, we can consider using these methods:<br />
1. For newly created users who have not signed in to Office 365, global admin can go to
<strong>SharePoint admin center</strong> &gt; <strong>user profile </strong>&gt; <strong>
Manage User Permissions</strong> &gt; if you see <em>Everyone except external users</em> listed in the box, please remove it. Type the user's name, add the user into the list, scroll down to
<strong>Permissions for userxxxx</strong>, make sure <strong>Create Personal Site ...
</strong>option is <strong>not</strong> selected, click <strong>OK</strong> to save the change.</p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c1cb7fd7-0ca0-471c-b1c1-9ea4019942aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc1cb7fd7-0ca0-471c-b1c1-9ea4019942aa" /></a></p>
<p>After doing the above, the new user's personal site will not be created and he will not be able to access OneDrive for Business library. Admin can also go to
<strong>Admin center</strong> (new UI) &gt; <strong>Users </strong>&gt; <strong>Active users</strong> &gt; select the user and click
<strong>OneDrive Settings</strong>, he will see a message saying "<em>OneDrive is not provisioned for this user</em>".<br />
<a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d5667f35-a59f-4427-a895-f760f05b6f7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd5667f35-a59f-4427-a895-f760f05b6f7f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. For users who have already used OneDrive for Business, the above steps will not work. We can disable the sync button for the user's OneDrive for Business library:<br />
<br />
Go to <strong>Admin center</strong> &gt; <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Active users</strong> &gt; click
<strong>OneDrive Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Access files</strong> &gt; click the link to go to the user's OneDrive for Business library &gt; click
<strong>Return to classic OneDrive</strong> in the lower left corner &gt; Settings icon &gt; turn
<strong>Ribbon</strong> on &gt; <strong>Library</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Library Settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced settings</strong> &gt; select <strong>No</strong> in <strong>
Offline Client Availability</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />

            Hi Nellie,<br />
<br />
What do you mean by "remove users' access to OneDrive for Business"? Could you share more details with us?<br />
If we don't want users to access OneDrive for Business, we can go to SharePoint admin center &gt; user profile &gt; Manage User Profiles &gt; find the user by typing his name &gt; hover over the account name and click the down arrow &gt; Manage site collection owners &gt; remove
 the user from both Primary Site Collection Administrator and Site Collection Administrators.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>Your initial response above gave a bunch of detailed instructions on removing a user's access to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then asked, "If we remove users' access to OneDrive for Business, can they still use the Office Online apps? That doesn't seem possible."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't seem to understand where I'm coming from. I'm not interested in removing user access from OneDrive if that means they can't use the Office Online apps. That would have the same effect as not subscribing to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm interested in is being able to tell my employer that they have no choice but to subscribe to OneDrive if they want users to be able to use the Office Online apps.</p>

<p>last week two of our customers have changed their Internet connection and, for this reason,&nbsp;their providers have changed their public IP addresses. Since both have an Exchange Server On-Premis, the public IP address of their mail server was changed also.
 After this change was made, they wasn't more able to send e-mails to recipients that are on the Office 365/Exchange OnLine Platform. When they try to send e-mail, they always receive back an NDR like this:</p>
<p><strong>AM1FFO11FD040.mail.protection.outlook.com ha restituito questo errore:<br />
Service unavailable; Client host [<em>public IP address</em>] blocked using FBLW15; To request removal from this list please forward this message to
</strong><strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, we have forwarded a lot of NDR to the address mentioned above (and also to

*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;and 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), but they still have problems and the delisting team never say them anything...</p>
<p>We think that, perhaps, their IP addresses ar listed in your blocklist due to the wrong PTR record resolution, since the connectivity provider (Telecom Italia) have spent one week to modify the PTR records... But now all the DNS record regarding their mail
 server are OK. Their public IP addresses are cheched also by the Outlook.com Delivery team using this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=capsub&amp;productkey=edfsmsbl3&amp;locale=en-us&amp;ccsid=635806049111602712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../getsupport</a></p>
<p>And a specialist&nbsp;answer this to us:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Sachin and&nbsp;I work with the Outlook.com Sender Support Team.</p>
<p>I do not see anything offhand with the</p>
<p>IPs: <strong>(<em>public IP address</em>)</strong> that would be preventing your mail from reaching our customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>We noticed that you provided error message that advises you to contact </em>
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em><em>.&nbsp; Those errors are investigated by a different support team and we have escalated this issue to them on your behalf.&nbsp; Someone from
 that team should contact you within 24 hours.&nbsp; In the future, you will receive the quickest resolution for these errors by emailing that address directly</em></p>
<p>So, why our customer's IP addresses are still listed in your blocklist, causing very serious problems to their business? Why the delisting team, that say they are answering within 24 hours, doesen't say anything to us and doesen't remove our customer's IP
 addreses from the blocklist quickly?</p>
<p>Please help me&nbsp;to resolve the problem very quickly, because our customers are angry for that since they have a lot of problem with their business.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For this type of scenarios, you should request the removal by forwarding the NDR to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. If you already did that then have to follow up with the delist team - hopefully they can give you some more feedback.</p>
<p>The other option is to asking the recipient side O365 admin open a SR with Office 365 support and work with the engineers on solving this issue.</p>

<p>Hope this will help you!</p>

<p>Hi Garenlngu,</p>
<p>thanks for your suggestion. Since we have also customers that use Office 365, we have asked to one of them to open a case with the support and, following this way, the problem was resolved... But do you agree with me that it isn't the correct way to address
 the problem, do you? I think your answer is yes... If Microsoft create a service (blocking list) but they doesn't correctly support it (the delisting team), I think this is a big problem...</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi MaxVader71,</p>
<p>Glad to hear that the problem was resolved by opening a case with the support.</p>
<p>Actually, Microsoft has not only one way to support such kind of issues. Besides opening a case, we can also try resolving the issue via our forum support by giving us your relevant tenant information and the complete NDR message. And we will help you escalate
 the case to our relevant team to fix the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Difficulty managing Distribution Groups - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Difficulty managing Distribution Groups</h2>
                    <p>In my browser-based O365 client, I am able to view the distribution groups that I own and am a member of, by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To control access to this Group, you can do this in the browser:</p>
<p>1. Log in to O365 - go to 'portal.office.com', you should end up being logged into 'Microsoft 365' with your O365 ID visible in the top right-hand corner;</p>
<p>2. In left from your name (O365 ID) you should see a cog symbol;</p>
<p>3. Click on the cog to show 'Settings' and click on 'Mail' at the bottom of the list;</p>
<p>4. In the left-hand pane of the new display, expand the entry 'General' (above 'Mail');</p>
<p>5. Click on 'Distribution Groups';</p>
<p>6. The group mentioned should show under the list 'Distribution groups I own' in the main window (members of the group will see it in the list ‘Distribution groups I belong to’);</p>
<p>7. Select the group in the list and you should be able use the icons showing to add or remove people from the group as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few years ago, in my previous company, when Office 365 'Modern' Groups were introduced, the interface changed, and we watched people's ability to manage distribution groups&nbsp;(including our own) disappear as the new versions of the O365 browser-based client
 were rolled out across the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having this in mind, I was alarmed when one of my users reported that he was not able to process beyond step 5, as 'Distribution Groups' no longer showed in his list of options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there changes afoot with regard to distribution groups and their management?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please remind me.&nbsp; How do I find/establish the version of O365 browser-based client in use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Quinton</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have ActiveSync 4.5 installed and it does not connect to Smartphone via Bluetooth.&nbsp; I am able to Partner the phone with the pc.&nbsp; ActiveSync is setup to 'Allow Wireless Connections' when connected. I tried connected while disabling the Firewall
 but this did not work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing is that on the phone, the only 'Service' that appears on the phone is 'Wireless Stereo' and I was told that 'Active Synce' should also be in that list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas which be appreciated as I have tried everything?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Do you mean that it does not work when you click "Connect via Bluetooth"? Did you set Activesync to connect to the proper Com port in Connection Settings? The com port must be&nbsp; the same as the one used by your PC.<br />
<br />
Also, for this to work, you must successfully sync your device though USB first.<br />

<p>Initially I Partner the phone with the&nbsp;pc successfully, then I try to connect from the PC using ActiveSync, from Connection Setting&gt;then clicking Connect with 'Allow wireless connection on device when connected to
 the desktop' box is ticked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I tried connecting from the phone by using ActiveSync via Menu&gt;then selecting "Connect via BlueTooth".&nbsp; This prompts the setup of a partnership.&nbsp; I click 'Yes' and and 'Add new device' appears as well as my "Computer" as it was already
 partnered.&nbsp; I tried adding the device again, when I arrive at the "Services" screen, only "Wireless Stereo" is displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have successfully connected using USB though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not connected via a COM port.&nbsp; Is this necessary for Bluetooth?

                    <p>Inactive window scrolling works fine in Word, but not in Excel. This is driving me mad because I'm doing a job right now where I have to look through different workbooks side by side, and inactive scrolling would probably speed things up by about 25%.</p>

<h2>            Truncating Calander Events Issue</h2>
                    Hi everyone, <br />
<br />
For work I get calander events for the trips I go on. I sync my Motorola Q9m to laptop. When I look at the event its incomplete. At the bottom is says: " Text truncated on device. Modifications of these items on the device will overwrite full text on desktop."
 The problem is, is that I do not want the event truncated. I want the whole event. I have been looking into settings on both the phone and the laptop and I do not see anything. Can anyone help??<br />
<br />

    <title>10130-Any Difference in Network Access with Password or PIN log - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saltgrass  say:</h3>
<h2>            10130-Any Difference in Network Access with Password or PIN log in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The reason I ask is because I did a clean install of 10130 on one system using a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; Since I had not used the PIN logon before I decided to try.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After logging on, I opened Explorer and went to the Network section.&nbsp; I noticed I could not see my other Windows 10 system or my NAS.&nbsp; Long story-short, I spent two hours going through network settings and making sure everything was OK.&nbsp; Nothing I did seemed
 to help and I noticed the iTunes server on my NAS was accessible, but not the file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of frustration, I decided to restart the system and sign in with a password.&nbsp; Well, both&nbsp;shares were shown and accessible.&nbsp; I thought it strange, so I restarted again and logged in with the PIN, and again the systems were missing from the Explorer listing.&nbsp;
 It might be noted, I could see a Windows 8.1 system using a Local Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any attempt to access them using the \\Computer\share option met with error messages and a User and Password dialog were never presented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to confirm this situation, I went through the same process with my laptop, again a clean install and signed in with PIN.&nbsp; Same results, meaning no access to the referenced systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I had not used a PIN before, this may have happened in earlier builds.&nbsp; There may also be a possibility something with the Router is involved but I don't have the knowledge to track the problem down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Network connectivity does not seem to be involved,
 so for now, I would recommend no one log on using the PIN option if you need to access local assets.&nbsp; I have no way to know what else may be involved with this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks..</p>

            <p>Big thanks for sharing your experience with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New to Windows 10, went from 8.1 straight to 10130 beta and had problems with not accessing NAS shares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying various stuff on the net, changing settings, adding registry settings, all it was in the end was the signing in with a pin.</p>
<p>Signed out and logged back in with password and all is well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIG THANKS, this method does work!!!!</p>

            <p>This is a strange one, on latest 10166 and I decided to try the pin access.</p>
<p>I have 3 NAS boxes, Synology, Buffalo and Lenovo.</p>
<p>The Lenovo was the only one that wouldnt work with Win10 &amp; PIN, switch back to normal account login and the Lenovo started working again. &nbsp;Confirmed multiple times on 3 different win10 machines.</p>
<p>Very strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should say, this is Samba shares or any access like \\192.168.1.4 or \\nas2 etc</p>
<p>Web access to management page works fine still.</p>

            <p>I am not sure exactly what is involved in this situation.&nbsp; But the later builds do the same thing, and because an upgrade install may already have the credentials for some device, they may work where a clean install may not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the original situation is about a device which does work with a Password sign in, is not seen with a PIN sign in....&nbsp; My thoughts are in certain situations, since you have not signed into anything using a password, an external device may not be seen
 correctly.&nbsp; But all I can do is guess and see if it continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some use the system may learn to recognize the external device.. I suppose I need to try harder to see under what circumstances that might happen, perhaps after at least one password log in.</p>

            <p>most likely it's "user+password access" to shares (in SMB file sharing since, like, FOREVER) and a lack of general BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY with THEIR OWN STUFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was VERY concerned with the strong-arming of the Microsoft Logon, which changes your login name to AN! E-MAIL! ADDRESS!.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently SMB sharing doesn't allow for PIN access from Windows 10 because it DOES! NOT! KNOW! YOUR! REAL! PASSWORD! UNLESS! YOU! ENTER! IT!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's not storing a hash, even. &nbsp;Bummer, because a stored password hash would FIX! THIS! PROBLEM!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had trouble with share access disappearing mid-session a few times. &nbsp;But 'no access at all' is VERY VERY VERY disappointing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks OP and others for reproducing this and CLEARLY demonstrating its existence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure if you, as a home network 'admin', installed some over-priced microsoft OS domain controller, it would "fix" the problem. &nbsp;But I wouldn't go there. &nbsp;Not at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Linux running Samba can act as an old-style domain controller, or a NAS, or a number of different things (including a simple repository of shared files), without paying money. &nbsp;go figure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>well, until NOW, anyway. &nbsp;And is THAT part of the big picture on this?</p>

<h2>            Hacking Problems</h2>
                    I have changed my password about 5 times in the last 6 months. I keep having people trying to access my account in different parts of the country and different states. When I look at the screen where it shows when/where I sign in, there are more "unsuccessful
 attempts" at logging into my account than I'm actually using it. I use my account on my I-phone mostly, but sometimes Firefox on a desktop computer at my work. I am getting super frustrated because about once a month, all of my contacts get sent a spam email.
 It's embarrassing and frustrating! I report to Outlook that it wasn't me, they make me change my password and people continue to try to hack into my account. I have had this account for 10+ years and do not really want to start over with getting a new email
 address, but I've very close to closing this account due to all the problems I'm having. Does anyone have any solutions? Please help me!<br />

    <title>windows defender and windows automatic updates turned off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaketolan  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows defender and windows automatic updates turned off</h2>
                    <p>I've recently been having problems with my windows defender always being turned off and my windows automatic updates also being "disable by your system administrator."&nbsp; When I go to control panel &gt; system and security &gt; windows update &gt; change settings,
 under "important updates" there's a red shield with an x and the drop down list is grayed out, not allowing me to change it.&nbsp; Below it says "windows will never check for, download, or install updates."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to check for updates manually, I get a pop-up message that says, "Windows Update can't check for updates because settings on this PC are controlled by your system administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open windows defender and attempt to update virus and spyware definitions, I receive a pop-up notification that says, "This app couldn't check for virus and spyware definition updates.&nbsp; Check your internet or network connection and try again."&nbsp; The
 support information lists this as "Error Code: 0x80004004"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, this wouldn't bother me, but my firefox window has recently been randomly crashing, uninstalling my apps (colorful tabs and adblocker. I used to have NoScript installed too, but I gave up on resetting all my settings on that one every week couple
 days), and installing one or two random, obviously malware apps.&nbsp; Additionally, I'll find a new malware in my list of programs (which I immediately uninstall).&nbsp; They all have different names, but they're just generic things like "Daily Bible Verse" or "roboisaver."&nbsp;
 The firefox crashing and uninstalling my apps is easily the most annoying part of all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the windows update troubleshooter, to no avail, and I've also completely reset my firefox a couple of times, but it doesn't seem to change anything, which leads me to believe it has to do with my defender and updates being disabled.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any tips on how to fix any of this?&nbsp; It's been happening for about 2 months or so now, starting with the windows defender being suddenly turned to off and later including the firefox crashes and the windows update turning off.</p>

            <p>The only significant change I can think of was installing the Adobe Creative Cloud, but I've since deleted that and all associated programs after my trial ended, and the problems have persisted.&nbsp; The problems did not occur concurrently with that download,
 but maybe a week or so after downloading it.&nbsp; That was just the most recent major download I can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe I have any extra security software downloaded, and I can't see any in my programs list.&nbsp; Up until recently, Windows Defender and Firewall were getting the job done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also running Windows 8.1 and "gpedit.msc" isn't bringing up anything when I type it into the Run prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>typing "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">net user administrator /active: yes" into my command prompt returns "you entered an invalid value for the /ACTIVE option."</span></p>

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

            <p>Thanks for your advice.&nbsp; I've tried several of these, and they have deleted/quarantined a few (~15) potential malware files, but nothing has changed my ability to check for windows updates or turn on my windows defender.&nbsp; I'm hoping what they've gotten rid
 of will fix my internet browser issue, but without windows defender back up and running, it seems like that might only be a temporary fix.&nbsp; :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of them seemed like they were meant to run for Windows 7, and I'm running Windows 8.1, if that makes a significant difference.&nbsp; They seemed to work fine, though; they just didn't do anything for my windows defender/update problem.</p>

            <p>I finally decided to do this, mostly because I'll be upgrading to Windows 10 immediately after (I can't download it now because I can't download any updates), so I figured I would probably want to clean my lappy out anyway.&nbsp; I moved all of my personal files
 onto my skydrive/jump drives, but there's one thing that's keeping me from resetting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows office (2013, I think) on this laptop, but I can't find the original package for it.&nbsp; I'm concerned that I won't be able to re-download my programs without some kind of security code that might be in that packaging.&nbsp; I see the files on my
 microsoft account, though, so I'm confident that there should be a way to re-download them.&nbsp; I'm just unsure of how getting those programs back onto this computer will work, and I don't want to reset it until I know I'm not going to blow that purchase because
 I didn't cover my bases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does require some sort of security/download code, is there a way to find that on my computer?</p>

<h2>            Shared Mailboxes Sent Items</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Following this article - <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2015/03/03/want-more-control-over-sent-items-when-using-shared-mailboxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2015/03/03/want-more-control-over-sent-items-when-using-shared-mailboxes/</a></p>
<p><br />
It states that we can enable emails sent from a shared mailbox to go to the shared mailbox sent items.</p>
<p>I've enabled using the commands in the article, but this still isnt functioning as expected.</p>
<p>Ive seen comments about this being phased release but that was over a year ago.</p>

<p>It should be rolled out to all tenants now. Well, if you are using Edu or Gov plans, it might be a different story.</p>
<p>You can check via PowerShell whether the setting is enabled for the shared mailbox, as detailed in the article. If it is, the other thing you need to check for is the reg key mentioned in this KB:

<p>I've checked the setting in powershell. The reg key does not exist on the computer.</p>
<p>This is the first time we've enabled this setting and would prefer not to have a reg key to enable it.</p>

<p>hi server adminashley rhodes,</p>
<p>i have also performed a test from my side and the feature worked smoothly from my side. therefore, i’d like to collect the following information to better understand the situation:<br />
1. as i understand, the function simply didn’t work after you ran the powershell, while you can run the cmdlet without any error message returned, right? if so, could you upload a screenshot of the powershell output of
<strong>get-mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** | fl messagecopyforsentasenabled</strong> for our further analysis? (replace *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with your shared mailbox’s email address)</p>

<br />
2. are you using pure exchange online service? if not, are you under a hybrid deployment? i’d like to make sure there are no differences between my test environment and yours.<br />
3. could you ask another user who can send from the shared mailbox test if it works so we can determine the issue is related to specific users or all of them?<br />
4. does the issue persist if another admin run the cmdlet for the shared mailbox?<br />
5. what if you enable the setting for another shared mailbox? will it work as expected?</p>
<p>we are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Server AdminAshley Rhodes,<br />
</span><br />
Since you are in a hybrid environment, I want to confirm some additional details:<br />
1. Is the shared mailbox created in the Cloud?<br />
2. Is your user account exist in on-premises or Office 365?</p>
<p>And please test using another shared mailbox when you have time. It can help us identify whether it's a tenant issue or the problem is related to this specific shared mailbox.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry</p>

<h2>            How to create Web Queries in Excel 2008.</h2>
                    I want to create a web query in Excel 2008 the will be compatible with 2004, 2008, 2011.&nbsp; Obvious the "Create New Web Query" that exists in the PC version is not there in 2004, 2008 (i have not used 2011 yet).<br />
<br />
I need to go to a spot price site for gold (www.goldprice.org) and bring the spot price of the gold at that point into the template that I developed.&nbsp; The instructions i did find are a little confusing and do not necessarily explain how to get the price from
 a site.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            OneNote UWP won&#39;t sync, and has Sync conflicts and won&#39;t let me resolve them</h2>
                    <p>Yeah, this is very problematic, as it is eating my notes.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3401ad5b-d56a-4003-9e5a-4bedd0d9e5eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3401ad5b-d56a-4003-9e5a-4bedd0d9e5eb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even worse, An entire page of notes evaporated in a sync conflict. These docs are not shared with anyone. Is there any way to make OneNote use local files so this doesn't happen? It would not let me resolve the conflict as I couldn't select anything on the
 conflicting page. I had to use ON2016 which I happened to have access to. I am scared now. I need my notes. Like very very much. They can't just randomly disappear on me. Should I stay away from OneNote for critical tasks?? I believe this is all related to
 the creators update.<br />
<br />
This notebook doesn't show up in ON online, how do I rescue it? I can't have ON eat it. Can I print it somehow? Send the notebook to ON 2016? Where is the file on my computer? I need to copy it and save it somewhere? Please if you write such buggy software,
 give us some work arounds to teh terrible syncing.</p>

<h2>            Migrate from Windows 10 Enterprise to Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    I thought I was a Windows 10 Pro Insider "beta tester" until on July 29th I was informed I had 90 days and then had to buy Windows 10 Enterprise. Can someone please tell me how to migrate from my present Windows 10 Enterprise over to Windows 10 Pro? The
 build number is Widows 10 Enterprise Build 10074. I am single user only. Thank you for your help and guidance.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for a detailed reply.</p>
<p>I have ALL my applications loaded PLUS many uddated drivers for my pc.</p>
<p>I am hoping there is a way to avoid a "clean install"</p>
<p>I always wanted Windows Insider Preview 10 Pro and somehow got "ENTERPRISE" 10 ???</p>
<p>Any way to avoid a "clean install" and update from "Enterprise 10" to "Windows 10 Pro"</p>
<p>I am not an Enterprise user. I have a very small business.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed my Insider experience!!! :-)</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is free for upgrade for genuine installs of Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1. You get to upgrade to distinct editions of Windows 10, based on the editions of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 you are running. If you are running Windows 7 Home for example,
 you will be upgraded to Windows 10 Home. If you are running Windows 8.1 Pro, you will be on Windows 10 Pro. If you want Windows 10 Enterprise or Education, you will have to buy
<br />
them before upgrading.</p>

    <title>How do I add a custom field to a visual report&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I add a custom field to a visual report&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My organization is using a custom text field (Text10) to specify the department associated with resources. I am trying to create a customized version of the Visual Report - Resource Work Availability Report so that I can filter the report by department.
 I tried to do this by the following:</p>
<p>Select Visual Reports -&gt; Create Report</p>
<p>Select Resource Work Availability Report -&gt; Edit Template</p>
<p>Select Text10 from the Available Custom Fields Box and click Add.</p>
<p>Text10 appears in the Selected Custom Fields Box.</p>
<p>Click Edit Template. </p>
<p>The Excel Pivot Tables comes up, but I can't find the Text10 field in the Pivot Table Field List or anywhere else.</p>
                </div>

            Alan,
<div>Pardon my jumping in.&nbsp;I thought Julie might have responded back but perhaps she is tied up this morning and I assume you would like an answer as soon as possible.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately the output format from Project's visual reports as pivot tables in Excel is not exactly intuitive. It took me a while to figure out what was going on but some research and help from some of Julie's other responses got me on-board.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In your Excel pivot table on row 4 (or thereabouts) you should see, Year, Quarter, Week and Resources. If resources does not appear in the table then you will need to add it from the Pivot Table field list on the right side of the screen by clicking the
 box next to the Resources field. Once Resources appear in the table, select any resource. Then right click to display the drop down menu. From that select "Show properties in Report" and finally select your custom field.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />

            Hello Alan,<br />
<br />
The custom field is not a field that is part of the Pivot table fields - so no automatic filtering as there is for Resources.&nbsp; You can convert the Pivot Table to Formulas and then be able to filter based upon Text10 -- but you'll lose the Pivot table capabilities.<br />

In previous versions of windows you could go to folder options -&gt; File Types and click the advanced button and find an option to Confirm open after download. I can not find this in Windows 7.</p>

&nbsp;<br />
<span>XLS , "Confirm open after download" is checked and browse in same window" is unchecked.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>If nothing work, I suggest that you reset the Internet Explorer settings. </span>

<h2>            Connecting a 301 to an e-mail account</h2>
                    
<p>I'm already losing the will to live with this so any help would be most grateful:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>bought a Nokia 301 for the purposes of receiving and sending e-mails, on PAYG was Orange, now EE network. Thought it would be a cheap, non chunky semi-smart phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connected it to the internet as per the EE guide -&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://ee.co.uk/help/phones-and-device/nokia/nokia-301/nokia-301-internet-and-applications/nokia-301---setting-up-internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ee.co.uk/help/phones-and-device/nokia/nokia-301/nokia-301-internet-and-applications/nokia-301---setting-up-internet</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then got my Roundcube e-mail provider to tell me that "The POP3 server address is mail3.gridhost.co.uk and the port is 995." &nbsp; All good so far. Used a guide on the internet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.base.be/en/mobile/mobile-internet/configure.html#/nokia/301-1/e-mail/usecase/manual-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.base.be/en/mobile/mobile-internet/configure.html#/nokia/301-1/e-mail/usecase/manual-configuration</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks a doddle, no probs at all. Found the outgoing SMTP settings for Orange as:&nbsp;smtp.orangehome.co.uk&nbsp;Port: 587&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But no matter what I do when I try to sign in a get a message saying "Communication error try again later!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have I just been fleeced for £50?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            N8 outgoing calls NOT ALLOWED</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem, not always but sometimes when I unlock keypad on my phone /Iam using a password lock/ and I try to make a call it says NOT ALLOWED. The incoming calls works without problem only the outgoing calls are NOT ALLOWED. After switching off and
 on its working. Any solutions about this? Thanks a lot-</p>

<p>Hi cryoy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you able to send and receive SMS messages with no problem? If so, could you also put your SIM into another phone just to check that it is not your SIM/operator dropping out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Report back here.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>same problem here. Sometimes (after unlock the phone) outgoing calls are not allowed. Simply on/off solve the problem. (go offline mode and go back to online (general profile) does not solve this. SIM card ok, replaced by service provider and works fine
 in another phones.</p>
