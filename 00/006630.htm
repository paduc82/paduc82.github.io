<h2>            Suggested improvement to Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I have a suggested improvement. Just as we can click and tag an email as "Junk", why not add the facility to tag as "scam".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would this do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, it would move it to a folder similar to "junk" where it would disable all the links to protect you. Why a separate folder - well as a lot of stuff ends in junk without being tagged, most people have to at least take a quick look through junk for
 the odd thing that might have slipped through. Ideally something you have clearly identified as a scam doesn't want to be in there. Why not just delete scams, I hear you ask?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I keep them - partly so I can show people what they look like, so they don't respond to them. Sometimes, you may want to keep them as information/evidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my main reason for not just deleting them is that they could be part of developing another layer of protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the action of marking it as a scam could also trigger actions to help protect. With the growing compute power, this saved scam could be used as a template and a background process compare new emails against it. (This whole train of thought is
 down to getting very similar scan emails in quick succession - ones imploring me to unblock my email, which of course isn't blocked or I would not have been able to receive the email...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But furthermore, the same trigger could send information back to the Exchange server that a particular email is a scam. Once a few people have marked it as a scam, a system can start to analyse them for what is common and what is different in order to build
 a template to match scams against. The all future emails flowing through the system can be tagged as "potential scam" and go straight into the user's "scam" folder, where they would be sandboxed until the user actively flagged them as safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus we would be using the collective intelligence of those of us who can spot the scams more easily to protect the community of email users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure there are details that would need to be worked out, such as mechanisms to prevent abuse e.g. by a group of users acting in concert to tag legitimate emails as "scams", and whether it should be only server side, or it could be client side or a combination
 of the two. There is a lot more to think about - for example, an option for just one user on a domain to flag an email as a scam to then ensure that all very similar copies are automatically flagged as potential scams and diverted into everyone's "scam" folder;
 this would allow someone such as an admin to immediately get it out of all their users' inboxes, as it is not uncommon for scams to be sent to every valid email address at a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read this and think it is a potentially interesting idea, then comment, and hopefully Microsoft may then think about it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes if you persist long enough, it is possible to help reduce the scammers. After several attempts over a period of time, I eventually got the some of the UK Government sites to stop putting links in their emails on the basis that everyone who had
 an account knew how to access it, and once people got to know that genuine emails didn't have links, they had one means of separating out the genuine notices from the scammers. So now when I get an email that says there is a tax notice waiting for me and there
 is no link in it, I am fairly sure it is genuine, and since I am going to log on without clicking a link in the email, I am far less exposed anyway.</p>

    <title>Word 2013 to PDF Conversation doubles file size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dzirkelb1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 to PDF Conversation doubles file size</h2>
                    <p>Our enterprise upgraded to Office 365 small business, and with that comes an upgrade from Office 2007 to 2013.&nbsp; Since the upgrade, whenever we convert a word doc to a pdf, it doubles the filesize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file before is&nbsp;a general newsletter created in word, about 350k in size.&nbsp; Normally, we would convert to pdf, making it around the same size (with word 2007), but now, when we do the same steps in 2013, it makes it over 700k.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We check the box to make it smaller (minimum size (publishing online), but beyond that, we don't do anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not looking for ways to make the word doc smaller, I'm looking for ways to make the converted pdf the same size as the word doc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this issue started with the upgrade from 2007 to 2013, it is NOT an adobe issue, it is a Word 2013 issue.&nbsp; I can replicate the exact same steps on the same computer using word 2007, and the pdf created is right around 350k.&nbsp; I do the same thing in
 2013, and the pdf created is over 700k.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere that word may include the source file in the conversion, which we don't want, but I can't find the option to remove anywhere.&nbsp; I'm not sure if that will solve the issue or not, but it is a start.</p>

            The problem is fixed by doing the following: <br />
- entering an enddate to all repeatitive appointments (in outlook)<br />
- running the statement (in c:\windows\system32\..) "regsvr32.exe ole32.dll" (after gaining Admin rights on the network)<br />
- downgrading PDA off Windows mobile 6.1 Professional to Windows&nbsp;Mobile 6 professional (Flash ROM)...<br />
<br />
Quite a search but in the end it works.<br />
<br />
Thanx 2 u all.<br />

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try rebuilding the indexing for Outlook 2010. Follow the steps mentioned in the link below to rebuild the search indexing:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-advanced-indexing-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-advanced-indexing-options</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also access this option from Outlook by going to File, Options, Search, Indexing Options and then click Advanced. Now click Rebuild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion provided is helpful. If you need further assistance, reply and I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>HI Aravinda,</p>
<p>Thanks for your info. But as I said in my problems MY Outlook does not have a tools button, drop down menus by right clicking on the search button, etc and it does not have a FILES button to click on like you said. For further information I assumed it was
 Outlook 2010 as I started with a LIVE email account and then after some time and for whatever reason Microsoft or Internet Explorer? automatically changed the account to Outlook. And this Outlook I have now has none of the features like the old Outlook I am
 used to having. When I open and use the Outlook I have&nbsp;now the only buttons along the&nbsp;Outlook ribbon on top of the Outlook page are New, Reply, Delete, Archive, Junk, Sweep, Move to and Categories!
</p>
<p>Therefore I do not have the buttons like you suggested, "File" for instance so needless to say I cannot apply them to fix my problem.</p>
<p>And that is also why I stated in my problem - How do I get the original toolbar for the Outlook I am currently using. I guess I should have said how do I reinstall the original version (which I just found out&nbsp;would be&nbsp;Outlook 2010) and have all my data,
 folders, emails addresses, etc. automatically installed in Outlook 2010 assuming I can have it reinstalled? And I assume then that that should cure my problem as well with the search feature. Right?</p>
<p>What type of version of Outlook or what type of Outlook am I using then now. Any idea?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help again.</p>
<p>Tom</p>

            <p>Hello Again,</p>
<p>After more researching I found out it is still a "Live" email account I believe even though it says "Outlook" on top of the page on the left hand side of the page ribbon. And also researched that if the search email stopped working then MS says you have
 over 5,000 emails and to delete some. I checked and do not have but only around 1,800 total. So that appears not the problem. So what could it be and what would you suggest?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Reference Network Drives PowerPoint Command Line</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I need some assistance with PowerPoint 2010, and I'd appreciate some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Main Goal</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My main goal has been to make a PPSX file that contains some sort of link in it that allows someone viewing the file to click on something within the show that opens a PPTX file in edit mode--<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not in full screen</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, the only way that I've been able to do this is by inserting some sort of object (like a shape) into a slide and then using&nbsp;<em>Insert--&gt;Links--&gt;Action--&gt;Run program</em>, which I then use to point to the PowerPoint EXE and invoke the command line--"C:\Program
 Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\POWERPNT.exe" /n " FilePath\file.pptx"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Invoking this command line while viewing the file does open a PPTX file in edit mode (not in full-screen mode) as I want it to, but it only seems to work when trying to open a local file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I need to be able to open a file on a network drive from that PowerPoint command line.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Question:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use the PowerPoint command line to open a file stored on a network drive?<br />
EXAMPLE:&nbsp;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\POWERPNT.exe" /n " NetworkDriveFilePath\file.pptx"</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:&nbsp;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\POWERPNT.exe" /n " S:\SharedDrive\SharedFolder\file.pptx"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do forward this question to someone on MSDN if you think that it should go there.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you tried without specifying "/n"? As far as I can remember /n is simply to create a new presentation with a template.</p>

            <p>I tried this as a test by assigning this as the Run Program action setting, and it worked as expected (ignore the linebreaks):</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\PowerPnt.exe" /n "q:\@support\Presentation1.pptx"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: is a drive letter that's mapped to a network drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>@support is a directory where I put files I'm doing support on; the @ isn't anything special, it's just part of the directory's name ... forces it to the top of a directory listing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice in all of your examples that there's a space prior to the path to the file you're trying to open. &nbsp;I wouldn't think that'd be a problem, and it wasn't when I tried it here, but you might start by removing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think I've granted any special trust settings to network files, but you might want to check your trust center settings for anything that might exclude files on networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any messages when you click the link?</p>

            <p>Thanks both for your answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the space that Steve mentioned, and I might have been using the wrong slashes in the command. I had been getting a spelling error message before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works from within PowerPoint and from within a Run dialogue now.</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I was wrong. I'm still having the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the spelling error message that I was and still am getting is related to which slashes I'm using in the command line.</p>
<p>The correct syntax seems to be:<br />
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;"S:\SharedDrive\SharedFolder\file.pptx"</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>The New Problem:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When I insert that command into the run program dialogue in PowerPoint, it works, but, when I save the presentation and reopen it, it no longer works. However, for some reason, when
 I reopen the file, PowerPoint changes the syntax of the command from that above to:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\POWERPNT.exe" /n " S:/SharedDrive/SharedFolder/file.pptx"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Notice that the slashes are now incorrect--from&nbsp;<strong>\</strong> to
<strong>/</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When PowerPoint does this is when I experience my issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>The New Question:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">How can I make this work/make PowerPoint stop changing the syntax?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks.</span></p>

                    <p>Hi, I have a school workbook that multiple users need edit access at the same time.</p>
<p>Its a .xls file and some teachers using excel 2016 and some using excel 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I just use edit/copy link I get the following message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0a3db27-4515-4bb3-be31-b9fc749d8bfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0a3db27-4515-4bb3-be31-b9fc749d8bfd" /></a></p>
<p>This results in the creation of several copies of excel workbook&nbsp;rather than one workbook which multiple users can edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I try the and open the other way (see below), its a .xls file and I have checked the box 'allow changes at the same time by more than one user'</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ada50d9f-1ba0-4d29-8575-9f6cd61a6cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ada50d9f-1ba0-4d29-8575-9f6cd61a6cab" /></a>Users
 cannot edit at the same time. A 'locked by another user xxxx' message appear</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this so that the file can be edited at the same time? Thanks, T</p>

<p>Hello Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about the issue opening the Settings on the MSN site. To better look into this, can you tell us which browser are you using to access MSN site? What is your phone's OS build? Go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>
More</strong> <strong>info</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can perform a <strong>soft</strong> <strong>reset</strong> to refresh your phone. This will
<strong>not</strong> <strong>remove</strong> any files on your phone and it is safe to perform. To do this, press and hold the
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> <strong>
button</strong> at the same time until the phone vibrates and restarts. The process might take a little while to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response.</p>

            Yes I appreciate that. According to the wireless icon on the login page I am connected.I did wonder if it had not fully restarted with a uk keyboard. Next build I &nbsp;will try out that theory

            I have now confirmed that the reason it failed is that it reboots aftera build upgrade with the English US keyboard. I input my details as if it was an US keyboard and it took it.

I don't know how fast does the camera application load on an N73. But try to close some running applications in the background when you're planning to use the main camera.<br />
<br />
Sorry but as I've read on many forums, the N73 is regarded as one of the slowest Nseries device to date. But performance and feature wise - good enough.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

    <title>LUMIA 830 - apps crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bjwallace  say:</h3>
<h2>            LUMIA 830 - apps crashing</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 830 with an extra 16GB micro-SD for memory. I have not installed the Windows 10 update - as there as been none available from my provider (TELUS, in Canada). Last summer, I&nbsp;had a complete crash and with Microsoft tech - managed to restart
 the phone and salvage contacts to a 'LIVE' account and re-install them.</p>
<p>All was well for a few months, but gradually apps began to crash. Text windows just crashed back to the main screen during normal typing of text. The Camera app became VERY unstable...sometimes the pictures would be saved and sometimes not. When I open the
 pictures to edit/resize/crop using the phone's own built-in app - the pictures often either disappear or do not save the changes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it will crash out of Explorer when online (using data)...</p>
<p>Each time it crashes back to the 'home screen'.</p>
<p>The last few weeks have been worse still. Sometimes the phone will NOT start. I have to press volume and power together and hold for the OS to boot. Sometimes I need to do this several times.</p>
<p>I do not leave my phone on all the time, so I need to start it several times per day.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of 'free' (ie: data-mining!) apps installed - basically, mostly the stock factory apps.</p>
<p>I REALLY want to like my Lumia 830. I bucked the trend and got it - over tons of I-phones and Android phone choices - because I love Windows Phones...The phone feels high quality (aluminum frame!!)</p>
<p>I have tried removing the battery, removing and reinserting the SIM card...all to no avail.</p>
<p>It 'feels/acts' like its running out of memory - although all pictures and data are saved to the SD card...</p>
<p>Are there 'apps' available from Microsoft to diagnose memory issues and other issues for Windows Phone?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide. I do NOT want to go back to an 'I-Phone'!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Let me respond to your points...</p>
<p>1. there are no pending downloads or updates on the few apps installed</p>
<p>2. there seem to be no 'errors' in downloads</p>
<p>3. I am still running Windows Phone 8.1 - as there has been no available patches or updates from my provider - Telus</p>
<p>4. checking for updates - there are none ("your phone is up-to-date")</p>
<p>5. I always keep my phone on the charger and on WiFi when updating or modifying...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the Lumia Camera native app is sometimes troublesome (it seems to crash back to the homescreen more often then not - and the side hardware button that is supposed to actuate the 'shutter' no longer works...So, I deleted it, and reinstalled it
 from the store. No difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More irritating is the phone crashing back to the 'home page' out of the texting window. I can get a few lines into a text then, the screen drops back to the home screen with the live tiles...through the stock 'animation'...It seems to be as if the phone
 is out of memory for the basic tasks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find no way of telling me how much memory is used up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a separate 'SD' card and the phone is set to put all photos and videos on that card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love the phone...it is well-made, the resolution although just 720 p is just fine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...would REALLY hate to have to give up on this...I know Microsoft is not actively developing Windows Phone anymore - so I guess I won't stay up late waiting for any updates!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really too bad - Windows Phone is a very nice OS...much nicer than the i-Phone operating system...and as for Android? Yuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any ideas...</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, outside of hooking up to 'the cloud', is there any way to dump all the contacts on the SIM onto my PC and then I could totally do a 'wipe' and restart the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, removing the SIM renders the phone useless and it won't let me wipe and re-install anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to do a total wipe and restart unless I can save my contacts. The pictures and videos are on the SD card, so that's not a problem...</p>

            <p>Hello dude iam not a microsoft agent, but did you get your phone to work properly?? I have too a lumia 830 just bought it on the begining of January, i was luckly to update the OS to 10 the phone reseted constantly without the update, it still has its downside
 performance has it should be expected the opposite from a lumia 635 i had before, i dont know if in some point n the elaboration of the device some hardware went wrong, but like you said i had no choice and was forced to buy the phone, till now it works good
 but nit as i expected, a main app like the facebook hangs often, the phone cant stand the page loadouts, if you mind could you tell me what happened to your phone? Would be terrific to&nbsp; see your answer</p>

<p>Hi Jenben2018,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you clarify if the Excel file that you are trying to edit is a shared file? If yes, may I know if you are the one who created the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried saving the Excel file locally on your hard drive and check if the issue persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you also provide a screenshot showing the issue? This would help us to know the best possible resolution to offer. Kindly make sure that there's no personal information visible on the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, issues with editing Excel files can be resolve by just closing the file, then opening it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm keeping an eye to your reply until we resolve this issue. Rest assured that I'll go back to this thread once I received your reply.</p>

<h2>            print 11x17 spreadsheet in excel</h2>
                    I have an old Tecra XP running excel 2003 with a spreadsheet saved as 11x17, no problem prints just fine as 11x17. &nbsp;When I import it into my newer acer running windows 8/office2010 the paper size comes up as "custom" (with the dreaded yellow!) I have gone
 into the printers-printer server and it does show 11x17 and tabloid paper sizes but once in excel these sizes do NOT appear in the paper size options in any of the places to choose said size???? Printer is a large format HP 7610. any suggestions on how to
 print 11x17?? call me crazy but why would we have 3x5 card options for speadsheets but NOT have tabloid????!!!!

            Might start with the HP website and make sure the Acer has the latest printer drivers for the HP 7610 installed on it.

<h2>            WMDC &#38; IR Connection</h2>
                    Hi I have upgraded to Winows 7 but am unable o connect my Mio PDA using WMDC through an Infrared link.<br />
<br />
The IR link is working as I can pass data back &amp; fort but TomTom &amp;&nbsp;Memory Map need to sync using Activesync on the PDA.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it does work but the connection is not stable, other times it reuses to see my PDA at all.<br />
<br />
Never had&nbsp;this problem with XP. Pocket PC 4.20

            The USB connector on the PDA is faulty. That is the reason I have to use IR.<br />
<br />
IR works with my Notebook which is runnung XP and worked fine on both the laptop &amp; desktop when XP was installed.<br />
<br />
Only since installing XP has the problem occured.<br />
<br />
The IR link is working no problems. It seems that WMDC does not like using IR. <br />
<br />
It does work 'to a point' on occasions but then the nexy time&nbsp;I attempt to connect it refuses point blank to work.<br />
<br />
TomTom Home is the&nbsp;one that causes the most problems as Memory Map can be made to work more easily but is still a 'hit &amp; miss' affair. Both MUST have Activesync connection so WMDC needs to connect when Activesync is started on the PDA.<br />
<br />
WMDC does not auto-open when connection is made. I also struggles with connecting to my Samsung phones.<br />
<br />
None of these problems were there with XP.&nbsp;

<h3> meterrilee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am getting nowhere with online help "options." I don't think there are any real people to contact. Hopefully, someone here can advise me. My Office 2016 Word, Excel, and Powerpoint were accidently removed from my Mac. I have a product key. I want to reinstall
 them. I clicked on the download button through my account and my download time keeps fluctuating between 12 and 14 hours! Is this for real? I saw something about downloading offline in one of the troubleshooting windows, but I cannot find anything to do this,
 if this is a better option. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The support process begins with a "virtual" helper who is of no help. When requesting a real person and after selecting from several drop down boxes regarding my issue, I am left waiting. "Call back" keeps changing from 2 minutes to 8 minutes wait time,
 with no obvious place for me to even provide my phone information; chat fluctuates between 0 and 5 people waiting. I have clicked on the options and nothing happens. I am blocked from writing in the chat text area. What the heck! How does one speak with a
 live person? Is this normal that the download on my 1.5 year old Macbook Pro should take 14 hours? I spoke with a certified apple rep who walked me through a computer check up today and there doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary with my Mac. Please
 help!</p>

                    I recently did a phone reset of my Microsoft Lumia 950XL.&nbsp; Since then, I have not been able to download and reinstall Microsoft Wallet, one of three apps the Microsoft Store sees I own, but, for whatever reason, can't send.&nbsp; The group of three apps all
 give a resulting error code 0x80240013.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; I've the same encryption-capable SIM card I had obtained when I first got the phone...so it should not be a hardware change issue.&nbsp; And yes, the phone runs on Windows 10 Mobile.

            I am in the U.S.&nbsp; Also, I attempted to select the link in your reply on the affected phone.&nbsp; Microsoft Store at first said it was installed, then it said I needed to download it.&nbsp; Then it flashed conflicting messages about "Downloading...", "Starting Download...",
 alternating a couple of times before ending with that error code.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for letting us know. We suggest that you perform a <strong>soft</strong>
<strong>reset</strong> to refresh your phone and then try downloading the app again. This will not remove any files on your phone. To do this, press and hold the
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> <strong>
button</strong> at the same time until the phone vibrates and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure also that the date and time settings are correct. You can refer to this link and try the troubleshooting steps if you
