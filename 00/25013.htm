<h2>            Want to upgrade my hard drive, how to migrate windows 10 to new drive with only one hd slot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Problem is my pc has only one ssd slot(m.2 type), it's used by the 32 gb m.2 ssd now, how do i transfer the windows 10 on it to the new ssd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thoughts was to do a full backup to a usb, swap the drives and install fresh windows on it, activate it with the old key, and restore the backup, will this work?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or ideas are welcome, thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community and being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about changing the hard drive on your device with all the backed up data from the system. We will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that your thoughts about installing the new hard drive should ideally work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to take a backup of the data. Once that is done, you will have to do a fresh installation of Windows&nbsp;10 on a new SSD. Once that is done, you will face activation issues as the device hardware is changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to do a phone activation. Once the copy is activated, you will have to restore the backed up data.</p>
<p><span>You may also activate your operating system using phone activation method:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Activation using Phone.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>

</p><p>Since you are using HP mini Desktop, it would be better if you get in touch with the HP support team for further assistance on this issue.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Template - Drops Graphics on Send - Other Formatting</h2>
                    <p>I have created an Outlook rule that will reply, to sender (when certain content is in subject line), with a specific outlook message template (.oft).&nbsp; This all works fine, EXCEPT...</p>
<p>
</p><p>... the .oft file has formatted text and a graphic pasted into the middle of the message.&nbsp; When the message arrives in the recipients mailbox, it appears the paragraph breaks that were in the original .oft file are no more, and the graphic image I have pasted
 does not get sent either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check the Sent folder, to see what the message looks like there, and it looks exactly the same as the recipient side message looks.&nbsp; In other words, when I send it, the formatting (bullets, etc) are lost as well as the graphic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this and why might be done?&nbsp; I cannot believe we can only create plain text templates???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            It sounds like the message I being sent as RTF format, and unless the recipient uses outlook, they'll get a winmail.dat file and a plain text message. (The formatting and any attachments are in the winmail.dat file.) Many virus and content scanners delete the winmail.dat file, some clients hide it so the recipient wont see it. 
<br />
<br />Open the send message - the format is in the title bar, after the subject.  Is it HTML or RTF?

<p>Both sender and receiver use Outlook in all cases. In other words all senders and receivers will be within my company using Outlook. It is unclear what happens when the message is sent to the Outlook 365 environment for forwarding. I have tried using RTF,
 HTML format message and the results are the same. </p>

</p><p>I send a message to this process mailbox myself, to test, so I get the response and that is where I'm seeing it. I assume others in my company who have the same email system will see the same.</p>

            I do not normally use RTF. I only tried it because I thought it might help solve the problem. I also generally use HTML, which is what I had originally started doing when this problem arose. As I mentioned earlier all senders and recipients use Outlook,
 the Outlook client, from Office 365.

            Open the sent message from the sent folder and look at the title bar - what is the message format?
<br />When is the message format the recipients receive? 
<br />
<br />If the message format is html and they get plain text, the problem could be with the autocomplete entry. Delete the autocomplete entry for your test account and try again. Does it work correctly now?

            Have you restarted outlook? Autoreply tends to only work on one address once per session. 
<br />
<br />I'll test the rule - offhand I don't recall if it only uses plain text or if it's something relating to RTF format.

    <title>How do you rename categories in Windows 10 Calendar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m.rush  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you rename categories in Windows 10 Calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2016 and had been using Outlook for my email/calendar/contact needs, but all of a sudden events I add in Outlook no longer show up on my iPhone calendar app.<br />
<br />
So I'm trying this Windows 10 calendar app but there doesn't seem to be a way to rename or add categories. Blue, green, red mean nothing. In Outlook 2010 I could rename categories to useful names like Work, Personal, Fitness, etc. (Still trying to figure out
 how to get it to work in Outlook 2016, but that's another issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My preference would be to figure out why Outlook 2016 suddenly stopped syncing events to my phone and go back to using it for my calendar, but barring that is there some trick to renaming the categories that I'm just not seeing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Windows 10 apps category in the community when searching topics, but it's not an option to chose to post a question so this is questions is now under Outlook 2016 since I'd rather use this calendar than that app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            This is with an Outlook.com/Microsoft Exchange account? Do events created on the phone sync to outlook? Do you have more than one calendar folder in your Outlook profile? 
<br />
<br />You can definitely rename categories in Outlook 2016, and in Outlook on the web (slide the Beta off) - these categories will sync to the Windows 10 calendar app when you use an exchange account (including outlook.com)

<p>Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the fast reply. I have more than one email that I check in Outlook 2016, but there is only one calendar. I don't use Outlook.com so I will login and set up the categories that way. Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what happened. One day when I added an event to the calendar it showed up on my phone and if I created the event on my phone it showed up on the Outlook 2016 and then I opened the calendar on my phone to find an appointment and it was gone.
 I have no idea what I did (if anything) to turn that off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Outlook 20016 calendar is my primary calendar on my phone so I'm not sure what happened.</p>

            As long as the calendar is in a Microsoft Exchange account, it will sync to the phone.  Do events you add in Outlook sync to Outlook on the web?

<p>Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2016 set up as IMAP and it used to sync just fine with the calendar on my phone. I'm not sure when it stopped working but I added a webinar in the calendar on my desktop and it's not on my phone and I added a hair appointment on my phone and
 it's not showing up in Outlook 2016 on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know when the syncing broke or what caused it. The only change I can see is the data file is now a .ost file instead of a .pst file, but I don't know what that would have to do with the calendar. I may wind up uninstalling Office 2016 and reinstalling
 from scratch to see if that fixes the issue.</p>

<br />I have Outlook 2016 set up as IMAP and it used to sync just fine with the calendar on my phone. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Calendars in IMAP (or POP) accounts will not sync to the phone unless you use a utility - icloud if you use iPhone. 
<br />
<br />By default, if the account supports imap, outlook's auto account setup will add it as imap. It's generally better if you use multiple devices as the mail is the same on all devices- but it is definitely email-only.  
<br />
<br />POP is download mail only - it also wont sync calendar &amp; contacts without a utility. 
<br />
<br />In either case, meetings may/should show up on the phone and in outlook as tentative but appointments you create will not sync.

<p>That's weird. I never had a problem with them syncing without a utility before I upgraded to Windows 10/Outlook 2016 and it was working with the upgrade until about a week ago. I had been using Windows 7/Outlook 2010 and there may be some "behind the scenes"
 changes in the new OS/software. I'm still working with getting familiar with the new setup.</p>
<p>

    <title>Duplicate emails in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate emails in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I am getting duplicate emails in my Outlook 2013 Inbox with Win 8. I have seen other posts on the same issue, but the person with the question has not answered questions by the Community or the Community answer did not provide information that was helpful
 to me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;four POP3 accounts setup in Outlook. Just one of them, the default account, gets every inbox message twice. They are from 2 to 15 minutes apart. None of the other accounts get duplicates, including one of the accounts on the same server as the default
 account. My anti-virus program covers the entire computer and all four email accounts so I do not believe anti-virus is the problem. All four accounts are set to leave a copy on the server and all do. Webmail for the account that gets dupes does not have dupes
 on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted the default account and set it up again. I have done this twice. The test email that Outlook sends upon setup comes in twice.

<p>&nbsp;Thanks for the prompt reply. I delete all messages on webmail every other day on the default account and every few days on the other 3 accounts and have done so for years with previous versions of OL. I doubt there is a corrupt message there. I read the
 article about working offline, but I do not see what you are trying to accomplish. If you still feel that might help, please elaborate on your answer. Thanks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the prompt reply. I tried your suggestion for running OL in safe mode. I still got dupes on the default account so I switched back to normal mode, rebooted, and restarted OL.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed the setting for auto send / receive from 3 minutes to 10 minutes, rebooted, and restarted OL,&nbsp;and I am still getting dupes for the default account. I have no rules set up at all, and send / receive is the same for all accounts. Also, I do not have
 any accounts set for a separate send / receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you can come up with other suggestions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

 all four are POPs, two of the four (the default and one other) are with the same ISP on the same server, and only one account of the four is getting dupes, the default account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, I deleted the default account again and set it up for the third time hoping a miracle would happen. Still getting dupes. I unchecked the "save a copy on the server" for a while, rebooted, restarted Outlook, and still got dupes. I do not get dupes
 from any of my email accounts on my smart phone, just the one default account in OL. Today, I intend to set another account as the default acct and see if that starts duping.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am convinced this is an Outlook issue. I want to continue using Outlook for all 4 accts vs using Outlook for 3 and Win Mail app for the default. I already have web mail for all 4 accts so I am reluctant to create Win Mail app as another web mail. Someone
 with Win 8, OL 2013, and multiple email accts must have solved this problem. Thank you for continuing to try things to help me.</p>

            I agree that this must be a problem caused by Microsoft's attempts to force users to use the default Outlook app included in Windows 8&nbsp;which isn't&nbsp;the same as Outlook 2013.&nbsp; The mail app in Win 8 is difficult to use if you use&nbsp;a default POP3 account.&nbsp;
 I had to download the old Windows Live Mail so my wife could&nbsp;bypass the crappy&nbsp;MS default mail app.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried every solution to include contacting my internet provider.&nbsp; They can't find anything that causes this on&nbsp;their servers.&nbsp;

            <p>I believe you are correct. Of my 4 email accts setup in Outlook 2013,&nbsp;2 of them are with the same&nbsp;ISP on the same server. I get duplicate messages on one of the&nbsp;accts, the default, and no dupes on the second acct with that ISP. I also do not get dupes on
 the other two accts that are with different ISPs.&nbsp;It sure looks like the ISPs are&nbsp;not the problem.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since my last post, I upgraded from Win 8 to Win 8.1. Still getting dupes on the default email account in Outlook 2013. I hope someone out there can help.</p>

                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have one column with some measurement such as</div>
<div>(This is the format in which i write)</div>
<div>3'-6" x 12'-0"</div>
<div>1'-0" x 2'-8"</div>
<div>15'-6" x 0'-8"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&amp; in the second column i want the result of it. (Answers are in bold)</div>
<div><b>42</b></div>
<div><b>2.66&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>10.23</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I always do it manually by entering the formula as</div>
<div>=3.5*12</div>
<div>=1*2.66</div>
<div>=15.5*0.66</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But some times i make a mistake in entering a value so i get wrong result. So i want to make it automatic. So please tell me how can i do it.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure I agree with your answers. 15" 6" * 0'8" only comes out at 10.23 if we truncate the decimal value for 8" at 0.66.</p>
<p>The correct decimal for 8" is 0.66666667 and this when multipled gives 10.33 and not the answer you seem to want. However, truncated to 2 decimals of precision this seems to work for your posted examples</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=TRUNC((LEFT(A1,FIND("'",A1)-1))+(ABS(MID(A1,FIND("-",A1)+1,FIND("-",A1)+1-FIND("'",A1)-1))/12),2)*TRUNC((MID(A1,FIND("x",A1)+2,FIND("'",A1,FIND("'",A1)+1)-(FIND("x",A1)+2))+SUBSTITUTE(MID(A1,FIND("-",A1,FIND("-",A1)+1)+1,LEN(A1)),"""","")/12),2)</p>

            The oval button settings are stored in a preference file, but the button is no longer part of Lion's interface. If you somehow imported older preferences, this would still be honored by Word (pre-Lion), even though there's no button.
<div><br />
<div>Users can bring it back by hiding the toolbar and showing it again through the View menu, but the next time Word launches the same thing happens, unless you change that no-longer-accessible-through-the-oval-button setting.
<div><br />
<div>So back to your problem. Start with a standard procedure to bypass your Word settings and Normal template:</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Quit Word</li><li>Hold&nbsp;<i>Shift</i></li><li>Launch Word</li><li>Release <i>Shift</i>&nbsp;when Word stabilizes</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>If this solves your problem, bear in mind that's it's not a permanent fix, so post back or stick a piece of gum on the Shift key.</div>

    <title>Insert in word data taken by Excel dynamic interval - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Insert in word data taken by Excel dynamic interval</h2>
                    <p>Hi to all,<br />
<br />
in a Word document I should insert data taken from dynamic intervals Excel (data can be graphs, pivot tables or cell ranges), as the intervals to be taken are not known, I thought in Excel to assign a name to the cells interval so that in word I don't recall
 the cell range but the name assigned to that range.<br />
<br />
The word result should be something like this:<br />
<br />
Chapter 1<br />
<br />
bla bla bla<br />
[insert chart 1]<br />
<br />
<br />
Chapter 2<br />
<br />
bla bla bla<br />
[insert pivot table 1]<br />
<br />
<br />
Chapter 3<br />
<br />
bla bla bla<br />
[insert range with name X]<br />
<br />
How can it be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>1. To insert a link to an Excel objects or range of cells in Word,</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. In Excel select the range or the object (e.g. the chart/pivtochart etc.) and copy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. in Word, in the Home tab of the Ribbon, click the dropdown arrow at the bottom of the Paste icon (at the left hand end), click Paste Special..., then select the Paste Link option and choose the format you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top format will be an"Excel object" of some kind and that should be as good as anything if you selected a chart. If you selected a range of values, that will work as well, but if the data needs to span more than one page in Word you will need to choose
 one of the other formats, e.g. HTML.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do this, Word inserts a LINK field. You can use Alt-F9 to toggle between "field results" view, where you should see the chart or data, and "field code" view, where you will see something more like this:<br />
<br />
{ LINK Excel.Sheet.12 "D:\\test\\2018011202 links to excel objects\\Book1.xlsx" "Sheet2!R3C1:R7C2" \a \p }<br />
<br />
The { } are special "field code brace" characters - you cannot type them on the keyboard, but you can enter them using ctrl-F9 in the Windows desktop version of word. As it stands, the field should autoupdate when you change the data in that range (that's what
 the \a is there for. However, you can update the result manually by selecting th field and clicking F9.<br />
</p>
<p>Now suppose you define a Range name called "myrange" in Excel that refers to Sheet2, cells R3C1 to R7C2 (e.g. by selecting the range and using the Excel -&gt;Formulas-&gt;Define name dialog)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In word, you can manually replace the range reference by the name, so you have</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ LINK Excel.Sheet.12 "D:\\test\\2018011202 links to excel objects\\Book1.xlsx" "Sheet2!myrange" \a \p }</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then update the field and you should see the same result. (In fact, if the range name is already there when you copy the data from Excel, Word/Excel
<em>may</em> use the range name in the LINK field in the first place).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think you can assign a range name to a chart, but you can rename the chart. As as example of a linked chart I have<br />
<br />
{&nbsp;&nbsp;LINK Excel.Sheet.12 "D:\\test\\2018011202 links to excel objects\\Book1.xlsx" "Sheet2![Book1.xlsx]Sheet2 mypivotchart1" \a \p }<br />
<br />
(You might think that "Sheet2 mypivotchart1" or some other variation would be enough, but apparently not).<br />
<br />
Just be aware that </p>
<p>&nbsp;a. If you move your Excel file to some other folder, these links will probably break. You can use VBA to fix them up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. Word sometimes modifies the code in LINK fields without asking. In particular, if you try to generalise things using nested fields, Word will at some point overwrite your fields with what it thinks ought to be in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using static range names in Excel is one way to avoid hardcoding a range address such as R1C1:R13C3, but you obviously have to ensure that the range always points to the correct data, e.g. includes new rows you add at the end.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know (although it isn't something I have used) it is also possible to use a dynamic range name to specify a variable-sized area to a certain extent, e.g. if you want the first three columns of Sheet1 and you know the data will not extend below
 row 300, you can define a name, say "mydynamicdata" in Excel as</p>
<p>
</p><p>=OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$1,0,0,COUNTA(Sheet1!$A$1:$A$200),3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>and use</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sheet1!mydynamicdata"</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the LINK field. But Word will not work with all types of range name. As far as I can remember, it will only work with names that specify a range of cells, rather than (for example) a constant value. Further, Word needs the sheet name in the LINK field,
 even though it is part of the definition of the range in Excel,</p>

            Hello Jeff,<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are getting the "subscription expired" error, you'll need to renew your subscription. Otherwise, your Office will eventually run in reduced functionality mode, which means you’ll no longer be able to edit documents, or create new ones. You may refer
 to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/A-subscription-notice-appears-when-I-open-an-Office-365-application-4CABE32C-F594-4C0E-9191-3D3ADE10CCEB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            We appreciate your response. The only way to get rid of the pop up and continue using Office is to proceed with the subscription. If you are no longer going to use Office, you can uninstall it by following the steps on
 reduced functionality, we advise that you contact <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

    <title>Using SUMIF to populate a cell with text&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malkani17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using SUMIF to populate a cell with text&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is sort of a follow-up to earlier question of mine. I had asked about populating a row of different values depending on the selection from a list. I have the list of values on B2 on a sheet called Lists. The list is comprised of values from B4 to B13
 on a sheet called Data. Given a selection from the list, I want the corresponding text to appear in a cell (which are located on Data from G4 to G13).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used SUMIF to do this for numerical values but what do I do to return text values? Does this require vba?</p>

    <title>Moving specific messages to another folder in VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrian jones, ncpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving specific messages to another folder in VBA</h2>
                    
<p>I am attempting to write some code to move specific messages from one folder to another in Outlook, but having a few problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full description is a little complicated, but a simplified version would be: if the email has an attachment, move it, if not, leave it where it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first tried using something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for each objSourceItem in objSourceFolder</p>
<p>if objSourceItem.Attachments.count &gt; 0 then</p>
<p>objSourceItem.Move objSaveFolder</p>
<p>endif</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after the message is moved, the selection is changed to the next item and then as the loop continues, it move onto the next (meaning that half the messages are skipped).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set objSourceItem = objSourceFolder.GetExplorer.Selection.Item(1)<br />
While Not (objSourceItem Is Nothing)</p>
<p>if objSourceItem.Attachments.count &gt; 0 then</p>
<p>objSourceItem.Move objSaveFolder</p>
<p>Set objSourceItem = objSourceFolder.GetExplorer.Selection.Item(1)</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>objSourceItem = objSourceFolder.Items.GetNext</p>
<p>endif</p>
<p>wend</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that runs for one loops, and then falls over at "if objSourceItem.Attachments.count &gt; 0 then" with</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run-time error '-1594621681 (a0f4010f)":<br />
The operation failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the objects in objSourceItem have this message, but the subject and time are those of the previous, moved message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I inspect objsourcefolder.GetExplorer.Selection.Item(1) then that looks fine, it's the object that should have been referenced by objSourceItem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I step through the code in the debugger, there isn't a problem, leading me to think that there is an issue with the timing of the .Move method and setting objSourceItem to the new selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should note that I've not even got as far as reaching a message with no attachments yet. That fun is yet to come. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a method of achieving this, before I go back to my first attempt and just re-running the code over and over until they've all been moved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adrian</p>

<p>Never try to move or delete items from within a For Each loop. Instead, use a down-counting For loop. Assuming that objSourceFolder is a folder object:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;intCount = objSourceFolder.Items.Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For i = intCount to 1 Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Set&nbsp;objSourceItem = objSourceFolder.Items(i)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If objSourceItem.Attachments.count &gt; 0 then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;objSourceItem.Move objSaveFolder<br />

<h2>            New email account setup in limbo</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up a new email account for an organization.&nbsp; It demanded a birthday, so I just threw in a date.&nbsp; It's an organization, IT HAS NO BIRTHDAY.&nbsp; Now it wants "parental permission."&nbsp; I am not the parent.&nbsp; I am only the guy trying desperately
 to create a new account for an organization.&nbsp; I have entered an address and password only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to go back and change the "birthday."&nbsp; Could not be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to start over with the setup, "address already exists."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to load it into Outlook-365.&nbsp; "Account could not be accessed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also trying to keep the new account independent of my accounts, but it also seems to be trying to make it another one of mine.&nbsp; How do I avoid this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do now?&nbsp; How can this be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the address so I can set up a Blogger website for the organization, and again, I want it independent of me.</p>

<p>Hi RxDave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating an account have regulations that need to be met regardless if it's an organization or personal account. It requires accurate personal information such as age.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you go through the verification process which will require you to submit a proof of age. Please take time to review this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4090292/microsoft-account-age-verification-for-parental-consent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>about Age verification for parental consent and proceed with submitting the required documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once our dedicated Microsoft Support team received and reviewed your submission, they will get in touch with you via email for any updates.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Age verification is not the issue.&nbsp; As I explained, the age is entered wrong.&nbsp; Now I can't start over, I can't get into the account, and I can't find a way to go back and fix the date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to go back and fix the birth date.&nbsp; I am 73 years old, by the way, and I don't have much patience for nonsense anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a fatal flaw in your email setup process.&nbsp; The address becomes cast in stone before the setup process is complete.&nbsp; This is the problem that can happen with that flaw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I discovered the birth date in my personal account is also wrong.&nbsp; That happened on your end, not mine.&nbsp; I know this because years ago I had a Windows Live Spaces account with this address and I would get birthday greetings on the correct date.&nbsp;
 Now the month and day numbers have been reversed, i.e., what should be January 3 (01-03) is now shown as March 1 (03-01).&nbsp; When I tried to fix it, I started getting sucked into a vortex of getting codes to prove I am me, etc.&nbsp; Since I was already on my last
 nerve, and the problem actually happened on your end, I decided to just leave it wrong. You must have thousands of wrong birth dates like this on your email accounts.<br />

    <title>Slide orientation problem in Powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oflint  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slide orientation problem in Powerpoint</h2>
                    I am using Office 365. I have a blank slide open in Powerpoint and wish to change the orientation from landscape to portrait. There are two icons in the Layout section of the ribbon. One is labeled portrait, the other landscape. Both icons are gray and
 inactive. In previous versions of Powerpoint changing slide orientation was a simple selection in the layout menu. In the 365 version I have been frustrated by this simple task. In the end I went into the slide master, slected slide size and was able to change
 the orientation that way. This is completely insane. Does anyone know why this is or what fixes are available?

            <p>I'm not sure exactly what you're seeing. &nbsp;In Office 365 here, there's a Layout dropdown on the Slides group of the Home tab but there's now Layout section as such, and the choices under the Layout dropdown are various layouts, no Portrait/Layout options.
 &nbsp;I wonder if you have an add-in loaded that has added these options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, no need to go to the Master. &nbsp;Just choose Design | Slide Size | Custom Size to get the same Slide Size dialog box we've had since approximately forever. &nbsp;There you can choose Portrait or Landscape.</p>

            Thanks. That is essentially what I worked out with the slide Master but less steps. However it is curious, don't you think, that the options to include a Portrait and a Landscape icon in the ribbon are in the "Customize ribbon" utility. What are they there
 for if they don't have any function and don't&nbsp;work?

            <p>Ah. &nbsp; You added the buttons from the Customize Ribbon menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that somebody got handed a list of all the buttons and controls in PPT and was told to add the appropriate ones to the Customize Ribbon dialog. &nbsp;And missed the fact that Portrait and Landscape aren't appropriate ... I'm guessing they only work
 when the slide size dialog box is open.</p>

            <p>What is happening is in the Office 2010 I was able to print the slide in landscape on letter paper, orientation = portrait. Now there is no way to print this way. This was on the print screen, not the design screen. Every time I click portrait orientation
 on the print screen, it switches to landscape. I don't want the big printouts of landscaped slides to fill the paper. I want landscaped slides on portrait pap;er as in Office 2010 on the print screen. When &nbsp;I go to change the print screen to portrait, all
 my backgrounds are squished into portrait paper AND portrait slides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition, when I convert to PDFs I can put two slides on one piece of portrait paper, each slide with orientation = landscape. Please fix this. I thought it was my printer driver, but apparently the problem is with Office.</p>

            <p>Me too. &nbsp;I agree 100% with oflint. &nbsp;I could not find this orientation switch either. &nbsp;The fact that it is now "inactive" in places frustrates me at no end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thank you for responding to question. Yes, I now know about and go to Design grouping and flip accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I like the other versions better -- and no, I do not have problem with change. But maybe unnecessary ones, yes! &nbsp;What is wrong with older version layout. &nbsp;Seemed a little more user-friendly and intuitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really have my doubts about this 365 version. &nbsp;Really questioning if I am going to stay with this.<br />

            <p>It is possible to get vertical (portrait) slides in office 365 also.</p>
<p>first go to design</p>
<p>then go to extreme right on the top</p>
<p>select the last but one, that is slide slide size.</p>
<p>Again in that you select "Custom Slide Size"</p>
<p>Here you have the options to select the slide size and orientation.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

            Hello ModelliaNHeRo,<br />
<br />
In order to install the app, simply search for the app in question in the Marketplace on your Phone.
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/whatsapp/218a0ebb-1585-4c7e-a9ec-054cf4569a79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here is the Marketplace link as well.<br />
</a><br />
If you are unable to locate the app, then it is entirely possible that the app isn't available in the region in which you reside.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Geoffrey_A</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Microsoft Outlook email client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have been into Outlook on my old computer and her emails download as usual as mine do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. All emails are not coming through on her account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I sent a test email and it didn't come through on my new computer in Outlook 2013, but did appear on my old computer in her inbox. When Outlook on new computer checks for email it shows a green tick that it's checked but nothing appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I have supplied the information you require and you may have some further advice on how to solve this issue.</p>

            Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the additional information. Have you tried removing the account then adding it back? It's possible that the issue is caused by an incorrect setting when you configured your wife's account to Microsoft Office. If removing/re-adding the account
 did not help, please provide us the affected email account. I've sent you a private message where you can provide the requested information. You have to sign in to Microsoft Community to be able to view the private message area.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We're looking forward to your reply.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rhyan

            <p>I was receiving gmail emails into outlook until recently. Upon reconfiguring in Outlook as an IMAP account, its asking for a TLS command...this office/outlook program is older and doesn't have the TLS box to be checked in outgoing server!</p>
<p>How else can I find a way to insert TLS? Its not recognizing the email address for gmail, either. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi robin rodriguez,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Please be guided that using IMAP could only be done on mail application and not in the web based Outlook.com. However, in order to receive emails from your Gmail account, you can simply add it as a send-and-receive.
 To accomplish this, please refer to the </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Sign&nbsp;in&nbsp;to&nbsp;Outlook.com&nbsp;with&nbsp;your&nbsp;primary&nbsp;account.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;the&nbsp;Options&nbsp;icon&nbsp;Options&nbsp;icon,&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;click&nbsp;Options.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;Your&nbsp;email&nbsp;accounts.<br />
</span><span>4.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;Add&nbsp;a&nbsp;send-and-receive account, enter the email address and password of your secondary account, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;Look&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;verification&nbsp;email&nbsp;that&nbsp;was&nbsp;forwarded&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;secondary&nbsp;account.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;the&nbsp;link&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;email&nbsp;to&nbsp;verify&nbsp;that&nbsp;you&nbsp;own&nbsp;the&nbsp;account.<br />
*&nbsp;If&nbsp;you&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;set&nbsp;up&nbsp;auto-forwarding&nbsp;yet,&nbsp;the&nbsp;verification&nbsp;email&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;secondary&nbsp;account.</span></p>

<h2>            I am getting duplicate emails in sent folder in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello to everyone,</p>
<p>I use Outlook email on Apple mail, on iPhone 5 and on iPad Air 2.</p>
<p>I see duplicate mails in my sent folder. When I sent it, I see it double.</p>
<p>This happening all the time on Apple mail and 60 % of the times at the site of Outlook.com.</p>
<p>Is there a way to re-add my Outlook accounts or to restore at their factory settings or something else ?</p>
<p>

<p>The outlook.com server will save a copy of sent messages.</p>
<p>When Apple mail also saves a copy, you end up with duplicates.</p>

    <title>Authentication problems for Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tired_boy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Authentication problems for Office 2010</h2>
                    I have had this laptop for 16 months now and it came with Microsoft Word and Excel Starter 2010 already on the system. This morning i clicked on an Excel file on the desktop and it said i dont have the program to open this and took me to a screen that
 gave me 3 options - 1/ To activate office 2010 because i have purchased it already 2/ To purchase it and 3/ To try a trial version. Also the files are now a blank-looking bright orange symbol. I tried entering the authentication code that is on the sticker
 underneath the laptop and it says that it is not valid.&nbsp;
<div>However, if i click on Start and open MS Excel Starter 2010 and go to open i can open and amend any file. Say i saved that to the desktop though and double clicked it, it comes up with those 3 options again. However, again, i can access it through 'open'
 in Excel</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since having this issue i have installed updates that were waiting and i have done a system restore to yesterday - both changing nothing</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea how i can get this back to normal?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Help please with MCC4 car phone kit</h2>
                    I have just bought a 2 year old car with a nokia MCC4 car kit, it does not fit my existing phone which is a 5210, can anyone please advise on which phone will fit the kit and whether I should or can upgrade the kit without ripping out the trim of my nice
 new Jag.I have tried a Nokia 1100 and this fits but this is a very basic phone and I am not sure if I can still get one. Thanks

            OK your car kit is a cark-128 which is compatable with Nokia 3310 &amp; 3330 phones. Your Nokia 5210 is not car kit compatable so you will have to either buy an old 3310 phone or upgrade your phone &amp; kit to a full new system. You can still buy the nokia 1100
 which is now 1101, but its not going to sit &amp; work properly in your existing kit.<br />
Any profesional car kit installer will be able to take out you old kit &amp; refit a new one without damaging you lovely new Jag.<br />
<br />
Good luck &amp; hope this helps.<br />
<br />

    <title>Issues w&#47;grouping selections in excel pivot tables. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues w&#47;grouping selections in excel pivot tables.</h2>
                    
<p>So I have a set of data, which shows all transportation costs for loads both inbound &amp; outbound.&nbsp; From this data I typically create 3 pivot tables (on separate tabs).&nbsp; One shows only outbound, another shows inboutnd, and the third I show inbound freight
 arriving via a certain transportation mode (in this case common carrier only).&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this 3rd report, I typically group the originating locations by US and by Mexico loads.&nbsp; The problem lately, has been that when I do this grouping, excel activates that grouping for all 3 pivot tables.&nbsp; Reallly weird - I've made sure that I'm not simply,
 copying &amp; redoing the same table already, so I'm sure that I'm creating a new table each time.&nbsp; Didn't used to have this problem, up until a couple of weeks ago...</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This happens because all PT are using the same pivot cache.&nbsp; When creating the second pivot, you would have got&nbsp;a message asking
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Whether you would like to base the pivot on the pivot cache of the previous one.&nbsp; Using the same pivot cache will save space" - you would have selected Yes to that question.&nbsp; Select No and then see whether the Grouping applies only
 to the current pivot or not.</div>
