<h2>            Is there a way to check the time since last charge on the original Surface Pro&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to figure out what kind of battery life I'm getting on my Surface Pro. I'd like to know how long it's lasting since the last full charge as well as what is using up the power. If you have an Android phone, if you look at the battery information,
 that is the kinda info I am looking for. If Window doesn't do that natively, can anyone recommend a good app? Thank you for your help.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the article for steps on how to start your computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you not to disable the programs which are related to Webcam while disabling third party services or startup items.</span><span><br />
<b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under ‚ÄúReset the computer to start as usual‚Äù.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to uninstall the camera drivers and try to install once again.</span></p>
<p><span>To uninstall drivers from the device manager follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Start.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type ‚ÄúDevice Manager‚Äù in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the device you wish to uninstall in the Device Manager window and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can also uninstall by right clicking on the device and selecting
<b><span>Uninstall</span></b> from the context menu. A dialog box will open asking you if you really wish to uninstall the driver. Click on
<b>Yes</b>, and then <b>OK</b> in the next window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also uninstall the webcam software from
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
add or remove programs</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Install the webcam drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>

            <p>This may not be much help but Acer drivers and "Orbicam" applications are a nightmare... I have an Acer Aspire 9301 and it was a struggle to get the camera to work correctly with Vista (Originally had X.P.).
</p>
<p>Acer support were useless and only interested in selling recovery discs. The drivers and apps they said would work did not.&nbsp;Mine was&nbsp;Bison cam but they said try Suyin drivers... it was all whinged about at the time by many many others with the same problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&nbsp;almost certainly is just a case of finding a driver and application that will work for your PC. Ones not recommended or listed for my camera in the end worked faultlessly so having found what was good I then&nbsp;did a clean Vista install and used those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has your camera worked in the past ? or is there some history to all this.</p>

            My camera has worked before. I have had this issue come forth before, but not until now did it decide to act up again. The "Camera not found" I had removed the pics from the photo folder and that fixed it. Now it's not working at all. I will try to find
 a working webcam application. Thanks.&nbsp;

            <p>I looked back on mine and there are two applications needed. A driver and application. It was four years ago lol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me it was orbicam V1.0.0-19 and Orbicam V9-96-0-15 one of which was listed under "empowering technology and utiliities" on Acer site. One is a driver and one is an application that allows the webcam to open and be used to take stills or "movies"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then had to hunt for program in "all programs" on PC to open and put shortcuts to them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play Forza Horizon 3 Offline</h2>
                    Everywhere I look online, including the information in the Microsoft store says you can play this game offline, but whenever I try it either closes immediately or says I need&nbsp;to be online to open it. I have already followed the guide on setting up a device
 to be able to play offline, and I have the settings in my online Microsoft account and the Microsoft Store set correctly. Is there something new that is&nbsp;required to be able to play offline, or was this feature falsely advertised?

 you to play the game offline. To set your Windows 10 in Offline mode, you may refer to this

            I appreciate your reply. May I know if you checked your computer if it's updated before setting it to Offline mode? It is important to keep your Windows 10 updated to make sure that your games will be available to play offline. Also, may I know if other
 games on your computer don't allow you to play Offline mode as well?<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having a headache of a time trying to fix a simple but annoying issue. put simply my mouse and keyboard keep disconnecting randomly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
not i asked on my usual forum for some help, <a href="https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/591892-peripherals-disconnecting-bios-update-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here is the link to that</a>. i got some advice there. i then asked Asus for some help and got 2 replys from 2 people giving different advice. &nbsp;again some of said advice is in the link above. im still waiting on a reply to the other.<br />
<br />
some advice says i can update my bios on my Asus p8z68-v motherboard while on windows 10 no problem. other bits say i cant. (im assuming a bios update will fix my issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>another bit of advice says i need to downgrade back to windows 7, do my updates and then go back to win10. makes sense? but! i cant! the Microsoft page where i go to get the iso for windows 7 no longer accepts my key as a windows 7 key. there for wont let
 me download the windows7 iso file. i can no longer use the option on my pc to downgrade back to win7 for some reason, its just not there anymore.<br />
<br />
now i could just try to install the bios update while on windows 10? but i have no idea if that will course problems or even break the board?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
ive been trying to get this sorted for over a month now and everyone i talk to is giving me different conflicting answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so now im here hoping someone can give me the correct course of action.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
many thanks.</p>

            Since you are on Windows 10, you must be having Windows 10 default Skype client which is v12. Can you try to use that? If you type Skype in Cortana search bar, you will see Trusted Microsoft Store app written under Onedrive. This is v12 client.
<br />
<br />If you don't have v12 client, just go to Microsoft Store and download from there.

<h2>            Can&#39;t upgrade Windows Live Mail 2009</h2>
                    I am running Windows 8 Pro x64 with Live Mail 2009. If I try to upgrade Live Mail to 2011, the installer spontaneously aborts without any errors less than 1 second after I start it. If I try to upgrade to Live Mail 2012, the installer spontaneously aborts
 at 18% with no errors. How do I upgrade it?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and giving us opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are facing issues with Roxio Media Manager program and receiving error saying ‚ÄúError 1706 Valid source could not be found for product
 ERROR: unable to read certificate file, the windows installer cannot continue‚Äù</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Was the Roxio program installed successfully?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs follow these methods to fix the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>I would suggest you to follow steps from the article mentioned below and check:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot problems when you install or uninstall programs on a Windows-based computer</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may configure the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and
 helps to eliminate software conflicts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to the link:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persist you may continue with step 2 from the above link.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Make sure you reset the computer to normal mode after the troubleshooting completes. Refer to the section ‚ÄúSteps to configure Windows to
 use a Normal startup state‚Äù</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

            I don't believe you can install 64-bit operating systems in a Virtual Machine, even if the&nbsp;host itself is 64-bit.&nbsp; The guest must be x86.<br />
<br />
Support for 64-bit host operating systems
<div>
<p>This release of Virtual&nbsp;PC&nbsp;2007 supports 64-bit host operating systems. However, there is no support for 64-bit guest operating systems.<br />

<br />
You may find that non-Microsoft Virtual Machines are more cooperative, but I have no experience with VMware myself, so I can't advise you much on that.<br />

<h2>            Surface says &#34;you&#39;re not connected&#34; but it will not display Wifi choices</h2>
                    <p>I am so unhappy with this machine I put it aside for a month after purchase</p>
<p>rying again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It says "No networks" available.&nbsp; There are. I am writing this from a computer sitting beside the Surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;the 'help' might as well be in Greek.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Network Cables are plugged in?&nbsp; Presume they are or Wifi on computer would not work.
</p>
<p>Airplane mode?&nbsp; Found it.&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Wireless switch turned on - HOW WOULD I KNOW?&nbsp; your help says "there is no physical switch" so how do I turn it on?&nbsp; Imagine it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;connect to mobile broadband?&nbsp; what does that even mean?&nbsp; isn't that what I am trying to do in trying to connect to a network?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;restart your router?&nbsp; What on earth does that mean? </p>

            <p>thanks for trying to rescue me! </p>
<p>the supplying company set it up and it keeps running (ie, to my other computers which are working and getting WiFi)</p>
<p>The Surface suddenly decided it could after all 'see' a wireless source.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So far I am running 100% - after 4 hours I am unable to do 100% of the things I've tried.

<p>Nice that you answered.&nbsp; </p>

            Seems like method 1 solved my problem. &nbsp;Normally I would get this message several times a day. &nbsp;It has been over 3 hours since I applied method 1, and the error has not popped up again. &nbsp;Thanks much.

    <title>Driver Verifier Detected Violation Blue Screen Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Driver Verifier Detected Violation Blue Screen Windows 8.1 &#42;&#42;HELP&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently formatted my computer due to a number of issues with slow performances and adwares, which is why I've decided that restoring it to factory state would be an easier solution. Since then, I have had two blue screens of death (have attached
 minidump files for your reference) on consecutive days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time happened with a KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED error, happened when I was transferring some photos and music from my external hard drive to my computer. PC just randomly restarted itself. after displaying the blue screen error message. In addtion,
 it would start up and shut itself off after half a second, repeatedly. I had to completely power drain it to turn it back on.</p>
<p>I've done some online research and followed a few steps (eg. virus scans, turn on driver verifier, update devices in device manager to latest software update etc.) to try and diagnose the problem, but none helped, evidently by second error which happened
 just a day after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second time happened with a DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED VIOLATION error when I was shutting my PC down, could very well be because Verifier.exe was enabled the day after.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the solutions I found online indicates that there is a driver(s) that is not updated or incompatible with the OS so I've tried scanning for updates for each device in Device Manager, but all of them are updated. I really have no idea how to find
 out without having to uninstall each and every single third party application in my PC. So basically, my hope is to find out where the root is, and get rid of it once and for all. Hopefully, the minidump files can give some indication as to which program/device
 is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if the information provided below is relevant at all (it's my first time posting here), but if you require any further information, please don't hesitate to ask, I will try my best to get it. Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It failed to update windows again yesterday and when it restarted, it undid all the updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another blue screen crash half an hour ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there appears to be three additional drives under "This PC"(screenshot in link above), which only appeared recently. Is this normal? Should I be worried? Is there anything in there that could help with your diagnosis?</p>

<p><span><span>To identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item.
 It is a <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 204, 1)">much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.</span></span><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Run Autoruns and select the
<strong>Everything</strong></span><span> tab. Click </span>
<strong><span>File</span></strong><span>,
</span><strong><span>Save</span></strong><span> and, using the scroll to the right, change the ‚Äú</span><strong><span>Save as type</span></strong><span>‚Äù option

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a second report from ADW Cleaner in link below. Yes I did remove all that ADW found last time, but for some reason it still found some infected files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Autorun report in link below. Is this different from going to the "Startup" tab in "Task Manager"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are currently 202 available important Windows updates from the last time it failed to update. However, I think that it could've been just one of them who failed and forced the rest of the updates to roll back. Is there a way to diagnose which of the
 202 failed to update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia graphics driver updated successfully.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you run ADW Cleaner it produces the report showing suspect items. You can select all or some to remove. I recommend removing all. Once the selection has been made you need to confirm
 removal and having done so ADW Cleaner asks you to restart the computer. The items are removed when the computer is rebooted and a report detailing what has been removed is provided. Unless you follow this procedure nothing is removed.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Thread stuck in device driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chanie_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Thread stuck in device driver</h2>
                    So i upgraded to windows 10 and it is automatically set to automatically do updates, so behind my back it did the previous update about 3 days ago and when i came back i had the blue screen frown text screen saying that something went wrong and that it
 was collecting data, and like always on any computer i have worked with it wasn't actually doing anything. It told me that the reason was: "THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER" so thanks auto update! i have an AMD Athlon X2 (yes its old) with a 1TB WD black and
 an ASUS Radeon R7 260x, when i go into update history it says that the last driver update failed but on Device manager it says i have the latest drivers on everything in my PC. i have done all i believe i can so please actually help so i don't end up needing
 to reinstall EVERYTHING to get things to work.

            <p>It's your<strong> video card driver</strong>. I am having the same issue and had it with Win 7 as well. Restarts don't work, I had to shut the PC off and manually start it with the power button. I haven't found a solution yet and was hoping the Win10 upgrade
 would work, but it's not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going through some troubleshooting now and will try to remember to post my findings.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you tried updating drivers?</p>
<p>What is the make and model of your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER bug indicates that a thread in a device driver is endlessly spinning. A device driver is spinning in an infinite loop, most likely waiting for hardware to become idle. This usually indicates problem with the hardware itself,
 or with the device driver programming the hardware incorrectly. Frequently, this is the result of a bad video card or a bad display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to check for the latest Graphics card drivers from the device Manufacturer website and see if it fix the issue. If you don't find the latest driver or if the problem still persist, then try installing the available drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Download the latest&nbsp;and available driver from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Uninstall the existing graphics card drivers from your PC through Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<strong><span>‚ÄòProperties‚Äô</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;<strong><span>‚ÄòCompatibility‚Äô</span></strong> tab and click

            Yashwanth, Thanks for the reply... But I tried reinstalling the graphics driver and many other fixes. After installing the Win 10 update last week, and then a graphics card update, my keyboard would not work. Was forced to replace the c: drive with a factory
 image and rebuild the system. &nbsp;Working great now! &nbsp;Never mind the 24 hours of ****. I call it blunt force repair.

            <p>I am having a similar problem but only when I use the&nbsp;academic writing&nbsp;referencing 'my Endnote Web' website. There's a drop down list to input a new reference and everytime I click on the list to select the appropriate option, my laptop freezes and then
 crashes (screen goes blue and the 'thread stuck in device' message comes up. Once rebooted and try to reattempt, the same problem happens again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had this problem with anything else, only the endnote website.&nbsp;The software works fine when adding references to office documents.&nbsp;It is vital that I use this website for a piece of work. Any suggestions as to how to resolve this problem? Thanks.</p>

            Its been 4 months, so I might not be clear on the details, but I ultimately had to replace the motherboard even after Dell tests suggested it was OK. &nbsp;No problems since.

                    &lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday, and now I can't access anything. There's a pop-up window saying "Serious Problem! Start-menu and Cortana not working. We will try to fix next time you log-in."&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I can't access
 Windows update, I can't update my computer. I can't access my browser or programs. Will they actually fix this or do I have to do something? The computer I'm using right now was also upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday and do not have the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon&lt;/p&gt;

            This bug has existed even in the preview build. Please do not select this as an aswer, but the only way to use your MSA account with your system is to wipe out your PC and do a clean install. Microsoft has ignored this critical bug for quite a while now.
 This should be a high priority.

            <p>It's funny because I was restarting the computer several times by using the "shut off" button and then manually restarted the computer. A couple of days ago a windows update failed because of this, simply because I didn't use the "restart" button. Does that
 make sense? You know, there is a sleep, shut off and restart button, and what fixed this problem was using the restart button. Windows update apparently only activates when you use the restart....</p>

            <p>Hi, i have the same problem. Try to update your machine with Windows Update.</p>
<p>A way to go in Windows Update is to go to File Explorer and on the left side click This Pc. Than up you will see a settings icon. And there you are. Go to Update and look for an update, maybe it will solve your problem. I still can not fix my start.</p>

            <p>Got the same problem. Updated two laptops. One went smooth the other, not so much. It locked at settings update and shut down. Restarted and serious error message popped up " Cortana and Start Menu not set up windows will try to correct on next sign in".&nbsp;
 After several attempts to sign in the message was still there. Not a good first impression...</p>

<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm the one who posted this question and I've found that you simply have to do a "RESTART". Meaning you have to click the actual "restart" button, and not the "shut down" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

    <title>Problem with OLE hanging system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with OLE hanging system</h2>
                    When I go to save files and I click on the drop down to change the file location, my system hangs for 2-10 minutes. &nbsp;I tried saving a file in Excel ... clicked on file, then save as, and when the drop down appeared I tried to change the file in the SAVE
 IN box ... the system hung. &nbsp;I eventually got a message that MICROSOFT OFFICE EXCEL IS WAITING FOR ANOTHER APPLICATION TO COMPLETE AN OLE ACTION ... but nothing else was running on the system. &nbsp;After an extended wait, it finally cleared. &nbsp;This also is happening
 when I try to save a downloaded file in AOL. I'm running Windows XP with Service Pack 3 and have all the latest updates applied (automatic update).<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
Yes the screen is flipped here is a step which will get you the screen back in normal position.</div>
<div>Press <strong>Ctrl</strong> and <strong>Alt</strong> key simultaneously and then press<strong>upper arrow key</strong>. That should resolve the issue.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Please check whether you face the same issue while working in the safe mode.<br />
a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information gently tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode.<br />
e. When Windows starts and check if the issue still persists.<br />
For additional information refer to the articles below.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Skype Metro App Search - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carl.p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Skype Metro App Search</h2>
                    <p>So it seams that the new search will not only send my search text across the internet&nbsp; to Microsoft and search the skype database, and then it will search each of my conversations, returning the most recent occurrence of the search term in each conversation.&nbsp;
 Is there no longer a way to search just an individual conversation?&nbsp; Once I have the first occurrence, is there a way to search for additional occurrences of the term in a conversation, or even in all conversations? Searching again will only bring back the
 most recent occurrence once again.</p>

                    I would like to install MS DOS 6.22 under Windows 7 in dual boot mode, so that I can operate my machine and transfer all my Windows and other files to an external hard disk for back-up purposes. If I try to do this through Windows itself, because some
 of the Windows files will be active, these particular files cannot be copied. I have downloaded Virtual Floppy Disk to help and I know&nbsp; that I will have to set up a separate partition, but how exactly do I go about installing the DOS?<br />

<p>??</p>
<p>Making something as complicated as a dual-boot system where you may/may not be able to access everything (DOS is not going to see NTFS natively&nbsp;- so are you using FAT32 with Windows 7?) doesn't make sense to me when it is possible to get what you want either
 using the built-in tools or many other third party tools - many free as well.</p>

<p>Pretty sure that will NOT get them what they wanted...</p>
<p>They want to boot up in DOS so they can have access to ALL of their Windows files (because none of the Windows files would be in use.)&nbsp; A virtual machine would not cover that.</p>

Thanks for taking the trouble, Andre. I've visited the site whose link you gave and have downloaded the VirtualBox. I'm also looking at the suggestion of simply using the System Image in Windows 7. All I'm looking for is an exact copy of the hard drive that
 I can use to replace any files that become corrupted<br />

Instead of that, why not:<br />

<p>??</p>
<p>Making something as complicated as a dual-boot system where you may/may not be able to access everything (DOS is not going to see NTFS natively&nbsp;- so are you using FAT32 with Windows 7?) doesn't make sense to me when it is possible to get what you want either
 using the built-in tools or many other third party tools - many free as well.</p>

Hi, there.<br />
The NTFS versus FAT32 business does seem to present a problem. I am beginning to look into it, but I never thought that System Images could do what simple copying couldn't, which is to copy files that are being used by the computer. If System Image can indeed
 do this, then, I;m home and dry.<br />

            As Shenan says; you are complicating the process, a process which can easily be accomplished with the built in win tools or many third party utilities, some of which are free
