            Did you install anything recently that might have changed it back to the original version? If so, uninstall it. Then Go to PC Settings, Recovery, Update and check for new builds.&nbsp;

<h2>            Is it possible to call somebody in China from the UAE with a Skype number&#63; Problem&#58; both countries officially block Skype</h2>
                    Hi, I am moving to China and my partner stays in the UAE. Both countries restricted the access to Skype. Is it possible to use a Skype number in one of both countries so we can call and see each other? Or do we have to set up a Skype number in another
 country (e.g. in Netherlands, Sweden etc.) that we can use (via VPN)?

</p><p>Skype is not blocked in China. Only the ISPs in the UAE have blocked Skype. If you are planning to make a Skype to Skype call to China&nbsp;and you're in the UAE, using a VPN will work and you don't need to purchase a Skype number as long as it is a Skype to

    <title>Windows Update not offering pre-release drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sionic ion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update not offering pre-release drivers</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 10 10074 installed the day of the release of the beta drivers from Intel. It came through Windows Update, there was a firmware update and everything. Windows 10 installed it and my Surface ran smooth after that. But I&nbsp;needed to go back to 8.1,
 and now with the release of the new build 10122, I wanted to go back to Windows 10. Well, with both builds, 10074 and 10122, I am not receiving anything but a firmware update that isn't applicable to my system I already have it installed, it just shows up,
 installs or at least checks to see if it can be applied and realizes it doesn't, and then after that my system is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get Windows Update to offer me up the pre-release Intel drivers for the graphics. Device Manager can't find them through Windows Update either, and I don't even have unknown devices detected, I installed the 8.1 drivers for everything but graphics.
 But its not even showing an unknown device for the graphics, it just shows a basic display adapter, and it thinks that's the best driver available when I check for updates for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I do NOT want to wait for Windows Update to be fixed, I want the pre-release Intel drivers released on here to download so I can install them myself. I am not waiting for Windows Update to push an update. I want the drivers on a flash drive the next
 time this happens.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just can't believe there is no other source for these drivers other than Windows Update. Intel's website doesn't even offer a graphics drivers for the Intel Atom x7! Every driver from their website would not proceed with installation. Even their automatic
 utility said I had a future processor that the utility did not recognize or know of yet! And this is for Windows 8.1! I needed the Intel software to change some settings and I had installed 8.1 from scratch, I know the Intel software comes with the default
 image on the Surface 3 but I preferred a clean installation. The Surface 3 drivers on Microsoft's website do not provide the software, only the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall this is all messed up. Intel needs to have proper driver support for the Intel Atom x7 on their website for Windows 8.1, it's their SOC. And I want a download for those pre-release Windows 10&nbsp;drivers, I am done checking for updates constantly hoping
 it might decide to push the right update with the right drivers.</p>

            <p>I figured it out. Turn off driver signature enforcement and through device manager, install legacy device, choose graphics card from list, then click have disk. Locate the inf for the Windows 8 Surface 3 graphics driver. When it warns you the driver isn't
 signed, just allow it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Graphics driver will kick in. Then go to Windows Update and check for updates, Windows Update will offer a Intel HD Graphics driver and install it automatically. The correct Windows 10 preview graphics driver will be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also copy that installation from the Windows Update download folder to somewhere like a flash drive for quick access next build you install. Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi CC2018,<br />
<br />
Welcome to this forum and we are glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, I can edit my notebook that created via OneNote in OneNote for Win10 normally. To check if you can edit your notebook, please sign in your account in
<strong><a href="http://www.onenote.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote online</a></strong> to see the outcome. If you can edit your&nbsp;notebook, please close(Right-click the notebook's name&gt;Close This Notebook) and reopen (More Notebooks)your notebook
 to see if this issue persist. If you still can't edit your page, please create a new page to see the result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also share with me more info as below to let me have a better understanding of your scenario:</p>
<p>1. Does this issue happen to other sections?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Can you edit other notebooks that created in OneNote 2016 via OneNote for Windows10?</p>
<p>3. The version number of your OS (Click Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;OK)&nbsp;and OneNote(Three points on the right-top&gt;Settings&gt;About).</p>

<h2>            I use the OneNote App on my android tablet and some of my files have become corrupted</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung S2 tablet running the OneNote app. I moved notes and set up a new notebook yesterday and a lot of photos I had in the notes have become corrupted and are no longer stored on the tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tablet at the time had saved all my changes and allowed me in and out of the notebooks. However after a while it started to become delayed and gave me a 'hang on while we find your notes' type message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I hadn't synced the notes with my laptop version of one note. I have since synced both versions and the pictures have become corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any text I had written is still there though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched and tried to find a way to fix the problem but no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else a suggestion on how to fix it??&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Caitriona, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with the corrupted files on OneNote application from mobile devices may arise due to an outdated application. To isolate the issue, we'd like to ask a few questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked if you are using the updated version of OneNote application to your mobile device?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? This is to avoid providing the same troubleshooting steps that you have tried.</li><li>We'd like to request of the error message that you are getting. </li><li>Did you make any changes to your device before experiencing this issue? If yes, tell us more about it.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>According to the one note app on my tablet it is running version 16.0.8625.2040.
<br />
Thats the only version number it is giving me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I think it recently did an update and the errors may have started to occur around then. My apps on my tablet are set to update autimatically.</p>

</p><p>In terms of trouble shooting, I had signed out and back into the app, I tried to see if there was anything on the forum but it all relates to using the desktop version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had tried some of the desktop solutions such as seeing if there was a misplaced notebook etc. Unfortunately there wasn't too many answers to errors in android versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original error message I was getting was 'hang on while we try to get your notes'. The device could not find the notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error occured when I tried setting up two new notebooks for my notes. I had successfully moved all my notes into the two notebooks and then it was almost as if onenote couldn't cope with the movement of the notes and stalled and lost them.</p>
<p>I hadn't synced my</p>
<p>tablet with my desktop version before all this happened. Even when I did sync it, some of the photos I had captured in my notes were absent. When I clicked on them to try and find them it wouldn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I wrote the original query, more issues are arising with my android version. It keeps claiming there are 'conflicting changes on this page. try opening it with onenote online to see the conflicts'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The photos from my notes used to store onto an album on my tablet which are now no longer there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done to retrieve my notes and fix the issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached some screenshots of my onenote and the errors I am recieveing.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aef84bdc-d102-48df-b129-613c21a4f399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aef84bdc-d102-48df-b129-613c21a4f399" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a2b5f90-e422-48ce-a2e6-811a5f106709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a2b5f90-e422-48ce-a2e6-811a5f106709" /></a></p>

</p><p>I would be grateful for any help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to make use of the front camera on E71&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to make it useful for something while not on a video call?

<p>With it being a camera it's uses are quite limited, what exactly would you like it to do?<br />
<br />
On most phones (not just Nokia's) with front camera's the feature tends to go unused if people have no interest in video calling. Any other uses tend to revolve around that but using other applications or connection methods to do it.</p>

            Exactly. I'd just like to make use of it for something, say as a mirror, since very few callers are interested in video calling. So, if there's some built-in or external app that enables the user to access this camera, that would be great. Just that.

            I can't speak for the E71 but some models (like my N8) have the option to capture pictures/video using the front camera so it could be used as a mirror.<br />
<br />
If the E71 has this option open the camera app, press options - "use secondary camera". If the option isn't there then it doesn't have the feature. You may be able to find third party apps that offer the feature by searching google.

            Just checked. Such an option is not there. Guess there's no in-built functionality to make use of the front camera. Thanks for the resolution. Let's see if someone else already knows of an app, since so far I've not been able to find one by search.

<p>Jagdeep, thanks for the post.</p>
<p>Roady, thanks for the quick help.&nbsp; Is there any documentation on the pre-requisites required for Outlook Social Connector to work?&nbsp; would be a great asset to share, this way, we get all pre-requisites in place before starting the pilot/evaluation/deployment.</p>
<p>Also, is there a link to download only the RTM for Outlook Social Connector?&nbsp; For people who want to use this with their Outlook 2003 and 2007, they will require this is they are not being allowed to upgrade the entire suite to 2010.</p>

<p>There is no RTM release for the Outlook Social Connector for Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007. It is expected to be launched when Outlook 2010 becomes available in the retail stores (mid June).</p>
<p>The pre-requisity of Windows Search 4.0 is mentioned on the download page of the OSC download page. As Windows Search only works for Exchange accounts when Cached Exchange Mode is enabled, we've gone full circle why CEM is needed for OSC to work ;-)</p>

<p>I have the same/similar issue with Microsoft Outlook Social Connector (OSC).</p>
<p>Some information about my system:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using a fully updated version of Outlook 2007 (12.0.6514.5000) SP2 MSO (12.0.6529.5000)</li><li>My email is on an exchange account which is locally cached. </li><li>I am running a fully updated version of Windows 7 Pro </li></ul>
<p>This is what I can see in OSC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail items in the inbox and sub-folders </li><li>Calendar items where the originator was the contact. </li></ul>
<p>I have tried installing the OSC on two machines with this configuration and have had little luck</p>
<p>Attempts to resolve that I have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deactivated all plug-ins except the Windows Email Search <span>
Index</span>er </li><li>created new profile </li><li>Rebuilt <span>
Index</span> </li><li>Set this register key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles\Current Exchange\ddb0922fc50b8d42be5a821ede840761&nbsp; to 00 10</li><li>Restarted Outlook after <span>
index</span>ing complete </li></ul>
<p>It appears that only items from the sent items and deleted items do not <span>
index</span>.&nbsp; (If we are looking at conversation threads, both should be <span>
index</span>ed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other items of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can see everything (including deleted and sent items and calendars items)&nbsp;in the contact activities view</li><li>If I go to a calendar item where there are attendees, OSC recognizes all attendees and I can select&nbsp;each attendee&nbsp;from the People Pane on the calendar item, but oddly the&nbsp;appointment that is open STILL isn't shown in the appointments for that individual.
</li><li>For me, it doesn't seem to matter if the contact is internal or external. </li><li>When I search on to:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp; (for a particular contact), their emails show up in sent items.</li><li>If I search on from:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (for a particular contact), their emails show up in inbox and clicking on 'Try searching again in All Mail Items" bring up subfolders, sent items and deleted items&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Any suggestions including the proper place and format to file a bug report for the beta would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I also am having a similar issue.</p>
<p>I have two exchange accounts, hotmail connector to two Office Live custom domain accounts, and one POP3 account.</p>
<p>The social connector worked before I added second exchange account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now no detail records ever appear in the connector?</p>

            Of itself that change won’t produce the error. A  5941 indicates that it can’t find a Collection object, in your case a table. <br />So things to check:<br />Is there actually a table in the document you tried to run it in?<br />Did you have the cursor in a row of the table before you tried to run it?

    <title>Zune HD dock issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael bishop99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune HD dock issue</h2>
                    
<p>I have the Zune HD 64 and now, the Zune HD dock.&nbsp; I have the dock plugged into my Windows 7 computer via the supplied USB cable.&nbsp; I also have the analog out from the Zune dock going to the line-in input on my computer via a 3.5mm to 3.mm stereo patch cable.&nbsp;
 My problem: The output from the Zune dock contains so much static/noise that I can't listen to the Zune playing music this way.</p>
<p>I've tried plugging the 3.5mm patch cable directly from the Zune to my computer's line-in input - and that works perfectly with no noise or static - so there is no problem with the patch cable - but alas, the Zune is not plugged into its dock - so it is
 not charging.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to use the dock to charge, to sync, and to play music - but because of the static from the analog audio out from the dock, this is not currently possible.&nbsp; Please help!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Michael Bishop</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>A couple of suggestions -</p>
<p>1. Try a different patch cable?</p>
<p>2. Try connecting the Zune HD and Dock to your Home Theater?</p>
<p>3. Make sure the connector in the dock does not have any particles/dust or bent prongs/pins</p>
<p>If you get the same static with a different patch cable on both the computer and the home theater system then it is possible that the there is some internal damage to the dock. Checking the connector for dust and bent pins may be a clue as well.</p>
<p>Suggestion at that point is to consider your return and/or warranty replacement options. The only other possibility is the connector point on your Zune device check it to make sure there is no particles/dust or bent pins.</p>

    <title>text, menu names, buttons disappear re-appear on mouse hover - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sammitina  say:</h3>
<h2>            text, menu names, buttons disappear re-appear on mouse hover</h2>
                    Hello all,
<div>Just updated to Office 2013. Noticed from the get go that something was wrong. When the splash screen came up when it was installing I could not see what the "NEXT" button said just a - on the button. Then when you are choosing the theme I noticed some
 of the items from the list were missing until I would hover over them with my mouse, and then they would appear, and others would disappear. After installing this problem has occurred all over office. In Outlook some folder names don't show, buttons in the
 ribbon, and menus names are missing but they will reappear when you hover over them with the mouse, but others will then disappear. The same goes for Word, Excel, and Lync. Also in Word if I bring a document up, some of the text inside the document will seem
 like it has disappeared. It's not actually gone, but if I highlight it, I can see that it is there. This is very frustrating as I would love to start using Office 2013, but can't as I cannot see what I am trying to do! When I roll myself back to Office 2010
 everything works just fine and I do not have any of these issues. These issues also do not happen in any other programs other than Office 2013.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried repairing, uninstalling, and re-installing office 2013. I have checked and unchecked the box for Disable hardware graphics Acceleration as well as Use subpixel positioning to smooth fonts on screen. None of this has helped. Actually checking
 the box for Disable hardware graphics acceleration made it worse and distorted everything on the screen. I have updated my graphics driver to the most up-to-date, as well as tried rolling it back to an earlier version to see if that would help. I don't have
 any PDF buliders or fastpictureviewer installed. I'm out of ideas at this point. I am running Windows 7 64 bit with an Nvidia 9500 GT graphics card with the version 320.18 driver. Help please :)</div>

            I have intermittently seen similar symptoms in Word 2013 (local install). <br />
<br />
I didn't find a real fix, other than booting the computer.&nbsp; To me that implies there is some sort of bad interaction with other software, or "soft" corruption of that Word / Office session, but not corruption of my Office or Window installations.<br />

            I have tried rebooting the computer, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling office, but no luck there. I have had to uninstall 2013 completely and reinstall 2010 so that I can actually work. To me it seems like it's an issue between my graphics card/driver
 and office 2013, but I haven't been able to find anything to support that or cure it.

<p>Please tell us what file format you are working with, DOC or DOCX (etc)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm what version of Word/Office you are working with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is happening to only a single file, "file corruption" is a good guess.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word you have a couple of options to "fix" file corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Save As to Another format</p>
<p>If you have not used any "advanced" word features in the file you could try using Save As to one of the older file formats, ie DOC or RTF, and then back to DOCX.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Use a 3rd party program to Open the File</p>
<p>Some non-Office "Word" equivalent programs have routines that correct minor XML corruptions.&nbsp; Open Office, Libre Office are the 2 most commonly suggest alternatives.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Copy into a Blank file</p>
<p>Open your corrupted file and a new "blank" file. Then Select, copy and Paste from the corrupt file into the "blank" file.&nbsp; One thing you have to make sure you do is
<strong>NOT</strong> copy the very last "paragraph" mark <strong><span>¶
</span></strong><span>in the file.
</span>In addition to the usual paragraph formatting information, this last "paragraph mark" contains some of the file formatting information.

            The problem has been solved. Starting Windows in safe mode, I had no problems. For this reason I have used the "msconfig" Windows utility to uncheck several programs in order they do not run when starting Windows. In this way I have seen that the problem
 was caused by a virus or malware called tunesNINJA. I have removed this virus deleting some files and also using "regedit". After some days, the problem has not appeared again.

</p><p>I'm afraid it's not possible to recover an account if you have typed an email address that

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a&nbsp;suggestion, try creating a Yahoo! account with the same email address as what you have put as your primary alias on the Microsoft website if it is not yet taken. By that, you can receive any communication email and verification codes that are needed
 to verify your identity and get back to the account.</p>

            <p>Hi Sofia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are getting an error message on your phone which shows that the user name or the password is incorrect for the email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description of the issue, it's possible that you have two-step verification enabled on your account. This is true if you're using a Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to refer to the article below and see if that helps:</p>

<h2>            IT won&#39;t allow Outlook iOS App access Exchange due to &#34;security issues&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot use it with my company’s exchange server because of a security issue they claim.&nbsp; Curious if there is anything to it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here is what the IT office says:<br />
<br />
"We do not allow the Outlook app because Microsoft rebranded an app that they purchased late last year.&nbsp; It actually downloads and caches mail from the Exchange server to a third party server to “accelerate” the user experience.&nbsp; Too many security issues with
 this."&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this legit?</p>

            I believe the issue is related to how the Outlook iOS App operates and not Exchange Server.

<h2>            Control memory usage from a PowerPoint object&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a PowerPoint slideshow to cycle through pictures. I'm using VBA and a picture object to randomly select pictures. The longer the slideshow goes, the more the memory really balloons until the system begins paging and slowing everything to a crawl.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to control memory being used by the object? Release it or clear it out before loading the new picture? Becasue this also affects the file size of the slideshow if the "Save" button is pressed.</p>
<p>The code. It pulls a list of filenames from a text document, choose one, then retrieves the file. Ignore the "movie" name, it's really just pictures.</p>

                    I typed several documents in word 2003 but closed word and hit "don't save".&nbsp; Does word 2003 have an autorecover feature?&nbsp; And if it does, what is the likelihood that&nbsp;I can still retrieve these documents or have someone else look at my harddrive and do
 it.&nbsp; These documents were typed and not saved over several months and unfortunately i didn't think I would need them again but I do. I know it is easier to retrieve unsaved documents in 2010 but these were typed in word 2003

<h2>            Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 suddenly stopped displaying emails in html in my msn and hotmail inboxes</h2>
                    Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 suddenly stopped displaying emails in html in my msn and hotmail inboxes, and I can't find a solution to this issue that fixes the problem.&nbsp; It will now only download and display images in plain text format in these folders.&nbsp;
 Can you tell me how to get Outlook to display messages in html format in my hotmail and msn accounts?<br />
<br />
I have already tried reinstalling both mailboxes, but this did not fix the issue, and I have tried adding all emails to the safe sender list, but nothing has worked so far.

            Hi, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I am running McAfee Antivirus Plus.&nbsp; I turned off the e-mail scanner and this did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; I have seven e-mail accounts associated with my Outlook sofware and it is only the hotmail accounts that do not display email in html.&nbsp; The others display
 html emails as html.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that some emails from certain sources, such as Monster.com (to my hotmail addresses) do actually display in html format.&nbsp; But very few.<br />
<br />
This issue first occurred when I was experiencing difficulties with Outlook in so much as when I first booted it it would go through the process of downloading new mail, and then it would hang on the last mail it was downloading.&nbsp; It would then not send any
 additional mail until I closed Outlook and killed the process in task manager, before restarting.&nbsp; Everything worked fine after a forced close and restart.<br />
<br />
Having searched the forums I was led to believe that this was an issue caused by the amount of mail in my mailboxes.&nbsp; The main mailbox was about 2Gb.&nbsp; So I did a mailbox cleanup and also archived all mailboxes.&nbsp; This reduced the main mailbox size to about 0.5Gb
 and significantly reduced the number of mails in volume.<br />
<br />
It was after the mailbox cleanup that the issue of html emails not being displayed for my hotmail accounts occurred.&nbsp; I don't believe that it was a coincidence!<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I found a cumbersome remedy to the original issue.&nbsp; In brief, I have a laptop which I use at home and at work connecting to my home wireless and the wireless at work.&nbsp; When at home I connect to a Belkin router, which requires software installed
 on the laptop in order for it to connect.&nbsp; This is fine when at home, but when at work I have to close the software before it will connect to the work wireless.<br />
<br />
I found that if I turned the wireless off on the laptop first thing in the morning, before I opened Outlook, and then switched it on once Outlook was open, then I no longer experienced the issue of Outlook hanging on the last mail it was downloading, and the
 software subsequently shut down properly without having to open task manager to force it to shut down.<br />
<br />
The mailbox cleanup and archiving has since resolved this issue in the majority of cases, although every now and again it will hang, and I have to force it to close before it will work properly again.&nbsp; This I can cope with as it is very frequently, but I still
 have the issue of hotmail mails not displaying in html in the majority of cases.<br />
<br />
I hope this is useful and look forward to hearing from you!<br />
<br />
Jon<br />

            <p>Hi JonathanTuck,</p>
<p>Have you tried creating a new profile in Outlook.</p>
<p>This is a regular step in troubleshooting.</p>
<p>What you want to do is to create a new profile and with a new personal folder and test to see if html email displays properly.
</p>
<p>If so then you can try opening your Outlook data file in the new profile and see if the problem returns.
</p>
<p>If the problem does return then you know there is&nbsp;something wrong with the Personal folders data file. (.pst)</p>
<p>If the problem does not return then you will know there was a problem with the Outlook profile and you can continue to use your new profile.</p>
<p>Here are a few articles that you can use to troubleshoot this process.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your reply.&nbsp; I have done this previously.&nbsp; I separated my email accounts and had each of my hotmail accounts running in Windows Live Mail, and this software displayed the emails in each account in html format, and thus resolved the issue.&nbsp;
 However, I was not comfortable with having to use two e-mail programmes, and having previously deleted the accounts from outlook, I reinstalled them and went through the process of downloading everything again.&nbsp; Having done that, the majority of the emails
 did not display in html format.<br />
<br />
What can I do to resolve a problem with the psd. file?&nbsp; I'm afraid that I couldn't see the answer in the links that you provided.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi JonathanTuck,</p>
<p>I just want to make sure we are on the same page....email that has already been converted to plain text cannot be reverted back to HTML.</p>
<p>With that said, are you seeing new emails from Hotmail come in as plain text?</p>
<p>Is that where we are at with this issue?</p>
<p>If you are finding that a new Personal Folder (.pst) resolves your problem with incoming email showing as HTML when expected. Then the resolution would be to&nbsp;use a new .pst file and then move your contents over to the new .pst file.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I don't know how to convert the plain text emails into html format.&nbsp; If I did, this would be a very good interim fix for the problem!<br />
<br />
The vast majority of new emails come in as plain text.&nbsp; E-mails from a few sources do come in as html, but not many, and always from the same sources.&nbsp; Sources that come in as plain text always come in as plain text, like all of my linked-in communications,
 for example.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, a new .pst file does not resolve the issue.&nbsp; The reason I say this is because I have deleted both of my hotmail accounts from Outlook and started again, and this did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; I do not know if this means that I have used a
 new .pst file, or not.<br />
<br />
I have looked at the link that you have provided and could not find anything that helped.&nbsp; I am not transferring my .pst files between different versions of Outlook.&nbsp; I have had the same version of Outlook for several years and the problem occurred during this
 time.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div>You could always just print the form from InfoPath into OneNote. Or you might be able to export the InfoPath to Word and then from Word to OneNote.</div>

    <title>Word thinks it&#39;s unlicensed&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justicecupcakes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word thinks it&#39;s unlicensed&#33;</h2>
                    My copy of Microsoft Word, which was functioning fine last week, now seems to think it's unlicensed. I checked my account online and it says I still have Office 365 A1 Plus for students in my subscriptions, but the application itself thinks I'm unlicensed,
 despite being logged into the exact same account.<br />
<br />
I've tried updating and it didn't help. Does anyone have any ideas?

            Hi Justicecupcakes 
<br />
<br />Click this link and run through the Office activation troubleshooter:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlice...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation, including activation . . .

    <title>Where did they go&#63; Quick Parts Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where did they go&#63; Quick Parts Gallery</h2>
                    <p>I was thrilled when I discovered the Quick Part Gallery and found I could a paragraph of text that I use repeatedly. I added approximately six different phrases to the Quick Parts Gallery yesterday and used most of the several &nbsp;times throughout the day.
 But today they are no where to be seen. I tried saving another phrase to the Quick Part Gallery, saved the document, rebooted my machine and it was also gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can guide me. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>When you click the "Save Selection to Quick Part Gallery" item, the dialog includes a box for "Save in". You can select any template that's currently in use, including Normal.dotm and Building Blocks.dotx. When you click OK, the building block is saved in
 whichever template is shown in that box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After saving the building block, when you close Word, you should be prompted to save the template by a message like this one:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2f289da-d2f3-4f7e-8c08-40450fe62f73" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't see the message, or if you clicked Don't Save, then the change probably wasn't saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're saving building blocks in Normal.dotm, you should go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Save and check the box for "Prompt before saving Normal template" to make sure the message shows up. It's a good idea to keep this checked anyway, so you're notified
 of any attempt to change Normal.dotm, both intentional and not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you can do is look at the Building Blocks Organizer (that's also on the Quick Parts button's menu) to see whether the building block you think you saved is really in the place you expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's one more possibility, although not too common. In some company networks, a misguided IT department may forcibly overwrite every user's Normal.dotm template during login, in an attempt to prevent use of unauthorized styles. Check the date of the file,
 which you'll usually find in %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates, to see whether it matches the date/time when you saved the building block in that template.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2016 Desktop - hand written notes are disappearing&#47;erasing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel paulino  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 Desktop - hand written notes are disappearing&#47;erasing randomly</h2>
                    <p>I use OneNote a lot for school to record all my lecture notes. I also do my homework on OneNote.&nbsp;You can imagine how integral the program is in my academic life, and it hasn't failed me until now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating to Office 2016, I've been experiencing my handwritten notes (henceforth I will call "ink") disappearing completely at random. For instance, I would be merrily writing notes for a lecture, covering certain figures almost completely with ink.
 To my dismay, all these notes that I've written would then vanish the next day, leaving the page half as dense with ink than before. Sentences would be missing words, and&nbsp;lines and arrows would have disappeared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have actually witnessed these disappearances occur with my own eyes. I would be reading my notes, and then suddenly the page would blink white, and then half my ink would have disappeared. At first I thought I may have deleted them so I attempt to press
 the "undo" button, but that does absolutely nothing. The ink was lost permanently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this? Does the OneNote engineering team know of this CRITICAL bug? I&nbsp;used to be a major advocate of OneNote. It has been my favourite app to use for the past 4 years. I can no longer recommend this program to others as long as this
 MAJOR issue remains. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution for this issue??</p>
<p />
