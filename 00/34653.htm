<h2>            Purchased game is not correctly downloaded</h2>
                    
<p>I have purchased and tried to d/l BO2 Apocalypse, but it is apparently not downloading correctly. I have tried every remedy I can find in this forum to no avail. The d/l seems to proceed as I would expect, but the product is never found on the hard drive.
 There is no error code, no region problem, I am in the US region in my profile and I still live in California. I&nbsp; have deleted every file in the system folder and checked for the initial purchase of Apocalypse (shown as&nbsp; paid&nbsp; for in my&nbsp; purchase history).
 The only different behavior I have seen is that the game d/l progress bar starts at 1-5%, then pauses, then jumps to 99% and then finishes with no error messages. I recently d/led Elite successfully and then immediately tried Apocalypse again, but it just
 went thru the same procedure as before and the file was not listed on the h/d. The console is running on Ethernet and functions perfectly in other respects. I don't have a Season Pass.</p>

<p>Do you have a flash drive large enough to hold the content + 1GB? &nbsp;If so I'd suggest pulling your hard drive and downloading your profile and the content to the flash drive instead. &nbsp;Be aware that configuring the flash drive for the console will wipe everything
 on it.</p>
<p>If you are using a 4GB console then obviously this isn't going to be an option.</p>

<p>Fail. I used a 32GB flash drive as you described. Oddly enough, as soon as the move process began, Apocalypse was the first file. When the move was finished, however, Apocalypse was not listed on the HD or the flash drive. I downloaded Apocalypse again,
 but this time the download seemed normal compared to other downloads of large files. It looks like Apocalypse is physically on the HD (or flash drive) but for some reason is not recognized as being playable. Is a licensing problem possible??

<p>Possibly, you can do a license reset, but if the files is downloaded correctly and not working you'll probably want to contact support on the phone.</p>

    <title>Windows Live Mail constant password loop error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail constant password loop error</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 8.1 32-bit. I've had WLM set up on this PC for months now with zero issues. The other day when I booted up and opened WLM 2012 I get a popup that says "To help protect your account&nbsp;information, please sign in again." So I click on OK.
 Then the sign-in window comes up with my username and password already entered (it's been saved in WLM since day 1). I click on "Sign In" and the same popup comes up. It will happen repeatedly as long as I keep doing it. If I click cancel on the popup or on
 the login screen (doesn't matter which one) it goes away and then up on the toolbar it shows I'm signed in (it gives me the option to sign out). Also even after hitting cancel I have no problem accessing any of my email (there's 3 email accounts setup in WLM),
 replying to email, etc. Any ideas?

            This is not the answer. Please do not mark it as such. The thread you pointed me to was for the Windows 7 OS not 8.1. The answer in my case was to simply re-enter my password.

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).</span>

            But my method (and the one unspoken one) <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always</span>
</em>works. You <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">never</span> </em>need to do a clean install of Windows in this case. Sorry, but your information about fixing this particular issue is wrong under any circumstances.

            If you can't see an icon for Administrator in Safe Mode then you need to contact a reputable local professional. Do not use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. The MS Office disc will do nothing for you. The professional will be into your system
 in under 5 minutes but I cannot discuss the methods used in these forums. Microsoft is very clear about the terms of use of these forums and I won't contravene them.
<strong>You do not need to reinstall Windows</strong> but you will need to take the machine to a professional.

<h2>            Why will DVDs not play&#63;</h2>
                    Recently my laptop has refused to play DVDs - when I put a disc into the drive it merely opens the DVD as a set of folders and ReadMe files etc. Even if I open My Computer and right click on the D: drive it will not offer me the option of autoplay.

<h2>            Headphones not working</h2>
                    I have a surface laptop I purchased 9 months ago. I use my headphones regularly to listen and work. The last two months the sound stop going through the headphones even though it says they are detected. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for
 sound. I just bought a new Surface laptop two days ago. Worked with the headphones for two days and now it is doing the same thing. I can't have two bad laptops, can I? Is it something I pushed to disable the headphone sound? What do I do? Thanks

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3269655d-49e6-42c3-bf12-503adef078e5" title="LaRisaGiacomini">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know about the issue of the surface headphones. We are delighted that we are able to get in touch with you. To update your surface headphones and to make sure that you have the latest updates please do the following:</p>
Install updates using the Cortana app (within the United States)
<hr />
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Here's how to install updates using the Cortana app on your mobile device or Windows 10 PC. In each case, you'll need to be connected to your device using the included USB cable (for Windows 10) or over Bluetooth (for iOS, Android, or
 Windows 10).</p>
<p>To update your headphones more quickly, use the USB cable and your PC instead of updating them over Bluetooth.</p>
On a Windows 10 PC
<ol>
<li>Set up your Surface Headphones with Cortana. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Manage my Surface Headphones</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Check for updates</strong> under <strong>Firmware updates</strong> or select
<strong>Update</strong> if there's an update already available.</li></ol>
<p>The update will take a few minutes to download, and you can use your headphones during this time. After the download, your headphones will restart and the update will take a few minutes to install. During the installation, your headphones
 will appear to be off. If your Surface Headphones don't reconnect automatically after the update is finished, press the power button on the headphones to turn them off, then turn them back on to reconnect.&nbsp;</p>
On an iOS or Android device
<ol>
<li>Set up your Surface Headphones in the Cortana app. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Devices</strong> menu and choose <strong>Surface Headphones</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>If an update is available, tap <strong>Update Now</strong>. To check for updates anytime, select
<strong>Surface Headphones</strong> &gt; <strong>Updates</strong> &gt; <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>The update will take a while to download and install (up to 30 minutes or more). After the download, your headphones will restart and the update&nbsp;will take a few minutes to install. During the installation, your headphones will appear to
 be off.&nbsp;If your Surface Headphones don't reconnect automatically after the update is finished, press the power button on the headphones to turn them off, then turn them back on to reconnect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Let me clarify that I do not have Microsoft headphones.&nbsp; These are standard plug into the headphone jack headphones. Nothing fancy.&nbsp; They work on other devices so I know it is not an issue with them. The computer recognizes when I have them plugged in but
 the sound is&nbsp; not directed to go through the headphones but continues through the speakers on the computer.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help though. I will try to find answers in another way.</p>

            Once again no need for your snarkiness. You just assumed. Thank you once again for all your unhelp.&nbsp; I have done all those steps and options and the computer does have listed my headphones on there when they are plugged in but the sound does not go through
 them. I was thinking maybe an issue with an update that happened with Windows 10 or Microsoft. I will take both computers with the same issue to a local computer place that might be able to figure it out.

 to get it to work with the older versions or the newer ones. &nbsp; Any ideas?

            You can define a custom output profile.&nbsp; When saving to your computer (File &gt; Save movie), scroll down to the bottom to find a 'Custom' option where you can specify bitrate and resolution.&nbsp; Just like the prior versions, though, this isn't truly a "lossless"
 format.&nbsp; You are just increasing the bitrate to hopefully retain more of the original quality.&nbsp; If you go overboard you can end up with really large file sizes, so be careful.&nbsp; Pay attention to the estimate of size/minute on the Custom screen.

            What's strange about doing it like that, is even if I put the highest bit rate possible (I think it is 135,000)and it tells me that the file size will be close to 1 gig, after I publish it, the file size is closer to 20 mb but with pretty good quality.

<h2>            Computer crashes when pressing F1, F2, F3, F11, or F12</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Whenever I press the volume or brightness-related buttons, my laptop completely freezes, bluescreens, then attempts to restart. However, it freezes in the process of restarting, so I have to force shutdown either way. It has been like this for several weeks.
 Is there anything I can do to fix this, and why is it happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hi Dov, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It sounds like there may be a corruption in your system files or drivers, so I'll provide a couple of troubleshooting steps for you.
<br />
<br />Firstly, see if the System File Checker can repair any system files:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />Reboot, then try the function keys again. If that doesn't work, you might need to reinstall your laptop's keyboard drivers from the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />If you're able to let me know what brand and model your laptop is, I can provide a direct link to download the correct drivers.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!       
        </p>

            Hi Dov.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />If you can identify which manufacturer's driver enables the Fkeys then I would update, or reinstall it in Device Manager by choosing Uninstall and then restart PC.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            I'd try to find out which driver handles the Fkey functions and replace or reinstall it.   It may be an element of the chipset, or may have a separate driver on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.

                    <p>I had Windows 8.1 Home Single Language 64 bit OEM edition pre-installed in my laptop.Few months ago I've upgraded it to Windows 10Home Single Language 64bit 10240 build OEM edition using GWX(Get Windows 10 ) app.Now recently i've upgraded it to Windows 10Home
 Single Language 64bit 10586.14 build version 1511 OEM edition via windows update.Now the activation status is showing that "<strong>Windows 10 on this device is activated with a digital entitlement</strong>". I want to know more detailed information about
 this <strong>Digital Entitlement</strong> .I'm scared that i've lost my original OEM product key.As per my knowledge OEM version product key is stored inside the BIOS chip.Then why my windows is activated with a digital entitlement instead of activated with
 a product key ? Please someone explain this.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;am not sure why we are receiving this code to the email address but this better be resolved quickly. I&nbsp;am sick and tired of calling and chatting to people who cannot help me. I&nbsp;am happy to post the email address and gamertag my sons uses. I can also supply the credit card details linked to the account&nbsp;and the Paypal account details we used to purchase Assassins Creed. I have the email confirmations and proof of purchase for all the products. I also have the Xbox One Device&nbsp;ID if you want that.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p>
</p>

<p>This issue has been ongoing since last Friday 1st September. Maybe the account was hacked, I really dont know but its not that hard to rectify the issue when we can supply all the account and&nbsp;payment information.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p>
</p>

<p>We have made a complaint and also lodged a complaint with the ombudsman about this. Can somebody contact us ASAP about this issue.</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>COD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            COD</h2>
                    
<p>For the last two days I have been playing black ops and an xbox party Saturday we had no issues at all, but suddenly we started getting kicked from the game and our party. It's now to the point where even our mikes are starting to break up and we are being
 backed out all the way to our dashboard. IT's not our connection since we have full signal and no other major electronics running we even shut off the connection to the computer, but still we keep getting disconnected or just plain kicked back to the lobby
 plus we've been running into a few modders lately, but that is handled through the xbox itself and not of any concern to me right now. Please help us straighten this out I'm almost to the point of not paying for xbox live and stop playing black ops.</p>

 Photoshop if the error message is to be believed. </p>

            <p>Yes. The work around is simple enough.</p>
<p>Visit NIK webpage and you will see that they have responded with a fix for all the unhappy campers.</p>
<p>You reinstall the version 1.105 of NIK by using the link they sent you by email after being taken over by Google&nbsp;for downloading the complete suite. If you don't still have that they have another suggestion.</p>

    <title>Expand the size of virtual hard disk in xp mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vk2506  say:</h3>
<h2>            Expand the size of virtual hard disk in xp mode</h2>
                    I use windows 7&nbsp;Ultimate. I have one virtual hard disk in my XP mode. The size of this virtual hard disk by default is created with a disk space of 127 GB.Can some one help me how i can expand this to 325 GB. I tried few things but it did not work.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) The expand command in diskpart.exe does not work, the error message is something like..make sure the disk is expandable. I&nbsp;shrink'ed&nbsp;the size of the hard disk to 90GB and did the same expand command and it worked but only gets expanded to 127 GB, but
 not beyond that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) I tried to create another VHD drive with dynamic mode, but &nbsp;during creation at the disk size allocation it says the drive will only be expandable to 127 GB. There is plenty of free space in the Physical hard drive...almost 650GB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3) I contacted Microsoft, but I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;think they attempt&nbsp;to solve with good knowledge. First&nbsp;response&nbsp;was &nbsp;to re-install the XP mode and you will get to define the disk space, but it never asked me to define the disk space during re-installation. The second
 response was&nbsp;completely&nbsp;wayward, they say you cannot have a virtual hard drive more than the size of 127GB which is completely oblivious.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can any one help. Currently I have one VHD drive, with 127GB and i want to make this 325GB. Actually I need all of this 325GB space in one drive and it&nbsp;can't&nbsp;be in multiple drives.In simple i want the Total disk size as 332800 MB. Please assist.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank You so much.....</div>

<h3> itr -admin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I use the Shutdown&#58; Clear virtual memory pagefile on my home business laptop running Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using the latest Win10 Anniversary upgrade and updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I use the Shutdown: Clear virtual memory pagefile on my home business laptop running Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having to manually clean my memory dozens of times an hour (no exaggeration) It is as though Windows does not ever release previously used memory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Lenovo G50-80 IdeaPad laptop with 8gb of physical memory, 8gb ready boost, and with system managed page files on automatic for three different drives. But it has gotten so bad, I am out of memory just on loading or restarting. &nbsp;Windows just
 doesn't seem to release memory at all for reuse. I have to do it manually and repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With every internet page I open I have to clear memory. Every time I close a page I have to clear the memory. It has become a nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the very best AV software, (individually not at the same time) and none find anything wrong like malware etc. &nbsp;My primary is Qihoo 360 Total Security - the best I have ever used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I am disabled and the Internet is my only way to access the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have read the same regarding spreading the pagefile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to replace hardware I would only do one at a time. Perhaps new hard drive first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final note have you ran&nbsp;a scan for corrupted files.</p>
<div>Method 1: <br />
System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</div>
<div>Run system file checker (SFC) and see if it helps. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not help, use method 2.</div>
<div>Method 2: </div>
<div><br />
Run DISM tool and check the issue. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</div>
<div>after the scan is complete type the following and press Enter.</div>

            <p>I would start by removing the ready boost drive and put the virtual memory file on the C:\ drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check on the Lenovo site and make sure you have the latest Lenovo drivers. Not using device manager but from the Lenovo site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try a scan with Malwarebytes free <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Does Microsoft have computer tech assistance for these kind of problems or must I find a private company to restore my computer to running smoothly and correctly?</p>

    <title>Elan Touchpad Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrfizzysodapop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elan Touchpad Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I'm asking this because I have not found a decent solution for my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabyte Laptop P35G v2 running Windows 8.1 64-bit pre-installed. 'ELAN input device' is what is coming up on my Device Manager, but only after I select 'hidden devices'. It does not show up normally. It does not show up under the ELAN device tab under mouse
 properties, and it does not show up as hardware under mouse properties either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully uninstalled the driver and reinstalled it. Nothing happened. When I select the device under Device Manager, I am informed that 'this device is not present, is not working properly, or does not have all its drivers installed. Error code 24.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't figure out pretty much anything, hoping that a more knowledgeable person can help. I'm leaning towards the idea that my touchpad is simply broken.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The touchpad may indeed be broken (have a hardware issue). Check with Gigabyte Support<br />
and/or a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service).<br />
Gigabyte Support<br />
<a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/support-downloads/technical-support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.gigabyte.com/support-downloads/technical-support.aspx</span></a><br />

<br />
These may help :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on TouchPad
<br />
- Driver's Tab - Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers), now RIGHT CLICK on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself <br />
(all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. This does not stop the touchpad
<br />
from working.<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista's is the same except
<br />
we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
Microsoft - Hardware and Drivers<br />

<h3> dont5  say:</h3>
<h2>            What To Do With Those Annoying DCOM Errors Event 10016</h2>
                    <p>It seems that there are a lot of users that are experiencing DistributedCOM error Event 10016 including me as my System Logs in the Event Viewer looks like a crime seen at times with all the red dots down the left side. I have racked my brain all across
 the net reading forums of different sites that claim to solve this problem by doing this and doing that. Well I have found the solution to them. The solution is to ignore them and leave them alone as trying to fix them will only cause more problems for your
 computer and some can be quite nasty. It is always wise that before you do anything to try and fix a problem on your computer especially one like this that involves the registry and changing permissions of a file you should create a system restore point. Restore
 points are your friend in getting out of trouble. Below is the Microsoft link concerning these DistributedCom errors&nbsp; that I ran across. It has helped me by putting my mind at rest concerning these annoying errors.</p>

            Exactly what it appears to be for me too. I have complained about this error to Microsoft in the feedback log many times. Evidently if one manages to fix it it is just suppressing the error as it will still happen but it will be like a domino effect and
 screw up something else. Thank for your reply. <br />

            <p>I went through Ms Podder's procedures but when I saw what the IE&nbsp;'Reset' option&nbsp;would do, I stopped short. I did go through the other suggested steps. I tried the update website again and&nbsp;copied what I'm still seeing. As before, there is no actual Info Bar
 on the Update page where the copied message appears, just this illustration:</p>

The website will not display correctly on your computer without this control. To install it:

<p>1. Right-click the Internet Explorer Information Bar. It's located just below the address bar.<br />

<p>POSTSCRIPT: I neglected to mention that this difficulty arose yesterday after I re-installed IE 8. The browser was running painfully slowly so did an uninstall leaving the one-use version with which I did the re-install of IE 8. The re-installed IE 8 is
 still almost as slow but otherwise behaves as expected.</p>

            <p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went in as you suggested and found that BOTH 'Allow active content...' options - yours re files, plus from CDs - were
<em>already selected</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used Windows Fix-it, installed Download Manager and&nbsp;ran the&nbsp;May 2013&nbsp;malicious software removal tool but whenever I return to the the Windows Update site, all I still see is the copied and pasted 'Install Active X control' message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's an Apple Store about 5 minutes from where I live.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I would like to get my PC running properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gord</p>

            <p>I have IE8 with XP and I have the same install active x issue as Gord. The Rt click option just under the address bar does not give the option to install active x control. An incidental observation: the bar under the address bar is the same color as the
 address bar and not the same color as shown in the examples given which are a dark blue.So how can I update my Microsoft Security settings if I&nbsp;do not have the active x option like the others?</p>

    <title>Everytime I wake up my computer, the clock is wrong - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Everytime I wake up my computer, the clock is wrong</h2>
                    <p>The reply does not solve my problem.<br />
I have an Apple desk top running OSX10 (Snow leopard) with Paralells allowing me to run Windows XP.<br />
The Apple clock is fine. the clock on the bottom right of the XP screen runs when the computer is active.<br />
I never switch it off (as per Apple instructions. I merely 'put it to sleep. so there is still power on.<br />
Everytime I wake it up the XP clock is wrong and sometimes by DAYS! it maintains the time and date of last usage.<br />
This makes a joke of my e-mails as some people get a reply before they have sent their message (according to the time on my clock).<br />
<br />
When I run Paretologic PC health advisor it usually puts it right but a few days later it fails again.<br />
So what do you suggest?<br />
Many thanks.<br />

            Because some moderator has split your question from another thread, it's difficult to determine what "reply" you mean.&nbsp; In the thread linked at the bottom of your post, you wrote that you were using a utility from Doug Knox's site and that your clock was
 keeping correct time.&nbsp; Is that not the case?<br />
<br />
The problem you have is that in your system, Windows is running in a virtual machine (Parallels).&nbsp; In this case, the usual response to incorrect clock time (i.e., replace your CMOS battery) doesn't apply because the virtual machine doesn't rely on the CMOS
 clock in the same way that a non-virtual operating system does.<br />
<br />
The following paper is written about VMware -- not Parallels -- but if you read the first two pages of text (pages 3-4), you'll get an idea of what the cause of your problem is likely to be:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/Timekeeping-In-VirtualMachines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/Timekeeping-In-VirtualMachines.pdf</a><br />
<br />
If you want a more definitive answer, I suggest that you ask in the <a href="http://forum.parallels.com/forumdisplay.php?f=60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Parallels forum</a>.&nbsp; Be sure to provide the versions of all software (e.g., your Mac OS, Windows XP, and Parallels)<br />
<br />
[Edit] <br />
<br />
In a quick look in the Parallels forums, I noticed that some versions of Parallels seem to have a problem keeping the Windows clock properly synchronized.&nbsp; See

I do wish these Moderators would not do that sort of thing.<br />
The reply that was of no help was the one from Microsoft<br />
The reply that WAS of use was the one containing Doug Knox's URL was the one that cracked it!<br />
So all appears to be sorted. Tahnks for your input.<br />
Cheers.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My fault I am afraid. I wish I hadn't requested the split now. 'Split' doesn't mean what I thought it did. I just wanted things to be 'cleaner' and it seems that in requesting that to happen, the waters have become muddied.</p>
<p>In future, to avoid this sort of thing you would probably be better off raising your own question rather than appending to someone else's thread.</p>
<p>The original poster had probably given up and I just assumed when I saw your reply you were the 'OP'. I also didn't catch just how old the original question was.</p>
<p>Apologies to you and LemP for my lack of observation.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>
