<h2>            How to turn off Autocomplete in Outlook &#38; Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Particularly looking to disable date autocomplete which is making a right mess of my documents but very happy to disable all autocomplete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the new "quicktext" section but there's no option there to disable it.&nbsp; I thought of jus deleting all its contents but that doesn't seem to be an option either and in any event I can't find the bit that does the date autocomplete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Evan</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Raju,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the reply, that's great for Word :-)&nbsp;but the Outlook article only seems to relate to the e-mail autocomplete.&nbsp; It's the e-mail text editing autocomplete I'd like to disable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>E-mail address format is universal around the world, date formats are not.&nbsp; Suggesting autocompletions for e-mail addresses is probably helpful for most people but the suggested autocompletion
 for dates is almost certainly wrong for the vast majority of users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even where the localisation settings are correct the date format in autocomplete often deviates from that in common usage.&nbsp; Furthermore there are many issues such as corporate policy, personal
 preference or tone of message that all dictate the format of a date.&nbsp;I may use a short form when writing an informal note about a meeting next week, or a long form about a meeting at some further point.&nbsp; I use shorthand (eg "1st Sept") when speaking with friends
 or close colleagues.&nbsp; The date autocomplete does not (and can not) recognise these subtleties.&nbsp; Moreover the suggested format that it uses is one that I never use.&nbsp; I</span><span>n other words, autocomplete
 for the date is /always/ wrong for me an as far as I can tell, most other people too.&nbsp; And becuase it happens by default when you press return as part of normal tying rather than having to opt-in to it you get extra, incorrect, dates strewn across your document
 which you then have to go back abd remove.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What's mystifying me, and apologies as this is probably really obvious, is that if Word is being used as Outlook's composition editor, why aren't the Word settings persisting into Outlook?&nbsp; So
 now I've turned off the autosomplete in Word and I can now write dates again, how is it that that e-mails still have the date autocomplete running?&nbsp; Is there a box somewhere I should have ticked to use Word as the e-mail editor?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many thanks again for your time &amp; trouble,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Evan</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2010 doesn't use Word as e-mail editor. It uses a subset of Word to provide a Word-like environment, but in essence it is a separate application.</p>

            <p>Oh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link :-)&nbsp; Looked at the other thread, which has left me&nbsp;even&nbsp;more lost in France.&nbsp; If I've got the right end of the stick: the autocomplete date only autocompletes correctly for the USA date format; cannot be turned off without turning off
 all autocompletes; and cannot be modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So given that there must be /some/ people in the USA that don't use the full format every time the following sentence is probably valid: "date autocomplete is useful for some Americans but a nuisance for everyone else in the world and also for some other
 Americans".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of the above is true, which I'm having some difficulty believing, why would any sane product manager persist with it when all it can do is irritate the vast majority of customers?&nbsp; Very strange.</p>

            <p>Using Outlook 2010, as part of the Office suite, I have no problem in typing 1st Sept it doesn't revert to September, unless I follow the tool-tip suggestion and use the Enter key</p>
<p>I have no problems with other date formats I use from time to time - no date is auto completed, unless I accept the prompt.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com - Sharing - Missing function &#34;Can view when I&#39;m busy&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few months ago I shared my calendar with my friends. I set them all as "Can view when I'm busy". Today I wanted to add two additional friends and I found out, that only possibilities which are available are "Can view" and "Can edit". Where are the rest of
 possibilities?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also your article at https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-your-calendar-in-Outlook-com-0fc1cb48-569d-4d1e-ac20-5a9b3f5e6ff2 is telling how to share your calendar. Is something wrong with my calendar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with customer support which tried to help me even over remote control, but without any success.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Tomas,<br />
<br />
With the new Outlook.com there are changes made to the interface and its usage like the Focused and Others inbox. Regarding your concern, it turns out that the other option when sharing a calendar is no longer available after validating this to our end. But
 we would appreciate if you will raise this to our Outlook team as a feedback using our
<strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook feedback</a></strong> page so that we improve the usage of Outlook.com to our valued customers.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<p>Dear Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as you asked. Still I wonder why you guys (Microsoft) decided to remove those options and I didn't found any reasonable answer for it. Hopefully, somebody will be able to tell me that reason.</p>

<h2>            I would like to extract all sentences with a particular piece of text</h2>
                    I have a long Word document, and I am only interested in looking at the sentences with a particular phrase. I'd like to paste them all into another document, or just cut everything besides those portions and save as a new version. I could just do a Find
 for the text and MANUALLY copy those sentences, but we're talking about hundreds of them. Any way to automate this? It doesn't need to be EXACTLY a sentence - 50 characters before and after the phrase would work. Anything that cuts down the document to a&nbsp;manageable&nbsp;size.
 Thanks!

            This is the search:
<div><br />
<div><b>[\^13 ][A-Z][!.]@YOUR EXACT PHRASE HERE[!.]@[.\^13]</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>It will look for:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>[either of these] (the sequence between brackets means "either") a Carriage Return (written "\^13") or a space (it appears right after the "13")</li><li>followed by an upper case letter (either A, B, ... or Z, written "A-Z" to denote a range)</li><li>followed by NOT (!) a period (.), appearing "one or more times" (indicated by "@"); this will match any sequence of characters before&nbsp;the phrase</li><li>followed by the phrase (exactly written, as wildcard searches require matching upper/lower case)</li><li>followed by anything that is NOT a period, one or more times; this will match any sequence of characters until the end of the sentence, denoted byâ€¦</li><li>either a period or a Carriage Return</li></ol>
<div>Thus, that sequence will find these cases (where "Â¶" is the preceding Return):</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Â¶Start of sentence PHRASE continuation of sentence. â€“ This would be the first sentence in a paragraph</li><li>Â¶Start of sentence PHRASE continuation of sentenceÂ¶ â€“ This would be a title with no trailing period</li><li>&nbsp;Start of sentence PHRASE continuation of sentence. â€“ Because of the leading space, this would be any sentence in a paragraph, except the first</li><li>&nbsp;Start of sentence PHRASE continuation of sentenceÂ¶ â€“ Again, a leading space but no trailing period (could be an error, but it's found anyway)</li></ol>
<div>Because of the structure&nbsp;assumed by the search&nbsp;(namely that there should be text before and text after PHRASE), there are instances that it will not find (like&nbsp;"PHRASE continuation of sentence" or "Start of sentence PHRASE"), but you can find them if you
 force the search to comply with the assumed structure (use "HRASE continuation of sentence" or "Start of sentence PHRAS"). And there is que question of leading tabs, which were not considered.</div>

<p>I tend to agree with Linley in deleting the partnership (I would delete it on both the device and PC), soft reset your device, reboot the PC and connect again to establish a new partnership.</p>

<p>To be honest, I might strongly consider doing a Hard Reset but see if this works.&nbsp;</p>

I suggest you delete the partnership on your device and computer. Reboot both and connect the device again to create a new one. Before you do this, I recommend you make sure you have a good backup.

<h2>            Office 2016... Outlook will not open signatures or stationary buttons for editing.</h2>
                    <p>I have looked all over the internet for solutions... same registry edit suggestion, but it doesn't help... doesn't fix the problem... my thinking is, if the registry edit was supposed to be the simple fix for it, why wouldn't Microsoft create to Mr. Fix-It
 for it?</p>
<p>I've tried all suggestions and can't seem to find the fix...</p>
<p>uninstalled and reinstalled... removed my virus protection... disabled any and all add ins (there were none)... Outlook will NOT open the signatures button for editing email signatures...</p>
<p>I've also tried outlook in safe mode... not go there.</p>
<p>I also tried creating a new outlook profile...&nbsp;that didn't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also built a whole new windows profile... it worked for a day... then it broke... SMH</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person I am trying to help is the owner of my company... for goodness sakes Microsoft, HELP ME!</p>

<p>
</p><p>This microsoft support article fixed our problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>apparently the new computer came with "microsoft office desktop apps"... the registry configurations are similar to what we installed as office 365 click to run... the registry confusion caused anything user profile related to not work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>following the directions in the link, and removing what was needed to be removed... solved our problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all that you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; we are a small company who have a hosted exchange service through Rackspace (a provider)... our support funnels through them first... Rackspace got Microsoft involved... notice the date on the graphics and the "updated" date...&nbsp; within the last couple
 to few weeks... that has been all the time frame they have been involved... finally, Microsoft published a fix for this issue.</p>

Thanks for your understanding.<br />

<h3> lann094  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 causes all windows to be blacked out</h2>
                    I have been suffering from quite a specific problem, and searching for it is near-impossible, so I hope no other thread exists for this problem.<br />
<br />
For some time, seemingly randomly, upon opening Outlook 2013 I will be met with this result:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8373823-ccc8-4e77-8b34-e696e295579a" /><br />
<br />
Initially, the outlook window is blacked out as shown. However, as I begin to return to other windows on my computer, they are also blacked out in the same fashion. It seems to only affect windows that use aero (or whatever it's now known as), and also any
 context menu boxes (right clicks) for seemingly any situation. The only method I have found to resolve this is to restart my computer.<br />
<br />
It would be great if I could get some guidance on how to resolve this.<br />
<br />
System Specs:<br />
Windows 8.1 x64 (Also occurred on Windows 8)<br />
Office 2013 Student Edition (I think... The one given to tertiary institution students at discount price)<br />
Intel Core i7 950 @ 3.9GHz<br />
Nvidia GTX 680 (Latest video drivers, has been occurring over multiple versions)<br />
6GB RAM<br />

    <title>How to install the Italian dictionary for spell checking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sstraveler  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to install the Italian dictionary for spell checking</h2>
                    In Word 2010 I have documents where I have set the default language to Italian and I would like to spell check them in Italian.<br />
<br />
It told me that the Italian dictionary was not installed and sent me to the download page where I selected Italian and downloaded the file and ran the set up.&nbsp; I clicked the license box and it said in Italian the instal was complete.&nbsp; I restarted Word 2010
 and it still says the Italian dictionary is not installed.&nbsp; And it sends me in a loop back to the download center.<br />
<br />
I checked my downloaded files and the Italian is still in Downloads and I have run the install more than once.<br />
<br />
How do I get it into Word 2010 so that I can spell check my Italian documents in Italian not English?<br />
<br />
Grazie ..... Thank you.<br />

            What did you download, exactly? Note that for Office 2010, you will have to purchase a language pack. See

            I just took another look and I realized when I go the Language Preferences option in 2010 and click the not installed it actually takes me to a page for Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess only 2013 has a free proofing option in a foreign language?&nbsp;

            Actually, sorry SS Traveler, I forgot to mention that if you want the Italian dictionary for spell checking on any Microsoft Office Module 2010 (I mention 2010 because it's the one I have, but obviuosly I assume any version before) you have to pay the
 ASTRONOMIC RIP-OFF amount of 25 $, or psycologically meaningfully 24.95!

<p>Hi Kdarts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested the issue using OneNote 16.14.1 on Mac and the command + F searching feature is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to follow the suggestions below to see the result.</p>
<p>1. Try to&nbsp;Use <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> to see if the shortcut command works.</p>
<p>2. Please try to create a new User Profile on your Mac computer according to this
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>Then please check if you are able to work normally with the command + F in OneNote in the new profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand your situation and provide help for you, please confirm the information below:</p>
<p>1. Provide your Office version according to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19#ID0EBCAAA=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What version of
 Office am I using?</a></p>
<p>2. Could you please capture some screenshots related with the issue to share with us?</p>
<p>3. Do all the shortcut commands not work? For example, command + C/ +V/ +X.</p>

<p>Hi Kdarts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't happen in safe mode, you can restart your Mac without pressing any keys to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't come back, it was probably caused by a cache or directory issue with your startup disk, which safe mode fixed. If the issue persists after you restart your Mac, please let us know and we will provide further help for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Gloria, I am having the same issue this time, except now the issue wasn't resolved from Safe Mode.&nbsp;<br />
I've taken some screen shots for you. <br />
My command + F works in OneNote, except it is only finding what I have typed, not my lectures slides, whereas usually it picks up on my lecture slides.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc0a7809-1f8b-4f50-bba7-c0651c9dafb4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc0a7809-1f8b-4f50-bba7-c0651c9dafb4?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6308a0ad-456e-42f1-8a01-f29e6f472f48?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6308a0ad-456e-42f1-8a01-f29e6f472f48?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ac51924-a4a8-48cf-852f-1492d1c64d15?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ac51924-a4a8-48cf-852f-1492d1c64d15?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi Kdarts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to confirm how did you insert the PowerPoint slide.</p>
<p>Please share your steps with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, I can only insert PDF Printout in OneNote 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>I save a PowerPoint document as PDF and insert it in OneNote using the "PDF Printout" in Insert tab.</p>
<p>When I press command + F and do the searching, I cannot search for the content in the PDF file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<h2>            DX12 and Multiadapter testing</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway for me to test this capability of DX12? Its the capability to allow the integrated graphics to be used unison with the discrete card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked here:&nbsp;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/directx/archive/2015/05/01/directx-12-multiadapter-lighting-up-dormant-silicon-and-making-it-work-for-you.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Unreal Engine 4 and the Demo they used, however I wasn't able to enable the multi-adapter feature. I heard that they modified the demo. Any idea how they got it to work or how I can?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ShaikShayan,</p>
<p><em>Question 1.the differences between connection filter &amp; Spam filter on EOP.</em></p>
<p>These two tools using different conditions to block spams. For example: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200718(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connection filter</a> uses IPs. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/jj200684(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Spam filter</a> includes domains, email address allows list and languages.</p>
<p>Actually, you can use transport rules to block spams as well depending on conditions.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p><br />
<em>Question 2.I have third party anti-spam filter engine &amp; planning to set the EOP as my MX Record &amp; I see we have so many Domains which are whitelisted &amp; block listed, I would like to import all the domains on EOP , can you please help if I can add bulk domains
 to EOP?</em></p>
<p>The answer is no. it is not feasible to bulk domains to EOP. You need to add them manually. However, you can type in multiple domains in spam filter at&nbsp;the same time and save it.&nbsp;Given the situation, would you mind submitting

<p><span><span><strong>Method 3: </strong><strong><span>Manually reset the Windows Updates Components</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to manually reset the Windows Updates Components. Resetting Windows update components diagnoses and fixes problems with Windows Update. Refer the steps below to Reset Windows update components:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>&nbsp;on the keyboard and then select â€œCommand Prompt (Admin)â€ from the menu.</span></li><li><span>Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services.

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Now rename the&nbsp;<strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Catroot2</strong>&nbsp;folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the â€œENTERâ€ key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Now, letâ€™s restart the&nbsp;<strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the&nbsp;<strong>ENTER</strong>&nbsp;key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Type&nbsp;<strong>Exit&nbsp;</strong>in the&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>&nbsp;to close it.</span></span></p>
<p>

            Hi Bradley,<br />
<br />
According to your description, I have the following understanding:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You are using <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App (OWA)</a> in your Mac.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You want to set up your admin (here we can call your admin a delegate) to send the Skype meeting (online meeting) on your behalf.
<br />
<br />
Please clarify it with more details if anything is misunderstood; if it is the case, you can try referring to
<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2013/09/04/configuring-delegate-access-in-outlook-web-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            2014 IRS W-2 Template for Excel</h2>
                    <p>[EDIT: Jan 2, 2014] The files now support both a 4-per-sheet and 2-per-sheet W2 layout!&nbsp; Samples of each are available also.&nbsp; All links have been updated below.</p>
<p>[EDIT: Jan 12, 2014] An error in processing Block 12b-d entries has been corrected.&nbsp; Same link.&nbsp; A separate version has also been prepared for use with the forms as the IRS provides them where the information for 2 individuals is printed on one physical
 sheet.&nbsp; New links below.</p>
<p>[EDIT: Jan 15, 2014] Error in processing the 2nd line (2nd state) in blocks 15:20 of the 2-Up forms corrected.&nbsp; Revised files uploaded - same links.</p>
<p>[EDIT: Jan 23, 2014] 2-Up versions - changed instructions to clarify employer name &amp; address entries.</p>
<p>[EDIT: Jan 24, 2014] All Versions: cleanup of some formulas to help&nbsp;prevent displaying 0 when source data is empty.&nbsp; 'For IRS Provided Forms" version now only requires Employer information to be entered once, not on&nbsp;each line.</p>
<p>************************************************************</p>
<p><strong>Edit Jan 27, 2014</strong>&nbsp; An all-in-one version has been uploaded, that provides output to IRS provided 2-up W-2 forms, non-IRS provided 2-up forms and non-IRS provided 4-up forms.&nbsp; Additionally, this version provides completion assistance for
 W-3 forms using the IRS provided form.&nbsp; It includes links to relevant IRS documents for W-2/W-3 preparation and to the sample [not for final product] forms files to use while adjusting printer alignment.&nbsp; Enjoy!&nbsp; A little late for this year, but could possibly
 still be useful next year as long as the IRS doesn't change anything except the year of the forms:</p>

<p>The previous versions, available with links below, have been left in place.</p>
<p>************************************************************</p>
<p>Last year there were some people seeking an Excel workbook to use to print W-2 forms from.&nbsp; I built one and some 1,800+ people found it and downloaded it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've altered it a bit to hopefully make it a touch more friendly, but the basics are still the same.&nbsp; Anyone without accounting/personnel system software that can print W-2's is certainly welcome to this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: the layout of the W-2 has not changed since 2013, just the date at the bottom of the form.&nbsp; So if you're one of the 1,800+ that have last year's model and have it already 'tuned' to your printer, you should already be good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: These two files will print information for 1 individual in both the upper half and lower half of the 2-up form such as you might acquire from an office supply house like Staples.</p>
<p>You can grab the macro-enabled, Excel 2007/2010/2013 compatible version from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/e0eeko96m8k1kvf/W2-2014.xlsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/download/e0eeko96m8k1kvf/W2-2014.xlsm</a></p>
<p>An Excel 97-2003 compatible copy of it is available here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/k9sk8kv5s5x52of/W2-2014.xlsï»¿" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/view/k9sk8kv5s5x52of/W2-2014.xls</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>ADDED These versions will print the information for 2 individuals per sheet on forms such as are provided by the IRS:</p>
<p>Macro-enabled Excel 2007/2010/2013 compatible version:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/066cf6ggx3ae1md/W2-2014_For_IRS_Provided_2up_Forms.xlsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/download/066cf6ggx3ae1md/W2-2014_For_IRS_Provided_2up_Forms.xlsm</a></p>
<p>And the Excel 97-2003 compatible version of this version:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/15qk1mfnf25mqi8/W2-2014_For_IRS_Provided_2up_Forms.xls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/view/15qk1mfnf25mqi8/W2-2014_For_IRS_Provided_2up_Forms.xls</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the vagaries in printers (sheet feeding and the way their drivers render sheets) it will probably be required that you adjust the layout of one of the sheets to print on W-2's run through your printer.&nbsp; Rather than making you waste the real thing,
 here is a scanned copy of the 2014 4-Up layout that these files are set up to print.&nbsp; You can print several copies of this Adobe Acrobat PDF file and use them to get the alignment correct before printing the real forms:</p>

<p>My heavens!</p>

</p><p>And the really scary thing is that I see references to like "Line 437" and "Line 207" - I do not even want to look at your actual tax filing form!!</p>

</p><p>I might toy with it, but no promises.&nbsp; One thing I see right away is that you would almost have to use merged cells to get the positioning of entries correct.&nbsp; Perhaps not, but it might be necessary - but then that would be my problem and not the end user's.&nbsp;

            <p>Right now I have a report of a problem with 4-line addresses in one section so I'm looking into that - turns out it works as designed, but instructions for completing the Employer name and address entries were not clear - new version uploaded to hopefully
 overcome that shortfall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing to remember is to return to this discussion and download the latest version of any of the files from above just before doing a production run&nbsp;- although that may cause you to have to realign the forms to your printer again.&nbsp; When I update/fix problems,
 I simply upload and overwrite the previous file so that the link stays the same, but only my [Edit] comments above give a clue as to the status of the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am glad that these are filling needs for people.&nbsp; I'm looking into some of the 1099's (-R and -Misc) and possibly W-3 and 1096 - but that might not happen in time for this year's filings.&nbsp; But we'd be pretty much ready to go next year!</p>

            THANK YOU!!!!! &nbsp;1099 Misc , 1096 and W3 greatly appreciated! &nbsp;I've done the trial and error guess where the boxes will land method in Excel and it is so frustrating. &nbsp;Successfully linked &nbsp;my Quickbooks data &nbsp;to employee data sheet- no more laborious typing.

            <p>No promises on the 1099/W-3's - it actually pretty much depends on what else comes up this weekend.&nbsp; I've got a couple of other projects already in progress, and need to get those out of the way before jumping on something new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, I kind of have to play that same guessing game initially at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some semi-humor before leaving: W-2 printing took place at my day job today.&nbsp; They use the 4-up format of the W-2 with dedicated software that's supposed to know where to put stuff.&nbsp; Took them about half-a-dozen trial runs to get the forms to run through
 the printer and print/align properly.&nbsp; First run: oops! upside down!&nbsp; But eventually they did get done.&nbsp; Same printer we used last year :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>LATE NOTE: I've gotten some feedback from a few users who have let me know that it worked for them "right out of the box" when they were printing on an HP LaserJet printer.&nbsp; The printout design I did on all of this was done using an HP LaserJet 200.&nbsp; Other
 users,&nbsp;printers unspecified, have noted that the alignment wasn't as good out of the box - one user even reporting that on a 2-up output, the top half printed fine, but bottom half had crept up (printing too low in that section).&nbsp; Most definitely a YMMV situation
 here.</p>

<h2>            IE pop-up &#58; not responding</h2>
                    <p>We are hosting an application on IE with around 1000 users logging in on daily basis. We recently shifted from Firefox to IE. From the very first day, we have started getting 'Server(domain name) not responding' pop-up, which comes with a recover web-page
 option. As there are multiple users, it's difficult to train them not to use 'recover web page' and wait until system becomes ready again , because of which application gets re-loaded for most of them and results in session already existing message. is there
 a way to disable these pop-ups at IE level ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on how the 'website' has been programmed.... and which IE security zone (File&gt;properties) your company network maps the host to...</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE11 has ActiveX filtering (blocking of Flash and Java JRT runtime ActiveX controls).... other browsers do not... a common reason why a website displays the 'not responding... long running script' is because it uses Flash or another ActiveX control, that
 is either blocked by the security zone settings or the ActiveX filter settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Possible, include links to problem websites with your questions, so we can visit and test them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is an internal company website (intranet), mention as such in your question, and</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use the File&gt;Properties menu in IE to confirm that it is mapped to the IE 'Intranet' security zone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Use the f12&gt;Emulation tab, to determine which Emulation mode your internal (legacy) website is using and how it was established... eg. IE Enterprise Mode (IE8), Enterprise site mode lists.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If your internal website is currently using IE11 (Edge) emulation mode, you may have to use your company's Enterprise Site Mode lists to force it to use IE10 emulation mode or lower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first instance consult with your company's IT department, to confirm the Group Policy settings and Enterprise Site Mode lists for the legacy host (server).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are consumer support forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. We can block pop-up in IE11. But users have to manually do it on their machine by following way as this settings are for clients.&nbsp;</p>
