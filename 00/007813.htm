<h2>            Going from Office 2003 to office 2010</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know what do I need to do to install office 2003 to office 2010. I have a large amount of data which I do not wish to lose. How should I go about especially outlook as I have years of important emails which I do not want to lose. Will outlook
 2010 automatically pick up the office 2003 data or do I have to export and import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Your data/docs is not affected by an Office uninstall, but in any case your data is backed up to external isn't it.</p>
<p>Depends on the type of mail account you were using if pop mail simply install 2010 which will upgrade 2003.</p>
<p>No Import/Export required</p>
<p>If your data is not backed up you will at some stage lose it.</p>

            <p>You don't have to do anything special, just install 2010.&nbsp; When you install 2010, by default it will uninstall 2003. But, you do have the option of doing a "custom" install. You can specify a separate install location.&nbsp; Some people (myself included) like
 to keep the old version around until you are comfortable with the new one.&nbsp; If you want to do that, there are a couple of extra steps you will have to take to make running both painless.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you install new versions Office automatically picks up on existing configuration files (like normal.DOT and Outlook.PST) and registry settings.&nbsp; Actually, the same applies if you uninstall Office using the control panel.&nbsp; That type of uninstall leaves
 behind setting files like normal.dot and configuration registry entries that are picked up during the re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Palcouk made a good point. When making significant changes to your system, like installing new software (and ESPECIALLY when upgrading Windows!) it is a good idea to create a full image copy backup of your system BEFORE making the change. That way you have
 a known good backout point. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to take the short way out, for outlook, you could simply copy the PST file to a new location.

            <p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My data is not backed up to external recently. I do a back up every so often.<br />
Yes it includes outlook.</p>
<p>I am using pop mail.&nbsp;<br />
Could you give me a step by step installation as I do not quite understand how 2010 will automatically install everything from 2003. The emails etc are all in different folders not just Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanky for your time.</p>

</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>What tool will you use?</strong></p>
<p>By the time they got to Win 7, MS finally figured out how to create a reasonable backup tool.&nbsp; So it is not unreasonable to use the Win 7 backup feature.&nbsp; Personally I prefer to use some of the freeware backup tools. You also have the option of paying for
 a 3rd party tool to get more features and "free" support from the maker.</p>

<p><span>Good article, I (Rohn007) have used earlier versions of this product and was happy with it. It includes the tool you need to make a bootable recovery DVD disk. This is exactly what you need to recover from a “BAD” WIN 10 “upgrade”.<span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>What Features do I look for in a Backup Tool</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Image copy backup </strong>- create a "snapshot" of your entire system at a given point in time. When you restore an image copy backup you have a working system from that point in time. These backups are relatively large and time consuming.&nbsp; If
 there is an option to compress the backup file I select max compression. It adds a little time to backup, but saves a lot of space on the backup drive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Incremental Backup - </strong>identifies files that have been changed since the last image or incremental backup and only save them.&nbsp; Much faster than image copy backup. During a restore is used in conjunction with prior image copy backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. Backup to external storage - </strong>no longer much of an issue (was in the past). But it is important to be able to save your backup files to a drive other than the HD you are backing up.&nbsp; If that HD dies, you don't want your backup files on
 it too.&nbsp; A few years ago you could reasonably backup to DVDs (and before that to CD and "floppy" disks), but now given average HD size you can only reasonably backup to an external USB type drive.&nbsp; This year you can buy between 4 to 8 TB external HDs for under
 US$300, even 1 TB drives are now under US$100. 1TB is now the minimum I'd suggest for image backup storage. It gives you enough room to save several backups.&nbsp; The beauty of doing any backup to a large, 1TB or more, USB drive is that you can start and forget
 it until it is done.&nbsp; In the past, using Floppies or CDs, you could be stuck at the machine for hours, feeding up to 40 disks to the machine to capture all of the backup. That was a real PITA, and a major reason why the average user never got into the habit
 of doing backups. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. Bootable recovery disk/usb - </strong>In some situations Windows is still working so you can start the recovery from inside of Windows. But in the WORST CASE Windows won't run so you have to have a bootable DVD, or USB, with the recovery program
 on it.&nbsp; From inside Windows, you can create a recovery disk and from most current backup programs you can do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. Selective file Recovery</strong> - while doing your recovery from image copies is the main feature you are looking for, it is more often useful to be able to look at your backup and extract individual files or folders that you want to recover.
 Say a file has been "lost", accidentally deleted or corrupted, then it is nice to be able to go into a backup and at least restore a slightly older version so that you don't have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Backup Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Backup strategies are defined by how much file change is happening on your system AND how important the data/files are to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">A "full" image copy backup </p>
<p>requires more time to create, and to restore and more HD space. But it is also the easiest to restore.&nbsp; Used for starting point of future recoveries, used for systems with much file change happening on them (ie after Windows Updates...).
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Incremental Backup</p>
<p>require less time to create and restore, and less HD space.&nbsp; Useful when you know there is not much file change happening on the system but you want/need to make sure the changes are not lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">A General strategy I've used - Weekly backups</p>
<p>On a typical home system, where there isn't really much file change happening, I like to do an image copy once a month, followed by weekly incremental backups. The key question is when to do the full backup. Do you do it before the monthly Windows Updates,
 or after?&nbsp; It depends on how optimistic/pessimistic you are.&nbsp; If you believe MS is good at doing update, then you probably want to schedule the image copy after Windows updates are applied. That way you have a known good point to return to including the latest
 updates.&nbsp; If you are are a realist/pessimist, you do the image copy BEFORE Windows updates are applied. On the assumption that MS is going to F'up and you will need to restore back to a working system without the updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since these backups take time, I find it easiest to schedule them on the weekend at night, when I'm less likely to be using the machine.&nbsp; So, on the first weekend of the month I do the full image copy (right before "Update Tuesday"), then the other 3 (or
 sometimes 4) weekends I do incremental backups. </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Optional Strategy </p>
<p>Given the relatively large HD sizes we now have to work with I have also adopted a secondary strategy. I take the C: drive and shrink it, then create a separate D: partition for my data files.&nbsp; C: contains Windows and installed applications.&nbsp; It is relatively
 static, for the most part the only changes are due to Windows Updates. And occasionally installing applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; With this approach, you could even get away with only doing monthly backups of the C: drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the D: data "partition" / drive contains all
 of your personal data files.&nbsp; I also move the C:\Users folder to the data drive because it contains most of the file change happening on your system.&nbsp; So now you have all of the file change happening in an easy to identify location, that is much smaller that
 your full drive.&nbsp; It is now easier and faster to run more frequent backups, full or incremental, on just the D: drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an additional benefit from creating a separate Data drive.&nbsp; If you do have to restore Windows for any reason, you no longer have to worry about losing your personal data files. They are no longer on the C: drive!
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>"Ideal" Backup System</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1980's a computing pioneer defined an Ideal backup system using the mnemonic "3-2-1", a play on the popular "1-2-3 Lotus Spreadsheet" program (that essentially drove the creation of PC computing in business).</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>at least 3 copies of any file,
</span></li><li><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>at least 2 different storage mediums (say on your hard drive plus at least one of the following: thumb drive, DVD or the cloud),
</span></li><li><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>at least 1 copy offsite -- in case of fire etc!&nbsp; (ie the “cloud” meets this requirement, so does using a thumb drive moved to a different building, or a server in a different building)</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Gibson </span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>PS: yes “correct” the plural of medium is media, but I don’t speak latin! &lt;grin&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>You can do your backups manually or make use of automated tools.&nbsp; A strategy I have used is timed backups during the editing session (5 minute). Then the final end of day save is copied to second medium. I rotate the “second” medium with an
 Offsite copy.&nbsp; Once a week I go in and clean up the 5 minute incremental backups to keep just the end of day copy (to free up space!)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have used the “autohistory” tool at codeplex. It is easy to use, but like any automated process it uses up a lot of space.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, although Office apps have been around since the the mid 1980’s, MS has not figured out that we need a good “Autosave” backup feature. In the past there was a “versions” feature in some office apps, but it only kept incremental copies
 of files, not full files. Win7 has a file “versions” feature, but it is tied into “System Recovery Points”. Not very useful.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following links tell how to setup macros that run automatically and use SAVEAS to save full copies of the file with the date/time included in the file name. You have to manually delete the “extra” backup files, but you control the process rather
 than Windows or Office. It is a bit more work, but I find it worth it for very important files that are changing frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exception: the Windows 8/10 "File History" feature now takes care responsibility for of making frequent file backups of data files away from the applications and moves it into Windows.
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Windows 8 / 8.1 and 10 have done a great deal to improve the Windows backup system. Using native features in those versions of Windows, even 'normal' home users can setup an "ideal" backup system that meets the 3-2-1 rule.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; If you have any further specific questions, feel free to ask.

<p><strong>Note 1: </strong>these Dual Install instructions specifically apply to 2013 and earlier. I am no longer sure of the specifics required to run 2016 and earlier versions. These instructions may work with 2016 after making some minor tweaks. I am waiting
 for confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2: </strong>These instructions do NOT apply to OUTLOOK. These instructions assume you only have one version of Outlook installed. This is due to the specific issues raised by the Outlook.PST file.

<p>This tip describes the specific steps and choices during the 2010 custom install. After you have the multiple versions installed you still have some additional steps to do. They are described in this tip:</p>

</span></p>
<p>With multiple versions installed, there is one issue you can’t avoid, Default Windows File Associations. Only one app can be used to open the files by double clicking in Windows Explorer. You have to pick which one.</p>
<p>FYI: NoReReg key works with Office 2010 / 2013 installed on Windows 7 and 8 (I tested it myself Rohn007)</p>
<p>Note: in user accounts, when you log in to do the NoReReg hacks, DO NOT start REGEDIT using “Run As Admin”. You will be editing the wrong “Current User” key &lt;grin&gt;</p>

<p>Look at the event handler for error messages. In one case it was showing an error that
<span>HKLM/Software/Classes/.msg </span>could not be accessed.</p>
<p>This is how I fixed it:</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span>Using Regedit navigate to the reg key identified in the error</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span>Then select the “Owner” tab,</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

</span>Open Regedit again</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span>locate the same Classes/.msg key.&nbsp; You should now see a number of sub keys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there is no error message, ie normal operations try adding the NoReReg key</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Manual method:</strong></p>
<p>Before you close up shop and start working on this reg fix, open the version of Word that you will want to be your default. In other words, say you have two versions of Word on your system. You want to use 2007, but you want 2003 to be the version
 that opens by default when you click on a DOC file. Open Word 2003 before you insert the fix below. This will ensure that Word 2003 is the last version opened and it will, if necessary, reset the registry to that version. (More on getting around this default
 in the next section.) </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Now make sure Word (office apps) is closed </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Start regedit<span>&nbsp; </span>&lt;Win<span>&nbsp; </span>R&gt; and type REGEDIT</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Note that if this doesn’t do anything, you’re using a system where the administrator has taken away your ability to edit the registry so you don’t mess it up!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Once within the registry, click the + (plus sign) to expand the <span>
/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/ </span>folder. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Scroll down and locate the <span>/Software/</span> folder and expand that one. We have a long journey ahead, so hang in there!
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Once within the Software folder, scroll down that branch of the folder tree until you find the folder for
<span>/Microsoft/</span>. Click the + to expand that one.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Now scroll down to locate the <span>/Office/</span> folder.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>There you’ll see the numbered versions of the Office versions you have:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>2013 is 15.0</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>2010 is 14.0</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>2007 is 12.0</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>2003 is 11.0</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>2002 is 10.0e. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>This fix can be used for all recent versions. Or at least, I know it works as far back as 2000. I can’t confirm anything earlier. But if you’re still using a version older than 2000, speed is obviously not an issue for you!&lt;grin&gt; Expand the folder
 for the version you want to speed up. (Note, this speed up fix will only help you if you are running multiple versions. So if you only have one version of Office on your system. Don’t bother with this setting, as it won’t do anything for you.)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Move to the <span>/Word/ </span>folder and expand that. Almost there!
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Okay, locate the <span>/Options/ </span>folder and select that one. This is the folder where you’ll be adding a new registry key.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>With the Options folder selected in the route we took above, click Edit &gt; New &gt; DWORD Value
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>This will insert a new registry key into the Options folder. It will be highlighted in edit mode so you can go right ahead and start typing the name of this key:
<span>NoReReg</span> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Hit the Enter key after typing the name to have the name accepted. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>Now double click this new key to open it. The Value data will read 0 (zero) by default. Change that setting to the number 1
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>·<span>
</span></span>click OK to accept that value. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Then close the registry. You did it!</p>
<p>So what is it that you’ve done? Well, you went into the Word registry settings for the version of Word you selected and you set a new registry key. The key is an option that stops Word from reregistering itself if another version is the current
 default. The value of 1 means Yes. So the NoRereg (no reregistering) is set to Yes...i.e., don’t do it! This will cause Word to ignore the default version and just open, without taking several minutes to go through the reregistering hassle.

<p>Then, uninstall Office 2010, (make sure all older office installations are removed), reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!),&nbsp;reinstall Office 2010.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong>Supplemental instructions</strong>
<p>MS tends to put everything in separate folders and with long wordy names.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I decided to consolidate things somewhat. <span>&nbsp;</span>So I navigated to the “Start” menu and edited folder and shortcut names to be more concise.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created a single “Microsoft Office” folder and migrated all of the shortcuts into it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created shortcuts to the 3 “2003 to 2007 Interactive Command References”. Then I started renaming the shortcuts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In my case I had Office 2003 and Office 2007, so I renamed them as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp;</span>“2003 Excel”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2003 PowerPoint”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2003 Word”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2007 Excel”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2007 Excel 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2007 PowerPoint”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2007 PowerPoint 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2007 Word”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“2007 Word 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”</p>
<p>etc…</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Word 2003</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Word 2007</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Word 2010</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Word 2003 to 2010 Mapping</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Excel 2003</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Excel 2007</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Excel 2010</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Excel 2003 to 2010 Mapping</p>
<p>etc…</p>
<p>As well, I decided to keep both sets of “Office Tools‘, so I kept one folder and renamed the shortcuts using the same pattern, ie starting with the year.</p>
<p>I also do custom installations, specifying unique installation folders to further separate the installations. It isn’t completely successful, some common folders are still used, &nbsp;but it seems to help.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s recommendations are incomplete regarding Word - see <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm</span></a> for further recommendations with regard to shared resources that are better not shared.</p>
<p>Office apps also work better also if their startup folders are not shared.</p>
<p>In the case of Excel I would relocate the contents of the (Excel 2003) XLSTART folder to a new sub folder of the existing XLSTART -The start-up folder location is stored in the registry at</p>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common\Xlstart</span></p>
<p>Set the value to match the sub new folder name e.g. Office11XLSTART. That should sort out Excel 2003. Create a similar sub folder and registry entries for Office 2010 i.e.Office14XLSTART and at</p>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Xlstart</span></p>
<p>The same idea applies to Word’s startup and template folders.</p>

            So its done, without any problems. I did have to uninstall office 2003 as the new office 2010 is 64 bit and the 2003 was 32 bit.<br />
All my emails etc are in order. I am so glad it went smoothly.<br />
Thanks for your help guys.

            Your easiest way to get this is to take your handset into a Nokia Care Point and get them to give your handset a software update.<br />
This will recover any basic information and leave your phone settings as if it was new.

            The 6288 is also listed as supported for Nokia Software Updater (NSU): <a href="http://www.nokia.com/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nokia.com/softwareupdate</a><br />
<br />
Note that using NSU, or a Nokia Care Point "reflashing" the phone will, while restoring a preinstalled theme, also wipe it clean for all data.<br />
<br />
So, use Nokia PC Suite to make a backup first (and after updating, use it to restore the data):

<li>Puts down a "DRAFT" watermark, prints, and then removes the watermark.</li><li>Sets the document template back to "Normal" to work around some compatibility issues.</li><li>Prints a precise number of copies for each page in a document as according to the various needs of duplicates and triplicates in my office.</li></ol>
<p>However, I cannot figure out how to make a one-button macro that sets my printer options to "Staple + Collate", prints, and then resets it to "Collate".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that because I have to set that printer option by selecting "Printer Properties" in the Print section of the File tab, the dialogue box that opens is not properly part of the MS Word program and therefore anything I do in there does not get included
 in the ongoing macro recording.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution that people can suggest for me? Know that I am not experienced with writing VB code directly for my macros, but I am willing to give it a try.</p>

<h2>            Cracked screen&#47;Warranty on ASUS Transformer Mini T102HA-C4-GR</h2>
                    I purchased an ASUS Transformer Mini T102HA-C4-GR Signature Edition 2 in 1 PC for my son for Christmas from the Microsoft.com websit. Does anyone know if it comes with any kind of warranty? My son has already cracked the
 screen and I'm not sure how to go about getting it fixed. I didn't want to take it to a local repair shop if it will void any warranties. Should I be contacted Asus about this or Microsoft?

            <p>The written warranty was included it the paperwork that came with the PC. </p>
<p>Physical damage is probably not covered by a warranty. </p>

                    Microsoft keeps sending me an Email to Reconnect to Google and for some reason it has my Google Username as Ed Williams and it is edwusa, but I can't seem or don't know how to edit it to edwusa, I think that's why I cannot reconnect.

<p>
</p><p><span>Planner has a limit of 250 tasks per person. If you assign more than this to the user, the error message

<p>
</p><p><span>We suggest you delete completed plans / projects so that Planner will have the space to create new ones.</span></p>

            Try selecting PROPERTIES for a .jpg file, and then select the CHANGE for OPENS WITH.&nbsp; Change to program it is incorrectly trying to use to open .jpg files to WINDOWS PHOTO VIEWER.&nbsp; That solved the problem for me.&nbsp; And I believe like changes for other file
 extensions may be corrected in the same way.

            <p>&gt;&gt; Technically, there is no limit.</p>
<p>Let's make that "no practical limit". &nbsp;The numbers it uses internally to track slides (SlideIndex, SlideID and such) are all Longs, meaning that PPT will probably get a very bad tummy-ache once there are more than 16million and some-odd slides.</p>
<p>Personally, I make it a rule never to include more than 10,000,000 slides in a presentation. &nbsp;One slide a second is about all people can absorb at best, and very few audiences will sit there and absorb information at that rate for half a year.</p>

<p>This is because you went back to the previous build and the update thinking you had problems sets a flag to block upgrades this below will reset it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Resetting Windows Update Components&nbsp;will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates.&nbsp;Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>&nbsp;on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Stop the&nbsp;<strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>3. Now rename the&nbsp;<strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Catroot2</strong>&nbsp;folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried that solution but one of de commands cannot be executed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot rename&nbsp; SoftwareDistribution folder because one o sub-folders is still in use with following files:</p>

            <p>I got build 14267 throw fast ring configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I got several problems as I reported in feedback. So I had to go back&nbsp;to version 1511 build&nbsp;14257.1000 which is now installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several solutions I stopped services but I could not rename SoftwareDistribution folder because one o sub-folders is still in use with following files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folder: DeliveryOptimization<br />
&nbsp;Folder : d1de701d28de66ad0e9b906739fff177e5ebed37<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;File : F833866DA25B058211FB832BF4E7ECB7E73F854C79378DCCB4C776166951D142<br />
&nbsp;Folder : a78e2024e88a26e51706f9a346420c6474cd3918<br />

<p>
</p><p>So I could not complete the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to safe mode and renamed the folder but as soon as I reboot it is rebuild.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have problems downloading updates from Store getting errors 0x80073cf0 and 0x80070003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I run Windows update troubleshooter "One or more Windows update components are configured incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Ok but I have found doing a clean install of BETA software will clear up problems after trying "fixes", as maybe one of your many apps maybe causing the problem. just saying.

<p>
</p><p>So far I understood from&nbsp;windows log the main errors are related with apps from Microsoft namely Microsoft mahajong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my apps runs without problems in windows 10 x64 version 1511 build 10586.164 in a desktop and two notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile going back to a previous build it seems updates to new builds cannot de done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m trying to confirm it.</p>

            If the box says Professional then there is no seperate key required for Access.&nbsp; I would suggest you contact the Vendor and have then give you another package because soemthing must be wrong with this one.

<p>
</p><p>I have a user who is able to view the 'headers' (Sender, Subject line, and first line of email) in her Outlook for Android, but when she clicks one to open the email is blank only shows (no subject). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She was remote when this happened, and believed it may have been as a result of her password, when she got home she changed her password, but it did not fix it.</p>

            <p>Hi Carlyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the root cause of the issue is related to your Outlook for Android app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, we recommend you contact the app built-in support for dedicated help. You may also request bug fixes and submit feature requests via in-app support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note when using the in app support:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. It is recommended that the user turn on notifications for Outlook in order to know when the technician is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you will see a response from the technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. It is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e8b32c3-bfbf-4560-855d-ab9cb2076ac6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e8b32c3-bfbf-4560-855d-ab9cb2076ac6" /></a></p>

    <title>After update, ALT-S no longer saves Outlook calendar entries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neman syed  say:</h3>
<h2>            After update, ALT-S no longer saves Outlook calendar entries</h2>
                    <p>After a recent update (and having turned on the Coming Soon feature), I can no longer save Outlook calendar items
 with ALT-S. (ALT-SHIFT-S continues to work, but is definitely not built for speed.) It's not a matter of it requiring a capital S - that's never been the case ever since keyboard shortcuts were introduced, and it's not required for other Outlook items like
 email, where ALT-S still works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a long-time power user (i.e. since the first release of Schedule+), I have to assume this was a mistake, not an intentional design change. You just don't change long-established things like shortcuts. It's too disruptive. (Yes, I'm bitter about the new
 shortcut mappings, and still can't get used to them. In fact, I still don't know a single person who thinks they're an improvement. But that's another story...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a mistake, please correct it. If this was an intentional change, please provide the option to undo this. Whenever these kinds of changes are made intentionally and without the ability to restore your preferred way of working, it alienates power
 users while being invisible to the n00bs who didn't know or care in the first place.</p>

<h2>            error 5174 Sorry, we couldn&#39;t find your file. Was it moved, renamed, or deleted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This discussion is for those writing macros using VBA with Word, Excel, etc and have faced this error when executing your macro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Documents.Open (..)</p>
<p>error&nbsp; 5174 Sorry, we couldn't find your file. Was it moved, renamed, or deleted?<br />
&nbsp;("drive letter:\...\filename...")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a lot of posts around this error. There are 2 main scenarios, and the easiest one is the only one that is getting discussed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 1</p>
<p>You are trying to open a "path\file" name that has actually moved between the time your program started and came up with the "path\file" name value, and the time it actually tried to open the file. That is easy to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 2</p>
<p>THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE AND MOST DIFFICULT TO DETECT</p>
<p>The value you are using to designate the "path\file" name to open using your macro code such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Documents.Open (....</p>
<p>...said value contains non printable characters (I am not talking about non alphanum like "." or "&amp;, or characters not allowed, I am talking about ASCII 13 most likely being the last character at the end of the value for your filename. But when you use Debug.Print,
 that character is not printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps To Confirm:</p>
<p>When you are in debug mode, Debug.Print "the value of the path\file you are trying to open".</p>
<p>This will print as expect with no visible issues, you can then confirm the file exists by copy pasting the printed value in windows explorer and the file should open automatically. If it does open manually, then you are likely dealing with scenario #2</p>
<p>THEREFORE</p>
<p>while in debug mode, using the variable that contains the path\file vallue, write a FOR statement to iterate through each character of the string using Debug.Print Asc(&lt;&gt;), where &lt;&gt; is the variable in the FOR iteration that gets assigned 1 character from
 the path\file string at a time. Most likely you will see the last character will print as 13</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VBA function</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trim(....</p>
<p>does not take care of this problem. you need to use the&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Replace (...</p>
<p>function with "Chr(13)" as the value sought to be replaced with vbNullString</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some hacks that consist in adding ASCII char 13 (carriage return, without a line fee) to file names and then appending the name, etc</p>
<p>There are utilities that clean those issues up, maybe not completely?... this might be the cause.</p>
<p>Another possible cause in my radar is the DOS prompt adding an extra char 13 when redirecting the output of a DIR command using "&gt;&gt;"&nbsp; into a file to create a list of files from the DIR command. It does not happen for all files in the results of the DIR command,
 it could be for files having special characters that are allowed. I do not have the time to investigate that further.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Inbox default Display Time</h2>
                    Outlook 2010 appears to have a one month default display setting on the Inbox requiring a filter to be set for a longer period to see emails in the Inbox older than one month.&nbsp; By setting a one year filter the last year of email in the Inbox can be seen.&nbsp;
 Is it possible to set a different default Inbox display period, so that a filter doesn't have to be set every time you want to view an older email in the Inbox?

<h2>            Visio 365 Layers and custom behavior....</h2>
                    <p>Good day all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a drawing with multiple sections grouped by layers. I want to display a few connectors&nbsp;<em>only if multiple layers are selected.</em> I can assign it to one or the other or both, but if I do not have both layers visible I do not want to see the line.
 Is there a context I can add to the Layer Membership ShapeSheet values? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have ="13;21" as I have the connector assigned to layers 13 and 21. If either are active it is visible. I only want to see it if&nbsp;<em>both</em> are visible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for something like ="13<em>and</em>21"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would mean the shape would only be visible when both layers 13 and 21 are active, but not if just either one are active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

Hi Gregory,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>
I have test this on our side, I would like to explain that if the two shapes has been assigned same or different layers, if there is one layer selecting Visible, it will display the connector:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/185f1b1d-5d11-42c1-8f92-fe8a03eb2767?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/185f1b1d-5d11-42c1-8f92-fe8a03eb2767?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
As although the second shape is visible, but it is existent, so the connector also displayed.</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
As a workaround, I suggest you delete the connector manually.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Given the situation, we suggest you vote for your requirement to <a href="https://visio.uservoice.com/forums/229400-visio-on-desktop?query=only%20display%20connector%20when%20all%20shares%20visible%20visio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            SharePoint Online &#58; Permission settings issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a rather strange issue with the permission settings in one of the SharePoint online classic teams site. There is a list to which I want to grant read access to all of the users in the organization but they must not be able to access other contents
 in the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To achieve this, I have set up unique permissions in the list for 'everyone except external users' to have 'read' access only. However this doesnot work. For those accessing the list for the first time receive "Access Denied" and if they refresh the page
 or copy the URL to a new tab ; list becomes accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Limited-access user permission lockdown mode" site collection feature is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Hi MB_2017,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Is the URL of this classic team site https://domain.sharepoint.com or https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename?
</p>
<p>2. Can users access this site before you set up the permission "everyone except external users"? I mean if users are able to access the site before you set up permission for the list.
</p>
<p>3. After refresh or use the URL, are users able to access the list? Can they access the list next time?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a test with a site collection https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitecollection2 in my test tenant. For the site collection permission level, I first make sure no users have any permission for this site collection. Test account cannot access this
 site at present. And then I access the list which want to share, in the permission, click Stop Inheriting permissions, remove any user/group in the remain permission list, click Grant permissions, enter everyone except external users and give it Read permission.

<p>You could follow these steps to set up the permission for the site and list. And then check if it works well for users.</p>

            You can have one from with multiple sources by using subforms. Or you could use a multi-table query if you just want to display data rather than input/edit.

<h2>            how to identify whether my email account got infected with a virus  or hacked</h2>
                    Hello i recently went to go check my contact list and came across a suspicious contact that i did not add so i am not sure if someone may have had access to my account to put that there or what. Also would be good to know when the contact was added so
 i might be able to figure out if it was because of some other computer i may have used.
<br />
<br />
I have done virus scans on my recently used computers and nothing comes up. <br />
I have also changed my Security info (passwords,phone #, alternate email, security question)<br />
<br />
If a mod could help me solve this i would appreciate it greatly. i do have the contacts "Name and email" if needed.<br />

<p>Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. It's understandable to be concerned about the security of your account when you notice changes in it that you have no recollection of doing, which in your case was the addition of contacts. I'll be happy
 to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common indication that an account was hacked is the outgoing emails in the account. If you receive feedback from your contacts that they are getting emails from you which you are not aware of, it's a strong indication that the account was hacked.
 Also, if our system detected inconsistent logs or spamming contents in the outgoing emails of your account, your account will automatically be blocked for the possibility of being hijacked.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are glad to hear that you are proactive enough to change your password and security details in your account. It's also good that you scanned your computer for possible infection of virus or malware. To further secure your online experience with us, please
 visit the solution article below and do the instructions that you haven't done yet in your account.</p>

<h2>            Domain name still shows Pending Changes</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is an updated post regarding issues I have been facing from my original post:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-signin/domain-name-is-pending-registration-in-outlookcom/596482a7-9020-4e05-917f-7aa65ae34fa2">
http://answers.microsoft.com/</a>&nbsp; ; for which I still do not have a solution.
<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>My issue is:<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At first, I was unable to register my domain, due to the "protected word" issue. However, after posting this issue, support was able to unblock this domain.&nbsp; My domain is
<a href="http://www.primainternational.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.primainternational.in</a><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After registering the domain in the Windows Live Admin Center, I received the MX and TXT records which I updated with my domain registrar. After updating those records with my registrar, the status of my domain on Windows Live Domain Site maintained "Pending
 Changes". I left it for a few hours to a few days trying several times, hoping for the DNS changes to propogate through the internet, however the status still showed Pending Changes. Please note that it has been over a two months since this issue. The support
 personnel on my original post referred me to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-wlsettings/handling-issues-with-mx-record-or-pending-dns/b722ed21-b20e-40e2-8dbb-26fa12003c32">
THIS</a> link, which I steps I have already followed, and could confirm that I had correctly setup my DNS settings. Apparently my issue was then escalated to a support specialist, however I was asked to contact my registrar for properly solving this issue.
 Not to mention that each time I was asked to remove my existing MX records to replace with the pamx1.... records, I was left without my current emails.<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also tried setting up a completely new Microsoft account. I removed all other records from my registrar, however the status with the new account is also showing Pending Changes. As stated by other users facing the same issue as me, it seems that
 "they did&nbsp;<b>NOT&nbsp;</b>unblock our custom domains correctly&nbsp;<b>OR&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>they don't seem to have a handle on allowing&nbsp;<b>once stuck</b>&nbsp;custom domains to be configured cleanly." Many other users who faced the same protected word issue are unable to prove ownership
 of the domain with the correct MX records.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am confident that my DNS settings are set up correctly. Could someone from support please help of this issue?</div>
<br />
Regards,<br />
Preet

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for any frustration. Let me assist you further with validating your domain on Windows Live Admin Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reviewed your other thread regarding the issue and have collected all the important information so we can forward this issue to our Support Specialist. Before escalating this issue, I would just like to ask for the nature and purpose of the domain.
 I apologize if this has been asked before but I was unable to find it on the other thread.</p>

<br />
Thank you for your prompt reply. The nature and purpsoe of the domain is to showcase our range of pharma products and services that we offer to our international clients.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate to learn by when this issue can be resolved. As I have updated my MX records as per the mail set up required by Windows Live. Till it gets registered and approved, I am left without any communication with my clients.&nbsp;

<p>We have checked your domain on our system and it shows that it has invalid MX Record. We suggest you change your MX record to a correct on so that your domain will be verified. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Delete all existing MX records configured in his registrar wait for an hour or two</p>
<p><span><br />
2. Go to <a href="https://domains.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">https://domains.live.com</font></a></span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
3. Get the MX record from there and it should be in ###.pamx1.hotmail.com format if it’s in ###.msv1.invalid format, please replace it with .pamx1.hotmail.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to ask if you have more questions.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to consolidate two Office 365 accounts into one&#63;</h2>
                    I have two accounts with multiple licensed users in each. Is it possible to consolidate the two into one account? Or maybe it would be easier to just migrate users manually by turning off their subscriptions under one account and issuing new licenses under
 the other account?

<p>Hi Mark McGarrity,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not feasible to merge or&nbsp;consolidate two Office 365 accounts to one. As you mentioned, you can export the content of one of the account and import to another one, then removing the licenses (delete the account) and add them to another one. I totally
 understand this may cause you inconvenience for running it manually, regarding this, I suggest you to submit your feedback and thoughts via
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 uservoice</a>&nbsp;or you can vote <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general/suggestions/18770236-work-out-a-way-to-merge-more-that-one-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Microsoft set a high value on customers' feedback and releasing of many features comes from customers' thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Iry</p>
