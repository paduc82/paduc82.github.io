<h2>            Latest version of Skype</h2>
                    <p>Dear Skype Users,</p>
<p>I have recently had to update Skype (Basically Forced to Download the latest Update) and I have found it almost impossible to customize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is much less user friendly than the previous versions and simple things like searching for Skype users, editing contact information, editing names, Changing a contacts photo, or generally personalizing Skype is a lot more difficult or in some cases almost
 impossible for the lay person in this new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I am missing something or possibly I am just getting too old to use Skype but does anyone else in the community have similar problems or feel the same about this latest update ?</p>

<p>Yes I found your posting as I was trying to find out how to send someone a link to skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help seems to be out of date.<br />
"select your profile photo"<br />
"select 'share link'"<br />
<br />
Well none of the above work.<br />
<br />
It seems as though Microsoft have got busy with a great platform and made it impossible to use.<br />

<p>Dear Mick (From another Mick),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Skype since it changed from MSN Messager. It's been on a continuous downhill slide since it changed over. I've updated to Skype 8 twice, only to revert back to Skype 7 each time. For 3 years and counting, I've been asking and begging Microsoft/Skype
 to allow changes to font size and type. I've been ignored. I can't read the small font that Skype has decided to use. I complained about the lack of customization and again have been ignored. I have sent well over 100 feedback reports complaining about Skype
 8 and what it's lacking. On Skype 8, I couldn't get my microphone to work, even though it works on all other programs. I couldn't turn off my laptop camera, so ended up having to change the settings to blur it out and covered the camera with tape. I complained
 about this long and loud too, only to be ignored. I've just received an email stating Skype 7 is gone as of November 1st, 2018. So I'm changing to another messaging platform and exploring others. Skype is no longer responsive in anyway to it's bulk of users.
 Thus, I am about to begin boycotting Skype and some other Microsoft programs that have changed for the worse. I would suggest that anyone fed up with Microsoft/Skype do the same thing. When a company becomes so arrogant that they ignore their customer base,
 they don't deserve their customers. Passive/aggressive dictation is still dictation. I guess what I'm saying is I'm pretty much fed up with being ignored and spit on by Skype. Look around, there's other programs out there.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2016 Excel Add-ins not showing up</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchase MS Office 2016 H&amp;B for the Powerview and Power Pivot functions, which should be available on this version according to the MS rep I spoke to.&nbsp; I cannot, for the life of me, get it to work.&nbsp; I have placed the button in the ribbon
 but when I select it, nothing seems to happen.&nbsp; There is no option in the advanced settings to turn on this feature as described in other sections of the forums.&nbsp; With this not being there, it leads me to believe that it is not a part of this suite.&nbsp; Chat
 support is about as helpful and my 8 year kid when it comes to trouble shooting.&nbsp; It was all basic steps or restarting and running a repair tool from the uninstall screen or a Microsoft fixit tool, non of which worked.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP!&nbsp; If this suite has the
 option for the power view and power pivot, how do I get it to work?&nbsp; If it does not, I need to return this product ASAP as this is the sole reason I upgraded from office 2010 to 2016.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for all your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost forgot, I am running windows 7 Pro, 64 bit in a domain if that makes a difference.&nbsp; And I do have admin rights on the PC.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Filename when working with Excel 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a company owned Macbook, running on macOS Sierra (10.12.3). On this Macbook there is installed a MS Office 2016 Standard (Word, Excel, ...). When opening an Excel-file from the companys filestorage (Windows Server 2012R2), Excel tries to create a
 temporary file called </p>
<p>
</p><p>(original-filename).xlsx.sb-(random-string)-(random-string). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore the file cant be saved, because this file-extension isn't supported by IT department. Because of crypto-trojans they limited the possible file extensions to office typically extensions like .xlsx or similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I tell Excel 2016 (and Word 2016 too) not to create these temporary files - or create them within a temporary location on my local system?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b10cdea-daa7-4c8c-b796-de07fe724268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b10cdea-daa7-4c8c-b796-de07fe724268" /></a></p>

            <p>Hi Jim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you four the link to the feature request :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our IT uses the FSRM role on Windows Server to lock it down. As they told me, this tool has a white list of known file extensions and everything else gets blocket. So allowing files without extension isn't possible with this tool :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will use your link to post my wishes. Maybe someday in future... it gets heared ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards, </p>
<p>

<h2>            PPT 2013&#58; How do you animate the same object multiple times at different points in time.</h2>
                    <p>My goal is to have Object A fly in, then Object B fly in, then Object A fly out.&nbsp; Each triggered by a mouse click.</p>
<p>Pre-2013 this was easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you do it in PPT 2013?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to create an additional animation to Object A, it selects the existing animation &amp; overwrites it.
</p>
<p>Yes I realise that it can combine the effects BUT I can see no way to separate the timings so that animations on other objects can play in between.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>( currently I need 12 nearly identical slides just to do the animation sequence I could do on 1 slide in 2010. )</p>

            <p><strong><u>Solution</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to click the "Add Animation" button in the ribbon. To add an additional animation to the same object.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Sure, makes sense when you know. But not obvious when you are used to pre-2013 functionality.
</p>
<p>I know, kinda dumb answering my own question, but I eventually figured it out after I'd asked the question.

<p>Hello friends.</p>
<p>Only Nokia Maps Updater 3.0 can install Nokia Maps on the 5530! (info from 0800)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the Nokia Maps Updater from nokia.com (any version will work, i picked e63)</p>
<p>Install it and let it download any updates (for itself) until it reaches 3.0 version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With NMU updated to 3.0 version, connect the 5530 in pc suite mode, and install Maps 3.0 on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that run Maps from 5530 one time, and close it (it will create necessary folders)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, download nokia map loader, let it update itself, and download any maps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, I'm downloading Brazil maps into mine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I'll post back if anything fail.)</p>

<p>I've successfully installed ovi maps on 5530 using basically the same steps as above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone explain to me how network positioning works ? Do I actually have to go online or can the phone work out the position without incurring any charges. When I first installed maps, it showed me in roughly the correct position. I tried it out on a
 journey and the position changed several times. The only problem is, that now I'm back home, maps shows my position as still being at the last position&nbsp; (around 8 miles away) and nothing seems to change it.</p>

<p>What you mean by "my position"? The 5530 doesn't have a GPS module/antenna!</p>
<p>You can add points of your interest as "Favorites" and use em in your routes.</p>

<p>I encountered the same problem when I tried to upgrade. Seems to me that Nokia is now checking the phone model and Ovi Maps is not officially supported for the 5530.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that Nokia has closed the loophole? I've investigated several methods described in this post, and they don't seem to match with what is actually available out&nbsp;for download nowadays. As far as I can see, "maps updater" and "maps loader" no
 longer exist - it seems there is currently only one "channel" through which to load maps onto your phone, and that is via Ovi Suite. Any download links that I can find by searching for the terms used in the posts above all lead to the one thing - downloading
 the maps application version&nbsp;for your particular&nbsp;phone. I selected 5530 and then downloaded the .sis file to my PC. Then upon transferring to my phone, I discovered my phone already has the lasted version of maps installed on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem comes when I connect up Ovi Suite, and it says "cannot find maps or voice guidance files in your device. This is due to either of the following reasons: your device does not support the Nokia Maps application, or the maps and voice guidance files
 in your device are corrupted. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the other syncing features in Ovi Suite are working fine, which means there is no problem with the connection between the phone and PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't see how the files would be corrupt, since I just recently had my phone system completely reinstalled at a Nokia shop, and this is the first time since then that I've tried to do anything with the Maps application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if my device doesn't support the Nokia Maps application, then why does it come with&nbsp;Maps already installed, and why am I able to download a version of Nokia Maps for 5530 from the official Nokia website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open the maps app on my phone, with WiFi connected, it seems to be <em>
trying</em> to work, as I can see that it is downloading data, but it just keeps giving me a blank screen and a "no info available" message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody&nbsp;had any recent success?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Benson&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi kfafNQ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In OneDrive for Business, the Edit permission include the permission to delete items. So you may not be able to do this in OneDrive for Business. Although OneDrive provides different
 ways of retrieving your files after being deleted</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-files-or-folders-in-onedrive-949ada80-0026-4db3-a953-c99083e6a84f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restore deleted files or folders in OneDrive</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you may create such a permission level in a SharePoint site. My suggestion is that you may store your files in a SharePoint site, then create a unique permission which include permission
 of editing but not deleting of items by the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the SharePoint site, click the gear icon &gt; Site Permissions
 &gt; Advanced permission settings;</span></li><li><span>In the PERMISSIONS ribbon, click Permission Levels &gt; Add a Permission Level;</span></li><li><span>Add all other permissions contained in Edit, but leave Delete Items and Delete Versions unchecked.</span></li></ol>
<p>You may also refer to the following article for the detailed steps:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/how-to-create-and-edit-permission-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create and edit Permission Levels</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, you may grant the users this unique permission by the steps in this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/customize-permissions-for-a-sharepoint-list-or-library-02d770f3-59eb-4910-a608-5f84cc297782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Customize permissions for a SharePoint list or library</a></p>

<p>Hi kfafNQ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SharePoint is a kind of collaboration site for users. You can check this article for details:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/sharepoint-online-service-description/sharepoint-online-service-description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint Online Service Description</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive for Business is for private use since before you share the files in OneDrive with others.</p>
<p>SharePoint is a collaboration platform for sharing use.</p>
<p>You can refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/should-i-save-my-documents-to-onedrive-for-business-or-a-team-site-d18d21a0-1f9f-4f6c-ac45-d52afa0a4a2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Should I save my documents to OneDrive for Business or a team site?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which subscription do you have? SharePoint is included in all enterprise subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint can be connected, if you have permission of one SharePoint site, you can

copy or move</a> files from OneDrive for Business to SharePoint sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the workaround for your situation is permission in SharePoint, you may also need to read this article:

<p>
</p><p>The permission control in SharePoint is not available in OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive for Business is for private use, when you share the folder with your users, you can choose read permission or edit permission, if the users have edit permission, then they are also able to delete the files in the folder. Sorry for that.</p>

<p>Ok Gloria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we suppose that One Drive cannot provide me with a solution, neither SharePoint that I do not have it, do you have any other idea how can I accomplish the (many can edit, only one can delete)?</p>
<p>

            <p>Try this:</p>
<p>1. Disconnect all devices/desktop apps.</p>
<p>2. Go to your device with Windows Phone.</p>
<p>3. Delete Facebook account.</p>
<p>4. Add a new account, this time using the email from Facebook Profile.*</p>
<p>Ex: www... fb... com/<strong>yourusername &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;--add @facebook &nbsp;. &nbsp; com</strong></p>
<p>5. The password is the same one you use to access facebook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>* This will prevent future problems, if you modify the emails that have access to your facebook account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>

<p>Actually the reports and also the responses from Microsoft are about the 7.8 update being halted due to issues with the way the live tiles refresh. While we have yet to hear from Nokia on this seeing that there are a number of Microsoft posts and statements
 around the net confirming the issue it would be safe to assume at this time they halted the update cycle to fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's hope Nokia comes out with an announcement on this as it needs to be addressed by an official source.</p>

            Thanks paulheu at last a semi official confirmation that there is a problem with the upgrade. The silence from Nokia is shamefull, perhaps Microsoft never told Nokia the upgrade was pulled. What a total shambles.

<p>In all honesty, Once the firmware update has been delivered to teh update service it's out of Nokia's hands.. Obviously they can/could/should go ask MSFT what is happening, but that's about it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me it would seem it is MSFT who needs to come out and let you people know what's up.</p>

<p>Hi Lucky,<br />
<br />
We'd like to isolate if the issue is related to the Office apps alone, therefore I have provided several methods below to troubleshoot the Office application. The methods are listed in order and you can click the next method just in case the previous method
 doesn't resolve the issue:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<p>
</p><p>If the error message also occurs on other programs on Windows, please answer the following queries below so we can further isolate this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the recent changes you've made before this issue occur?</li><li>Have you tried running a disk clean up to delete junk files and free up memory space?</li><li>Have you tested the issue using other user account profile on Windows?</li><li>Aside from Office apps, what are the other programs where the error message usually occurs?</li></ul>
<p><br />
If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.<br />

            I would cut the content of page 2 and paste it into a new document that I would use as a Directory Type mail merge main document with the first paragraph formatted to start on a new page and with a data source that had 499 records in it, with just one
 field, containing a space in each record. &nbsp;Put the mergefield in some innocuous position in the document and execute the merge to a new document. &nbsp;That document should then contain 499 replicas of the second page of your original document and you could then
 use CTRL+a to select it all and then copy and paste it into the original document that contains the page 1.

    <title>Issue with IE and Default opening of file type not showing on list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimdirt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with IE and Default opening of file type not showing on list</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to help my sister fix a screw up she did when I sent her a .kmz (Google Earth Placemark) via email&nbsp; , what she did was just click "Open" (Windows 10 Home , 64 bit , Version 1803) , and did not look and it , I guess ,it had defaulted the box
 to be checked to Always open this type of file with IE&nbsp; , because she at the time did not have Google Earth installed (she thought she did , but did not) so when she Opened the file&nbsp; , it just opened up IE and was directing her to websites&nbsp; , so I had her
 install Google Earth and she clicked on the KMZ again , which now has a IE Icon&nbsp; , and all it does is open IE , and she has no way to "choose" to open it in Google Earth .......</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I am trying to do (she is mostly PC illiterate) is step by step get her to change the association of the KMZ from IE to Google Earth&nbsp; ........ The issue being , if I even try it on my Win10Pro PC , it does not show the .kmz on the list of associated
 files with IE&nbsp; &nbsp;, there is no setting in Google Earth to associate the .kmz to Google Earth , because it already is&nbsp; , but now that she opened the .kmz in IE&nbsp; , it won't associate it with Google Earth or from what I can tell&nbsp; , allow her to choose another
 "Default" program to open the .kmz&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So .......... How (so I know , and can explain to her over the phone since she lives 300+ miles from me ..... in simple easy to follow directions) do I get IE to no longer associate a .kmz to it , and that if it does not show up on the minimal list of HTTP
 , HTTPS&nbsp; , etc. list of files where is it associated with it&nbsp; , then where do I find the association and change it ?? ,&nbsp; and then associate it with Google Earth&nbsp; , since in Windows 10's infinite idiocracy , it does not allow you to right click on something
 and choose&nbsp; "Open With" , like it should&nbsp; , it only gives the option to "Open"&nbsp; , even though it does it with other files that have already been associated with a program&nbsp; &nbsp;, I need this to be done in the most simplest form , because I just spent over a hour
 just getting her to find the file in Downloads&nbsp; , and click on it and add the Placemark to Google Earth&nbsp; , then save to her Places ..... but the issue is&nbsp; , any more .kmz's will only open in IE&nbsp; , so I need to walk her thru getting it changed to Google Earth
 , and never with IE and/or get it so she can choose what to open it with&nbsp; , as I was unable to find that option as the "choices" are very limited (Thanks for dumbing down Windows , Microsoft .....Not) , and I can't figure out how to do it&nbsp; , so there is no
 way , I could talk her thru it , until I can find out how to do it , and since we have different versions of Win 10 , everything (stupid) is different or displayed differently or a option on my version , but not hers (again , pure stupidity , ALL versions
 of Windows should have the exact same capabilities)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO ........&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Ideas how to disassociate something that is not on the associated list for that program , but seems to be defaulted to it somehow still ???&nbsp; , at least , not on the list of selections that shows up when you try to change the Default settings of a program</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes she did "Save" the file&nbsp; , it ended up in her Downloads folder&nbsp; , and when Right Clicking&nbsp; , she only has the option to "Open" , not Open With x Program</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as using another App&nbsp; , that is also a issue , because as you mentioned , it is NOT on the list&nbsp; , and I could not find a way to "ADD" a program to the Open list&nbsp; , the only options were , IE or "Choose a App" from the Microsoft App Store , of which
 Google Earth is not one of the ones it shows as available&nbsp; , at least when you use the Choose From App selection from the Program Association section, which I tried from my PC as well , and got the same results&nbsp; , or rather lack of results&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other Ideas ??&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>She was able to get IT into Google Earth&nbsp; &nbsp;, doing as I mentioned above with my guidance , the issue is&nbsp; , trying to change the association from IE to Google Earth&nbsp; , that is where the issue is&nbsp; , we can't find a way to clear that or any .kmz from being
 associated with IE&nbsp; , and since it does not show up on the list of associated files with IE , we can't just uncheck a box and then have it Open With xxx&nbsp; , it automatically wants to open ALL .kmz's with IE any time she gets a new one from anywhere , like if
 I sent her another .kmz&nbsp; , if she clicked on it in the email (which would normally just open Google Earth) , OR saved it and opened it from there (which would just normally open up Google Earth) , it would still just open a search in IE&nbsp; &nbsp;.... That is the
 main issue&nbsp; , to disassociate it with IE somehow , and with no option to "Open With"&nbsp; , she/we are kind of stuck , as there is no place we can find that allows us to change what opens it as , IE decided that IE is opening it and that's it&nbsp; , no other choices
 that we can find .... and why I came here&nbsp; , as there has to be some way to tell IE to allow us to change that file type from IE to something else (Google Earth)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Worth trying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as passwords (are those backed up?) and you will have to re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset IE Settings button in Internet Options&gt; Advanced. What a reset of IE settings will do:<br />
How to Reset Internet Explorer settings:<br />

<p>
</p><p>2. Try the quick, easy method of reinstalling Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Start &gt; Search &gt; search for turn windows features.</p>
<p>That should find <em>Turn Windows features on or off (Control Panel)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the list, uncheck Internet Explorer, click OK and restart. </p>
<p>Reverse that, check Internet Explorer this time &gt; OK &gt; restart.</p>

</p><p>I am completely changing the subject but here is the situation:&nbsp; Initially the Office 365 license was under the acting ceo's name.&nbsp; That person is still at the company.&nbsp; Now there is a new CEO.&nbsp; The user information under office account is under the person
 who was acting CEO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new ceo asked me if the name could be change to her.&nbsp; I thought all I would need to do is edit the name.&nbsp; However it turns out that it could be much more complicated.&nbsp; Is the an easy way to do this?</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan,<br />
<br />
I am not sure if this is what you meant, point out if I understand wrong.<br />
If you want to change the Office Applications Account Belongs to information like this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb67f97a-b5a6-43d7-82ee-7187686a1f80?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb67f97a-b5a6-43d7-82ee-7187686a1f80?upload=true" /></a></p>
You could remove the acting CEO’s license key in that computer and sign in with the now CEO’s account.
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/odsupport/2015/05/01/how-to-reset-an-office-365-install-to-the-initial-activationinstall-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Remove Office License Key</a>.<br />
As for User Information, you could sign out the old account and sign in with a new one.<br />
If your new CEO don’t own her license, you could assign license to her in Admin Center:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assign-licenses-to-users-in-office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business.</a><br />
<br />
If this not what you meant, please give me more information about the account you want to adjust, some screen shots maybe, to protect your private, you may send them via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?tm=1527661428680">

<br />
Sorry that I didn’t initial the Private Message, you could check it now.<br />
The license is essential for a user. If you now CEO doesn’t have one, you need to purchase one and assign to her.<br />

            Maybe my thinking is incorrect, but if they have 2 office 365 business licenses, that gives them !0 installations.

<p>I am going to have a meeting with the CEO, to discuss the licensing issue.&nbsp; However I have a question to is off the subject about licensing.</p>
<p>This company does alot of bulk emailing.&nbsp; Often, they copy email addresses to outlook.&nbsp; Recently they have gotten error messages back when they do this on outlook.&nbsp; The have gsuite as there email provider and outlook as the interface.&nbsp; I have been talking
 to gmail concerning these bounce backs and I have been told that copying email addresses to outlook, isnt allowed.&nbsp; And that the company should use the gmail interface to send bulk emails. The reason is confusing but it has something to do with being authenicated
 with a password.&nbsp; I know I'll be asked that and I'm confused if this is microsoft or gmail.&nbsp; If it goes through gsuite...then does it go through gsuite when its on outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They want to do everything quickly, which I understand.&nbsp; But I want to make sure they do everything legally too.</p>

<h2>            HP Stream 7 with KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED &#40;win32kfull.sys&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Installed build 9926 on my Stream 7 tablet a few weeks ago. After about 10 days started getting memory exception BSOD errors with increasing frequency. Thought little of it until it threw the KMODE error in the title. After the first error it reboots, throws
 the error again, reboots and asks to go into recovery mode.Unfortunately, I'd not taken the time to rebuild the recovery partition, figuring I could just use my OTG cable and the USB media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which it now no longer recognizes. </p>
<p>:-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Stream has never shown up when connected to a PC or laptop. I'll next rebuild the image on 2 USB sticks. Anyone else have a thought as to how to"unbrick" my lovely little tablet? I have ran all of the UEFI diagnostic options with no HW issues found.</p>

    <title>Why do I lose formatting when a note in OneNote is accessed in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob kuefner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I lose formatting when a note in OneNote is accessed in OneNote on Ipad</h2>
                    I have pasted information into OneNote Home Office 365 Premium from my Bible software and it pasted with all the formatting and even the footnotes beautifully. Here is a link to a screen shot showing the pasted text...&nbsp;<a href="http://sdrv.ms/10nWBNS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/10nWBNS</a>&nbsp;.
 Later when I go to use my Ipad OneNote, which I have purchased the upgrade to.... when I open up the same note, it changes the formatting on the Ipad. When the notebook syncs with servers.. (my OneNote Notebooks are on my Skydrive) the formatting is also changed
 on the desktop note. The changed note now looks like this...
<div><a href="http://sdrv.ms/12f3nm9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/12f3nm9</a>&nbsp;. I also have an android phone with the OneNote app and have the same issue. Obviously my hope is that if I am out somewhere and have need to check out a note, or am working on one of the other
 two platforms, and web page I load or link will look the same. At the very least, I'd obviously like the original formatting not to be effected. I do love OneNote, and have dabbled some with Evernote, but it just doesn't have as rich of formatting options
 or the filing options with notebooks, tagging and sub notebooks and sections that I can accomplish with OneNote, but I'm hoping that the apps in Android and iOS will improve so formatting isn't lost or impacted in such a way. &nbsp;At the current time, I don't
 have a Windows phone, or a Surface, though I do really want one of each... but until then I do want access to my notes, without having to worry about such changes. Any thoughts as to efforts to make the apps more compatible with the desktop version, or a way
 to preserve the original formatting if a mobile app will make these changes. thanks</div>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion, but it misses the point. I have no problem with just using OneNote on the desktop or laptop in this case. But one of the things that I want to be able to do is access my notes on mobile devices, without messing up the note itself.
 The whole point of having mobile devices would be to allow someone to access the information on a variety of different devices. I believe I paid around $14 to have all my notes available on my Ipad OneNote app. It'd be nice to have it sync properly without
 losing formatting. I realize that it's limited in scope and I appreciate your link above that clarifies that limitation regarding text formatting. But I also am a little disappointed to see the date of the post is January 2011. And according to the ITunes
 store the app was last updated on Dec. 2011. That's still almost two years ago. I know that there is talk of Office for the Ipad, but I'm hearing late 2014. I was given the Ipad, so it's not like I'm going to throw it out, and I can't afford at the current
 time to purchase a tablet running Windows8. I really love OneNote, but I also need to be able to see my notes that I've created, scanned or clipped while at my office, but not being able to on a mobile device is disheartening.

<p>Forgive me if you already know this but Nokia PC Suite will give you full access to the pictures on your camera and you can copy them to your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can link up to your PC from the phone with a micro USB cable very easily or you can use Bluetooth if you already have a Bluetooth adaptor on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The software is also very useful to sync contacts from phone to PC.</p>

            I've used the 6700 classic on work. It has both USB connection and bluetooth for you to use with a computer. I've not used it with ovi or pc suite, but using the phone as a mass storage device should be possible. If you have the pictures on your memory
 card, you could pull it out and connect it to a card reader dongle to pc too.

            <p>Hello Josh,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Unfortunately, there is no feature within Outlook to set the folders as expanded in navigation pane.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">That said,
<strong>Outlook will remember which folders were expanded when closing</strong>. To have all the folders as expanded when opening, you need to expand all the folders/sub folders before exiting Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If that is not working in Outlook, try to reset the views in Outlook to the default ones. To do that, try the following step:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open Outlook &gt; View tab &gt; Click on ‘Reset View’ under current view.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Note</strong>: Resetting the views would change the views to factory settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For further clarifications, reply and we would be happy to assist.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you.</span></p>
