<h2>            Xbox One Elite controller is not worth the money and my immense anger at microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Note: I am posting this because tech support has not helped me. I want answers about why both the quality and warranty are so utterly lacking on Microsoft's most expensive "Accessory" yet. Please put yourself in my shoes, and try to imagine the immense frustration
 and utter lack of assistance I am receiving.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you want to read my proposed solution, skip ahead to the last paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>So recently I purchased a brand new Elite controller from game stop for around $220, since the controller does not have a rechargeable battery for some unknown reason. I made this decision for three reasons. One: I was under the impression that I had a year
 long warranty on the device, which I learned alter was not the case, but more on that subject later. Two: The normal controller quality is utterly abysmal compared to what we've come to expect from the industry. Three: I am a competitive Halo player, and I
 need quality controllers that feature paddles. Normally I buy from third party developers like Scuff, but I figured "Eh, it's microsoft, they must offer the best quality.
<strong>Especially when considering the price tag</strong>." So I bought the controller. Day one out of the box I was already disappointed to find out that I needed to fork over additional money for a battery pack, which I did, because "eh, it's Microsoft.
 This should be the last money I have to put into a controller for a long time."</p>
<p>My friends called me a moron for buying such an expensive controller. I told them I have been a long time customer and that Microsoft would never give a "screw you" to long time customers. I mean, after all, they were the ones who helped finance Halo 2,
 the game of my childhood.</p>
<p>Flash forward <strong>FIVE MONTHS</strong>. No, not one year, not a decade, only FIVE MONTHS LATER, and my controller busts. Now you're first thought is probably "be more careful bro, don't drop it," and normally I'd completely agree with you. I think the
 attitude of entitlement in America is completely disastrous, but I can confirm that I've not only never dropped this controller, but that I've never even touched the thing if I so much had a crumb upon my hand. I've given more care and attention to this controller
 than most people give to their controller for Pete's sake!</p>
<p>The actual issue was simply. I was off fighting Oryx in Destiny, and was planning on going for Onyx on Halo 5 slayer afterwards, when suddenly I heard a strange clicking noise in my controller. Curious, I examined it. The issue soon became apparent. The
 right bumper was loose, and I could tell <strong>something internal had broken</strong>. No biggie, I wasn't worried due to the fact that I just had to call Microsoft and grab a new controller. I didn't even leave my raid! A quick google search confirmed that
 I was not the only one with this problem, but that I was one of dozens! <strong>
This was not a simple one and done error, but rather a malfunction deserving of a factory recall</strong>. I was significantly perturbed, and for good reason, but I still knew I had my warranty to fall back on, and those online said that the warranty covered
 the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the raid, which was incredibly annoying to run without my melee, I had to cancel my Halo game play due to the issue. Well that stinks for my teammates, but what can you do right? I started an online chat and was met by a nice lady who could barely
 type. I can officially say that this was the first time I had trouble understanding tech support over an online chat. Oh well. I quickly explained the situation, and waited about fifteen minutes. The lady responded with a quick apology,
<strong>explaining that the warranty only covered controllers that come with the elite console,
</strong>and that they could not except the controller back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I silently screamed at them, but politely signed off, thanking them for the support before coming back onto the forums to write about my experiences. Not only did I learn that they offered a measly 3 month support plan, less than most next gen games bought
 through gamestop, but that the issue, which clearly was a manufacturing issue, was my problem, and that they wouldn't do anything about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looks like my friends were right. Microsoft really did just screw me over.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My solution:</strong></p>
<p>First off, we the community need a formal apology for this inexcusable abuse of trust. More practically though, we need year long warranties, and support for the issue of bumpers dislodging. This is not one or two people, this is a widespread problem, and
 must be officially addressed. I read a reddit post where the poster only received an official response after a bandwagon of people responded angry comments towards microsoft. Listen, I'm no genius, but if I talk to ten people who are even considering to buy
 the elite controller, and I tell them of my issues, <strong>that will cost Microsoft $1500 dollars.</strong> I'm no math genius, but I think it'd be cheaper just to give me a new controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to make it right with me: </strong>As a consumer, I feel as though I have been abused. I want a new controller, and an apology not only for the pathetic support and warranty, but for the hours I have spent on tech support trying to resolve the
 issue. If Microsoft doesn't fix this situation in a way that satisfies me, as well as it's customers, I will have no choice but to leave. Me and several good friends have already discussed PC gaming, and now it seems that Microsoft has put the final nail into
 it's xbox shaped coffin.<strong> I am begging Microsoft to fix this situation, but I fear that they&nbsp;simply&nbsp;do not value their customers.</strong></p>

Ditto, brother. &nbsp; My right bumper sheared inside my elite, unlike you, i bought mine for $150.00. &nbsp;In fact, i bought mine to replace the contoller that came with my xbox one, because the bumper same side bumper broke on that one. &nbsp;I thought a more expensive,
 customizable, and robust contoller would last longer. &nbsp;I bought it this past January and it just broke in this month, July. &nbsp;The 360 controller i had lasted 10 years and i traded it in when i got the Xbox One. &nbsp;I guess, looking at your article, i'll have to
 try an off brand controller!

<p>
</p><p>I tried all sorts of things to get several of the latest builds to install, it always hung around 84% (39% configuring settings). I read all kinds of things mentioned in all kinds of threads.&nbsp; Grabbing the install.esd out of the failed download in
</p>
C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources folder and using the tool in the thread above to create an iso file, then using the win7 usb dvd creator tool did the trick.

<h2>            increasing volume of voice commands</h2>
                    Is there any way to increase the volume level of voice commands (I.e. Turn by turn directions, text to speech and speech to text) so that at least it's similar to the volume of the other processes&nbsp;that are being run on the phone such as in game music or
 the music app.

<h2>            I use different contact folders in Outlook.   But I only want to synchronise ONE of them to my phone or tablet.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My Outlook has several contact folders - for example, 'Contacts (default)', 'Ex work colleagues', 'Admin group'.</p>
<p>But I only want to sync the Contacts (default) folder with my phone - not the ex-work colleagues not the admin groups (as these are very big.</p>
<p>How do I do that? &nbsp;Is there a way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a gmail account as my primary email account (via IMAP).</p>
<p>I used to have an iphone and used to sync via icloud.</p>

<p><span>In Word for Mac, there is no such button to update mail merge results after the source data is changed. As you mentioned, we have to close and open that Word document again or reloading the data source file.</span></p>

<h2>            How to move only &#34;On My Computer&#34; mailbox from one mac to another</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new MacBook and installed Outlook 2016 and connected to my corporate Exchange email. &nbsp;I also have a mailbox of historical emails stored in the "On My Computer" mailbox folder. &nbsp;How do I move just the local emails/mailbox to the new
 Mac? &nbsp;If I do an Export on the old Mac, is there a way to limit it to exporting only the "On My Computer" mailbox rather than the Exchange mailbox?

<p>Hi Qmaster,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Exchange accounts, all the data stored in the Exchange server. Before exporting, you can remove only the exchange mailbox and export the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any trouble during the process.</p>

            Here is some tips when posting error code as a title doesn't help a little more info such as the number helps, info in the body of the posting such as what your system is Make/Model, which Version/Build, preview or public, what fixes have you tried? also
 doing a Google or Bing search will find lots of info for that error. Also this is the forum for testing of newer builds of Windows 10 before being released to the Public and isn't a general support site for the Public builds.

            Like u m also new here but not a newbie in Nokia.. ;)<br />
As per ur query u dont need a technical advisor, a standard micro SD card will work in 701, irrespective of company n class.<br />
<br />
It already includes a whooping 8GB storage on board.<br />
<br />
NOKIA cards r rare in indian markets especially here in Mumbai, u can try for Nokia priority dealers if u want in ur local areas.<br />
<br />
What the issues u r talking abt in 701 ?<br />
It already runs on Symbian Belle n will get FP1 update soon. A worth buy or shdbi say value for money ?? ;)

            Hi,<br />
Buy the memory card with class 4, 6, 10.<br />
Minimum class 4 memory card is required for video camera to record 720p HD videos, because in HD video, data has to be written very fast to the memory card.

            There are no issues with 701.<br />
Update your phone to BelleFP1.<br />
It might increase your phone speed up to 50 to 60% in my opinion.<br />
Along with that you get dolby digital sound, 20 new widgets, upgraded processor speed of 1.3 GHz and much more. :)<br />

<p>Pretty close to perfection, the 701 is.<br />
Overall it is brilliant for most users.<br />
<br />
3 things that disturb me,<br />
<br />
No weekview in the calender.</p>
<p>A fix hopefully comes as the calender had it before on Belle.<br />
Nokia internet radio widget causing trouble when playing.<br />
No webdav client in the filemanager as before on anna devices. Most people dont know the functionalty so perhaps not an big issue overall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of autofocus is for some people an issue but the camera is really good for macro pictures and even better than a lot of phone cams when it comes to video recording. Really nice to do do video shooting :-).<br />
<br />
Best device ever from Nokia I think considering the price.<br />
Have never been so satisfied overall in a period of 20 years.<br />
<br />
Snappy, stable and nice feeling of the touch screen too.<br />
Price tag of euro 225 in some places in europe is best buy in history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have even droid friends that are amazed by it, and they are on much pricier devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I such a pity that this device isnt available for more people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, I use Transcend SDHC card class 6 and that is working just fine.</p>
<p>I dont recomend sandisk though, but that is personal experience.</p>
<p>I think you have good information about this subject from Srik in earlier answer.<br />

            HiI am using 701 for past one month, really good phone. My doubt is that when i checked nokia india site the specs says nokia 70 supports max of 64gb of memory card.Also checked with other nokia site the max capacity of memory card support is mentioned
 as 32gb. I want clarification for this. Does indian version of nokia 701alone supports max 64gb, what about others country version.When i checked with other forum using of higher class actually slow down the phone. It is better to classs use 4 or 6 for optimum
 performance. For 720 or 1080 video recording and playing class 4 or 6 msd card are good one.<br />
<br />
Also wants know why all symbian touch phone are 640x360 res. And also have very big doubt for me is why nokia is not using ARMv7 processor for it symbian phones. There are several phone with ARMv7 pro samsung i8910 omnia HD and sony ericsson vivaz, satil series.<br />
<br />
I thought symbian os will not support armv7 pro. When i googled couple of years before i found and waited. Nokia came out with lumia series phones using this type pro. Atleast single core ARMv7 1.2Ghz above will be good option for future symbian phone.I suggest
 nokia to come with symbian phone as same or equal spec of lumia 900.<br />
<br />
I am fan of nokia and symbian. And also nokia should get rid of resistive touch phone also.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Awaiting for reply

<p>AFAIK 32GB is the largest card that can be formatted upon device, there is no problem utilising 64GB microSDXC providing formatted to FAT32 upon PC prior to use which does reduce capacity to about 59GB.</p>

                    <p>Update seems to be trying to install this driver but fails on installing it. It seems that update will not accept any other updates until this is completed. I have no error codes and have no idea what it is for. What should I do next. When I click on the
 Install Now button in update it grays out and nothing happens. Update also becomes locked up and can not be closed or minimized. I checked maintenance and it does not show any problem also did troubleshooter and still no problems shown. will this cause a problem

<p><strong>update: The driver dated 7/6/15 is installed according to device manager. I uninstalled and restarted and the same driver was installed after the restart but it is still hanging around in update with the install now button showing. Hit the install
 now button with same results. How the heck do I get it to go away in update ??&nbsp; Wish we had old update so things like this could be corrected. Again will this impact future build updates or security updates ????</strong></p>

    <title>Recovering an overwritten file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmeshenberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering an overwritten file</h2>
                    <p>Can&nbsp;I recover an earlier version of a Word file if I overwrote it and saved it with a new name? In Windows 10 I overwrote an earlier version of a file with a new one, i.e., I mistakenly replaced "volume &nbsp;1" with "volume 2," when I want to keep both versions.
 So far I checked for auto saved (.asd) files; there are none relevant. I use Carbonite for backup but it, too, saved only the current version, and there are no earlier versions to restore. Any other possible tricks or tips or is the previous version gone forever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you never set up the Windows 10 File History function, then your older version probably is permanently lost. At best, you may find a temporary file (*.tmp) somewhere on your drive that contains some of the old text.</p>

    <title>O365&#58; Mailbox Quarantine. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajay p_  say:</h3>
<h2>            O365&#58; Mailbox Quarantine.</h2>
                    <p>We just recently had one of our users mailboxes quarantined by Microsoft. It lasted a full 24 hour period. We are a global law firm that works in an industry where we often have same day deadlines. Clients of ours that tried to email this user thought he
 had been hacked (which reflects poorly on our firm), fired, etc. It's frustrating as Microsoft support said there was no way to lift the quarantine (as it was via O365 and not Exchange Server), and our company was made to look bad by the message generated
 in the Failed Delivery email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That email looks like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Your message wasn't delivered because the recipient's mailbox is quarantined. If the problem continues, please contact your email admin.</span></p>
<p>Can Microsoft do something about this generated message that doesn't make it looks so bad? Perhaps mention that it's something being done by Microsoft and will be sorted out after a 24 hour period. Anything to basically elaborate to make it sound like the
 recipient mailbox doesn't have a virus, infection, etc? I understand the need for quarantining a mailbox (although I've never seen it occur with O365), but the wording could at least be changed to make things sound less drastic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>No Microsoft isn't going to change the wording and I would hope they wouldn't people would need to be warned about a compromised mailbox.</p>

</p><p>What you are going to have to do as an organization is try to prevent the account from being taken over and used as a spam/malware bot.</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to have all the employees use Multi-Factor Authentication. That would go a long way to prevent this from happening in the future.</p>

            But the account wasn't taken over/used a spam/malware bot. When I contacted support they couldn't tell me why it was quarantined. They're monitoring the mailbox for the next two days to try and figure out why it happened. This is from o365, not Exchange.

            It looks like it had to do with synchronization errors. The user reported that right before his mailbox was quarantined he kept receiving a multitude of synchronization messages, and support confirmed that this could have been something that would have
 caused the mailbox to be quarantined, at no fault of the user. I agree that MFA is an excellent idea, just think it's mildly irritating that something like that could cause a quarantine.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to Convert DXF or DWG in Visio 2016 as an editable object</h2>
                    <p>I'm working with an architect who is unfamiliar with Visio, and I am not familiar with AutoCAD. I'm trying to convert a CAD file (had them export both a DXF and DWG file). When I right click on the drawing, to bring up the convert prompt, it takes about
 2 mins to load. After it loads, nothing happens. I then try to convert it again, and I notice the layers are now down to 2 (rather than 20-30 prior). So, I convert yet again... nothing happens. I cannot move, edit, or scale the drawing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried to ungroup and then the entire drawing and page disappeared. </p>

<p>What is&nbsp;DWG file format version (wiki article&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AutoCAD</a>)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newest version DWG 2018 file format became in March 2017 ! </p>
Probably Visio 2016 is not compartible with that file format ?

<p>The latest DXF file I'm trying to convert is saved down to 2010. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only different approach is I did was start with a blank drawing. I went to Insert &gt; CAD Drawing and unchecked the 3 lock boxes, so that I could at least move it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a select all, right click, and convert. but the pieces stay grouped together as one. I tried ungrouping it and then it looks like it disappears. I even tried doing a select all and it revealed the wire frame. so I tried adding strokes and fill colors,
 but to no avail. Nothing seems to want to parse out the group. I tried to do Ctrl Z to undo (undoing the Ungrouping) and now i'm left with an image with a big X in it.

<p>Another method i tried was just importing it, converting it, and then just saving and closing it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I re-open the visio file where my CAD drawing was, is just a white box with a black X icon over it. I cannot even see the drawing group.</p>

<h2>            Install home and Office 2016 for the MAC shows wrong account</h2>
                    <p>I tried Office 365 to verify that Excel could read my files. I cancelled right away and then bought MS Office 2016 Home and Student for the MAC. I accidentally made two separate accounts. When I install MS Office it never asks for my product key and claims
 it belongs to the other account as a 365 install. How can I get this copy to show up under the right account with the right programs and not be charged for the monthly fee?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>They did not charge me. I made sure the credit card was deleted before then. </p>
<p>I removed the 365 version of Office. Then i waited until the day after the "official" end of the 365 trial period and then tried to reinstall. All went well from there.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, I am having some difficulties this pm. I can log in into my account but cannot access my inbox. My wife logged into her inbox perfectly on the same computer. It's an imac, even though it shouldn't make any difference. How can an e-mail address
 be able to log in and another one not access its inbox. On nmy tablet and phone I am constantly logged, so i can still retrieve my mails but can't work from my mac.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 10 Has Stopped Working. Message keeps popping up. I can cancel it and keep on working, so it appears that Internet Explorer is not actually stopped working.</h2>
                    &nbsp;My computer had a virus and it has been wiped clean and then reloaded with windows 7 and a new virus protection system.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the reload the people who worked on the computer loaded Internet explorer 10 which I would have never loaded.&nbsp; Now I am experiencing
 the same problems that came with Version 9 and now 10.&nbsp; I want to be able to work on the internet with many screens open and not have to worry about this warning box popping up and telling me that the internet cannot be found and you need to close the box.&nbsp;
 And then it gets stuck in a loop and basically hoses your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; HELP PLEASE!!! I would rather go back to version 8 where there were no problems.&nbsp;

<p><br />
In fact, the options were all essentially diagnostics, so not necessarily intended to "work", just help you identify a cause of your symptom and then it would be up to you to figure out how to avoid it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the next possibility on that same tack would be booting in safe mode and seeing if your symptom would reproduce in that environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, it would imply that you normally have some programs in your Startup which are incompatible with the level
 of IE you have installed that you should either remove, disable or replace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Removal would be preferable because some program's hooks in the registry can cause problems even when they are not actually running.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then hopefully their uninstall procedure would
 repair such damage and let you use IE without further interference.</p>

<div>
<p>I tested the link should work, but seems it will download the Office 365/2019: Microsoft_Office_16.22_19021100_Installer.pkg.
</p>
<p>If you confirm this install package is what you are looking for, please close 3rd party apps to avoid confliction and
<span>try again,</span> or even use another browser.</p>
<p>

            Yes it is possible, but not user configurable. When in an occasion the phone memory becomes full during a bluetooth file transfer it will automatically redirect the file being sent to the memory card.<br />

That can be done only in S60 series. 5610XM is S40. I don't know any method to do that, but you can try the one suggested above existenceguest.

            The 5610 is an S40 3rd edition phone, it does not receive files over Bluetooth as messages like the N70 and other S60 phones do.<br />
<br />
As NJ15 says, they will go to the "received files" folder unless they are too big for the phone memory, in which case they are diverted straight to the card.

<h2>            Auto-populate data from Master sheet into separate tabs</h2>
                    <p>I would like to auto-populate the data from my Master sheet "Open Bookings" based on the customer to a separate tab for that customer. I have tried several formulas and VBA codes, but its not pulling the data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 15 customers, which means i'm currently having to manually input this data for every tab. If I could automate that process it would save me so much time. Thanks in advance, i've attached my worksheet.&nbsp;</p>
