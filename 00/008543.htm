<h2>            Deleting Skype contacts in Outlook permanently</h2>
                    <p>I want to delete all of my skype contacts from outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted all of the contacts in my contact list, but the skype ones won't delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the beta and tried, but they didn't allow it there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened my skype app on windows 10 and deleted all of them. I went back into outlook classic and they are all still there. I go into the beta and they are gone. I've logged out and logged back in. Restarted my machine. Logged out of all apps with my username
 and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do not show in the skype app. They do not show in the outlook.com beta.&nbsp; They DO show in the outlook app on windows 10, and they also show up in outlook.com classic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read things about hiding them, but I don't want to hide them, I want to delete them.&nbsp; These people are not people I want in my contact anymore at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened the outlook program to try to delete them as well and it says I cannot make changes to a read-only folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read something about syncing contacts, but no one goes into any detail, and all of the microsoft people that post just direct people to websites that don't even cover this topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello Mark_N13!&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your response.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon your request, I went into the people app, it does show the contacts that I see in the skype (plus more that I thought I had deleted as well), but when I right click on them, the "delete" option is dithered out. I did try to click once and then tap the
 delete key on the keyboard, but nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the people app, they are all tied to my hotmail.com account. I've only had the one hotmail address and only have the one email address associated to skype/windows/outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did also go into the Skype for Web link you posted and the contact list is completely empty.&nbsp; I went back into the outlook.com classic and it does still show they are there. I went into the outlook beta again as well, but they are not showing in that system.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back into the skype app in windows 10 to check, and there are no contacts there in the contact list at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd check one more spot, so I downloaded the skype for iphone app. I denied the app syncing with my contact list for my phone, and that contact list in the app also shows completely empty except for a bot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking of one more thing, these contacts are way back from my "windows live messenger" days. In the "people" portion of outlook.com classic, there are three options: Contacts (empty), Skype contacts (the ones I can't delete), and WindowsLive Contacts (just
 says downloading contacts and never changes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any further assistance you can give.&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Wait, so they are just there for all eternity and I cannot delete them ever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just supposed to imagine that they aren't there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go into the Outlook 2016 application they show up in my contact lists. If i try to delete them, it says I cannot make changes to a read-only folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is this correct?&nbsp; I can't delete contacts out of my own skype contact list? I do not want them there anymore. I do not associate with them any more.&nbsp; I have had my hotmail address since hotmail started.&nbsp; I can't just "not use" my skype contacts for the
 rest of time. What if I want to add new ones? Am I stuck looking at all of these people that I don't talk to anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you not even fix your own software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix the error. Put in a patch and get it over with.&nbsp; The Microsoft forums are full of people with this issue. It's obviously known by everyone that it's a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, yes, once you click Skype icon in the Outlook app or beta, your Skype contact should appear. You cannot delete the Skype contacts within the Outlook, but you should be able to do it on the Skype app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you've tried deleting the Skype contacts, which was successfully done and they are no longer showing even on a different device.&nbsp;However, in the Outlook the Skype contacts still appears.&nbsp;The Skype contacts on Outlook account should only
 appear if they are still present in Skype, but if they're already deleted then they should no longer appear in Outlook as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this case, I highly suggest to consult Outlook or Microsoft support first then let us know what will be the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your reply.</p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Basically, open Internet Explorer (not Microsoft Edge). Press F12. This will bring up the emulator tool.&nbsp;</span><span>Log in to outlook.com. Now, change the "User agent string" to Internet Explorer
 7. You should see something like this:</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now you can go to skype contacts and delete them as you would normally do. Also, by going to "Manage Contacts Folders" you can delete WindowsLive Contacts.
<span>Then return the user agent string back to Internet Explorer 11 and close the emulator.</span></p>

    <title>How did I end up RUNNING Win10 on this machine without burning a disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oneinchsidehopmulroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How did I end up RUNNING Win10 on this machine without burning a disk or anything&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I can't say that I'm upset, but it seems that it was applied as an update... to a whole new OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did agree to the Tech Preview and download the ISO, but I hadn't burned a disk yet. &nbsp;It seems that my copy of 7 was moved to ...\windows old\ and Win 10 became active- but there doesn't seem to be an option to rollback to 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Mike</p>

            <p>Some persons who signed up for the Insider Program who are running Windows 7 have reported being able to update through Windows Update.

            <p>The agreement you accepted at the beginning said it would be issuing new builds when available. This is test software, not the final release and it can be updated automatically and even removed from your computer at any time--not likely, but possible. That
 is why it is not an upgrade, just a preview. It expires on April 15, 2015 and you will have to upgrade to the final release or reinstall your previous version of windows. It should have been installed on a separate partition or diff drive. Be sure to make
 copies of your personal files on external media frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you downloaded the iso and ran setup.exe it installed win 10 over your windows 7. To return to 7 you will have to use the Recovery disks you made or install from win 7 installation disk. Booting to the disk you should have burned from the iso file would
 have enabled you to do a Custom Install and installed win 10 to a separate drive or partition. I agree that there should have been more warning about the automatic install.</p>

            When you say bells and whistles I know what you mean.&nbsp; I was involved with the testing of Win 8 and loved it but 10 has left me underwhelmed!!!.&nbsp; I have installed it on a stand alone laptop and still run 7 Ultimate and 8.1 on other laptops in the home.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I wait with baited breath the "improvements" promised with 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy.<br />

            I have to admit I was one of the (very) vocal critics of 8. &nbsp;If I needed use a tablet all day it'd be fine, but I just need to get work done, and for that I still have to be tied to a desktop. &nbsp;I'm hoping that 10 will be better/faster/stronger, not just
 "looks like a tablet!". &nbsp;I had to downgrade 200+ corporate PC's that came with 8 down to 7. &nbsp;I hope I never have to do that again.

<p>The Windows 10 Technical Preview is an early picture of the operating system at this time. Right now, this build is specifically targetted at Enterprise customers and making Windows 10 feel familiar enough for them to migrate from Windows 7 and take advantage
 of the many improvements that have been introduced since Windows 8/8.1 not only just for Touch, but also so the desktop. Microsoft release future builds in the future that are focused on the consumer improvements.

<p>
</p><p>Its interesting that you mentioned that the first build you saw was 9859. That's strange, did you really have Windows 7 installed or was it build 9841 of Windows 10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are coming from Windows 7, these are some of the immediate improvements you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Boot – Windows&nbsp;10 boots significantly faster than Windows 7, in fact on an SSD, I can have Windows&nbsp;10 up and running in 5 to 7 seconds.
</li><li>Fully Touch Ready – This has been a miss on prior versions of Windows going back to Windows XP Tablet PC edition. Windows 10 features a smart, fluid and fast interface that is significantly engineered for Touch called the Start Screen. There is just no
 disadvantage when using it with Touch. You can swipe, pan, zoom and do all the key actions expected on a Touch device. Microsoft has also created an environment that will encourage third party developers to create touch ready applications just for Windows
 10. These applications will not run on Windows 7. </li><li>Fully compatible with existing hardware and software. If it works with Vista or Windows 7, it is guaranteed to work with Windows 10.
</li><li>Tighter Internet integration – Windows 10 features a holistic integration with services that deliver information right to your screen without much need for you to find and discover it.
</li><li>The ability to sync information across multiple devices makes Windows 10 a truly Internet ready operating system.

<p>Closer to when the product is being finalized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is still a long way to go, there will be consumer optimized build, then one for developer improvements, then some further refinements after I am sure.</p>

<p>Thanks Andre</p>
<p>I was coming from 7 pro SP1, and the first build was just prior to 9860- &nbsp;I thought it was 9859 but I'll have to go find the logs to be sure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen some of those improvements yet- but I'm testing this on an old dog, Semperon 140 booting from a slowish HD. &nbsp;I'd like to see how it performs on legacy systems. &nbsp;Right now boot times are in the several minute range vs about 100 seconds under
 7. &nbsp;But it's only been a few days and I think it's updated every time I've rebooted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's nice that it's touch ready, but touch screens in a desktop environment (especially with audio and video editing) are a nightmare- that's why there are so many control surfaces designed for ProTools, etc. &nbsp;If I just wanted to put clips of my daughters
 dance recital on youtube, touch would be fine, but when you have to sync audio tracks it's just a nightmare. &nbsp;On production machines we've had to go through and disable all the swiping, zooming, etc. &nbsp;(Well, actually we ended up removing 8 and installing 7
 even after that.) It's great on my phone but not at work. &nbsp;I am hoping though that developers will start using the OS's default features rather than the proprietary means of doing it in the software, then again I REALLY don't want to have to repurchase editing
 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And from a work standpoint the LAST thing I want is tighter internet integration. &nbsp;There is nothing worse than a pre-master recording leaking out because it just happened to be linked to someone's blasted Facebook account. &nbsp;So much so that editing and production
 workstations have had all WiFi yanked and are hooked by Ethernet to a closed LAN. &nbsp;Anything in or out is on a HD- sneaker nets all over again. &nbsp;It may as well be 1990 with serial networks and floppies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I REALLY want this to be a good stable OS, just something that nuts-and-bolts works. &nbsp;And right now, EVERY grumpy, glitchy, pain in the neck proprietary surface, device and application has run without a hitch. &nbsp;Including 32bit programs that exploded in 64
 bit environments before. &nbsp;Even an old Amiga midi editor that has to run inside an emulator. &nbsp;For me, that is the most impressive thing that I could have seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just told that there is a free Photoshop app- &nbsp;I'm looking forward to browsing through the apps and finding toys. &nbsp;Damn, now I'm the one playing with bells and whistles and toys. &nbsp;Next thing you know I'm going replace the image on my desktop with a
 live feed of all the pictures of kittens in Pinterest.</p>

<p><strong>Solution - &nbsp;Download the 10041 ISO file and burn it to a DVD then re-install 10041 from it and the sound will work. Problem solved. I believe the audio driver in the ISO was updated. I did a Fresh Install by the way. When booting from the DVD you
 get an option to either keep you're programs and settings or do a New Install. I chose a new install. I noticed that doing a new install actually installed the OS 10041 a Lot Quicker then going from 9926 to 10041 thru Windows update which i originally did</strong></p>

            Im homeschooled and my computer told me it had an update so I let it do its stuff then when i came back and it was finished there was also no sound at all. I tried to almost everything in my power to fix this problem and an hour and a half later nothing
 fixed it. This update getting rid of my sound is screwing me because for my online school I need sound for LiveLessons and videos for classes. So if you know Microsoft if you want to try to fix this as fast as you can that might help.

            <p>Number 1.&nbsp; If you read you should know that you should not install the Preview on a computer that is being used for vital work as it is unstable and can crash the whole system at any time.</p>
<p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, you can only sync one calendar to your Pocket PC.&nbsp; The one that is called Calendar.</p>

<p>I believe there are 3rd party apps that will do what you want although I am not familiar with them.&nbsp; I will try to look into it and if there is a reasonable solution, I will get back to you.</p>

<p>I am looking to do the same thing for someone in our office.&nbsp; I have a few ideas, but still need to test them and some of the answer may require manual steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows moble can now show and sync&nbsp;multiple folders.&nbsp; I am hoping that if I add an additional calendar to my inbox and get the information from the shared calendar to that one (the manual process), I might be able to see both from the phone.&nbsp; I might be
 able to sync the two calendars in Outlook, but will have to find that answer somewhere too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is only possible with the newer versions of windows mobile so it might not work in your case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a thought that I am working on.</p>

                    <p>POSTING ON BEHALF OF A MICROSOFT CUSTOMER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The customer is using outlook.com. He is having an issue with dragging contacts from "To" to "CC" when replying all to an email. He is able to drag from "CC" to "To" but not the other way around. When he drags the name it is replaced with a URL.
</p>
<p>This picture shows dragging from "CC" to "To" is possible: <a href="http://sdrv.ms/RzT3ET" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            The issue here (Calida opened this on my behalf - thank you, Calida!), is that when I use "Reply All" to reply to an email that has various people in the To: and CC: fields, I can't move people from one field to the other using Outlook.com.&nbsp; Moving from
 CC: to To: generates a strange link, and Moving from To: to CC: is impossible because the dropdown from To: when I initiate the drag shows suggested users, which covers the CC: field.<br />
<br />
Sure, I can type the names in the field and do it that way, but I thought dragging from one field to another to rearrange the people getting the email would make more sense.<br />

            Thank you for the responses. &nbsp;This issue isn't about when to use Reply All - it's about moving contact between the To and CC fields in Outlook.com. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My original point was to inform support that there is an issue and that the current system is, at best, counter-intuitive, and at worst outright broken. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Using CTRL when dragging does not fix the problem. &nbsp;Changing the option to suggest only people in the contact list also is not working, as that is what is being suggested.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>I am aware of other methods of getting the same results. I can reply to one person and type everyone else in. I can leave the fields alone knowing it's still going to get to everyone. Those will both work. My point was that functionality that Outlook.com
 appears to be trying to support is not working correctly. &nbsp;If the workaround involves changing settings, holding down keys, or performing a task that is anything but the click-and-drag method that the system falsely appears to support, then it is something
 that probably needs to be looked at.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please reconsider the core issues here:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Moving a contact between To: and CC: (as in from To: to CC:) is not possible, due to the CC field being blocked by suggested contacts that appear when clicking on anything in the To: field.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) When moving a contact from CC: to To:, the resulting "contact card" that appears in To: is a link, not the contact. The contact is never moved.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h3> davefair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Network Adapter drops in build 10049</h2>
                    <p>Since I've upgraded to 10049 when it first hit, I've been experiencing occasional network drops where my NIC drops connection.&nbsp; Sometimes disabling/enabling the Ethernet adapter resolves the issue.&nbsp; Other times I have to reboot for it to reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say for sure, but it looks like it could be something to do with Project Spartan, because after using it for a while, that's when I seem to experience the issue the most.&nbsp; Going to refrain from using it all day today, to see if my issue goes away,
 just to try to narrow it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; I rebooted my machine, refrained from using Spartan and it just happened to me again as I was copying files to a network share.&nbsp; Tried to run the troubleshooting app but it hung.&nbsp; I rebooted, and the NIC was disabled.&nbsp; Re-enabled and back up and
 running.</p>

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage (testing environment), certain features might not work in the usual manner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now since windows 10 is in developing stage and there will be no specific drivers available for this operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to download the Ethernet Adaptor drivers from Manufacturer’s website and install it in
<strong>compatibility mode</strong>. Make sure you install the drivers according to the bit version of your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps to install a driver in compatibility mode:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Right click</strong> on the setup file of the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> Tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Let the driver to install and then check the functionality. </p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>

            Well, the exact make and model was in the title of the thread, so the answer is a&nbsp;Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; At any rate, I think I may have resolved the issue myself by deleting any remnants of a Cisco VPN app I was using and re-installing the network drivers.

            <p>The #REF Error is produced when a formula refers to a cell that's not valid..... therefore, what you are experiencing is to be expected. &nbsp;When you create a new sheet with the name you mentioned the formula in the cell will have to be confirmed again with
 the enter key in order to update the value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once, you have created your new sheet when you double click into the cell and confirm with enter the cell will be recalculated.</p>
<p><br />
A better option may be to do the reverse....create all of your sheets and then insert all of your formulas. &nbsp;This would prevent the manual portion of the process. &nbsp;This could be done using a macro, which would eliminate manual entry.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on how many formulas you have on your master sheet this may or may not be practical, but you can do what you want by using INDIRECT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create a column of the expected sheet names on your master sheet, and then refer to those using the INDIRECT formula, you can avoid the REF errors and the formulas will populate correctly when you create the sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See image below. In my example, Sheet1 and Sheet 2 already exist, sheets 3-5 do not. The formula in B2 is&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(ISERROR(INDIRECT(A2 &amp; "!B1",TRUE)),"",INDIRECT(A2 &amp; "!B1",TRUE)) and copied down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strictly speaking you don't need the INDIRECT and could just enter the IF formula to a non-existent sheet like so</p>
<p>=IF(ISERROR(Sheet1!B1,"",Sheet1!B1)</p>
<p>but doing it this way is a pain to enter because Excel will prompt you for a filename to reference all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>Compare two Excel Sheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ab_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compare two Excel Sheets</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two sheets that are more or less identical, i.e. they are "images" of the same sheet taken at different point in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any in-built function that allows me to compare both the sheets and highlight the cells that do not match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to write a 3rd sheet with comparison of every cell - as the sheet is quite complex with too many data + merged cells etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus something similar to a "Track Changes".</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Well, they claim to have added such a feature for <strong>specific versions </strong>
of Excel 2013: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/basic-tasks-in-spreadsheet-compare-HA102834117.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/basic-tasks-in-spreadsheet-compare-HA102834117.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could set up conditional formatting on one of the sheets as shown here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Chip Pearson has an add-in that is available from this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cpearson.com/Downloads/Downloads.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cpearson.com/Downloads/Downloads.aspx</a></p>
<p>scroll down in the upper-left list to find the Compare.Zip entry and grab that and see if it will work for you.</p>

            Try a soft reset to see if that works.&nbsp; If not, then I suggest doing a hard reset to bring it back to factory condition.&nbsp; That WILL do it.

<h2>            outlook 2013 will not work</h2>
                    I am frustrated beyond belief with Outlook 2013. I can not get it to open at all on one computer, it says " can not start, can not open, set of folders can not open, operation failed." I uninstalled and reinstalled the program twice and everything works
 but Outlook.....all I get is that error message.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On my other computer, I can open outlook and I set it up with my Gmail account but it stops working all the time, or only downloads part of my emails or freezes up......I am very very frustrated!!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried all the tips about removing all add ins, re setting up the account, etc etc but all these continues!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I see all the instructions about safe boot, etc etc and that is all beyond what I am capable of doing. I expect a product I bought which portayed itself as working with my emails to actually work when I install it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am about ready to give up and I really feel I wasted my money here since I can not return the product.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cany anyone advice in plain English why this is happening and how I can resolve it?&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows Defender can&#39;t remove HACKTool&#58;Win32&#47;AutoKMS</h2>
                    I used my Windows Defender to remove HACKTool:Win32/AutoKMS which it quarantines, but only for a few seconds and then it returns. &nbsp;My PC runs slower as a result. How can I get rid of this thing?

            <p><strong>HackTool:Win32/AutoKMS</strong> is a heuristic detection (from <em>Windows Defender</em>) designed to generically detect a
<em>hacking tool</em>. </p>
<p>Because this detection is generic, it means that the malicious behavior exhibited by files detected as HackTool:Win32/AutoKMS can vary from once instance of this detection to the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HackTool:Win32/AutoKMS it can be used to “<em>crack</em>” or <em>patch</em> unregistered copies of Microsoft software. We recommend that you don’t use hack-tools as they can be associated with malware or unwanted software. There have been plenty of cases
 in which we have seen malware distributed with these kind tools.</p>

            <p>WMP12 is included with Windows 10.&nbsp; It is only WMC that has been withdrawn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 10 Home, you can find it in the Start menu as Barry has already said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 10 Pro, you might first have to go to</p>
<p><em>Start </em>button [right-click on it], </p>
<p><em>Control panel</em>, </p>
<p><em>Programs&nbsp;&amp; features</em>, </p>
<p><em>Turn Windows features on or off,</em> </p>
<p>Set the checkbox for <em>Media features</em>. </p>
<p>Press <em>OK </em>a couple of times to complete </p>
<p>and then it will make you reboot for WMP to be loaded.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When your computer restarts, you'll find WMP in your <em>Start </em>menu.</p>

            <p>They did not abandon as others have pointed and I agree that Groove is less than an acceptable application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have been paying attention to some of the stories about the new MS goals, I think they are doing this for the new business model of subscriptions and the revenue stream that is possible through that model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, as soon as I can find my W7 disc, I will be going back to that. I had exactly ZERO problems with anything with W7. I have been an insider since Feb 2015.</p>

            <p>Sorry Lads. Sorted it.</p>
<p>Well me geeky son did. Turns out it was the Speaker driver what choked on its rusk on the transition. Apparently if WMP doesn't sense a speaker to play out of it locks up say "There's summat wrong with file or codec" when there's nothing of the sort as that
 list of codecs proves. Why not just say "Hey there's summat wrong with your speakers Jessie!" Developers {rolls eyes]. So Sonny Lad does a speaker health check and sure enough no stereo output. so off to Device Manager, finds the RealTech speaker driver, uninstalls
 it and then restarts the PC, and wizz bang, Bob's yur Uncle, the goddess tones of Hatsune Miku comes flowing out like on W7. The world's my oyster again. ^_^</p>
<p>Apologies to Microsoft for being a whingy Pom. </p>
<p>So for anyone else having this problem here's the PX:</p>
<p>Go to the little Windows logo[in Windows 10 ~_^] very bottom left in Task Bar and right click,</p>
<p>Click Control Panel then click Hardware and Sound,</p>
<p>On Sound list click Manage audio devices. a little window should appear with any and all your connected speakers listed. click on the one you use and then go down and click [configure],</p>
<p>another little window should appear saying Speaker Setup, with what looks like a drawing of you sitting in front of your speakers.
</p>
<p>Select what audio channels you use from the list [I use Stereo of course ^_^] and cursor over and click on one of the speakers.</p>
<p>If it works you'll hear a little tinkley sound, if not an anger little window appears saying "Speaker Test Failed" like I did. ^_^</p>
<p>So to fix failure go back to Control Panel and up to Device Manager and click on it.</p>
<p>On the list of devices find the one with "Sound, video, and games controllers" , and click,</p>
<p>Find the brand name of the speakers connected that have failed and right click.</p>
<p>Click [uninstall] and without fail restart your PC, laptop, whatever.</p>
<p>Wait for restart completion. Go to WMP and play something.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If that works for you send a thanks on a £10 note to my e-mail address, or simply say thanks.</p>
<p>If not, whinge at Microsoft.~_^</p>

<h2>            creating master documents</h2>
                    <p>We are attempting to create a master document from several word documents. &nbsp;We insert a section (next page) break at the end of the first document "try" to keep the page/section numbers as created for each document. &nbsp;Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.
 &nbsp; Our biggest problem is when adding or deleting sections within the created master document, it totally destroys all formatting, page/section numbering and we have to either start all over or go back and modify each page/section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are creating these documents for very large project bid specifications and it is typical to have to add/delete sections, pages, from a contract book.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Exactly what do you want to end up with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost certainly however, you may need to unlink the headers and footers in each of the documents from those in the preceeding section and this may require that you insert a Section Break at the beginning of the individual documents so that you can unlink
 the headers and footers in the rest of that document, rather than insert the Section Break at the end of the document.</p>

<h2>            Loading a Text Files Using Concordance Database Delimiters</h2>
                    I have a large number of text files that I need to manipulate with Access.&nbsp; They are exports from The Concordance database platform. The file delimiters are&nbsp;þ
 and (ascii 20).&nbsp; &nbsp;Access do not allow to import this characters.&nbsp; How can I make Access to load them correctly?&nbsp; I do not want to have to open each text files to manually change the delimiters on the text files.

Thank you&nbsp;

            Am not familiar with the LexisNexis Concordia database but according to their website, there are only 4 export file options  (Excel, CaseMap, Numerical data and Equivio)

Exporting Concordance data
https://help.lexisnexis.com/litigation/ac/cn_cl...

If the data was exported to Excel then there would be no issue with importing the data into Access

&gt;&gt;The file delimiters are þ and (ascii 20). Access do not allow to import this characters.

A little unclear if you're referencing "File" or "Field" delimiters but just for the sake of accuracy, delimiters are not imported but used to separate discrete data blocks. If this actually involves "field delimiters" then Access will only a single character to be used but not 2 (i.e. either  or þ but not both). 

Perhaps the quickest solution would be to get the data exported in Excel format (if possible)

Thank for your reply.&nbsp; Is not possible.&nbsp; We receive these files from different sources.&nbsp; Most of this data do not even comes from Lexis Database since there are other database systems that export the data with these delimiters.&nbsp; &nbsp;These delimiters are an
 standard of most Litigation Support systems.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(ascii 20) delimit the fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;þ is the Text qualifier.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I can manually change them for traditional ", or |^ but
 if any of these character are already on the data set then I cannot use them and I had to try with others.&nbsp; All that takes time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Years ago I saw someone that made Access to accept these delimiters by dealing with the system registry somehow.&nbsp; I did not had
 the chance to ask the person how he did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is an example of such a file:
þBegin ProductionþþEnd ProductionþþBegin Production Attachþ
þASI1627603þþASI1627603þþASI1627603þ
þASI1627604þþASI1627604þþASI1

            Apologize for the delay in responding but been spending a fair amount of time trying to track down the reference to a registry change to no avail. 
<br />
<br />Using the field delimiter character by itself is not an issue - just need to specify it but have not been able to locate any way to add a text qualifier character to the 3 available options of &lt;none&gt;, single and double quote. regardless of what that character is - whether using Access or Excel.
<br />
<br />Hopefully someone else will have more/better insight regarding text files coming from a Concordia database

<p><span>If you use an Exchange account, you don’t need to run the Outlook clients and Out of Office messages (OOF) will still work. If you are using a non-Exchange

2) Install all the updates.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I used to connect to Checkpoint SSL VPN to access my client's network where all the sites except outlook work perfectly. Not sure of the cause &amp; the place of the problem as it works without vpn. Without vpn my local ip is in 192.168.x.x &amp; after connecting
 vpn it changes to 172.16.x.x series ip provided the public ip to be the same.</p>
<p>Once i connect to the vpn, i get the client's dns addresses. Doing a tracert cleary shows that the IP is terminating at the outlook's public one. Could someone pls help to solve this weird issue?</p>

<p>Your solution worked. Thank You very much indeed. Could you kindly tell me what could corrupt&nbsp;the registry in this manner. Was it something I did or a Microsoft automatic&nbsp;update that got&nbsp;installed or perhaps a hardware error!</p>

            <p><strong>How will I know if my computer can run Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 system requirements are similar to Windows Vista and Windows 7 with some caveats:</p>
<p>1 GHz or faster processor <br />
1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) <br />
16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) <br />
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver <br />
Your processor (CPU) must support the following extensions: SSE2, NX, PAE</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Should I upgrade my existing version of Windows to Windows 10 Preview?</strong></p>
<span><span>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.</p>

With this new testing process, Microsoft is giving enthusiast access to pre-release code at pretty much the same rate as their internal testers.

Build 9879 will be last build for 2014, Microsoft will resume availability of newer builds starting in early 2015.

The expectation among users should be that they will either need to upgrade to final release or reinstall their previous version of Windows after they have completed their evaluation of the Preview. Microsoft officials recently indicated the intention of having the preview releases support upgrades to the final version. This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM. With the excitement surrounding the arrival of a new major release of Windows and the more public approach to testing Windows pre-release version in comparison to previous releases under development, a lot of persons who are normally not exposed to beta testing are jumping in without hesitation.
