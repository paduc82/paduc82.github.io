            <p>Hi Mayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately nothing can be done about the deleted items from Windows.old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to use the disc of the earlier operating system, if you want to revert back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, for further assistance please reply.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I do not want to revert back to the previous OS. I had some personal files which were saved in the primary drive by default, these files got deleted. I wanted to know if there is any way to recover those personal files.</p>

            <p>I too lost some personal files that I kept in the Windows.old folder- simply because I didn't KNOW there would be a reason to move them! &nbsp;If I had KNOWN beforehand from MICROSOFT that I needed to move them BEFORE the upgrade I would have! But I didn't KNOW
 because no one told me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would a Microsoft employee come to my house and re-rip over 200 DVDs so I can continue to use my computer to stream them to multiple devices in my house? Didn't think so.</p>

            <p>I think that they were not even saved in Windows.old, so I don't think you lost anything by it being deleted because they were never there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting thing to watch out for, if this is true (do a backup first!!!).&nbsp; I just looked in my Windows.old and there was nothing at all in its root, so I don't think it even tried to save anything it didn't recognize.&nbsp; Just program files, users, windows,
 recovery.&nbsp; If you had anything weird in the root, my guess is it didn't even try.&nbsp; If you had it in users, it would have been saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I check my root directory on the upgraded drive, all that stuff is still there so I am puzzled how you would loose anything.&nbsp; But it definitely isn't win Windows.old because it wasn't something it changed, at least for me.</p>

            <p>Hi Vinod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Windows Vista. When I installed Windows 8, it transferred my data to a folder called windows.old. After I installed Windows 10, it created another folder called windows.old.000. At that point, I had no idea that my data from there will be deleted automatically
 after a few (30 days what I read in the forums).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I can find both the windows.old and windows.old.000 folders and subfolders but none of my data/documents are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can retrieve that data?</p>

    <title>Install hangs at 32&#37; due to SEP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craiggjerde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install hangs at 32&#37; due to SEP</h2>
                    <div>I have spent dozens of hours trying to upgrade Windows 10 to 1607.<br />
I get to loading at 32% and it stops, telling me to remove SEP. I have removed SEP, but it seems to find more residual files. I have read through the web advice about removal of remnants, edited my registry, and looked for unwanted files. I have used wipeclean
 and wipe, several versions.</div>

<div>Background: I ran SEP until the university stopped providing updates to retired professors.<br />
I deleted SEP 12.something months ago. Somewhere along the line I had to reinstall WIndows 10 because of problems installing Paperport.
<br />
I am now booting from C. My old boot drive is still in my computer as drive F; it probably held old installations of SEP.&nbsp; I have looked for those files as well and run wipeclean on the F drive, as well.<br />
Bottom line:&nbsp; I cannot update Windows 10.</div>

<div>Suggestions. <br />
Provide me with a current version of SEP that I can install (if possible), install Windows 10 and then uninstall SEP.<br />
Tell me any other way to get rid of this SEP nightmare. I used to like the program.</div>



<div>I have an old system snapsnop that contains such:<br />

    <title>Skype Credits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephsfernandez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Credits</h2>
                    <p>After recently purchasing a subscription for Office 365, I also received 60 minutes of Skype credit as part of the deal. &nbsp;However, I have been unable to transfer this credit to my Skype account. &nbsp;The problem is two-fold:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;I have a current balance of HK$0.01 (that is Hong Kong Dollars) of skype credit. &nbsp;It might as well be ZERO, as one cannot make any call to any landline, even to a local Hong Kong tel. no. for just HK$0.01. &nbsp;In addition, I am not able to process a credit
 for the HK$0.01 or transfer this to another person.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;To transfer the 60 minutes credit to my skype account, I need to first link my skype account to my Microsoft account. &nbsp;However, for whatever reason, it is not possible to link my skype account to my Microsoft account if my skype account has available
 skype credit. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably the simplest solution would be for skype to adjust the skype balance to 0.00. &nbsp;There doesn't seem any other way to handle the HK$0.01 balance, and hence, no way for me to transfer the 60 minutes of skype credit I am entitled to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office 365 subscription comes with free 60 Skype minutes. This does not include any Skype credits, rather, it comes with free calling minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Icons are so small in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>HI,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo laptop with Windows 10 on it, and some icons in the Microsoft Office programs are so small that I can't even see them (see arrows in red, please, notice that I've&nbsp;zoomed in the image) You can hardly see the attachment icons and also check
 that picture&nbsp;selection&nbsp;frame indicators (little circles) are very small, so it makes difficult to modify or to crop&nbsp;a picture when making powerpoint presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just a sample, but it happens with all office programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts about how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jorge</p>

            Hi Jorge.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) Try repairing Office at Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Modify &gt; Repair.  
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Update the Screen Resolution to one that fits better at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />4) Adjust the scaling to one that looks better in the same location.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I use an HP Laserjet 1300, always worked fine with XP Pro. &nbsp;Upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro. &nbsp;Now I always get a extra page (blank) page when I print a document that has only 1 page. &nbsp;If the document has more than one page, it always print a blank page after
 the first page i.e if it is a 4 page document it prints out 5 pages with the 2nd page always blank?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic time zone detection doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    Hi, I've been managing the IT for a relatively large company for several years. I've done several hundred windows 10 installs, with a variety of installation media, and I've never seen automatic timezone detection work. I've done this on many different
 kinds of computers with different hardware, and in several different time zones. I've done it with several different versions of installers. This behavior is present in default clean installs which have never been on the internet, up until they're fully updated.
 This seems to only be fixed when I manually set the time zone. I know that you can in many cases make the auto detection start working by manually starting or restarting the associated service, but I don't really accept that as a fix because I shouldn't have
 to manually fix things that are broken by default in an operating system that I pay for. What makes this more frustrating is that this isn't an unsolvable problem by any means. It works fine on every Mac I work with, and in Li

<h2>            Explorer.exe crashes&#58; Windows cannot open the 32-bit extensible counter DLL ASP.NET_2.0.50727 in a 64-bit environment.</h2>
                    Windows 8 Explorer crashes on a regular basis - whenever trying to copy/work with any folder containing NEF (Nikon Digital 'negatives') - these can be hard drive or network drive or SDHC card based files - location doesn't seem to be a defining issue.
 Seems to be completely stable with folders of JPGs or other images.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem started occurring 5th July 2013 - and I rolled back the PC to a previous system restore point created automatically earlier that day (about 0330BST) thinking maybe an issue with an update. &nbsp;Hasn't resolved the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On looking at error logs (below) I can identify when Explorer.exe crashes and all preceding fails - but am running out of patience trying to figure out what/why this is crashing. &nbsp;System has been stable since build - and only in last 24 hours has their
 been any problems - and only where NEF image files are present!</div>

            The file which appears to be causing Explorer to crash is the MSVCR80.dll:<br />
<br />
<div><i>Faulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 6.2.9200.16433, time stamp: 0x50763312</i></div>
<div><i>Faulting module name: <b>MSVCR80.dll</b>, version: 8.0.50727.6910, time stamp: 0x4fee6687<br />
<br />
</i>However another, possibly third party, file may be at issue.<br />
<br />
For instance in the following thread it was the DivXMFSource.dl:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-keeps-crashing-and-restarting-on/8709a2c3-1995-4e41-a958-206bb5a5700f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-keeps-crashing-and-restarting-on/8709a2c3-1995-4e41-a958-206bb5a5700f</a>
<br />
<br />
it may be useful to try to capture a user-mode dump of the explorer.exe crash to try to get more info on the crash.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file, then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file at the time explorer.exe crashes should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><b>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00</b><br />
<br />
</em><br />
After Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:<br />

            Thanks Auggy for replying.
<div><br />
<div>I think I might have found the cause at about midnight last night - although only further testing will confirm...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Had recently (last weekend) installed Capture One's equivalent of Adobe Camera Raw and uninstalling that seems to have (at least for the moment) stopped the crashing problem. Have had Explorer windows open in the background for at least a couple of hours
 now with no apparent issues. Apart from windows updates was the last thing to be installed...</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have the option Reset, Refresh or Advance Options, you&nbsp;can perform system restore- Restore your computer to an earlier restore point before this problem occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Choose Advance Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f12%2fimage150.png" height="256" width="340" /><br />
</p>
<p>2. Choose System Restore</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f12%2fimage151.png" height="242" width="342" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Choose Next.</p>
<p>4. Click one of the available date and time (before you encountered the problem). Click Next and Finish, and Windows will roll back to the previous restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once System Restore is successful, your computer must be up and running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are a few things you can try if you’re having problems installing an update in Windows 10:
</p>
<p>•Check to make sure your PC is connected to the Internet. Some updates can’t be installed if you’re using a metered Internet connection.<br />
•If you’re connected the Internet and updates aren’t installed automatically, wait a few minutes and then try installing the updates manually.<br />
•Use the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Two earphones &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me if you can use two sets of earphones (Turtle Beach) on one xbox for split screen play also do you need an adapter for the chat facility so both players can use the mic on the earphones (2 into 1 or a splitter)?</p>
<p>I don't want to buy another set of Turtle Beach earphones if you can't.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Appreciate the 3 star feedback whoever gave it to me, don't see you helping out.<br />
<br />
Ok, so your X1 and X11 connect via dual RCA cables and the headset itself conncts into a 3.5mm jack (that green plug). The chat function is held by the controller and amplifier in the headset so that shouldnt be an issue. Make sure the voice chat is set to
 headset only. What you need to do is buy a 3.5mm stereo splitter. This will plug into the green jack that connects with the RCA cables. Both headsets then should be plugged into one end of the splitter. The amplifier on the headset should be more than enough
 to deal with the signal. This should allow you to both hear audio with each headset. For chat, just plug the headset into the appropriate controller. You should both each have your own chat channel, however, I cannot garuntee the chat working for both. I've
 tried in the past and chat has only worked on player 1. If it works then great. I can garuntee that the splitter should work and cost no more than $5.</p>

<p>Thanks Hellhog.</p>
<p>I'll give it a try over the next couple of days. &nbsp;I'm guessing that both headsets will produce both players sounds at the same time.</p>
<p>I'll drop a line on the results.</p>

<p>Ok so I have the same deal but I have a set of x41 and x12. The x12 are connected to the x41 for the 7.1 surround. W have separate gold acct. but unable to hear eachother. We have the receiver for the x41 connected top the output on the tv and we really
 want to make this work. We play a lot of multiplier splitscreen and is a pain to not hear one another thanks.</p>

<p>I have the AX360 from way back and I have two headsets for it and it's dolby decoder allows you to plug in two headsets. Playing splitscreen was incredibly annoying with both players sounds coming through. Just made positional audio effects confusing. Setting
 the 360 to output stereo only on my surround sound was a lot more manageable.</p>

<p>Official drivers for go 7300 are not supported on windows 10 but...</p>
<p>i had the same issue to overcome and finally after countless efforts i solved the puzzle!!</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>STEP</strong><strong> 1: </strong>Download and save (don't RUN) latest driver of geforce go 7300 (notebook) FOR Windows 7 64bit or 32bit (depending in which mode your OS runs) from official website.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">here is the link: <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/8972/en-us</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Right-click on the application file and select properties, under the compatibility label check the
<em><strong>{run this program in compatibility mod</strong><strong>e for}</strong></em> box, drop down the bar and select windows 7, also check the
<strong>{<em>Run this program as an administrator</em>}</strong> box, click apply and close window.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Install driver, ideally it shouldn't deny its installation, at least it didn't show me any warning message of incompatibility. when is done installing will ask you to restart your device, Do it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>STEP 4: </strong>Now here's the catch. as soon as your laptop restarts you will notice that it didn't install nvidia drivers, microsoft basic adapter is still installed. but...it has install them in your directory. to check,
 go: This PC/Local Disk (C:) (or whatever the letter of your main driver is)/NVIDIA/WinVista64 (32)/179.48 (latest version)/IS/Display.&nbsp; Inside Display folder are the drivers we looking for, but for now close the window and back to the desktop</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>STEP 5: </strong>Go to <em>Device Manager</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop down Display adapters field, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on <em>Microsoft basic display adapter</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <em>update driver software.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose
<em>browse my computer for driver software</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Click browse button on the right side</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate here: C:/NVIDIA/WinVista64/179.48/IS/Display</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Display folder and click OK</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>STEP 6:</strong> It will take some time until is done so be patient, don't be alert when it pops a incompatibility message up,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nvidia go 7300 drivers are fully installed and ready to go</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>STEP 7: </strong>Reboot your laptop and right-click anywhere on the desktop,, ideally among the other options now it will show the NVIDIA Control Panel field to choose.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">It worked perfectly on mine, i hope it does to you as well.</p>

<h2>            Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 not recognizing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a wireless mobile 6000 and I've had it for a long time now. &nbsp;Suddenly it just stopped recognizing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a USB 3.0 and a &nbsp;USB 2.0. The USB transceiver became quite hot after I took it out of the USB port. After just a minute, the USB will just get incredibly hot. That does not happen with the Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 that I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse does not have a button where you connect, it just has the on/off switch, and the button that pushes the USB transceiver out. (The mouse has a blue sensor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the Mouse and Keyboard Center but the mouse is not recognized by my PC or the software. But the Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 that I have is recognized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am comepleteIy sure that ALL of my USB ports are on because I have tried putting a USB of another mouse in and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read other problems about this mouse of the Microsoft Community but none of the answers are helping me! Someone please give me a solution that will actually help me and get the mouse to work again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Thanks, Harrison.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 does not sign users out when shutting down or restarting PC</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 10 Pro 1706.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two users on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When shutting down or restarting, Windows does not sign the user out.&nbsp; Get warning message "Someone else is still using the PC. If you shut down now, they could lose unsaved work."&nbsp; FYI, Task manager shows the User Status of that someone else as "Disconnected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems only logical that when one user shuts down the PC that that user would be signed out.&nbsp; We can go through extra steps of signing out and then shutdown the PC from the Windows logon screen but I don't know anyone who would think that it's an user
 friendly process.</p>
<p>

<h3> davido0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 CPU problems and IAStorDataSvc &#40;32 bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday. Love the new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is what my Task Manager has been looking something like this for the last few hours:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c71735e-0d5a-4589-98cc-903a69ddf2a2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The IAStorDataSvc is a process tied to Intel Rapid Storage Technology. I have an HP machine, I checked HP Support Assistance, Intel Driver Update Utility, and Windows Update, but all say I'm using the latest Intel drivers with no available updates. This
 process&nbsp;<strong>constantly </strong>uses between 30-45% of my CPU, even when all applications are closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Runtime Broker is (from my understanding) a certificate/security process tied to apps from the Windows Store. I can workaround that right now by just not using any Windows Store application. Which is terrible, because Groove Music is actually useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"System" is more sporadic, I haven't identified that yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on actions I can take on these issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey Kiran, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input. I'm running Windows Defender on my machine. I did check around and found I still had Malwarebytes installed - it wasn't running, so I doubt this caused anything. I uninstalled it, then turned off Windows Defender for good measure.
 Restarted my computer, (Windows Defender seemed to have turned itself back on) and the IAStorDataSvc problem was gone... for about 2 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Microsoft Safety Scanner and ran a full scan. It did not find any viruses, spyware, or other potentially unwanted software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did a full Scan with Windows Defender yesterday after I set up Windows 10, it found one suspicious keylogger, which I removed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth mentioning this isn't the only problem I'm having with my Intel drivers. A few hours ago my WiFi adapter just went crazy, connection only held for a few seconds every minute, and it couldn't find any more WiFi networks. Had to uninstall the driver
 "Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2230" reboot and Windows found and installed the driver correctly.

            <p>I have the same problem and did all the scan and couldn't find any virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From reading the&nbsp;threads on the net, many Win 8 users also had similar problems with high CPU usage by IAStorDataSvc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution seems to be a driver update from Intel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to the Intel website, there is a fresh driver for Intel Rapid Storage Technology for Windows 10 published on July 29th.&nbsp; However, there is no telling whether it will fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being, I just kill the process every time I boot up my laptop so the fan won't be running at top speed all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should incorporate the new Intel driver in one of the Windows updates ASAP&nbsp;if that addresses this issue.</p>

here's the Intel Rapid Storage drivers you were talking about.</a>&nbsp;I downloaded the most recent drivers from 7/29/15.</p>
<p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25165/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-RAID-Driver
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extracted, went to Device Manger, selected the Intel Chipset SATA RAID Controller (Under Storage controllers) manually pointed to the folder where I extracted those drivers. It installed something. Rebooted. Problem is still here. Interestingly (1) The driver
 date on the Intel Chipset says the Driver date is from 6/3/15, and (2)&nbsp;trying to install the driver from the folder again doesn't install anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will add that ending the IAStorDataSVC task does temporarily get rid of the problem, and disabling it doesn't have any apparent problems.

            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue of excessive CPU usage by the above file, which I never noticed prior the Windows 10 update. I understand from your above post, that the Intel driver update link didn't help solve the problem so I haven't gone ahead with it. Please
 advise if you come across any solution to this. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>@Kiran Kishore</strong> - Hi, I have an HP laptop too (Envy 4) and just upgraded my Windows 7 system to Windows 10. I skipped the upgrade to Windows 8 cause I read about some compatibility issues with HP Envy 4. I suspect this current issue might
 be an issue with HP only systems! (I may be wrong)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As is mentioned in the very first post by DavidO0, I too rely for any system/drivers updates on HP Support Assistant and Windows Update, both of which confirm that my system is up-to-date. I specifically downloaded the Intel Driver Update Utility, interestingly
 enough it neither said that the drivers are up-to-date nor that they require any updation. Post scanning, it just said 'No drivers were detected for your product'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I checked for virus as was suggested by you in your first post and I can confirm you that neither Norton Antivirus nor Microsoft Safety Scanner detected any virus on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Well I have figured out my upgrade issues to Windows 10 on my Alienware computer, they are all dealing with device drivers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I was having problems with NVIDIA 353.03 before the upgrade. The install happen through The NVIDIA Experience and my laptop would not boot correct running Windows 7. I had to reinstall the previous version of the driver and it work. The newer one still
 blanked out my screen but I was able to power down my laptop after waiting a few hours to ensure Windows 10 had installed. After that, the new driver works great.</li><li>Intel Rapid Storage (IAStorDataSvc) driver, if you have any Intel motherboard or chip-sets I would recommend running Intel® Driver Update Utility before installing Windows 10. I found the drive for my Raid Controller from 2012 (11.0.0.1032) was the latest
 for my laptop and no upgrades for any of the other devices were required. The Windows 10 upgrade will install a newer one from 2015 (13.2.0.1022). The latest driver caused very high CPU usage (around 20%) and high disk usage (between 16%/19%). I installed
 the original driver that the Intel tool recommended was the latest driver for my laptop and my disk issues were resolved.</li><li>I have two HP printers, one a laser Jet and the other an Ink Jet. Windows 10 is still trying to install updated drivers for my printers but the install carried over the drivers from my Windows 7. I still get error messages from Windows 10 about them but
 I just ignore them for now. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would watch out for drivers automatically updated through Windows 10 and be ready to reinstall the previous drivers used before the upgrade to Windows 10. I have a DVD from Alienware
 with all the old drivers my system came with and pulled what I need from there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That's my recommendation and it worked for me. My system is performing better on Windows 10 then it ever had under Vista. Remember, not all drivers are created the same or will work the
 same with different version of OS.</p>

            <p>I have Windows 10 running on a Sony All-in-one and have the same high cpu usage for iastordatasvc.</p>
<p>From reading different forum articles I decided to stop the service.</p>
<p>As soon as I did it rendered my all apps, search and Edge unusable. </p>
<p>I went back and turned the service on and everything was ok again.</p>
<p>I'm just not going to worry about the cpu usage as the speed is good anyway.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem since I upgraded to Windows 10, I fixed this by go to Intel Download Center download and installed the latest&nbsp;Intel Rapid Storage software again. It all went quiet again.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday. Love the new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is what my Task Manager has been looking something like this for the last few hours:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da929b15-410d-46ef-944a-c0def4baaaf9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The IAStorDataSvc is a process tied to Intel Rapid Storage Technology. I have an HP machine, I checked HP Support Assistance, Intel Driver Update Utility, and Windows Update, but all say I'm using the latest Intel drivers with no available updates. This
 process&nbsp;<strong>constantly </strong>uses between 30-45% of my CPU, even when all applications are closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Runtime Broker is (from my understanding) a certificate/security process tied to apps from the Windows Store. I can workaround that right now by just not using any Windows Store application. Which is terrible, because Groove Music is actually useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"System" is more sporadic, I haven't identified that yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on actions I can take on these issues?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Install of Windows XP with Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to reinstall windows onto my laptop as I think it had a virus.&nbsp; I have managed to reformat my hard disk and was trying to run FDISK but this didnt seem to recognise my Hard Disk (I think).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try and load Windows from my CD I get a blue screen saying</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer.&nbsp; If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check for viruses on your computer.&nbsp; Remove and newly installed hard drives or hard drive controllers. Check your hard drive to make sure it is
</p>
<p>properly configured and terminated.&nbsp; Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical information:</p>
<p>***STOP: 0x0000007B (0xF7c82524, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me as I am at a complete loss of what to try next.&nbsp; I did try and run chkdsk from a follpy disk of ms-dos 6.2 but this told me i should run scandisk instead which didnt has not resolved anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and i also tried a different Hard disk incase my original one was damaged but keep getting the same thing.&nbsp; Also the disk has had Windows XP on previously.</p>

            <p>It's possible that the laptop is designed for Windows Vista only. If there are no Windows XP drivers available for the hardware, you're out of luck. You will need to do some research to see if this Advent 5431 laptop has XP drivers available. This will get
 you started:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=advent+5431+xp+drivers&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=781l2625l0l4234l11l9l0l2l2l0l203l893l1.5.1l7l0&amp;oq=advent+5431+xp+drivers&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=advent+5431+xp+drivers&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=781l2625l0l4234l11l9l0l2l2l0l203l893l1.5.1l7l0&amp;oq=advent+5431+xp+drivers&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are indeed XP drivers available (you will need to obtain these first and have them on hand as they will need to be installed immediately after installing the OS), then your problem is the laptop likely needs you to input a floppy disk with the proper
 SATA drivers. If this is not an option, you can probably access the BIOS and alter a setting for the hard drive controller to IDE or "legacy" or something along those lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this is more a hardware issue than a Windows issue, you might be better off posting to an Advent laptop users forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that Vista might be the only option.</p>

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this(one if you have already run activation troubleshooter)
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi Murf5
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC or Motherboard, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />What you can try is this:
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

                    <p>So some time ago my computer crashed and i had to replace the hard drive. I gave it to a friend because I did not have the time to do it myself and when I got the computer back it started acting up. My computer would at random times do one of two things
 which are freeze up entirely for about 5 seconds and then unfreeze and play a weird robotic buzz sound, or it will play a loud buzzing sound and crash kinda like how a bsod works but not a bsod just a frozen screen and the only fix is to hold the power button.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This issue occurs randomly the last time i had the five second freeze was 20 minutes ago and has happened probably five times in the past week. However I the last time i crashed was maybe five days ago and literally iv had the computer crash three times
 in one day and then one time in two weeks its crazy.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Oh also my friend had to replace both ram cards because they were fried most likely a bad power cable.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>---- Five second freeze followed by buzzing sound and all is good.</p>
<p>---- Complete freeze and loud buzzing sound hard restart is only fix.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>computer repair changes</p>
<p>---- hard drive changed from 500 gig to 1 terabyte western digital.</p>
<p>---- ram cards replaced&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Computer info</p>
<p>---- Lenovo B570 Notebook</p>
<p>---- Intel I3 Pentium B950 duel core possessor 2.10 Ghz x2</p>
<p>---- 8 gigs of ram (originally had 4 upgrades to 8 then had crash and both replaced)</p>
<p>---- 1 terabyte&nbsp;hard drive Hester Digital (originally "500G 7200rpm SATA, Hitachi")</p>
<p>---- windows 7 ultimate 64 bit (originally windows 7 home premium 64 bit)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I don't know how this site works but IL probably get emails on reply's so I am a computer tech but this has stumped me to ask for any info you want I can easily get you cpu-z information and event logs.</p>

</p><p>If you realy need help, you have to provide us with as much information as possible, and that includes
<strong>all generated dump files(nothing more than 1 month old)</strong>and if need be,you can force the system to crash by Running driver verifier (DV) per the instructions in the link below.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Also <strong>Norton360 </strong>could be playing a big role in the lags and freezes so, for
<strong>temporary troubleshooting purposes,</strong> i would strongly suggest that you
<strong>uninstall Norton </strong>and <strong>relace it with Microsoft Security Essentials.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reinstall it later if the lags and freezes continue and we determine that Norton wasn't the issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and 0xc000021a error</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Earlier in the week I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;All was fine no problems for s few days until yesterday. I switched on the pc it loaded to start page and then crashed and couldn't do anything. &nbsp;I switched everything off but now I get the blue
 screen and error 0xc000021a and the continuous repair loop. &nbsp;I have tried to do system restore but there are no points to restore to. &nbsp;I can't get into safe mode as when I try that it doesn't seem to recognise that I am pressing f4. &nbsp;At the moment I am unable
 to use the pc at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have upgraded to windows 10 via the free upgrade link and don't have any previous windows software here due to various number of relocations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on how this be resolved please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Donna,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might occur if the system files are corrupt. I would suggest you to refer to the article and use the recovery options to troubleshoot the issue:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Recovery options in Windows 10</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>:
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you have a backup for your important files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you reset your PC within a month of your upgrade to Windows 10, the option in Settings that lets you go back to your previous version of Windows will no longer be available.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you go back to Windows 8.1, some apps that came with Windows, like Mail and People, might not work anymore. To fix them, reinstall them from the Store.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t see the Choose your option screen after restarting, your PC might not be set up to boot from media. Check your PC manufacturer’s website for info on how to boot from media or change your
 PC’s boot order. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you chose not to copy the recovery partition when creating your recovery drive on Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, you won't be able to use it to reinstall Windows.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you chose not to back up system files when you created your recovery drive on Windows 10, you won’t be able to use it to reinstall Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Power Brick issue</h2>
                    <p>My xbox one and its power brick keep turning off whenever im playing games. Usually happens when im playing with other people. I can barely play for an hour in some games before it turns off. I believe that the power brick is what is causig this issue. Is there anything I can do to fix this problem?</p>
