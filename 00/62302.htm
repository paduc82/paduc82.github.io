    <title>Can&#39;t sign into Xbox App, 0x80070520 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign into Xbox App, 0x80070520</h2>
                    <p>Hello, for about a month I've been completely unable to login to the XBox Service on my Windows 10 PC. I've tried every fix I could find online, nothing works. So, I attempt to login to the XBox App, normally, when I start it up, it loads a few seconds, then it immediately pops up with "We couldn't sign you into XBox Live. Please try again later." I've been "trying again later" for about a month now. If I choose to sign in with a different account and enter my account details, it'll go as far as the screen with your icon and the "Let's Play" button, but as soon as I hit said button, I get the error again. This is really starting to piss me off, because I'm completely unable to access items I've purchased in a game, nor play with friends. I also attempted calling support, but they were no help. I'm starting to get pissed off with this, and would really appreciate some help.</p><p><br /></p><p>Addendum:&nbsp;If I try to use a different microsoft account to sign in, it kicks me back to the

<p>This could be caused by many problems. Firstly, do you have a VPN? If so, disable it, and try again. If not, that is irrelevant. Second, do you have a proxy? If so, run command prompt as admin and type "netsh winhttp reset proxy" without the quotes. If not,
 that is irrelevant. Thirdly, do you have one drive currently 'active'? If so, disable it, and try again. If not, that is irrelevant. There are many other potential causes, but let me know how/if these work for you.</p>

    <title>Xbox one X download speeds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g doub1e u  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one X download speeds</h2>
                    When doing an update or dowloading a game, I’ve noticed that my console will lag behind on the downloading. My house upgraded to 500mb/s because of past ping/download difficulties. When testing network details. My console will say 180mb/s download. I understand
 that a console might not be able to pull that. Currently, I am looking at the queue for a 8.72gb download and it says 80mb/s. That is perfectly fine with me, but the problem I have is that the network in the bottom left of the queue climbs in increments of
 3-4 every second. So realistically its only download at roughly 4 mb/s. I’ve already cleared mac address and all the good jazz, but doesn’t seem to fix the problem.&nbsp;

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Are you connecting the console to the network through an ethernet cable or WiFi? The ethernet cord will give a better download speed. There are different categories of ethernet cords that allocate different
 speeds. An example is the CAT6 which allows a Gigabit of download speed. We recommend making sure there are no applications, games or other downloads that are active as this can slow down the overall download speed.&nbsp;The article entitled

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The procedure for turning off the Touchpad will vary between manufacturers, depending on what brand of touchpad is installed.</p>
<p>Try pressing&nbsp; <em>FN</em> + F7&nbsp; to turn it off.</p>
<p>If this doesn't&nbsp; work, look for a touchpad (Synaptics) icon in the Notification Area (next to the clock). If found, right click that icon and lok for a Disable option.</p>
<p>If it isn't there, open Control Panel and look for a Synaptics, Touchpad, or Mouse icon. Open that icon and look for the settings.</p>
<p>If none of this works, you may need to contact Acer Support for the instructions.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p><span>Hi peaches42,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Has
 the icons size increased as well?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the Operating System installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It could be possible that the screen resolution of the computer might have changed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check if the Display Quality of the computer
 is fine. Refer the below mentioned articles for the same.</span></p>
<p><span>For Windows Vista:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Ways-to-improve-display-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ways to improve display quality</a></span></p>
<p><span>For Windows 7:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Display-Quality-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Display Quality troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check if the screen resolution is configured
 correctly. Refer the below mentioned article.</span></p>
<p><span>For Windows Vista:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change screen resolution</a></span></p>
<p><span>For Windows 7:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change your screen resolution</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Also check if the DPI settings have changed (Dots
 per Inch)</span></p>
<p><span>For Windows Vista:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Make-the-text-on-your-screen-larger-or-smaller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make the text on your
 screen larger or smaller</a></span></p>
<p><span>For Windows 7:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-the-text-on-your-screen-larger-or-smaller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make the text on your screen
 larger or smaller</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help then check if there are
 any latest display drivers available for your computer. You may log on to the computer manufacturer`s website to check for the same. Check for all device driver updates and install the same.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>For Internet Explorer check if the text size
 has been increased.</span></p>

<h2>            Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 4000 stopped working&#63;</h2>
                    Yesterday I booted up my PC and mouse would not work - since then I have bought new batteries and tried re-installing drivers all to no avail.<br />
<br />
I cannot figure out what has happened - only thing I notice on the USB stick I plug in the light is a much dimmer green and has a rapid flickering now - am sure in past when it worked it was a bright solid green light when connected.<br />
<br />
Help????

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you need to <strong>resynchronize</strong> your mouse with the receiver.</p>
<p>The light from the <strong>receiver</strong> (USB stick) gives a rapid flickering light when it's trying to establish a wireless connection with your mouse.

            I tried the reconnecting buttons before posting here but wouldn't have it - have since given mouse to a work colleague to try on his machine who's confirmed it's kaput - his machine recognised it was there (device driver installed) but it would not work
 for him either.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I believe it hit its pre-determined shelf life and kill switch kicked in - I swear it's how things are designed to keep the consumer economies going - make us buy new things.&nbsp;

<h3> koersontap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup file sharing locked to &#34;Nobody&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I have two computers connected to a homegroup. Both of them can read files from the other, but neither can write or save. I would like to be able to share My Documents and My Pictures with read/write privileges. I have the homegroup set up to share all libraries,
 and I have public sharing turned on as well. Many of the answers I've seen say to find the folder in question, and click on the "share with" button on the top, then choose whichever option I'd want (I'm looking to set to homegroup read/write). However, the
 folders are all locked on "Nobody", and it won't let me change this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I could move all the files to the "Public" folder, but I would like to keep them in the location they're at. It seems to me there would have to be a way to let me share files, otherwise why have that button there in the first place?</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m Not Dead Yet Achievement</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry if something about this has already been posted, I have no idea how to use these new forums. &nbsp;But what exactly is the criteria for this achievement? &nbsp;I had a sliver of health (much less than 10%) and my opponent had over half remaining. &nbsp;I came back
 and won the round, yet no bloop? &nbsp;I was on Ranked as well. &nbsp;Anything I'm missing? &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Your opponent must have a full life bar and you must have only a sliver left. It makes this achievement very hard to get. Same with winning both rounds with the timer running out. It's nearly impossible.

<p>It's not that tough. The best thing to do is not attempt this unless you're playing an opponent that appears in-experienced. The let them back you in a corner and beat you to death. Then when you have a little health left, jump over them so they're cornered
 and just beat them senseless. That was the strategy I used and it worked out.</p>

                    When I make a txt file in a folder with the content: <br />
This is a testfile.<br />
<br />
And search for 'content:testfile', the file I just made shows up. But changing the search to 'content:estfile', doesn't give me that file as result. Even 'content:*estfile' doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Also if I change the file's extension to cs (a c# source file), it also doesn't work any more.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can I make this work on any file that has text in it (independent on what extension or perhaps select what extension should be searched) and how do I make wildcards work?<br />

            <p>You can make use of special syntax symbols.&nbsp; Here is a partial list from my notes.&nbsp; [Update:&nbsp; apparently the use of these symbols is limited to content searches done in non-indexed locations]</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>= equals sign:<span>&nbsp; </span>
only gives results for items whose searched property exactly equals the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Usage of = with properties whose possibilities are limited in some way by Windows is redundant because those properties are searched that way by default.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, kind:=picture give results no different from kind:picture.&nbsp; Note -- the content property can't use =.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>~ tilde:<span>&nbsp; </span>works as =, except it permits the use of wildcard characters (* and ?), described later in these notes.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>~= tilde and equals sign:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items that have the search text anywhere in the property, regardless of appearing at the start, within, or at the end of other text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Two tildes ~~ works same as the tilde and equals sign.&nbsp; Note -- wildcard characters do not work with ~=.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>[Update:&nbsp; the content property can&nbsp;properly use&nbsp;~=&nbsp;only when searching non-indexed locations]&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>So, you could search:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>content:~=estfile</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can use the ext: property in searching, as in:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">content:~=estile ext:(txt OR doc)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>About file extensions, content searching won't work will all file extensions.&nbsp; There are settings to adjust to allow content searching of file extensions.&nbsp; However, if the files use special encoding, then
 it might not work.&nbsp; Also, Windows 7 Search can't search extensionless files.&nbsp; From my notes:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>How to allow searching of contents of more file types:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Not all file types are searchable by their contents by default with Windows 7 Search.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For a file type to be searchable that way, its file extension must appear in a special list (in the Control Panel, Indexing Options, click the Advanced Options button, and click the File Types tab in the box that appears) and have a checkmark showing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the box beside the file extension in the list to place a checkmark there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the desired extension does not appear in the list, then type it into the box at the lower left and click the “Add new extension” button.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Given that the extension is in the list, click on it and see what setting appears under “How should this file be indexed?”; if necessary, click to put a dot beside “Index Properties and File Contents”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Regardless of whether or not you search within the indexed area, and whether or not you want to have a file type set for indexing, those Indexing Options settings are required for Windows 7 Search to be capable of searching the contents of more file
 types.<span>&nbsp; </span>For any new setting here, Windows 7 has to rebuild the index, and that can take many minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>File extensions can not be removed in the Indexing Options settings, but there is a way to make Windows 7 remove them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Run Registry Editor, click HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, find the file extension in the list that appears, rightclick on it, and click Delete in the menu that appears.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Upon the next startup of the computer, that deleted file extension will not show in the Indexing Options.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(Do not remove file extensions that you have not added yourself, because Windows 7 needs to have them in the Registry to use them for their purposes, not just for Windows 7 Search.)</span></span></p>

<h2>            Wireless keyboard not working</h2>
                    <p>My Microsoft Wireless Keyboard is not working. So far I have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Replaced the batteries.</p>
<p>2) Checked that the USB port is working. I switched to another anyway.</p>
<p>3) I checked the keyboard settings to ensure the Filter Key was off, it was.</p>
<p>4) I Reinstalled the driver in question, by uninstall, then restart.</p>
<p>5) I bought Driver Easy, installed all updated drivers, the keyboard was on the list of that updated.</p>
<p>6.) I cursed at the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, what else do I need to do? Last time this happened it was just the batteries. This time I think it's Windows 10. I am not a computer person, but I can follow instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

            Hi Jan, 
<br />
<br />Great troubleshooting thus far (including cursing at the machine :) 
<br />
<br />When did this start happening? Is it a wireless mouse/keyboard combo? Do you have the exact model number (5000, 7000, etc)? 
<br />
<br />Let’s give windows troubleshooter a shot. Click start, type “troubleshoot” and launch it. Choose Hardware and Devices, run it, then choose Keyboard, and run that one. See if they find anything. 
<br />
<br />Let’s start here, and we’ll continue troubleshooting. 
<br />

<p>Hi, Charles.</p>
<p>Thank you. We need compliments, nice conversations these days!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I did that too...old ladies have lousy memories. I'm not really familiar with Windows 10, and the box in one set of instructions on line said to type "troubleshooting" in didn't do anything, so I found another way by accident, and did the troubleshooting
 of both the hardware &amp; devices, and the keyboard. Both came up that my printer, was disabled, which it isn't, because I had to print out the instructions to do this troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got to go fix lunch for company...I'm in Italy...so I assume you are in the middle of the night somewhere.&nbsp; But I'll be back.&nbsp; I hope you are still there!</p>

            Absolutely! Great convos indeed! It’s 6:24 here on the east coast, I have an 11 month old... So I wake at 5 most days to get some quiet :) 
<br />
<br />Ok, so the troubleshooter failed us... 
<br />
<br />Click start, and type “device manager” and open it. Expand “keyboards” and then, Is there any chance you could send a screenshot to me? 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + PrntSc and a photo will save within a screenshot folder in your Pictures folder. Try to send over that picture and we’ll take a look. 
<br />
<br />PS - how do you log into your PC, does it log in automatically, or does your keyboard work at the login screen? 
<br />
<br />Sorry for the all the questions, but the more info I have the closer we’ll get to figuring this out. 
<br />
<br />PPS - do you have a wired keyboard we could use to test with as well?

<p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>Well, I'd typed a whole response, and lost it. Damn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, to answer your questions.&nbsp; It's a Microsoft Wireless Multimedia Keyboard 1.1, Model 1014. Yes, ancient like me. It has both the mouse and keyboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to take a screenshot, that's how I lost the previous note, trying to attach it, but figured it out.&nbsp; See below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I login through the login screen, had to use the keyboard on the laptop.&nbsp; One thing I noticed trying to use the wireless was it would type 2 letters, then stop. I tried using the CapsLock, because the 3rd letter is in Caps, and it continued to let me type
 after that, until I got the entire password in, but it always gave me an error code, and since I can't see the password typed, I gave up after several times trying that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re, do I have an old plug in keyboard, nope. That went to recycle a couple summers ago. If I'd known.....</p>
<p>

            Hi Jan, 
<br />
<br />Thank you for all the info, and the screenshot. Sorry you lost the response...
<br />
<br />Ok, so here's what I think we should do. Right click on Microsoft USB Dual.... driver, and uninstall. Once it's removed, unplug the USB. 
<br />
<br />Reboot. Once you log back in, plug in the USB adapter. Let's see if it automatically reinstalls, and you can then use the mouse/keyboard again. 
<br />
<br />Good luck, I'll be here!

<p>Hi,8 Charles,8 d sted.&nbsp; Well, merde. I did as you suggested, tried to use the keyboard, and you see what happened.&nbsp; Hit the space bar, got an 8, typed the first few words of this sentence, and you see response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday, the week has been bonkers after the huge storm, tree fell on passing neighbor &amp; car, just grateful they weren't killed like some others. If you're not available today to 'talk', I can wait. One thing Italy has taught
 me is patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you have more ideas! Would you know if the little 'egg' shaped gadget that runs the keyboard and mouse, that's plugged into the USB port, is supposed to have all 3 lights on? There are letters in boxes above the lights, and A, 1, and F. I don't know
 what they mean. The mouse has always continued to work, but the keyboard doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            Good morning from the states! I’m very happy no one was killed either, sheesh! I’m glad you’re ok as well. 
<br />
<br />I’m familiar with the egg shaped device you speak of, but I’m not sure of the light combo that is supposed to be on there. 
<br />
<br />I’m starting to think the keyboard may be kicking on us... but we can’t be sure without testing it on another machine. Do you have any other PC around you can test with? If you plugged it in, the mouse worked, and the keyboard exhibited the same behavior, we may be able to say, it’s the keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this is doable.

            So I was thinking try your wireless keyboard/mouse on another computer (laptop or desktop) to see if the problems happened there as well. 
<br />
<br />If you have another laptop that would turn on, you can try to test your keyboard on it...
<br />
<br />Good luck on the hunt, I’ll be here!

<p>Oops. Forgot to send earlier email. But I'm back. Found mice, speakers, enough cables and cords to pay for a vacation in wire (if it was copper), but no keyboards.
</p>
<p>If I'd known....I save everything else. Best I can offer is a the other laptop keyboard, but I doubt that will work???? I can call a friend and see if she has one I could borrow for a couple hours, but I think she's in the States. Will let you know.</p>

                    <p>I have tried several times to download my music from&nbsp;USB flash drive to Windows Media Player library in Windows 10 without success. I had Windows 7 earlier before updating to Windows 10 and the music was on Windows Media Player then.</p>
<p>Can I have help in accomplishing this project.? Also any chance of recovering the&nbsp; previous Player library before updating to Windows 10?</p>

<p>I have gone thru your suggestions above and failed each time. The folders would be moved from the flash drive&nbsp; to the library alright but as soon as the drive is removed the folders on the desktop as well as in the library would disappear.</p>
<p>Do not know why? Still interested in a possible solution.</p>

            Hello my name is Yohandi
<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to have your participation in the Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that you are having problems after installing the operating system updates, my recommendation is to uninstall the latest updates installed on your computer today.
<br />
<br />How to uninstall the updates?
<br />1- In Cortana write&gt; "Updates" and select the entry "View installed updates".
<br />
<br />2- The "Installed Updates" window will open, where you can see each and every installed update
<br />
<br />3- Here, the next thing you should do is look for the latest installed updates and click on each of these with the right button. In the context menu we will see the option "Uninstall".
<br />
<br />4- Click on it and, after a few seconds, the update will be uninstalled from the system.
<br />
<br />5- Restart the computer and, when restarting, the problems should have disappeared.
<br />
<br />When detecting that the patch is not installed, Windows will try to download and install it again, so we must pay attention to prevent this from happening, at least until Microsoft solves the problems, something that may take a few days.
<br />
<br />To prevent Windows from installing updates again it is recommended to disable automatic updates.
<br />
<br />Any other additional thing, you can create a new question.
<br />
<br />I wish you an excellent day! ;)
<br />
<br />Hope this can help you

            Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
<p><span>I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<p>1. Have you made any recent changes to your computer?</p>
2. When exactly do you receive this message?<br />
3. What is the complete error message you receive?<br />
<br />
<p>Let’s clean start the operating system and check if you get the error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We recommend you clean start the operating system to determine if other programs are interfering with this application. To do this, see this article on how to clean start your computer:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, follow the suggestions under
</span><span>“How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot”.
</span></p>
<br />
<span>Hope this helps.</span>

            Same thing here with 2 different scanners using the TWAIN driver.&nbsp; On my older Epson RX600 I get caught in a loop of server busy, click retry - nothing, click switch to, goes to the start screen.&nbsp; Got an HP all in one for Christmas.&nbsp; I still get the error,
 but at least the scan works.&nbsp; If I click retry after the scan finishes then it works fine.&nbsp; It's done this since I bought my new PC a year ago with Windows 8. Contrary to what MS will try to tell us, this is very common, as a basic Google search will uncover,
 and I'm not of the belief that it's a flaw in how Windows 8 handles TWAIN.&nbsp; At least I can actually get my new scanner to work without using my WinXP virtual machine, which was my work-around to use my old scanner.&nbsp; It'd be nice if MS would admit this and
 work on a fix rather than give useless advice to start with a clean OS start and hope users just give up.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One Power Brick Problem</h2>
                    <p>So, I've had my Xbox One for a couple of years, i actually got it right when it came out. It was working fine yesterday, but all of a sudden, it won't turn on. the light, the noise, nothing. i look at the power cable, and the power brick's light is orange. i looked on the power brick and it said that orange means standby. i looked online and they all said the same thing, "just unplug it and let it sit out for a couple of minutes." I've tried this many times and it is not working. what should i do?</p>

<p>Hi Anggie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message "Error: api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing" that you received when you attempted to download Adobe Photoshop Creative Cloud 2017 requires a specific Windows update to be installed on your Windows 8.1 computer that will allow you
 to complete the download and install the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update is for the Universal C Runtime (CRT) in Windows that enables CRT functionality on the Windows operating system. You can check the prerequisites required before you proceed with installing the necessary update in your computer on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and the article also contains the links to the file that you need to download depending on the Windows version you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response once you complete the steps.</p>

<p><span>This could be caused due to corrupted AMD Catalyst Control Center (CCC). Try these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Run the AMD cleanup tool to remove &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everything. See:

</span></li><li><span>Run the CCC installer and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explicitly install only the device driver.</span></li></ul>

            <p>&nbsp;You could try booting Windows 95 to Safe Mode, but then you'd need to figure out what to copy your files to.&nbsp; Windows 95 probably doesn't support flash drives, and your current system probably doesn't have a floppy drive.&nbsp; You could remove the hard drive
 from the old computer and put it in an external hard drive enclosure, then plug it into a USB port and copy onto the new computer.&nbsp; These enclosures a relatively inexpensive, usually under $30, and it's not difficult to remove the old drive and put it in the
 enclosure.&nbsp; Just be sure you get the right enclosure.&nbsp; New computers use SATA drives and the old one is probably IDE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<p>It isn't likely that&nbsp;your current antivirus&nbsp;software would recommend you to buy someone else's product if it found an infection&nbsp;and AFAIK IE does not have any in-built malware detection. So, not having seen the actual message that you are getting it does
 seem suspiciously like you may have visited a web page having one of those malicious&nbsp;scam pop-ups that try to induce you to click a link and end up actually installing the malware that it allegedly is warning you about. Or else&nbsp;get you to connect with a fake

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you receiving the message "Warning your computer has a virus...." and telling you to download McAfee or Norton? Have you tried scanning for viruses using your security system/app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I contacted my security system after several days of frustration they removed the virus and gave me the same advice Microsoft suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp; I had been invaded with a virus despite the fact that I had a security system.&nbsp; Lesson learned!&nbsp;

            Not all keyboards are compatible.&nbsp; That may be one that is not.&nbsp; You can try a hard reset EXACTLY like this to see if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for
 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.</span><span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with this issue. In relation to your keyboard, as Parity stated, it is possible that it isn't compatible at this time; however, it may become so in the future with the Xbox One console. You may wish to try connecting the keyboard
 via a different USB on your console to see if it makes a difference or contact the manufacturer directly for support to find out if their keyboard has the capability to work with the Xbox console. You may also reference our support article entitled
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/ease-of-access/mouse-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mouse and Keyboard Support on Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!</p>
