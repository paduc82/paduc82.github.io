<h2>            Camper or Rusher</h2>
                    
<p>What do you guys hate more; a teamate who constantly camps and only gets a handful of kills in core team deathmatch, or a rusher on capture the flag or domination that gets 40+ kills but never captures anything? Personally I can't stand losing a domination
 match when someone on my team goes 48-3 with no captures and only one defend, and that has happened a couple of times.</p>

<p>Let's see. What do I hate more? A player that goes 7-1 on TDM or a player that goes 48-3 with no caps and just one defend on Domination? Umm, are you stupid? I want both of the those guys on my team. The guy that went 48-3 on Domination made the other team's
 lives living hell during that game. If you weren't capping flags while he was slaughtering them then

<p>I prefer team mates that don't rush out and get themselves slaughtered. &nbsp;I have seen numerous games tonight like that. &nbsp;They rush out and get killed by someone camping. &nbsp;So, when they respawn what do they do? &nbsp;They rush right back to where they got killed
 to get killed again.</p>

<p>The only players I hate more than anything are the ones who play objective gametypes like they're team death matches and are strictly there for kills and kills only. Those types of players may lead everyone in kills, but usually end up losing because all
 they care about are their meaningless stats.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Your question is a bit vague. While you are pointing out the bad side of each player, you are leaving out the important part.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What good are they doing?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If a guy in tdm has few kills, but fewer deaths, he's a benefit to the team .</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If a guy isn't capping or defending, yet he is keeping the enemy occupied so someone else can do the capping, then he is a benefit also.</p>
<p>*********************</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; sure, either of those guys COULD be doing the team harm ........... but making generic complaints about a particular playstyle is nonsense. You could think of the best tactic according to your standards, and someone could surely mess it up, and you could
 think of the worst tactic, and someone could be highly beneficial using it.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Its not the tactic that you use, but how you use the tactic.</p>

<p>Kind of wondering how capping flags works when everybody on the other team is respawning at them?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>My post was directed at the Domination half. Not Capture the Flag. <i>Still though</i>, I'd much rather have them spawn over and over at the same place, flag or not, than randomly over the map. As for Domination, I can say I've played six or more games straight
 in Domination where we took two positions and never lost either one of them. <span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">
All the while not bothering to take the third position (why would you? Then the enemy can spawn anywhere).</span> Doing so had several players on the team w/ scores like 48-6 or 75-12 while only taking one or no positions. I'm guessing you can't say the same
 thing huh? There are different roles amongst some teams. Yesterday I went 25-20 with 4 bomb plants in Demolition. I was the sacrificial lamb. Did it bother me that there were players defending me that went 38-10 and no plants? Nope. I knew my teammates were
 building up kill streaks to support me.<i><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I think what this comes down to is you need teammates that communicate. Not randoms.</span></i></p>

I have it set up so it records my speech and all party chat perfectly clear.</p><p>The issue I am having is, after video is recorded the Windows App Game DVR tags all&nbsp; lips as "xbox" under game, so when I go to upload the clip it doesn't recognise it as a game. I can sometimes take&nbsp;the tag from a recording made on xbox and place that into my clips and then it can upload but this is a little annoying and not all gamea have a tag i can steal (PUBG for one).</p><p><br /></p><p>My question is, is there a way to get the windows app DVR to recognise games recorded while&nbsp;streaming from Xbox One so that I can upload them to xbox live.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have read that the beta version of the app used to have an option to select the game when you pressed upload but that seems to off been removed.&nbsp;

<br />
I assume you have admin rights. Yes ?<br />
I assume you tried to uninstall Adobe Reader in Programs and Features in Vista,&nbsp;or Add and Remove in XP ?<br />
What did it say when " it will not let " you. Error message ?

<h2>            Flash Professional CC not working on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I'm a character animation student and artist trying out other Adobe software and coming across some trouble.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5e251da-6c01-4df9-8b28-6886653615f9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of what's going on in my screen. When I use the brush tool in an attempt to draw, every stroke automatically becomes a really long, straight line. I can also only make dots if I tap the canvas without moving my pen to make a line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had similar problems with Photoshop CC's brush tool in the past, but it was simple to troubleshoot and search for a solution since there are lots of resources for Photoshop online. However, I've been struggling with searching&nbsp;for a solution for this problem
 with Flash. Are there add-ons or setting changes I need for my software or my pen in order to make this problem stop?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully a kind stranger on the forum will give me some assistance or advice!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello marshalmansglinger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your question about using Flash Professional CC on your Surface Pro 3. I'll do what I can to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a few questions to look into this further:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is your pen input erratic in other apps such as OneNote, FreshPaint, etc.?</li><li>Is it problematic only with the brush tool?</li><li>Have you tried installing the drivers as per Barb Bowman's advice? That's a solid suggestion.</li><li>If that doesn't work, have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software?</li></ol>
<p>Please let us know. I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Zack_T</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue with my Surface Pro 3 and Flash CC.</p>
<p>I tried to reinstall the drivers but it did not seem to work. I tried using other painting software and everything seems to be fine with them. I also uninstalled and installed Flash again.</p>
<p>This seems to be happening with the brush and the pencil tool. </p>

            I feel that it may be a Surface Pro Pen issue, because I used my finger to draw&nbsp;in Flash CC and it worked perfectly fine.

            SO has anyone found a fix for this yet as I am also having this issue. It actually didn't start for me until I installed the latest N-Trig Wintab drivers for me and then when I uninstalled them the strokes came out normally again, but also without the
 drivers I can't get access to the pressure sensitivity and tilt options for the brush,and the program just recognizes my pen as a mouse which makes drawing slightly annoying..

            <p>Dear Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I tried searching online how to use Windows 10 built in Keyboard to type Bangla. But I had no luck, could not find any good/detailed information about how to use this keyboard to type Bangla.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are third party software available for free from internet. These programs are easy, straight forward to use and also comes with detailed information how to use the program. But I wanted to use windows 10 built in Bangla keyboard. Because I use windows
 laptop, Surface RT, Windows Phone few different windows devices. It would be convenient for me to type and edit Bangla script on the go.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest me a place I could find more information how to type Bangla with windows 10 without any additional program or app.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about about the connection issues, I can definitely understand how frustrating this could be. &nbsp;I recommend trying a few troubleshooting steps to see if we can get this issue sorted.<br /><br /><strong>Please give the following steps a try:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, check out our<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Service Status</a>&nbsp;page for updates on any current service alerts.</li>
<li><span>If the issue you are experiencing does not pertain to the service alert, try power cycling your console.</span></li>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console is powered off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Wait 5 minutes and then plug in your console.</li>
<li>Power on your console and check to see if the issue continues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give the steps above a shot and if the issue continues, please let us know!</p>

                    <p>No patience for that! Just downloaded thunderbird from Mozilla and is working perfectly fine.</p>
<p>So my advise to whoever is experiencing the same problem is : download thunderbird!!!!</p>
<p>The design is a little bit different from windows live mail but at least it does the job!</p>
<p>Very disappointing with Microsoft, Hotmail is an email provider that belongs to Microsoft so it should be working fine with the windows live mail. But instead works with Mozilla firefox thunderbird. Funny enough, isn't it?</p>
<p>Anyway guys, here it is my advice!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>losing control over remote controlled PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            losing control over remote controlled PC</h2>
                    <p>sometimes i lose mouse &amp; keyboard control over remote controlled PC (Windows 10 home edition, my home PC).</p>
<p>most of the time remote control works fine, but if i open certain applications on the remote controlled PC (e.g. windows task manager, system settings, some 3rd party apps...), i suddenly lose control.</p>
<p>my work computer at my office is using different operating system so i do not use windows remote control function, but 3rd party applications. i tried plenty of apps but seems they all using same protocol or something so none of those solve the issue, I've
 tried turn off windows defender / config firewall inbound rules / mess with ports on my home PC and then turned off every security feature i can possibly look for on my office computer completely but none of these fixes it.</p>
<p>I even went net coffee where all PCs running on Windows 10 pro edition, had a tech staff with me and we didn't solve this either.<br />
would like to know if this issue already been addressed or did it only happened on me, and how do i do / where should I look to get rid of this issue.</p>

<h2>            WiFi SLEEP BUG&#33; Marvell Chip Doesn&#39;t Turn Off During Sleep Even When Windows 10 is Set to Disconnected Standby - Drains Battery</h2>
                    <p>I've set the Windows 10 power options to not stay connected to wifi while asleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I run a sleep study report, the #1 and #2 offenders keeping my sleep battery drain rates in the RED is always the Marvell Wifi Chip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did a test and put my Surface Book into Airplane Mode before sleeping. What do you know... Sleep Drain was CUT IN HALF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One can only conclude the WiFi chip is not being put to sleep during sleep, even though the device is set for DISCONNECTED standby.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For crying out loud Microsoft. When are you ever going to get sleep working properly without killing our battery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before anyone asks. Yes, all updates/firmware patches&nbsp;installed. Yes they all installed correctly.</p>

            I almost hate to say it because it will probably jinx my SB, but the latest one (my seventh exchange) is working properly so far in Sleep and Hibernate (about&nbsp;4 days now). Fingers crossed it remains stable. So I guess it is fair to say that there is hope.
 This one is lot 1552, so not even the latest manufacturing lot.

    <title>Xbox Live R.I.P. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> domph  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live R.I.P.</h2>
                    
<p>I have been an avid gamer for most of my life. I am now 33 and been playing online with Xbox for a very long time. Now I know some games suffer with LAG and all the other problems that go with online gaming. I have played online with the old Xbox, playing
 games like Halo 2 and Ghost Recon back when I had 1meg connection. I used to play with few problems and never once would a game have been unplayable for extended periods of time. Now, coming close on say 10 years later. With 30meg broadband and technology
 advancing at an amazing rate, things seem to have come to a halt.</p>
<p>Games have&nbsp;become so laggy that I am unable to hit my target let alone kill someone. MW3, Ghost Recon FS, Max Payne 3, Battlefield 3 and countless others. Now I dont claim to be pro or an awesome player, I just know that I can empty a mag, melee, knife or
 even grenade someone and nothing happens except for them turning round and dropping me before I know whats happend. The scenario happens more than once in every match in every game I have named above.</p>
<p>I dont know the ins and out of how it all works but I like to learn and I try to figure things out. I look up net optimization and opening ports and stable connections. I get on the phone to my ISP and I know my net is at its optimum set up. So the problem
 has to be Xbox Live or the games.</p>
<p>Games are expensive and now with the pre owend market being&nbsp;abused&nbsp;by online passes, plus paying for Xbox Live. I am becoming disolusioned and realizing I am being ripped off. I will not be renewing my Xbox Gold cause the service is not being monitored and
 enforced like it should be. Hackers and cheaters and games companys just leaving things to go to ruin. Over the past few months I find myself playing less and less online. I love my Xbox and online gaming, I just think enough is not being done for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you want to be told. What are your download and upload speeds? Have you considered upgrading your internet speeds, or just plain old joining a private match on CoD with a friend and seeing if you have this issue? Honestly, sometimes I think
 my internet is the issue, when it's really my lack of shooting skills. I've become better though.</p>

<p>You are all numb on here. Bunch of Lemmings and Fanboys. Do you not notice how much things change, If your willing to pay for a service that isnt as good as it used to be then that just proves how stupid you all are. I am not saying all games LAG, some have
 excellent CO-OP modes (Borderlands) and a few others. I gave up with the Xbox Community cause there are to many MORONS around.

            <p>Name calling is not going to get anyone anywhere. DOMPH, it may be a case of your modem, router and/or gateway may not be optimized as best it can be for the LIVE service. There are so many variables at work here that it would be difficult to pinpoint an issue without more information.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In my almost ten years on the LIVE service, I have always had the best experience with DHCP. With my various hardware setups over the years, opening/forwarding ports always created more hassles. Just my $.02</p>

<p>I understand your frustration. It sounds like your connection isn't the problem. &nbsp;I've also been gaming for 30+ years and I sometimes get burned out. &nbsp;When that happens, I will take a break from gaming for a couple of months. &nbsp;That usually helps. &nbsp;I also
 changed my mindset. &nbsp;I play for fun. &nbsp;If a game isn't fun, I don't play it. &nbsp;Some of the games you mentioned are filled with modders, campers, and little kids who like nothing better than griefing every other player in the game. &nbsp;Get a group of like-minded
 players and play private matches or co-op. &nbsp;</p>

<p>if people are cheating, you should try to get thier gamertag, time and date the game was played, then report it. about the lag you seem to have i don't understand why. i don't have that problem at all. everything seems as smooth as silk.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If needed you can uninstall the updates to see if they were the cause however the below should<br />
correct the issue.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

<br />
Then run checkdisk (chkdsk).<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>After the above : (</strong><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.)</strong></p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

            <p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that you are receiving this error and I appreciate the effort made towards trying to resolve the issue. Let me ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>When do you get this error?</li><li>Do you get this error while accessing any application related to any external device?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Do you get any error code along with the message?</li></ol>
<p>There are generally three different causes for CRITICAL STRUCTURE CORRUPTION errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. A driver has inadvertently, or deliberately, modified critical kernel code or data.</p>
<p>b. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A developer attempted to set a normal kernel breakpoint using a kernel debugger that was not attached when the system was started.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A hardware corruption occurred. For example, the kernel code or data could have been stored in memory that failed.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let's try the methods below and check if you still get this error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives etc.) except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
If this fixes the issue, then add the devices one after the other until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Once found the culprit, you can update&nbsp;driver software for that particular device.</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please download and install the latest drivers and chipset drivers from the manufactures’ website for Windows 8.1 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<p><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: </span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to boot into Safe Mode and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To start the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p><br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the <strong>‘Windows</strong> + <strong>C</strong>’ key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>Change</strong> <strong>PC</strong>
<strong>Settings</strong> and then <strong>General</strong>.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll down to <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>Startup</strong>, click

<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>
Options</strong>, <strong>Startup</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Restart</strong>, select <strong>Safe</strong> <strong>mode</strong> and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue does not persist in
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Safe Mode</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">, then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

    <title>How to stop &#34;Check Firewall Status&#34; notifications&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to stop &#34;Check Firewall Status&#34; notifications&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 continually harasses me about the firewall, posting a "Check Firewall Status" notification multiple times per day, even though my firewall settings are controlled by a domain policy, they are fine and there is no problem, and
<em>I can't do a darned thing about the settings</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turned off "Security and Maintenance" notifications in the Settings -&gt; Notifications &amp; Actions panel.</li><li>Turned off "Messages about network firewall" in Control Panel -&gt; Security and Maintenance.</li><li>Turned off "Messages about Internet security settings" in Control Panel -&gt; Security and Maintenance.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I may be disabling important stuff I need, just in order to stop Action Center from constantly begging for my attention because of a useless, time-wasting notification. In fact today I took the sub-optimal step of hiding Action Center, because
 so far it has only ever shown worthless notifications. I hope there never is a real notification I should see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ever found one correct way to stop the "Check Firewall Status" notification? Failing that, is there a way to write a program to watch for and clear a notification, based on its message text, as soon as it arrives?</p>

            Hi Charles_Jenkins 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Do you have any other firewall or antivirus program on that machine?
<br />Are you using a VPN?       
        </p>

            I'm protected by a company firewall and endpoint protection, but not using a VPN. It's a desktop machine at my office where firewall settings are controlled by policies--I can't change the settings, so there's no point in Windows interrupting my concentration
 three or five times a day telling me that I need to go check them.<br />
