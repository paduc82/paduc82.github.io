<h2>            In office, I can&#39;t copy and paste images</h2>
                    <p>In Office, anything I try to copy will only paste as unformatted text.&nbsp; If I copy a table, only the text will paste.&nbsp; This occurs in Outlook,&nbsp;Word, and Powerpoint.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if I copy an image and select "paste special" in Word, the only options are "Unformatted Text" or "Unformatted Unicode text", regardless of whether I copy an image or table.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ctrl V always gives&nbsp;just&nbsp;unformatted text.&nbsp; When I copy an image without text, nothing pastes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an option I need to check to reactivate normal copy &amp; paste?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd be extremely grateful of for suggestions.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Importing Excel into Access</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 10 Pro and Office 2016 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just completed an Excel spreadsheet with 349 entries, (all within 255 ch limit) and I've been trying to import it into Access but only the first 11 lines are visible one of which is the header cells.&nbsp; I've set Excel cells as all text, there are no special
 characters, no cells with the little green corner and I've set the print area to cover all of it. I've tried importing using a new database template and a contacts template but can't get anymore than the 11 lines down.&nbsp; I didn't have this problem with Office
 2010 or earlier so what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            It appears that you haven't specified that the first row contains the column headings, though whether this has a bearing on the fact that only 11 lines are being imported I can't say.&nbsp; The following is the relevant code snippet from my DecomposerDemo demo:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TransferType:=acImport, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TableName:="MasterTable", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FileName:=strPath, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>HasFieldNames:=True</strong><br />
<br />
You'll find the file as DecomposerDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates how to import non-normalized data from Excel into a table, which is then decomposed into a set of normalized related tables.<br />

            How did you execute the import?&nbsp; If it was through the user interface try doing in in code.&nbsp; The opening form of my DecomposerDemo file could easily be adapted to provide a general purpose tool for importing from Excel without the subsequent decomposition.&nbsp;
 Note, however, that the demo was originally written may years ago and uses Bill Wilson's class module to browse to the Excel file, so you'd need to add the module to your database.&nbsp; These days we'd use the FileDialog property of the Application object of course.<br />

            Thanks' for your prompt reply David. Publisher 2002/3 works slowly on win 10 but I can cope with that. However trying to open old publishing files from a cd aren't proving successful. Your idea of copying sounded great but altho it seems to copy? it will
 not allow me to paste???

            <p>You didn't answer all my questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Has this always happened or did it just start to happen?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Can you create, save and open new Pub files?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Did you try inserting your Pub 2003 installation CD when asked for the 'Pub MSI'?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of copy and paste try opening Windows Explorer or whatever it is called in Win10 and right click a .pub file, drag, and copy to your desktop or another folder on your hard drive where you can find them. You need to find a way to copy your files to
 your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you copy a Pub file to your hard drive, right click &gt; properties and uncheck 'read only' attribute.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Can you open your older .pub files once they are on your local hard drive?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Do you have access to your old computer and the original files?</em> Try sending one to your self via email or upload it to the cloud where you can access it or copy it to a USB thumb drive and then copy that file to the hard drive on your new computer.
<em>Can you open that pub file?</em> If so then you might have to abandon the CD method of transferring your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If none of the above helps then what level Service Patch have you installed?
</em>Open Publisher &gt; Help &gt; About Publisher. At the end of the first line you should have SP2 or SP3? If you don't have any service patch installed, then install the SP2 for Office 2003:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2003 SP2: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23424</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Save this SP for future use as MS has quit support for Office 2003 and you may not be able to access this SP in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are at it, download and save the Office 2003 SP3: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do NOT install SP3 at this point! It had some features that prevented Publisher from opening old pub files because of security concerns. In fact if you find that Publisher 2003 shows you have already installed SP3 after looking under Help, then you might
 want to unistall Pub 2003 (you can't uninstall just the SP), reinstall and install just SP2 and see if you can then open the pub files you have copied to your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully your problem will be solved when you manage to copy your files to your hard drive and you won't have to uninstall. But you can try the SP2 install and then SP3 if necessary.

<p>Hi David </p>
<p>My Publisher 2002 (I see it is) is compatible with Win 10 altho it works slowly. The CD I'm trying to open must be corrupted in some way as it lets me open to the individual&nbsp;files on it but won't go any further.?? I have tried sending and pasting to my hard
 drive but it won't. I even tried copying to another CD but no luck. I have decided to forget it and get on with life. The files I remember I have tried to reconstitute&nbsp;with some success so once again thanks for your help. Take care. George Murphy</p>

<h2>            How can I get the data OUT of my SharePoint lists&#63;</h2>
                    We are a Mac-only organization. I've created some SharePoint lists and populated them with data. However, Export to Excel gives only the query file, which doesn't work in Excel for Mac. The "workaround" says open it on Excel on Windows. This is not an
 option for us. How can we get our data out of SharePoint so that we can run reports, etc. It can be text as far as I care, just any format that can be opened by Excel.&nbsp;

            Someone else suggested to use Flow. I set up a trigger, then used Get Items (Sharepoint) and then Insert Row (Excel). So it pulls the Sharepoint data to an Excel workbook located on my OneDrive. This is a sufficient solution and relatively simple to implement.

    <title>Windows 10 Defender high CPU - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> average idiot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Defender high CPU</h2>
                    <p>After an awesome experience&nbsp;upgrading from 8.1 Pro&nbsp;to 10 on my Yoga3Pro, I discovered is Defender eating between 10-35% of my CPU, all the time, and between 350-500MB of memory. Blech!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannnow which showed no problems.</p>
<p>I used to have Norton anti-virus installed, the Windows 10 upgrade removed it. I do not have any other running anti-virus/malware software installed.</p>
<p>I added C:\Program Files\Defender\MsMpEng.exe to the exclusion list</p>
<p>When the file exclusion didn't work, I added the entire folder&nbsp;(C:\Program Files\Defender) to the exclusion list</p>
<p>I do not have any viruses or malware on my computer. (Please don't suggest I might, I know better.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to give Defender a try rather than shut it off and go back to a 3rd party solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note to the folks running the forum... you don't have 10 listed in the Windows Version list, so I stuck it under "Other". Also, there isn't a clear Topic to cover my question, perhaps a Topic like "performance" would be helpful.</p>

    <title>Office 365 2016 Excel thinks that a file is open but it is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eliese gabriel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 2016 Excel thinks that a file is open but it is not</h2>
                    <p>We have a user on Windows 7 using MS Office 365 2016 Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When she goes to open an .xlsxm document on our file server she gets the message from Excel that the File is already open.</p>
<p>The problem is that is IT IS NOT OPEN. We have looked for the temporary file on the SERVER as she was getting this message from excel and it most definitely is not there.&nbsp; The workaround thus far is that she clicks notify and then Excel will open the file
 for her. Interestingly, after she clicks notify, we see the "~somefilename.xlsm" file appear on the server. She can then edit it and save it just fine, but this is annoying for her.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple "repairs", the quick version and longer version requiring Internet connection, have been tried but they have not fixed the problem.&nbsp; What else should I be looking at?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any ideas.....</p>

            <p>It sounds like she had the file open when excel closed abnormally, either a crash or the power was turned off on the computer. This leaves the "lock" file behind. It is this lock file that is causing the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On her machine, with no spreadsheets open, in Excel, go to File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Save option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make note of the "Default local file location". Then open that folder on her machine.&nbsp; Look for a spreadsheet file with a name similar to the problem file replacing the first 2 letters with ~$.&nbsp; Delete it, and any others you may find.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could even do a global search on her machine for files with that naming convention and clean them all up.&nbsp; Or you could go old school and use this DOS command to delete all of these temp files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>del /s ~*.*,*.tmp</p>

            <p>That Idea makes perfect sense to me but when I go and look on her machine at the Default Save location there are absolutely no "Locked" files there.&nbsp; When I do a search for any locked files ~*.*,*.tmp I get nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made sure that I can "see" all hidden folders and files so I don't believe that I am missing them because they are hidden.&nbsp; I really don't think that they are there.&nbsp; They are also most definitely not on the server.</p>

            <p>OK, that is strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have her write down the full and exact error message text. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any pattern to when she gets this message? Ask her to pay attention to what is happening just before she got the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into File Menu &gt; Options command &gt; General option. Make sure that her name has been filled in in the "User Name" field. In many companies that field is often filled in with a generic corporate name making it impossible to track back to who has the file
 locked. With the field filled in properly you'll hopefully get an indication whether her machine is causing the error or someone else.

                    <p>This year when i attempted to view my emails from my iPad, a message came up saying ( password incorrect ) meaning i would need to verify my password again, i think this was caused due to someone else changing my password or it being locked, after realizing
 that my password was not working i attempted to recover the email address at www.hotmail.com but the account recovery system requires me to remember emails sent and received on that Hotmail which is mainly used to receive emails off websites. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

    <title>adodb connection error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreabez  say:</h3>
<h2>            adodb connection error</h2>
                    Hi, I'm the database person at a big company. I built a few MS Access databases which staff use daily. The company was still on XP and some of the computers still are. Some have been upgraded to windows 7 with ms office 2010. The database was still working
 fine. Last week some of the computers were upgraded to windows 7 with ms office 2013, now my access programs are broken. We tried to uninstall office 2013 and install office 2010, but this did not solve the problem. It chokes where I set my adodb connection
 like: set MyVar = new adodb.connection. The error is -2147024769 (8007007f) Automation error. The specified procedure could not be found. Can you please help, I'm desperate! We've tried quite a few things already, but nothing is working so far. THanks

            Hi Tom, thank you for answering. I've tried everything you describe there, I even opened a new database with only the adodb connection declaration and setting. Funny enough it is able to read the dim CNN as adodb.connection, but it chokes on set CNN =
 new adodb.connection. It is almost as if something other than the database is stopping it. The same database is working on all the computers with xp and windows 7, it is only those ones that were distributed on one day last week that has the problem, unfortunately
 it is a large number of computers! There are around 60 users and about 40 computers are affected.&nbsp;

<p>That does not surprise me. The "Dim" line only announces that there will be a variable of that type. The "New" line actually creates an object of that type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try CreateObject, and it will fail as well, but maybe, just maybe the error message may be more informative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also see about upgrading ADO somehow. Maybe there are updates available that have not yet been applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe you can switch to using DAO?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last resort would be to conclude that these computers were built incorrectly or using a faulty image. Wipe one clean and reinstall from scratch.</p>

<p>&gt; Funny enough it is able to read</p>
<p>That does not surprise me. The "Dim" line only announces that there will be a variable of that type. The "New" line actually creates an object of that type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I agree with your statement. If I don't have the correct libraries attached, it will give me a user defined error right on the Dim line. So, all I was really referring to, was that I had the correct libraries attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many things, also other ways to connect, however, the same database is working on 50+ other computers, only on a select number it did not work after upgrading to windows 7. In the long run we decided to re image those machines and that did take care
 of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you so much for your help!</p>

<h3> kozlowskim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Office 2016 to new computer</h2>
                    <p>Is this true? Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016 - This licence is married to the hardware it is initially installed on and is therefore non-tranferrable. &nbsp;So if I buy this and put it on a computer that then fails I cannot take it off and put it on
 a replacement computer?</p>
<p>But if I pay £110 more I can buy this instead: Microsoft Office Standard 2016 - Open Corporate Licence. And then it can be transferred. It seems unreasonable to have to pay so much more just to be able to move the software to a replacement computer.</p>

<h2>            Closing Hidden Form</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span>Hi, all. I am sorry if I’m asking too much here.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Situation:</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I have an application with a login form. Once you press the login button the login form is hidden (visible=False) to be
 able to pass the user id and user rights to other forms or reports. In order to close the application the user needs to press a button in the swithcboard but that is not possible because of the hidden form.</span><span><br />
<br />
<span>Question: How do I activate the hidden form to close once the switchboard close application button is hit? Example where do I put the code, I need this to implement security access level properly like the one below:</span></span></p>

<p class="contentStandard"><span>If</span><span>
</span><span>Forms!frmLogin!cboUser.Column(4) &lt;&gt; 2 Then</span></p>

<p class="contentStandard"><span>End</span><span>
</span><span>If</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><br />
If the login form is not active then the above code will not work, that is why I have to hide it instead of closing it by DoCmd.Close “frmLogin”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">The login form will remain open to enable the user navigate all forms or reports which he/she is authorized to until deciding to leave the app.</p>

<p>Are you using Switchboard Manager? The Exit Application option should close all forms. I'm not sure why this presents a problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running code in the On Close event of some of your forms and this code requires the Login form be open and Exit Application doesn't close forms in the proper order, you may need to relook at the close sequence or you may need to code a close function
 that is called from the switchboard.</p>

            <p>This should be straightforward... Rip the tracks from the CD to your music folder. WMP will automatically add the songs to its library. You can then create and save&nbsp;a playlist from the 'play' pane on the right.
</p>
<p>When you say original CD do you mean this is something created by you rather than a commercial release? If so - before you rip it you may want to edit in&nbsp;(by right-clicking) the individual fields (Album Title - Artist - Track Title etc. as shown (highlighted)
 below. Your PC will then remember that info when you next insert the disc. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

                    <p>When on Windows 8.1 for my Microsoft Lumina 640 XL my hotmail account was my primary account. I also had my work&nbsp;email and calendar synchronised to my&nbsp;phone so I could check this when needed.&nbsp; Previously&nbsp;I had access to all my hotmail contacts, calendar,
 email etc... Since upgrade to Windows 10 this morning, I had to reinstall my work account. I have now discovered that everything from my primary account (hotmail) is also missing. I have attempted to add this missing account, but even if&nbsp;I can see it in Accounts
 &gt; Email Accounts &gt; Accounts used by other apps, it is not synchronising any of my primary data.</p>
<p>How can I restore my hotmail account to my phone? I need my personal hotmail account to&nbsp;still be&nbsp;my primary account it contains all my contacts and personal calendar items (contacts is now&nbsp;empty).&nbsp;I certainly do not want to see work stuff on my personal
 phone (as defalut) unless&nbsp;I choose to look at it and&nbsp;I need all my contacts back :(</p>

<p>To access a "dead" N900 see the Flashing documentation more require a developer's license/agreement &nbsp;The device you see is the N900 running Maemo Linux and the Memory card. The N900 is mounted as "Nokia N900" on the ./MyDocs and the memory card is mounted
 at its root.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linux has file protection and you mount the memory as "user" &nbsp;and Linux will allow you to change your file ownership to anyone. As it comes out of the box the files are set with the right "uid". &nbsp;So make a script that you can run on memory cards that you
 remove and store it, simply change uid of the memory card, and then set it back when you insert th card, or change access mode to "no access" (0000).. Use "sudo".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N900 is not "cold", but runs Maemo. The OS will respond to the commands on the USB cable that connects it to your PC and does not need any drivers. It is Windows that inquire with Microsoft if there is newer drivers. Never install them as long as you
 can use the N900 in "Mass Storage mode" and regular USB memory sticks.If the hardware is not changed there is no need to install anything regardless what MS wants you to believe. In PC Suite mode, it will ask for the Nokia drivers. Connecting the USB will
 power-up the N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you consider drivers and change the N900, download a book about Linux. E.g. try Ubuntu on your PC so you learn the commands., how X/Windows is set-up, Then try ti install the full Debian on the N900, run OpenOffice and see how &nbsp;the Alsa mixer works
 here and compare with Ubuntu. Try make scripts, simple menus - because here you can get things done. Soon you will wonder why you run Windows on your PC..&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Reader friendly Collapsible headings in word</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing instructions for a group of people who will have varying abilities and I want to be able to use collapsible headings to limit the number of instructions for those who "get" it while still giving step by step instructions to those who don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how to use the collapsible headings, but I was wondering if there was a way on adding a button/link that readers can click on, rather than trying to explain that they need to click on the small grey triangle next to the heading (just more instructions
 to complicate things)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see to find anything on this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can tell them to right-click anywhere in the heading paragraph, click the Expand/Collapse item, and choose the Expand Heading (if the heading is collapsed) or Collapse Heading (if it's expanded). There are also commands there for Expand All Headings
 and Collapse All Headings, although those will be less useful for your students.</p>

<p>Thanks Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the people I will be writing instructions for will be technically challenged (the ones who get it won't need to expand the text) even adding your explanation will add another level of complication that may put people off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only writing instructions for people to download a document from one-drive, save it to their computer, edit it, then save it back to one-drive. For those that get it, it will be simple - for those that don't, starting with an explanation of how to expand
 text will probably just add confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping for something along the lines of "show more" "show less" that I seem to see quite often (although perhaps only on line)</p>

<p>Instead of inserting or removing tables as in the example you could insert/remove blocks of text, either hard coded or from the use of building blocks. The bare bones of the methodology is included in the example you can download from

<p>Any sort of "click here to show more" button in a Word document will involve a macro. (The ones you see online are part of the scripting in web pages, and they aren't available in Word.) For people who have no background in Word, getting though the thicket
 of enabling a macro to run may be even harder than explaining about a right-click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fundamental problem is that macros and active controls of all types are commonly abused by evildoers (yes, there is such a thing as evil). Microsoft's response to that is to disable macros unless specific criteria are met (e.g., a certificate from a
 "trusted publisher"), or the macro-containing document is stored in a "trusted location". These requirements aren't burdensome for users who know what they're doing, but they're even more mysterious to beginners than the idea of a command on a right-click
 menu.</p>

            This is incredibly scary. If you delete an alias make sure you will NEVER get important email there. Make sure no one will be able to hijack accounts associated with that alias. A lot of websites let you change passwords through confirmation emails.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Basically after 30 days someone else will be getting whatever email you have associated with that alias (if you don't first cover your tracks) if you're not lucky enough to grab the alias and make it a regular account. A lot of people want to make an alias
 a primary account because they like that alias's name. If they like the name, chances are that they are also getting semi-important email there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I understand Microsoft's reasoning for this (to free up email accounts), but this is a huge security risk.</div>

            <blockquote>how can i convert an outlook.com alias into a separate outlook.com account?
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>If you're going to do what these links suggest doing (delete the alias, wait 30 days, attempt to grab the alias as a regular account) make certain you don't have any important email that goes to that alias.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let's say you have an alias called *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and decide to delete it, but you signed up for a ton of forums, social networking sites, etc. If you don't make sure those sites never use that email again, after 30 days whoever owns that
 alias/account will start receiving those emails.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck!</div>

<strong>She said that someone had change the properties of the phone</strong> <strong>
and thus I need some additional setting</strong>. And the customer service had stopped support nokia or microsoft anymore. So I ask you how to set the phone to be normally received call since the first call. I asked this because sometimes somebody try to reach
 me for&nbsp; the importannt issues and they thought i might have been unavailable for that time. So they have to call somebody else to reach me or i miss that phone completeIy. I&nbsp;try to go to your supporting service in bangkok and it keeps moving and&nbsp;has stopped
 servicing.&nbsp; Normally I go to your customerr service, and they want me to post something in here and wait for the answer. Hope this might help me.</p>
