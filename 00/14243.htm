<p>When trying to add my domain to Office 365, at the CNAME stage, I get the response "Invalid Host Name" when I try to add "autodiscover.outlook.com" as an alias.&nbsp; I had a similar response at the MX stage, but got through it by resubmitting a TXT validation.&nbsp;
 My domain is hosted by 1and1 and I have created the sub-domain "autodiscover" as instructed.&nbsp; How do I resolve the issue?</p>

<h2>            DVD won&#39;t play &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I inserted a disc into an external drive and when the only notification that popped up was asking me if I wanted to go to the Windows Store for a DVD app or do nothing. I selected neither of these and opened up Windows Media Player to see if it would let
 me play the disc, and it had the disc (sorry if I'm using "disc" incorrectly and it's "disk") under "unknown disc". When I clicked on it, it said the disc had no content, but I know it does. Please help, I'm just trying to watch Psych because they took it
 off of Netflix!!!!!! :'(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank You!</p>

</p><p>*EDIT-* Just read something and realized Windows Media Player no longer is used, but I do not have Windows DVD Player installed for some reason and it's like frick-fracking $15 on the App Store!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Government vs Commercial Tenant</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current customer has recently purchased an Office 365 for the purpose of an email migration. Before the migration begins the customer want to verify at an administrator level if this is government or commercial tenant. How do we go about verifying this
 on an administrator level? Is there a way we can check the licensing of the tenant in the Office 365 tenant? If not how would we determine this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you still experiencing this issue? If yes, what Build are you currently running? The latest Fast Track Build of Windows 10 is Build 10532. If you are not running the latest build or have a really old build, you might want to check your settings in Windows
 Update to insure they were not reset to non-Insider settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!<br />

    <title>reversing mail going into unwanted folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cogo23  say:</h3>
<h2>            reversing mail going into unwanted folder</h2>
                    <p>Copies of my brother's emails from a different sort of email service to hotmail started coming through every few minutes loading up to hundreds of copies into my inbox. When I tried to filter out his emails I think it told me my junk email addresses were
 full, and said something along the line of putting his emails into an unwanted folder.&nbsp; This did set up a new folder called unwanted and his emails go there rather than my inbox but the problem with his emails coming as multiple copies has stopped, but I can't
 seem to reverse the filtering out of his emails to this unwanted folder. I can't find where to undo this setting.&nbsp; His address is not in the spam folder, and is entered twice in the safe senders list, but this filtering out still won't stop.&nbsp; Does anyone have
 any ideas how to reverse this?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Damian</p>

            how bout logging in to a desktop version of outlook and try to remove the said folder? make sure that your desktop application is synced so it will also affect the web version of outlook.

            <p>Thank Nadia,</p>
<p>I did that and then it created an 'unwanted' subfolder under the deleted folder tree.&nbsp; I then deleted this and it again created a main folder marked deleted.&nbsp; Was worth a try.</p>
<p>I then have wiped a lot of my spam emai addressess that were filling my spam address folder to the point that I could not add more, and I deleted some safe email addresses as well.&nbsp; And then I deleted and re-entered my brother's email address in the safe-sender
 list. Whether due to this or not, sometime around that time my brother's emails have started going back into my inbox. I don't think it coincided with exactly the same timing as my address fiddling, but either way seems to be working now.&nbsp; Thanks for your
 suggestions.</p>

    <title>Record Slide Show and the Animation Pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hilarynovacek bundt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Record Slide Show and the Animation Pane</h2>
                    When using the record slide show option to record a slide, the animation pane doesn't show the accurate start and stop of each animation- when you view it shows everything as starting at 0 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<b>Is there any way to get an accurate view of when things start and stop- especially within a very animation-heavy slide, without manually going through to adjust them?</b> Otherwise when we need to add something or update our slide, we have to re-record and
 it becomes very time consuming.<br />
<br />
In addition, we use powerpoint to design&nbsp; slides, record our animations and then convert them to Adobe Captivate for our online training modules.&nbsp; We are trying to record the animation to sync with vocal cues of 1-3 minute audio clips, so adjusting the animation
 manually has involved stop watches, lots of note-taking and way too many hours of our time.&nbsp; In addition, because the animation pane doesn't show the timings unless they are manual, Adobe Captivate won't recognize the timings.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There HAS to be a better way that does not involve a.) manually timing out the entire slide or b.) re-recording the slide anytime we need to make a tweak or a change.&nbsp; I have been researching and can't find an answer!<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!<br />

    <title>New text messages from same contact starting new threads when old - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjg225  say:</h3>
<h2>            New text messages from same contact starting new threads when old thread exists</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Nokia Lumia 520&nbsp; with 8.1 installed.&nbsp; Starting this afternoon, text messages from my contacts are starting new threads when old threads already exist.&nbsp; I've made no changes to my phone since last night that I can think of.&nbsp; Last night, messages
 were sent and received as normal in existing threads.&nbsp; Today, I messaged a few people through those existing threads, but their replies came back as new threads (all messages from the same person in a single new thread, not new threads for each message).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
None of the threads were group threads, and none of the messages came in as group threads with another person added.
<br />
<br />
I can send messages to the contacts through either the old or new threads.&nbsp; Deleting the threads and shutting off/restarting the phone provides no change.&nbsp; The problem just keeps happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; It's really annoying, especially since having message history is very important to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that you are experiencing some performance issue with your SMS. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the
<strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
 Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this helps. Thanks! </p>

            <p>Thank you for keeping us posted! </p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you to perform a hard reset on your Windows phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc&nbsp;will be removed from the phone. If
<strong>backup</strong> is turned on under Settings, you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account).
<strong>Note</strong> that resetting your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates. You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can turn on your device you can reset your phone under Settings: <strong>
Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone<br />
</strong>This procedure is described in more detailed in this <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/basics/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
official how-to article</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your phone is unresponsive and you can't reach <span><strong>Settings </strong>
</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />, you may be able to reset your phone using the hardware buttons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong> </span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />and
<span><strong>Power</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10–15 seconds).</li><li>
<p>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, and then immediately press and hold the
<span><strong>volume down</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until you see a large exclamation mark.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following four buttons in this order:
<span><strong>volume up</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f6bd43a94-9d17-4c2d-8124-ac977d0da8b5%2fhardware-icon-volumeUP-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,
<span><strong>volume down</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,
<span><strong>Power</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,

Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take
 a while for the reset to finish.)</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The hard reset operation will take a while to complete and will show spinning gears before it reboots your device to factory settings. Usually it will finish within 30 minutes but can, in some rare cases, take up to a couple of hours. Some older Nokia Lumia
 handsets have a bug where a reset never seems to finish. If that should happen to you, check this

wiki article</a> for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information could help you with your concern.</p>
<p>

            <p>Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read about the hard reset elsewhere.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I've read that Microsoft allows no way to actually interact with or confirm the existence of a backup of text messages.&nbsp; Basically, a user just has to take on faith that the text messages have been backed up and will be restored upon initializing a reset/new
 phone with the same Microsoft account.&nbsp; Is that actually the case or is there some way to know for sure that my text messages have been backed up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and security</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Nokia E5 main problems</h2>
                    
<p>I like my E5, but it has some problems I'd like Nokia would solve:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the build quality of the screen is very poor, you can easily scratch it</p>
<p>- the volume buttons, mainly the down one, are too hard to press</p>
<p>- the Facebook app updates the home and mail pages 1 over 30 times</p>
<p>- no way you can download the Chat app through SW update, Net Settings or Ovi Store, and anyway it only works with Ovi, which is strange since there is Contacts on Ovi preinstalled</p>
<p>- the radio has the same bug of E72, so when you listen to it the phone randomly restarts</p>
<p>- there's no screensaver</p>
<p>- the web browser doesn't work with&nbsp;the SmartConnect access point</p>
<p>- the Email client often doesn't sound or show icon when receiving new messages</p>
<p>- the Search app doesn't let you search throught the internet.</p>

<p><span>I would add the problem of management of the reception. </span><span>When you tap the phone with his hand, the reception line decreases until it disappears.
</span><span>If you do not touch the phone, it works well. </span><span>Do you do?
</span><span>This problem also exists for the E71.
</span><span>I know who have been sent by the Nokia software updates to fix this problem (E71).<br />

<p>I've had two E71 and they both had this problem (the so-called&nbsp;"hand effect"), but fortunately the E5 works well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it depends on your operator which doesn't provide a strong signal in your area.</p>

<br />
Shame really most on net i've found are mpeg and it would be good to download and play them just using the phone.

            You can use the Nokia Multimedia Manager and convert some the mentioned formats into the MP4 or 3gp format supported by the N95.

    <title>How can you maintain the consistency and proportion of the letters in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annedannerolle  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can you maintain the consistency and proportion of the letters in WordArt when you copy more than one&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a title in WordArt, and I would like to be able to copy and paste that title, then replace the words. But the words spread out to fill the whole space, thereby making the width of the letters out of proportion. This is a major fault with WordArt,
 as I have spent hours&nbsp;messing round trying to resize words exactly to match the ratio of the first title word. It would be easy to add a tool which allows you to keep the same width and height (proportion) for the letters, but there doesn't seem to be anything
 like this. This is 2013, and I would have thought Microsoft could have come up with something as simple as that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally... I can't find anyway to reduce the line spacing on WordArt, although this wouldn't be a problem if the above was solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you copy and paste a WordArt box and then change the text the WordArt box remains the same and the text changes to fit. If you want the same size text and spacing then insert a new WordArt box with the new text at your preferred font size and Publisher
 will insert a box that is sized for that text. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that Publisher is a page layout program and design element boxes or containers&nbsp;need to stay the same size to fit the layout so Publisher changes the content size vs. the box size to maintain the layout. The same is true of a text box. Change the
 amount of text, the font size etc and it does not change the text box size.</p>

<h2>            How to decrease heading levels by one and change titles to heading 1 globally</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Title style for chapter titles and Heading 1, 2, 3 for sub-chapters and paragraphs. I'm trying to generate Table of Contents, but the titles are not being included. It seems that I was not following required MS Word conventions of heading levels,
 so I would like to do so now. I would like to&nbsp;decrease heading levels by one and change title style to heading 1 globally in my document. Is there a way to do it?</p>

            <p>By default, the Title style has an outline level of 1 and would be included in the TOC at the same level (TOC 1) as Heading 1. You can edit the TOC to use TOC 2 for Heading 1, TOC 3 for Heading 2, and so on, but it probably is more sensible and straightforward
 to reassign the headings, starting at the bottom level.</p>

If you don't see Heading 4, there are ways to make it appear, but it's easier just to "demote" the heading level by pressing

            <p>Abdul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you are missing the point.&nbsp; He did not mention HomeGroup.&nbsp; There are many that do not use HomeGroup (including business clients).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What he is describing is being seen by many people that have upgraded from 10240 to 10586.&nbsp; I have about 10 PCs&nbsp; on 10586 that all have this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue:</p>
<p>After upgrading to Windows 10 1511 10586, PCs belonging to an assigned workgroup lose the ability to see all&nbsp;of the&nbsp;workgroup&nbsp;PCs when they open&nbsp;"Network" from File Explorer. They may see some PCs, but not others. Some cannot even see the name of the PC
 they are on. An example is the PC I am writing this post cannot see itself. This is not a HomeGroup issue. This is a networking issue. My Server 2008 R2 sees all PCs.&nbsp; My Win 7 WMC PC sees all PCs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 10 of my PCs were&nbsp;upgraded&nbsp;from 10240 to 10586. All PCs lost various levels to see the entire listing of PCs in the workgroup. My main "Insider" test PC had this issue. I did a wipe and reinstall of RTM 10240. All workgroup PC can now be seen.&nbsp; My</p>
<p>
</p><p>Super summary:</p>
<p>Windows 10 build 10240 Workgroup PC listing&nbsp;works... 10586 does not.</p>

<h2>            Windows phone 10, Windows 10 and syncing music. &#40;Itunes&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very general question.</p>
<p>How do you guys sync music to your windows phone? I used to use the "Windows phone app for desktop" but this doesn't work anymore. For WP10 there is in my eyes not one decent way to sync music with your phone. Especially when using Itunes. This is something
 people always use and it's like Microsoft just drops this aspect. This deserves much more attention in my eyes.</p>
<p>Syncing music on a Windows phone is, for me, an utter nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings.</p>

<h2>            iphone app disregarded my laptop Skype name</h2>
                    Can someone explain why my iPhone Skype set up assigned my email address as my Skype name, and disregarded the one I have had for years on my laptop? I don't want two profiles. Also, my profile picture should have shown up and didn't so I had to add a
 new one on the iPhone.&nbsp; I am concerned I now have two accounts, but with the same email and phone number. I don't want that. Help, anyone?&nbsp;

<div>There a couple of mismatched <i>&lt;mc:Choice&gt;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>&lt;w:ins&gt;</i> XML tags but I got them sorted out. The problem are was between the text

            <p>If you keep up with what is happening with the Windows 10 insider preview at some point in the next few months the preview will be the final release and if it is download through the Windows Insider App it will first download and install denim and then Windows
 10.&nbsp; I did this with insider 10166 but felt I did not feel it was ready for prime time and so I backed off to 8.1 Cyan.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with Microsoft today and they have no control over ATT releasing Denim.&nbsp; I have been told when 10 comes out the control of all releases will be up to Microsoft and so they will be on a much more rapid pace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you download the Windows 10 Insider app but do not run it yet.&nbsp; The current version of 10 is 10512 and I run that on a Lumina 635 with no problems, however that is a fairly basic phone so I can't test every thing.&nbsp; I am hoping for one or two
 more updates before I install it on my 920.</p>

<p>Hi Teo,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may be software related concern, given that the error code pertains to software update. To resolve this, we strongly suggest to perform a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. This method will not remove
 anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power button until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'Slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
We're just here if you have further questions.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Did not receive my Skype number</h2>
                    <p>I know this question has been asked before, but how do I find out my Skype number? I did not receive it in the confirmation email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read other responses that say to log into the account on the web, but when I do, my profile information is different from my app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I click the icon to get my Skype number, it gives me a number and says its $8 to sign up!!!! I already have an active account, so I have no idea why the web and app info don't align.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I accessed the web dashboard directly from the confirmation email, so I'm doubly confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
