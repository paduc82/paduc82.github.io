<h2>            Configuring spell check for two languages</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>I brought years ago Word 2000 in another country. It was in language of that other country.&nbsp;<br />
When I typed text in that other language in Word 2000, it showed me immediately the&nbsp;<br />
grammatical errors or typos of this language. When I type English in that Word&nbsp;<br />
2000 that I bought in the foreign country, it also showed me immediately the &nbsp;<br />
grammar errors and typos in English. The grammar speller worked on both&nbsp;<br />
languages. Word 2000 recognized immediately both languages.</p>
<p>Now I got Word 2010 that I bought in the USA. When I type English text&nbsp;<br />
in Word 2010, grammar speller works fine. When I type another language into Word&nbsp;<br />
2010, it doesn't correct any of these grammar mistakes or typos and the&nbsp;<br />
grammar speller does not work with any foreign language. Only English works.</p>
<p>What can I do that Word grammar speller work in BOTH languages?</p>
<p>Thanks you guy for any advice you can give me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Band 2 powers down and won&#39;t charge</h2>
                    <p>I . One in December of 2015 which failed in February and would not re charge. I never did register it so I did not try to get it fixed. I purchased the second one in February and it just did the same thing. It seems IMPOSSIBLE to get anyone on the phone.
 I can't go through the support registration and repair process because I cannot read the serial numbers. Not sure why I bought another after the first one failed but I did. I guess it is buyer beware.
</p>
<p>Has anyone been able too get in contact with Microsoft to get these fixed? </p>

<h3> late4ttime  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Upgrade- Office 2010 Install Error 1935 Nightmare...</h2>
                    <p>I have had 2 "Office 2010 Techs" remote in to my computer for 2.5 hours- only to tell me its a "Windows" problem, so I was given a phone number to the "Windows Tech" department.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had 3 "Windows Techs", including a floor Supervisor, remote into my computer from 430pm- 1030pm- 6HOURS!!</p>
<p>Not only were they not able to solve my problem in the 6 hours, at one point they left me unattended for an hour (I have saved all of these chats) around 1015pm (5.5 hour mark) I asked what was next and was told that he needed to repair the .net framework,
 but it wasn't available so he was going to try a couple of different things to fix it- I said ok, thanks- I do need to be in bed my 12am PST as I have to work tomorrow, OK- he says. Then there was nothing- UNTIL BOTH TECHS ON THE CHAT TURNED OFF THEIR SERVICE
 at 1030pm! After 6 hours, and I don't even have a case number for a reference for the next person!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'll have to wait for the next level 1 tech to try the same dozen things the previous 5 tried for who knows how long before they will realize my issue is above their pay grade.&nbsp; I'm very frustrated about this experience and this compatibility issue with
 Microsoft between their own software!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Issue-</p>
<p>I upgraded from 8.1 to Win 10 after a few attempts using the Win 10 updater.</p>
<p>This caused me have a Single Image 2010 error whenever I tried to open anything. So I did an uninstall of Office 2010- restarted my computer- tried to replicate the error and I couldn't so-
</p>
<p>I then started an Office 2010 re-install- about 60% thru the installation- I get an Error 1935 and a roll back.</p>
<p>Ran CCleaner- then tried it again- same error.</p>
<p>Researched the problem online- ahh, .net framework- repair, did it- error 1935.</p>
<p>Updated framework download- program said its already part of my OS- installation isn't necessary- so it stops installing.</p>
<p>Tried to regedit the registry size- only its not listed in the control section</p>
<p>DISM- done, scannow done, both fine - still got an error 1935</p>
<p>Re-installed Win 10 from an image on USB- tried Office- Error 1935</p>
<p>Downloaded Office 2010 from the store with my product key- installed-error 1935</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I've watched the techs do the same things- for 8.5 hours. AND- I'll get to watch it some more, because the team of techs tonight- got tired of working on my issue before they fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the techs suggested I just go back to 8.1 and not use Win 10- yet another asked why I don't spend $399 for Office 2016- really?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know why after 6 hours tonight, the techs just left me there and shut off their connection? That's HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know why Office 2010 worked just fine with 8.1, but doesn't work with Win 10 when they are supposed to be compatible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how 5 trained techs can spend a combined 8.5 hours inside my computer and not accomplish anything?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix an error 1935? (I'm pretty certain the error is in the .net framework somewhere, and so are the Office Techs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone above a level 1 window tech is interested in providing some good customer service and will take the time to help me with this Office 2010 install issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading my rant.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am sorry to know that you are receiving a 1935 error while installing Office 2010 after upgrading to Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 10, is your Windows 10 activated?</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then use the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool and upgrade to Windows.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In order to resolve this issue I suggest you to download Windows 10 from the ISO file again and then use the media creation tool to download it to the flash drive or DVD.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Excel 2003 &#47; OWC 11 Html format from Excel 2007 &#63;</h2>
                    <div>Hi, I wonder if there is a solution to save Excel sheets for OWC 11 html format from Excel 2007 : Excel 2007 can open theses files, but his Html format is not compatible with OWC 11 after saving from Excel 2007 : Is there a solution, or an external tool,
 or must we use a 2003 version of Excel ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is a service pack, but the html is twice bigger than the "true" 2003 one, and if we can effectively see the result in OWC 2003, it seems to freeze the tab that contains the OWC in my application (the mouse pointer stays on waiting), and when we select
 one cell after one, the whole page becomes to black progressively : there is a big bug using Excel 2007 for OWC 2003 Html, even with this SP1 :</div>

    <title>How do I recover a word document I accidentally saved over&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I recover a word document I accidentally saved over&#63;</h2>
                    I'm working on a book and as backup I wanted to save it to a flash drive as well. So I saved it to a simple flash drive. Well, I worked on it some more, saved it in my word document, and then I wanted to save the new copy to my flash drive. So I dragged
 it over to my flash drive, and clicked on the move and copy option. I thought it was going to move my newest copy over to my flash drive and overwrite my old copy, but instead it saved my old copy (the one that was on the flash drive) over my newest copy (the
 one I had saved in my documents). Is there anyway I can recover what I accidentally saved over, and why did this happen in the first place?

            <p>I am not sure why what you describe happened, but you should be very careful working with Flash Drives and never save to them directly from Word or open a document from them in Word.</p>

            In the version of Windows I use, when I try to overwrite a file that already exists, Windows will pop up a query giving the date, time, and size of both files and asking what I want to do.<br />
<br />
Using SaveAs in Word does not give this amount of detail and should NEVER be used to save to a flash drive or other removable media. You should never work within Word on anything on mobile media. Period.<br />
<br />
The brief answer to your question is you re-do your work assuming you have closed out everything.<br />

<p>Hi JosueLaborde,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the error message, it seems your organization hasn't enabled self-service password reset for normal users. And as told, you cannot solve this issue if you use an user account since only the admins in your organization have the permission to reset the
 password for you or enable self-service password reset feature. In this scenario, you can try to contact the admins in your organization for the further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<h2>            how can I customize right-click menu in MS Word 2010</h2>
                    Hello, I know there has been a site that gave a general example, but more concrete, how can I customize the right click menu for MS Word 2010? Is there an easy way or only a difficult one with macro's for every icon I want to add or delete? I was thinking
 about adding text (for table of contents) and update table of contents, but I could think of more.
<div>Would it be possible for people like us who are 'scared' of programming to give a step by step approach?</div>

            I expect Greg Maxey will come along to help out here, but for an introduction you can read his page at
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/customize_shortcut_menu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/customize_shortcut_menu.html</a>.<br />
<br />
If the actions you want to add to the menu are just built-in ones, then you don't have to write macros to carry out those actions -- you can put in items using the built-in ID numbers as Greg does for "Bookmark" and "New Comment". But you will need at least
 the one macro (in Greg's example, Sub BuildControls) to insert those items into the right-click menu.<br />
<br />
There's another complication that Greg's page mentions but doesn't cover in any detail: Word has lots of different right-click menus. The one he uses, the "Text" menu, is the one you get when you right-click plain ordinary text. But there are other ones for
 when you right-click a table, or a picture, or any one of a dozen or more other things that might be in a document.<br />
<br />
If you're 'scared' of programming (sorry, not something that I've ever experienced), it might be best to describe in detail what you want to do, and get someone else to write the macro for you -- and maybe explain how it works so you can tweak it if necessary.<br />

            Yes it is trivially easy to add and delete macros.<br />
<br />
http://word.tips.net/T000986_Deleting_a_Macro.html<br />
<br />
You won't damage settings by adding or removing macros. At worst you will temporarily override a command if you name your macro with the underlying command name.<br />

            No. It's a Word 2007/2010 feature. When saving to 97-2003 format, the content controls are converted into static content. A good reason, perhaps, to move to .docx format.

<h3> swelch3579  say:</h3>
<h2>            Group Email Limits</h2>
                    I was trying to send a group email to 10 recipients from my outlook.com mail account, but got a message saying that I had exceeded the limit.&nbsp; The message said to add a phone to the account, but the link to that page did not work.&nbsp; I have a cell phone
 in my profile, and still could not send the group mail.&nbsp; I have tried this from both a Windows 10 laptop and a Windows 7 desktop, with the same results.&nbsp; I finally broke it into two groups of 5 that sent successfully, but this is ridiculous.&nbsp; I see on the
 forum many other such postings, but they usually mention recipient lists much larger than mine.&nbsp; How do I fix this problem?&nbsp; I also have a Hotmail account, and often send email to a group of 25.&nbsp; Will I have the same problem with that on future correspondence?

            <p>Hello terrac0tta:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having connecting to a Wi-Fi network.&nbsp; If your phone cannot find or stay connected to a Wi-Fi network this typically means there is an issue with the networks compatibility with the phone or
 the phone itself.&nbsp; There are a couple things I would suggest you look into to help determine what is at the heart of your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, make sure that airplane mode is OFF.&nbsp; If it is the next thing I would suggest is to power cycle your network by disconnecting the modem and router and then reconnecting it.&nbsp; I typically suggest to leave the network off for about 3-5 minutes.&nbsp; Once
 the network is rebooted, try connecting your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, try adding your network to the phone manually.&nbsp; The steps to add a hidden network are outlined here,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/start/connect-to-a-wi-fi-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/start/connect-to-a-wi-fi-network</a>.&nbsp; This may bring up some errors if there is a particular issue with the network.&nbsp; If you do receive an error, let us know the exact error you receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, try connecting you phone via other Wi-Fi networks.&nbsp; This is likely to be the best way to determine if this is an issue with the network or the phone itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<p>Please be informed that we don't have a feature that will automatically tag emails as junk if it is being forwarded from another account (especially if the sender is a trusted sender or included in your contact list) unless you create an email rule just
 like what Alden D&nbsp;said.</p>

<h2>            Windows phone HTC 8XT calendar generates duplicates, why&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>At first I didn't understand how to create and edit an entry, then figured it out but I'm still getting duplicates with different color bars even though I only save it once??&nbsp; I've analyzed my methods and can't find any reason for this.&nbsp; If I delete one
 of the entries it deletes the whole thread and I have to re-do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Android was hard enough to learn and then they kept changing the OS software and removing key settings which I really appreciated but at least I could go to the store for free and get something that worked better (usually).&nbsp; Windows has no alternate apps
 for the main ones (phone, calendar, alarms, Keyboard, signal strength (instantly updatable etc...)&nbsp; To be fair, there are things I like about the phone, but I'd like to be able to choose at least some GUI settings for things like the keyboard which does not
 allow single letter editing :-(</p>

            Ok, I think it's because it saves a copy for each email logged in. I noticed that when I clicked on each entry there was an email associated with it and all copies were different.

    <title>Custom views to group Shared mailboxes in Outlook &#40;Mac app&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom views to group Shared mailboxes in Outlook &#40;Mac app&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Background info:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organisation has Office 365</li><li>I've downloaded the app for Mac (running v16.25)</li><li>We have roughly 10 shared mailboxes, my work account, and my personal account</li><li>I've got these all linked in my client</li></ul>
<p><strong>The problem</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's too much visual noise - part of my role means I need to have access to these shared mailboxes used within my team, however a lot of these I will never interact with and will only need to refer to when prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Googling on the best way/s to customise my view or group folders but the documentation is unclear, varies version to version and between pc/mac/online</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I'm now getting 100s of notifications all treated equally - and I don't want to touch anything as these are shared mailboxes and I've had mixed reports of users changing something and the whole organisation having the change impinged on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I'm after</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I want to be able to group Shared accounts visually (e.g. "Work", "Personal", "Front desk", "Events", "Processing admin" etc) These would basically be arbitrary folders but at the top-level</li><li>I want to suppress notifications on certain folders but not on others</li><li>I want to be able to have a single-view inbox which comprises only the inboxes I want - I realise I could maybe set up a rule to forward an item, but ideally the messages would be interlinked so replying in one inbox would "mirror" this in another inbox
 (e.g. in "All accounts" inbox - any action taken there happens on others, if I simply forward it to myself it would be creating a separate copy of the email, right?)</li><li>I don't want any changes I make affecting others</li></ul>
<p>Is this doable? Does this make sense? I'm essentially a single person in a large org and I want my emails organised the way that work for me.<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated - as I said before, documentation is unclear and functionality is now so spread out across versions/platforms it's hard to line up guides with actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Thanks</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Hello Jimmy Porich,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>According to your description, I understand that handle many shared mailboxes caused such inconvenience to you. Given your concern, I tested on my side
 and here are the results:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>1.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Group Shared accounts visually.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>If you mean group the shared mailbox account that configured in Outlook, this is not feasible. But you can change the shared account description (such
 as “work”, “personal”, etc.) via <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> and it will show the custom name at the left pane:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbd027ef-c929-41ff-93a5-7b281ecabb05?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbd027ef-c929-41ff-93a5-7b281ecabb05?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>2. Suppress notifications on certain folders but not on others.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>This is not feasible based on my test. To help us improve our functions, we would be very grateful if you could submit your idea in Outlook for Mac
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice</a>. Many current features are designed based on user’s feedback. We truly appreciate your valuable suggestion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>3. Have a single-view inbox which comprises only the inboxes I want.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Your opinion is right. This is because “All Account” folder aggregates the inbox content of all accounts that configured in Outlook. However, you can
 adjust the Filter in “All Account” folder, change the condition to Account. Then you will be able to view emails by email account:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb4814de-e61e-4df5-9893-8ed6ebaa57de?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb4814de-e61e-4df5-9893-8ed6ebaa57de?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>4. I don't want any changes I make affecting others.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Since the shared mailbox is build for a group of people in your company to monitor and send email from the same account, thus, the changes that edit
 by one people will affect others. If you just want to create an Inbox rule (such as assign category to some emails or move emails to other folder), you can create the
<strong>Client Rules</strong> which only works in your Outlook client and doesn’t affect others in the shared mailbox. For your reference:</span></p>

<h2>            10049 Installation Problem &#34;Updates are available, but we temporarily need 0.00 MB-0.00 MB of space to download&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Just tried to update 10041 to 10049 on my Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; My harddisk probably had 3-4 GB of space left.&nbsp; The download process was interrupted and I see the following message on the Windows Update page under Settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Updates are available, but we temporarily need 0.00 MB-0.00 MB of space to download.&nbsp; Remove some things you don't need right now and we'll try again".&nbsp; There is a button "Go to Storage".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since freed up 25GB of storage space and rebooted several times, but the message remains and the installation does not proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the relevant update from c:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download, but that did not make a difference either.</p>

            <p>There are two issues being hit here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The UX has a bug displaying space. It should be showing how much free space is needed, but is reporting 0.00.</li><li>The rescan logic has a bug that requires the service to be retriggered, else it will not see newly freed space.</li></ol>
<p>The solution for this problem is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free at least 10GB to allow the download and setup process to have sufficient space to operate.</li><li>From&nbsp;an elevated&nbsp;command prompt&nbsp;run ‘’usoclient startscan”, which will reinitiate the scan.</li></ol>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>DSum Multiple criteria - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlovassell  say:</h3>
<h2>            DSum Multiple criteria</h2>
                    <p>I have a table called "CreditNotes" and fields in that table called "Values", "Currency","Period".</p>
<p>I want to use DSum to get the total values for all credit notes for a particular period for a particular currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expression, I think, should look something like this: DSum("Values","CreditNotes","Period=PeriodID" AND "Currency=USD").</p>
<p>PeriodID refers to a field on the form which values are from a different table.</p>
<p>Of course this does not work as planned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me</p>
