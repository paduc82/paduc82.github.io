    <title>Cannot accept Terms of Use - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot accept Terms of Use</h2>
                    I recently purchased a zune pass for the first time in a while. After completing the transaction, I signed out and then attempted to sign back in, however I was prompted to accept the new terms of service(supposed to go into effect in september) and re-input
 some privacy settings. Upon completing this, it took me to a screen thanking me for accepting the new terms, with no active "finish" button. Only "Cancel," which takes me back to my collection without being signed in. I've tried:<br />
<br />
-waiting on that screen(5+ minutes, nothing happened)<br />
-clearing temporary internet files, within internet explorer and in the control panel<br />
-making sure location and time zone were correct<br />
-signing in to zune.net to accept the terms(i was not presented with the option)<br />
-signing in to the associated live account<br />
-signing in to xbox.com with the associated account<br />
-uninstalling and reinstalling the software(manually deleting temporary app data between installations)<br />
-creating a new zune account(it accepted the terms just fine)<br />
<br />
After all that, it's still the same problem. Topics like this have been brought up as early as a year ago, but I saw none with a solution. Any suggestions?<br />

            Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I can't really help with this. I think a bunch of our accounts were fixed around the time mine went online last weekend. It totally sucks, though. It's worth a call to tech support to resolve. People also seem to be getting answers on zunesupport's twitter
 page. Hopefully, once it's all fixed we'll get a couple weeks of zune pass for free. I see that as the most realistic retribution.<br />

            Thanks Karl. I tried the last one first as it seemed the easiest. My A/V is MSE (which I guess means its integrated w/ Outlook). I excluded .pst files in its settings, and I think that did it. That's based on just one test, but am hoping for the best.<br />

            Sometimes with upgrades after it has installed it needs to do some "housekeeping" which can take a few minutes or a couple of hours most times it happens in the background, I always tell my customers to let it sit for awhile and see if things start working.&nbsp;

    <title>Excel 2010 VBA DAO query to retrieve Access Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimgdal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 VBA DAO query to retrieve Access Data</h2>
                    <p>I have VBA code in Access that uses a DAO SQL query to export data to an Excel workbook. This code works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I need to do significant interactive charting with the data in Excel, I want to move the DAO query to Excel for the initial data load so that I can then do the interactive charting in Excel. I have selected in the VBA tools references the following: 1)
 Access 14.0 Object Library, and 2) DAO 3.6 Object Library. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My code is below with essentially no changes (other than a few lines of needed Excel code for application and workbook objects and charting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on execution, I get a Run-Time error '3343', Unrecognized database format. I have tried many alternative, but none work. I could use an ADO connection, but it will help to use (nearly) the same Access VBA code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer suggestions to get the code working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>VBA CODE</strong></p>
<p>Dim db As Database<br />
Dim rst As DAO.Recordset<br />

            <p>Yes, you'd set a reference to the <em>Microsoft Access 14.0 Object Library </em>
if you want to automate Access from another application such as Excel, i.e. to run and control an instance of the Access application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Office 14.0 Access database engine Object Library</em> library lets you manipulate the data in a database, not the Access interface such as forms and reports.</p>

            <p>You must set a reference to the <em>Microsoft Office 14.0 Access database engine Object Library</em>. That is the DAO version for .accdb databases in Access 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DAO.Database object is - more or less - the equivalent of the ADODB.Connection object.</p>

<div><br />
<div>So reading through your report you posted above and one thing stands out to me:</div>
<div><i>"<span>Errors were detected in file 'Macintosh HD</span>"</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>So my advice would be to dig into that specific part. I did so, and got to a few questions:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Is Unicode involved in the document?</b><i> I have seen a few users had their ZipLibrary set to Unicode and by changing that back they were able to resolve this.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><b>Do you have a HP Printer? </b><i>Try saving your default printer to the Microsoft XPS Printer, this resolved it. There are a few reports on the HP printer and Excel conflicting causing similar issues.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>Like I said, look into that specific part and I have a feeling you will uncover a treasure cove of possible solutions and causes. I hope this helps.

            <p>The fact that you are seeing this error means Excel has detected a corruption and is about to repair your workbook. Once you open this workbook and re-save it, the corruption should be already removed. You will not see this error the next time you open this
 workbook.</p>
<p>Per the log though, the error lies in one of your formulae. Check the &lt;removedRecords&gt; sections.</p>

            They more or less removed that option from individual contacts.  The global setting for RTF is in File, option, mail - near the bottom, under Message Format. It should be set to Convert to HTML. 
<br />
<br />What could be happening is that the autocomplete record for some contacts is set to RTF - deleting the autocomplete and typing the address in will fix it.  This is definitely the cause if the recipient is receiving a winmail.dat attachment (some mail systems remove or hide the winmail attachment so it could still be the reason they get plain text.)  See <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/problems/outlook-is-sending-winmail-dat-attachments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/problems/outlook-is-s...</a> for more info. 
<br />
<br />To get into the old properties dialog, you need to set a registry key - I have it at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/use-outlooks-contacts-contact-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/use-outlooks-...</a> - if you have the retail or volume license, the keys will work, but it may not work 'as expected' in the current version (I need to check it again - they keep making changes). 
<br />

    <title>Link Master Slides to Multiple Decks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shibbysan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Link Master Slides to Multiple Decks</h2>
                    <p>Hello all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been googling away and can't seem to find the right combination of search terms to answer my question. I'm sure, though, that it has been asked and answered before. I appreciate any help you all can offer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a series of decks that all share some slides in common. Is there a simple way to link those shared elements together so that I can make a change once (in some master version) and have it propagate across multiple files? This is something like the
 "Slide Master" functionality but across files instead of internal to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra bonus question: every time I make a change, I need to go through and re-"Save As" PDF everything in bulk. If possible, I'd like to avoid having to buy a one-off program to do this. Is it possible to do this sort of thing with a macro, as thing gentleman
<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00740_Batch_re-save_presentations-_update_older_presentations_to_newer_PowerPoint_version.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
suggests</a>? (EDIT: I should add that I realize that this macro isn't exporting as PDF, but it looks like the functionality might be there to write a macro that would.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Lynnette,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to article below. This article describes how to update a Domain Name Service (DNS) record so that you can use Sender Policy Framework (SPF) with your custom domain in Office 365. Using SPF helps to validate outbound email sent from your custom
 domain.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for asking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mention the type of email account configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, MAPI or Exchange)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you receive any error messages while performing Send/Receive or while synchronizing?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Reset the view of the folder having issues with and check. Click to select the folder and then click on the View tab. In Current view click
 the option Reset View.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may remove and re-add the account in Outlook and check if that helps:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also restart the system in Windows 7 clean boot mode and try saving an Excel file and check how it works there.</p>

<p>Note: Make sure to restart the system back to Normal mode after troubleshooting.</p>

<p>I hope the above information helps. If you still have questions, you can always reply and I’ll be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Transferring .pst pop files from Outlook 2007 to Office Outlook365 on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    I have been attempting to transfer 402MB in several Personal&nbsp;Folders via Export to memory stick and then Import. Most small folders transfer but several larger ones do not. One critical 85MB folder when transferred by itself results in the following error
 message: "Folder Name Folder cannot be imported or exported. Your chosen folder name is invalid. This is most likely because you included your IMAP server's hierarchy delimiter in the name of the folder." I attempted a name change with the same result and
 message. &nbsp;I&nbsp;had over 2 hour telecon&nbsp;yesterday with M/S technical support without resolution. Is there a size limitation in the 365 program&nbsp;and, as I don't understand the meaning of the error message, can you suggest a way to import this one folder if none
 other?? Thank You&nbsp;

            <p>There is no need to export and import anything. Simply transfer the original pst-file and reconnect to it via: File-&gt; Open-&gt; Open Outlook Data File</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a pst-file of a POP3 account see:<br />
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Permanent Link to Restoring a pst-file of a POP3 account on a new computer"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Restoring a pst-file of a POP3 account on a new computer</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you originally had it configured as a POP3 account and now have it configured as an IMAP account, you can't use a forward slash in any of the folders which you try to import. Reconnecting it as described above is also possible and then you can just move
 the folders or just their contents (still: you can't have any forward slashes or some other special characters in the folder names which IMAP doesn't support).</p>

    <title>Using &#34;Hey Cortana&#34; in Windows 10 Mobile official release - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manshul malhotra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using &#34;Hey Cortana&#34; in Windows 10 Mobile official release &#40;10586.164&#41; for Lumia 930 &#40;India&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I own a Lumia 930 (India variant RM-1045_1032) Recently, I updated to Windows 10 Mobile build 10586.164 via the upgrade advisor app, from Windows Phone 8.1. While I set my settings,</p>
<p>Region- India</p>
<p>Language- English (India)</p>
<p>Speech- English (India),</p>
<p>I can use Cortana perfectly, but cannot use &nbsp;"Hey Cortana" in my phone. If I change my settings to either US or UK, it works just fine.</p>
<p>If Cortana is supported in my region, Why can't I use "Hey Cortana" with those settings? Can anyone confirm that Cortana is supported in India (with "Hey Cortana")?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have the same exact settings (Indian) in my laptop (Windows 10 build 10586.164 1511), and "Hey Cortana" works perfectly in it. Please suggest something so that I can use "Hey Cortana" in my phone too.</p>

<p>The issue has popped up again. More hours wasted trying to get a simple out of the box feature to work - in a service that we're paying thousands of dollars a month for. when will it be addressed????????????????????????????????????

<p>This is definitely a bug related to the assinine minimal download strategy.</p>
<p>Even though MDS is disabled for this site, SP will not surface the latest version of the file.</p>
<p>Original file has this url query version added: ?ctag=0$$15.0.4551.1508</p>
<p>If I delete the file and refresh everything, it' still shows the same version ?ctag=0$$15.0.4551.1508</p>
<p>If I then create &nbsp;a new file, and refresh everything it STILL shows ?ctag=0$$15.0.4551.1508</p>
<p>Changing the file name even makes no differnce - unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>So this is obviously a bug &nbsp;- once MDS is activated for a site any cached files NEVER GET UPDATED -EVEN IF MDS IS DEACTIVATED!!!!!</p>
<p>It's absurd to activate MDS by default if Msft can't figure out how to make it work properly.</p>
<p><span>MSFT: Please do away with this "feature" until you learn some rudimentary developing skills.</span></p>

<h2>            Email stuck in Outlook365.com online outbox</h2>
                    
<p>I have Office 365 for business hosting Microsoft Exchange. Single user not shared.&nbsp;One recent&nbsp;and three emails&nbsp;from a month ago from&nbsp;workstation on Windows 10 Pro with Outlook 2016.&nbsp;All&nbsp;4 show 'Sent'&nbsp;in workstation Outlook and nothing shows in workstation&nbsp;'Outbox'.
 When I log onto Office365.com, they show in the online&nbsp;'Outbox' and I cannot move, delete or edit them. None had an attachment.Don't know if it had anything to do with the problem, but all 4&nbsp;were replies. &nbsp;I do have lots of folders and replies are supposed
 to stay with original.&nbsp;Anybody have any ideas how to 1: move or delete them, and 2: what caused it?</p>

<p>Hi Erle,</p>
<p>I know you have encountered an issue that 4 replies are shown in the “sent” folder of your Outlook 2016 and they are stuck in the “Outbox” folder of
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App (OWA).</a></p>
<p>Generally, when replying to an email, the reply should be kept in the “Sent Items” folder of Outlook. According to your description “I do have lots of folders and replies are supposed to stay with original”, I’d like to confirm whether you mean the emails
 are kept in different folders while received and when replying to them, replies are kept in the corresponding folders.</p>
<p>If so, it seems that there is a conflict between the “OST” file and the personal “Sent Items” folder. Given the situation, you can try the following methods:<br />
1.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d?CorrelationId=6276041a-670f-4a7d-86bf-f3276b406c37&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a new Outlook profile</a> on your Outlook 2016.
<strong>Note</strong>: Delete the previous “OST” file before creating a new Outlook profile.<br />
2.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-on-or-off-Cached-Exchange-Mode-e8966ca4-6ecd-4bdd-ade2-64993dda432b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn off the Outlook Cached mode and turn it on</a>.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please confirm the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1.&nbsp;Are all the 4 emails replied to the same user?<br />
2.&nbsp;Is there any improvement if you change to another PC?<br />
3.&nbsp;Does the issue persist in Outlook safe mode? To connect to Outlook in a safe mode: Click “Start” menu of your Windows 10&gt; “Run”&gt; type outlook.exe /safe &gt; OK.</p>
<p>Also, upload a screenshot about the 4 emails are stuck in "Outbox" folder of OWA. Tp upload a screenshot: Click "Use rich formatting"&gt; "Insert Media".</p>
<p>Any update is appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Alan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>I obviously did not provide enough info. I cannot duplicate the issue and it has only happened 4 times. 3 of the 4 I replied to have over a hundred replies that worked perfectly. One I have only replied to about 10 times, yet all but this one worked OK.
 However, while researching your question number 2, I did discover another anomaly that is leading me down a new research path. All 4 emails originated from my Surface Pro 3. Since I cannot duplicate the issue form my home or work network, I am now researching
 where I was when I sent those 4 emails. As I visit some of our stores in other cities, it is a possibility I was on one of their networks. Don't know how that could affect Outlook Web App (OWA), but I am running out of other possibilities.</p>
<p>All that being said, I figured out how to delete them from the Outbox in the Outlook Web App (OWA). I deleted the 'Sent' item from the Surface and they automatically moved from the Outlook Web App (OWA) Outbox to the deleted folder, which I then emptied.</p>
<p>Next time I use a store's network, I will test this [if I can remember :-) ].</p>
<p>Thanks again for your reply.</p>
<p>Erle</p>

<p>One more clarification: The 4 emails appear 'Sent' on the Surface 3 they originated on; They all 4 also appear in the 'Outbox' on Outlook Web App (OWA); They do NOT appear at all on my desktop PC. Both Surface and PC running Widows 10 with Outlook 2016.
 Again, this is Microsoft Exchange hosted on Office365 for Business.</p>

<p>Hi Erle,</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification. </p>
<p>Since the issue can’t be replicated under the network environment of both your home and office, it might be related to the network environment. It would be nice if you could test and confirm it. You are welcome to post back if there is any update.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Android - latest release crashing every 7-10 minutes</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the most recent update to OneNote Android - which my "About" info states is 16.0.8241.1769 - the app will crash routinely on my devices every 10 minutes (or less). &nbsp;This occurs on both my phone (Galaxy Note 4, SM-N910A, running Android 5.0.1)
 and my tablet (Galaxy Note 10.1, 2014 ed, SM-P600, w-Android 5.0.1).</p>
<p>It makes no difference whether I'm adding a large or small quantity of data.</p>
<p>Anyone have a solution or a workaround?</p>

<p>Hi Dough,</p>
<p><br />
One of the possible why your OneNote app crashes is when your Office application cache data is full. To troubleshoot your issue related launching the OneNote app, we suggest that you follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your device, tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Apps </strong>or <strong>Application Manager </strong>then tap it.</li><li>Tap <strong>OneNote</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>CLEAR DATA</strong>.</li><li>Once done, open the <strong>OneNote </strong>app and check if it makes any difference.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still persists, we also recommend that you uninstall/reinstall the
<strong>OneNote app.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the result.</p>

                    <p>The report is grouped by mbr_id (member ID).&nbsp; The entire report could be&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;pages.&nbsp; Each member's portion of the report is 2-3 pages.&nbsp; I would like each member's report to say "Page 1 of 3" or "page 2 of 2" what ever the case may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already tried a couple of VBA codes I found while searching.&nbsp; The first one found at
<a href="http://www.utteraccess.com/wiki/index.php/Page_Numbering_by_Group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.utteraccess.com/wiki/index.php/Page_Numbering_by_Group</a></p>
<p>This one worked well to get just the page number to start over with each group so the "Page X" portion works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I erased the above and tried over again with <a href="http://access.mvps.org/access/reports/rpt0013.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://access.mvps.org/access/reports/rpt0013.htm</a>&nbsp; to get the whole "Page X of Y"
</p>
<p>But it's not giving me anything.&nbsp; No error message, but also no results.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>One other thing: your report should contain a text box whose control source refers to the total number of pages in the report, e.g. =[Pages]. This text box can be hidden, but it's essential that it exists.</p>

    <title>Making backup file visible or invisible in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noneofyourbusiness_007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making backup file visible or invisible in Word</h2>
                    <p>There is a way in Microsoft Office Word to select a check-box that will make all your Word backup documents visible as and when created.&nbsp; In other words, every time you save a new Word document (i.e. 'newdocument.docx'), you will see a second backup document
 (i.e. 'backup of newdocument.docx').</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is completely unrelated to any operating system method for making invisible files visible.&nbsp; It is an actual preference/option within Word.&nbsp; I know this to be a fact because I once turned it on within Word and can't remember how I did it.&nbsp; I'm an idiot
 for not saving the web post that provided the instructions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know?</p>

            <p>There is no such feature in Word, OS X or Windows. There would be no point in making backup files invisible. How would you find them when you need them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS tech support was correct, there is a Unix command to make invisible files visible, but this would only make visible the temp files that Word creates while it is working. You may be confusing these temp files with your backups, but they're &nbsp;different files
 for different purposes.</p>

            It's usually only cheap (or free) and poorly made (or very old) fonts that don't have a full character set, but some have other limitations (such as having caps only or no punctuation at all).

<h2>            MS Access 2007 - Checklist Per User Entry</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been my problem for two months now and I still can't find the proper structure for this. I hope you can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm creating a checklist for every project in our company. Each project has thousands of Isometrics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the situation;</p>
<ol>
<li>Admin will input the set of checklists per project. Every project has different checklist,.</li><li>User will enter a "text" as value for "isometrics".</li><li>After creating that "isometrics". The user will tick some data from the checklist.</li></ol>
<p>I can do the 1st &amp; 2nd, but I can't find a way to do the 3rd one. I want to keep the data whether the checklist is checked or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me. If there's still unclear with my situation. Feel free to ask.
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. Happy New Year!</p>

            <p>Please use precise language, so people not familiar with your situation can follow along. I'm having a hard time doing that.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p><em>&gt; I'm creating a checklist for every project in our company. Each project has thousands of Isometrics.</em></p>
<p>This seems to indicate that each project has ONE checklist, and that this checklist contains thousands of items called isometrics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 2:</p>
<p><em>&gt; Admin will input the set of checklists per project. Every project has different checklist,.</em></p>
<p>The first sentence&nbsp;seems to indicate that each project has a SET of checklists, in direct contradiction with Example 1.<br />
</p>
<p>The second sentence contradicts the first one: we're back to ONE checklist per project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 3:</p>
<p><em>&gt; User will enter a "text" as value for "isometrics".</em></p>
<p>This seems to indicate that all items on the checklist have text values. That seems hard to believe. Some will probably be numeric, or dates, or yes/no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 4:</p>
<p><em>&gt; After creating that "isometrics". The user will tick some data from the checklist.</em></p>
<p>I am confused. Isometrics now seems to mean something different.</p>
<p>Also "ticking some data" seems to indicate they are yes/no fields in contradiction to example 3 where they were text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there is just one "isometrics" per project. Funny that the word is plural, and in contradiction to example 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you can re-write your question? Also posting a screenshot of the relationships window you have so far will be helpful.</p>

<p>Ok. Sorry, I'm not really good in english. I'll try to explain clearly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each project has a set of checklist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Project alpha </strong>have checklists named, <strong>checklist 1, checklist 2, checklist 3, checklist 4
</strong></li><li><strong>Project alpha&nbsp;</strong>have isometrics named, <strong>iso 1, iso 2, iso 3, iso 4.&nbsp;</strong>(Users will define these isos)</li><li>After the user created <strong>iso 1</strong>, &nbsp;he will check some items from the set of checklist&nbsp;<strong>Project alpha</strong> have. Same goes for the other isos.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Project Beta </strong>have different set of checklists. like&nbsp;checklist a, checkdlist b, etc..</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the relationship;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42f38002-185c-4ab0-bd3a-6c3fc916d293" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>table 1 - Isometrics</p>
<p>table 2 - combinations of 1 &amp; 2</p>
<p>table 3 - Checklist</p>
<p>table 4 - Project&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>my question is, how to create that table 2?</strong></p>
<p>Everytime a user create an entry on table 1, &nbsp;the table 2 will be filled automatically.</p>
<p>from my example above. the table 2 will have</p>
<p>iso 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;checklist 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ ]</p>
<p>iso 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;checklist 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ ]</p>
<p>iso 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;checklist 3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ ]</p>
<p>iso 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;checklist 4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ ]</p>

            <p>Thank you, nice job re-writing. I am not a native speaker either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question I have is if checklists can be re-used for several projects. In your example they did not but I'm guessing that if you have Project Alpha and Project Alpha2 they may share some but perhaps not all checklists. It seems a good idea to share checklists
 and try to come up with ones that indeed can be shared by several projects. Is that how it works for you?</p>

            <p>Yes, Projects can share the same checklists. Actually, most projects use the default set of checklists.
</p>
<p>But there are few projects that have completely different set of checklist.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Good. That is what I expected. This is my design suggestion:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7fc5218-51cd-4544-b421-609f620c2073" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>To explain this design:<br />
I have Checklists as just a simple list of all available checklists, such as checklist1,
</p>
<p>checklistA, etc.<br />
The details of the items in each list is in ChecklistItems.<br />
Note that both Checklists and ChecklistItems are independent of Project. That's really
</p>
<p>important.</p>
<p>The Admin will pick the lists that pertain to each project and populate </p>
<p>tblChecklistsOnProjects. The PK is over both FK fields to express the many-to-many relation.<br />
Users will enter one or more Isometrics per project.<br />
Now about the tickbox: tblChecklistItemValues is to store those values. If other database
</p>
<p>designers see my solution we may have a discussion about the need for ChecklistID in this
</p>
<p>table. I would argue that it is needed because I am selecting the PK fields from tblChecklistsOnProjects as FKs in this table, thus ensuring we can only have ChecklistItemIDs that fit the checklists selected by the Admin.</p>

            <p>Very nice! Very clever. It will save a lot of data because there will be no repeating checklist unlike what I originally created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more question is, how do I relate the&nbsp;<strong>tblIsometrics </strong>and&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>tblChecklistItemValues?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Every isometrics should have all the checklist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After the user create an IsoID, he will generate a report. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>

<p>So I think the report would be with ChecklistItemValues in the Details section, and in the ReportHeader there is a subreport to show the Isometrics.</p>

<p>I logged a problem with the Windows 10 Mobile Messaging App (for SMS messages) a couple of weeks ago and I can see quite a few other people have logged or upvoted very similar issues.&nbsp; To date there has been no response from Microsoft other than the generic

            <p>Hello Kyabayinze:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you have been having accessing the marketplace.&nbsp; This is certainly not the experience we want you to have and believe there are a few things we can do to correct this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing we should do is try connecting via multiple connections.&nbsp; We suggest you try connecting via Wi-Fi and cellular data separately.&nbsp; To enable Wi-Fi, tap settings &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; ON.&nbsp; To disable data, tap settings &gt; cellular/mobile &gt; OFF.&nbsp; Once you
 have done this, go to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the primary Microsoft account &gt; select sync.&nbsp; If you see an "attention required" message or "not up to date" error, tap that and let us know the exact error message and code.&nbsp; If the account
 syncs without issue, go to the marketplace and try to download a free application.&nbsp; Please repeat this with Wi-Fi turned OFF and data turned ON.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you continue to experience the same issue, we need to next focus on the account itself.&nbsp; There are a few different things to do with the account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a> and verify that the account is complete.&nbsp; Click account settings &gt; personal info. &gt; make sure all information is complete.&nbsp; Once you have done this, go to security info and change the
 current password.</li><li>After you have done the above it is time to check the Xbox account associated with your email.&nbsp; The Xbox account will be what determines access to the marketplace.&nbsp; Go to
<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> and sign in with the email on your phone.&nbsp; If you do not have an account created, you will be prompted to create one.&nbsp; Once you are fully signed in, click MY ACCOUNT &gt; billing and contact information &gt; make sure
 that this area is complete.&nbsp; Take note of the country listed here.</li></ul>
<p>If the issue continues after trying the above, provide us the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>What country was listed on your Xbox account?</li><li>Have you recently enable two factor authentication?</li><li>Have you had any other issues on the phone, accessing email, using Xbox Live, accessing the music marketplace, etc...?</li><li>What is the current OS on your phone, tap settings &gt; about &gt; more info.?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 10 TP for free</h2>
                    I have upgraded my windows 8.1 computer to the insider version of Windows 10. If I have my 8.1 product key, can I still upgrade to Windows 10 for free?

<p><strong>windows 10 RTM without the need to go back to windows 7 or 8.1.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the next windows preview&nbsp;build after 10130 (it could be 10145, 10147 or higher)</p>
<p>will need to use the Microsoft System Account (MSA) to be able to get the next windows 10 build</p>
<p>just before the final version. So if you want to continue with Insider Preview you will need</p>
<p>to use your MSA with the same account you registered with to start the Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you do not want to continue with the Insider preview, then yes reinstall window 7 or 8.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>and upgrade via windows update like everyone else. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will not need a MSA account to get final version windows 10 and can keep using a local account.</p>
<p>If you want to use some features like windows app store and the new Cortana system</p>
<p>then you need to create or login with you MSA.</p>
