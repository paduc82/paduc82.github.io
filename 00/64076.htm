            i had to do a&nbsp; reinstall because that is what the computer repair shop said, they could not get my computer to "Turn over" after the windows symbol came up. My computer was left on during a power surge, so it would not respond when coming on.

            <p>Hi<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for replying with required information as to why you reinstalled Windows 8.1 Pro on the computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>I still did not get to know the exact error message you receive when you&nbsp;try to add or activate&nbsp;Windows Media center feature?</li><li>Ideally, If you were running Windows 8.1 Pro Windows Media Center will be available for use, I would like to know did you check if Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;is activated?</li><li>Which edition of Operating system is currently installed on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to try the following steps and check if the Windows Media Center gets activated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows key + X key.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Click on the <strong>System icon </strong>and then chose <strong>Add Features</strong>.</p>
<p>4. In the <strong>Add Features</strong> window select the option that <strong>
I already had a product key</strong> and typed in my Media Center key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, please reply with the status of the issue for further assistance, we will be happy to assist.</p>

            Thank you Sujata.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem seemed to be that I had Gmail that was added some years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I attempted to uninstall the app it did not exist according to the list, so I installed a new app and the printing error was resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be able
 to work out why this was so, but I remain in the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your help.

    <title>Flight Simulator X Deluxe Edition won&#39;t install on Win 10&#47;64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meanspitfire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flight Simulator X Deluxe Edition won&#39;t install on Win 10&#47;64</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, someone will know the answer to this one... Background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>FSX bought legally and I have its key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FSX installed easily and worked perfectly, though at reduced performance,&nbsp; on my previous computer running Win 10/32 Home (4GB RAM). My new computer runs Win 10/64 Pro (8GB RAM). I retained the graphics card, Nvidia GeForce 9800 GTX+. The driver was updated
 to the latest 21.21.13.4201 when installed in the new computer. The original driver will not work on Win 10/64, as I found out trying to revert to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I place the 1st FSX disk in the drive, it spins and the LED flickers normally. But, that's all it does, spin with the LED flickering. I don't even get an intro install screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 120GB SSD for the OS. I also installed my utilities and security apps there, and was going to install FSX there also. This leaves my 2TB HD for all my data, photos especially.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BluRay drive I use is the same one I used on the previous computer. (Does it need a driver upgrade?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something? I do that every now and then -:). Is there a patch available, or can a specific download be used where I would enter my key??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad that you were able to sort out the missing Directx10 box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you ever load any default or other add on aircraft and get missing sections or mangled parts scattered on the screen (with or without using Directx10 preview), it's because the developers (Aces Studios), forgot to include an entry in the fsx.cfg
 file which relates to the high memory requirement of FSX.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if you're interested in that inclusion and would need to use it if this type of problem occurs in the future, this is what you need to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; &nbsp;go to Your Drive (letter) &gt; Users &gt; Your Name &gt; AppData &gt; Roaming &gt; Microsoft &gt; FSX &gt; fsx.cfg</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; &nbsp;open up that file:&nbsp; fsx.cfg (make sure it's not fsx.cfg.txt&nbsp; - amending this one won't effect any changes).</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; &nbsp;after you've opened up fsx.cfg, scroll down to the section entitled:&nbsp; [Graphics].</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; &nbsp;after the last entry under the Graphics section, add this line as I've shown here:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HIGHMEMFIX=1</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; &nbsp;save the file and close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This entry is a mandatory inclusion and not a Tweak, as many folk tweak other parts of that cfg file.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, keep those details with you, in case you suddenly find strange things happening with your aircraft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Windows 10-Audacity-Windows Media Players</h2>
                    <p>1. <strong>Audacity</strong> will not work with <strong>Windows 10</strong>, despite all the
<strong>TIPS</strong> that lead nowhere. The <strong>Tips</strong> that have you check all the settings (that were never changed in the first place), uninstalling components (that were working just fine previously). Techies enjoy sending us on those wild goose
 chases, while telling us that it worked for them...&nbsp; Any other programs similar to
<strong>Audacity </strong>seem to charge to make them work, What a surprise!&nbsp; NOT....</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <strong>Windows 10 media players</strong>- all recommended Media Players don't work&nbsp; through
<strong>the STORE</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Answer:&nbsp; <strong>VLC Media Player</strong> does work with a normal download but also does nothing when installed from
<strong>the STORE</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Acer Aspire V3-372T Windows 10 - Touch Screen not working</h2>
                    <p>There is no listing for HID Compliant Touch Display in Device Manager. &nbsp;There are a few generically named HID listings and i tried turning those off and on again but only succeeded in disabling my touch pad and turning it back on.</p>
<p>There is no "Pen and touch" listing in Control Panel</p>
<p>The touch screen worked up until about 2 days ago.</p>
<p>I backed up to a restore point and then to an earlier restore point again and neither one made it start working again (one was from 4 days ago, the other was from 15 days ago).</p>
<p>I also ran Windows Troubleshooting which did something but had no effect on touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the most recent windows update which looks to be security related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have no idea what to do or why this is happening. &nbsp;I'm currently downloading the "VGA Drivers" package from Acer for my specific laptop and hopefully that will resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>I used the "Troubleshooting" in Control panel for Hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my last post I have tried to update drivers.</p>
<p>I downloaded the specific driver pack for my model of laptop available at http://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/drivers</p>
<p>specifically, I downloaded and installed:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>VGA</td>
<td>Intel</td>
<td>VGA Driver</td>
<td>20.19.15.4300</td>
<td>174.8 MB</td>

</tr>

</table>
<p>But, while compatible, this did nothing for the touch screen portion.</p>
<p>I also rolled back the updates to get rid of the recent windows 10 cumulative update.</p>
<p>I reset windows (reinstalled the OS, but did not get rid of my documents)</p>
<p>I tried deleting the "USB Input Device" that shows up under the HID section of Device Manager (it always came back)</p>
<p>I tried changing the device driver to be the Standarfd HID Compliant Touch Screen driver instead.&nbsp; Restarted.&nbsp; Touch screen still not functioning.&nbsp; Updated it back to the USB Input Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the same for HID-Compliant-Vendor-Defined Service in the same area with the same result.&nbsp; it's back to what it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run windows update multiple times</p>
<p>I checked the UEFI Bios to see if there was anything in there that would have anything to do with this and didn't see anything.</p>
<p>I rebooted into a mode that turned off Driver Signing in the hope that maybe it just wasn't loading because the touch screen driver was not compatible in some way with the new update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this had any effect at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, I did notice that pressing Fn-F7 on my laptop turns off/on the touch screen, but that is clearly software that's designed to do that and that doesn't give any feedback when the touch screen option itself is not available.&nbsp;&nbsp;It had no actual effect on
 the touch screen itself.&nbsp; It "thought" it was turning it off/on but that was just the result of some script it was running I'm sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, i'm forced to conclude that it's corrupted or incompatible in some way with windows 10.&nbsp; super irritating since this laptop and model are brand new as of January.</p>

            <p>Was there some Driver update earlier this week that might have disrupted this? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm taking it in to micro center to be serviced under warranty. &nbsp;Pretty poor for something i've had for 30 days. &nbsp;I'm starting to wish I'd spent the extra money on a MacBook. &nbsp;I like the PC and it's very versatile and Windows 10 is a big improvement, but
 I can't have this kind of thing happening. &nbsp;It's ridiculous. &nbsp;Today it's the touch screen, tomorrow who knows? &nbsp;Am i just supposed to turn off driver updates forever?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. Sorry for the delay.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand that touch screen is not working even after trying all possible resolutions.

    <title>fsc repair problems with problemantic new computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loricrv  say:</h3>
<h2>            fsc repair problems with problemantic new computer</h2>
                    <p>Long story:&nbsp; Bought a 'custom' computer with WinProfessional7 from a local dealer.&nbsp; Was not given a copy of windows--we were told that they had a 'site license' and they&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;give back-up copies or a program cd, and no longer used the "genuine" product
 sticker or gave out product keys---hmmmm; that with a 1T drive they couldn't partition it because the T1 drives became unstable when partitioned.&nbsp; I knew there was something fishy--took it back to have it checked---they checked that windows was running, but
 apparently did not check the internet connection, and sent it back. Anyway, I had difficulties with it from the get-go--.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I took it to another computer repair--they were able to sell me a new copy of win7pro&nbsp;with a product key--with sticker--&nbsp;its an &nbsp;oem copy of win7pro.&nbsp;They said that windows was working and I&nbsp;should not have any problems. &nbsp;GREAT!&nbsp; They did not, however,
 reinstall windows--the same problems are occurring&nbsp; and I still have no recovery disks.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran the system file checker and it reports there are errors it could not fix, but I have been unable to access the log file to see what the problem files are.&nbsp; I tried
 inputting the findstr string numerous times, but apparently I haven't been inputting all the %...% info correctly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any other option but to reinstall windows?&nbsp; I'm hesitant because the win7pro package says it should be installed using the 'oem pre-installation kit'.&nbsp; Is it safe for me to reinstall?&nbsp; I figure I have as good a chance of getting it right as a repair
 facility at this point!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Yeah, I was afraid I would have to reinstall windows. Not my favorite activity, but I don't have a lot of programs installed, and I guess not a lot of options.&nbsp; I tried the upgrade option, but it failed, saying it could not find needed files, so I guess I will
 be doing a clean install.&nbsp; Already took it to the custom retailer....they put it up and ran it all day and said no problems, but they apparently didn't do anything else--warranty?&nbsp; hah!&nbsp; Hubby talked me into getting the custom build saying it would be cheaper
 and I'd get more bang for the buck.....he took it in the first time (he works in the same facility) but refuses to make waves by taking it back.&nbsp; Yes, he's in the dog house!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I'm sorry, but Windows 7 Home Premium doesn't have secpol.msc (Local Security Policy editor).&nbsp; That requires the Professional or Ultimate version.<br />
<br />
What settings do you want to make?&nbsp; There might be another way to do it.

<h2>            5 months later and not a thing has changed, lol</h2>
                    
<p>I quit playing this game in November because of the constant 1 second handicap because of my good internet.&nbsp; Popped this game in for the first time a few days ago, gave it a fair chance and it is exactly the same from when I left it.</p>

<p>I shoot someone 5 times with no hit markers and I'm clearly not missing and then BAM, I'm dead instantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This game is the worst multiplayer game in history, considering how much money it has made.&nbsp; IW literally took our money and ran with it, again.</p>

<p>Well, this is the last time for me.&nbsp; The series may as well be dead as far as I'm concerned.&nbsp; I played the crap out of COD2, COD3, COD4, WAW, MW2 and then BLOPS started to turn me off and MW3 is the last straw.&nbsp; I'm done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MW3 = most terribly made shooter of all time.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I agree -- NOTHING has changed. I stopped playing around New Years &amp; threw it in for shiggles about a week ago &amp; it's the same garbage game I left. It's too laggy, too campy, too many people ignore the objectives &amp; it has THE WORST spawns I've ever seen.</p>

<p>If you had a good connection, you'd see the lag. People can't even argue that anymore -- according to the MW3 patch notes, lag &amp; lag comp have been patched over half a dozen times in 6 months...</p>

<p>@bLASTOJELLYFISH---Ill occassionally see lag, but sometimes the connection is great. I am like 15 down and 5 up (good enough interwebz). Lag is frustrating, but some sort of lag is always gonna be in online shooters, or games for that matter. The patches
 vary in the results. Some help a ton, then theyll patch again and its bad, then theyll patch again and its better. If you helping one, its bound to hurt another, just saying. BTW, too campy, too many people ignoring objectives is NOT part of the game. Thats
 the Dbag COD community, and if your a COD vet as you say, you should have known this. Spawns are fine. Its a game. If you die, just spawn back in and keep playing? People complained about getting "revenged spawned" or "spawned in too close to the action",
 but when its changed, people complain about getting spawn trapped. Whatever.</p>

<p>Lag is part of online gaming, true. However, lag comp is not and therein lies the cause of all the problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the community causing the issues, true again. However, IW/SHG (perhaps forced by Activision) gives people the tools to be those dbags. Cod uses a scoring system that benefits the lonewolf, objective ignoring playstyle rather than punishing it and
 IW/SHG (not the community) is the one who added in a counter-everything perk in Assassin. So I agree, the community has ruined what may've been a good title (like w/ MW2 &amp; BO), but they ruined it with the tools IW/SHG gaves them....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the spawns are not fine. MW3 is the 1st cod&nbsp;game where I'll consistently spawn into fire OR die and watch the killcam only to see the enemy getting killed and then respawning in the corner I just checked and passed. Say what you will, the MW3 spawns
 are awful.</p>

<p>^^I play mostly Dom, about 5000 games so far, and the spawns are FINE in it, no biggy really. Its a video game. If I die, I spawn back in and get back to playing. This game is NOTHING compared to MW2s Dbaggery Commando, OMA, Danger Close, tubing, Nuke, etc...........
 This game also has the hardline pro perk, helps with assists, and the Support KSRs, which I think helps objective gametypes, although some people still ignore them, LOL. Assassin doesnt bother me. Recon pro and flash bangs ran by a couple of my party find

<h2>            Achievement &#34;Warlord&#34; in Halo 5 will not unlock.</h2>
                    The achievement "Warlord" in Halo 5 will not unlock despite having completed the requirements multiple times. On Xbox.com my progress towards completing the achievement in 300%. I contacted Xbox support and went through several steps to try and resolve
 the issue and none worked. The support representative asked me to make a post here in order to have the issue resolved. Thanks!

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you using Internet Explorer to download the files?<span>&nbsp;
</span><br />
If yes, which version of Internet Explorer do you use?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were you able to see the download window earlier?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these methods <br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1: </strong>If you are using Internet Explorer, the automatic prompt for downloads might have been disabled.</span></p>
<p><span>To enable prompting:</span></p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer and click
<b>Tools</b>. clicking <b>Internet Options, </b><span>clicking<b> Security </b></span>tab.<br />
</span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Custom level...</b> to open the Security Settings dialogue.</span>
<br />
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Scroll down to the Downloads heading and select Enable for automatic prompting, files, and fonts.<br />
</span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>OK</b>, and if asked whether you are sure, click
<b>Yes</b>.</span> <br />
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>OK</b> again.</span>
<span>
<p><br />
After completing those steps, close all Internet Explorer windows. Then open Internet Explorer and attempt the download again.</p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>You can also download the download manager and check.</span>
<br />
<strong><span>Microsoft Download Manager</span> <br />

<h2>            The User&#8217;s password must be changed before signing in....</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I restored my pc through Dell's software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the restore, every time I login I get the error: The User‚Äôs password must be changed before signing in....</p>
<p>I put in the same password and it's all good.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>Windows 10 Version 1809 (OS Build 17763.529)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do this I found on another question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press&nbsp;<span><em>Windows key + R</em></span>, then type&nbsp;<em><span>lusrmgr.msc</span></em>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span><em>Enter</em></span>.</li><li>Click on&nbsp;<span><em>Users</em></span>, right-click on your OEM administrator account and select&nbsp;<span><em>Properties</em></span>.</li><li>Uncheck the box for&nbsp;<em><span>User must change password at next logon</span></em>. Click on&nbsp;<span><em>Apply&nbsp;</em></span>and&nbsp;<span><em>OK&nbsp;</em></span>to save changes.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>It would be best if you can also send me a screenshot of the said issue.</li></ul>

            Thank you for this link. I'm not sure if it will be worth trying because I have re-set my PC to the original settings and have since that received a different blue screen error message 'CRITICAL STRUCTURE CORRUPTION'!! Would you kow if the previous thread
 would be the best solution for this error message too? I don't want to make it any worse! Thanks

</p><p>For more information, there is a big possibility that your computer only needs an update of drivers. You can follow the provided resolution above, and see if you still get the blue screen.</p>
