<h2>            Windows 10 Reset - Personal Files</h2>
                    I'm wanting to do a reset on my laptop that I recently upgraded to Windows 10. I noted the reset option that allows for keeping personal files. My question is what folders are kept using this option? I couldn't find anything specific on it.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would inform you that if you do a reset&nbsp;on Windows 10,&nbsp;that means you are doing a clean install of Windows 10, therefore,&nbsp;all&nbsp;your data will be removed&nbsp;including&nbsp;the option to roll back to previous version. Your Windows 10 will start as a&nbsp;new operating
 system.</p>
<p>So, if you are attempting to do a&nbsp;reset I would recommend you to first keep a back up of all your files and then reset your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is incorrect as one of the reset option shows that you can reset while keeping personal files. It does not, however, outline what exact files/folders are kept.</p>

<h2>            Download Iphone pictures</h2>
                    I am trying to download &amp; remove all pictures from my iPhone. When I connect my iPhone to my laptop, it is recognized as another folder/drive. My iPhone shows 582 pictures on it , however when I go into the DCIM folder it is empty. I am not sure why the
 folder when accessed via the PC shows zero files, but the iPhone still shows almost 600 pictures.&nbsp; Does anybody have the answer?

            Hello how are you, thanks for posting in our microsoft community, 
<br />
<br />Import to your PC
<br />You can import photos to your PC by connecting your device to your computer and using Windows Photos app:
<br />
<br />Make sure that you have the latest version of iTunes on your PC. Importing photos to your PC requires iTunes 12.5.1 or later.
<br />Connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your PC with a USB cable.
<br />You might need to unlock your iOS device using your passcode.
<br />You might also see a prompt on the iOS device asking you to Trust This Computer. Tap Trust or Allow to continue.
<br />Then, follow the steps in these Microsoft knowledge base articles to learn how to import photos to Windows Photos app:
<br />
<br />Windows 10
<br />
<br />Import photos and videos from phone to PC
<br />
<br />To transfer photos and videos from your phone to PC, connect your phone to the PC with a USB cable. 
<br />Make sure the phone is on and unlocked, and that you're using a working cable, then:
<br />On your PC, select the Start  button and then select Photos to open the Photos app.
<br />Select Import &gt; From a USB device, then follow the instructions. You can pick the items you want to import and select where to save them.
<br />If you're using having trouble with an Android device or iPhone, see the below notes:
<br />On Android devices: You might need to change the USB setting to allow you to transfer media or photos and not just charge the phone. Go to Notification Center and choose Transfer files or File transfer. 
<br />On iPhones: Make sure your phone is unlocked, and when you see the Trust this device notification, select Accept.
<br />Having trouble connecting your phone? Get help with USB problems.
<br />Need to import photos from your camera, not your phone? See the instructions for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />When you import videos from your iOS device to your PC, some might be rotated incorrectly in Windows Photos app. You can add these videos to iTunes to play them in the correct orientation.
<br />
<br />Photos and videos that you sync from your computer to your iOS device using iTunes can't be imported back to your computer. 
<br />
<br />Learn what to do if you canâ€˜t import photos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer.

            My approach would be to install Google Photos or OneDrive on the iPhone and let that app upload the images from the phone, then enable the setting that allows the app to remove all the backed-up photos from the phone. You can download them to the PC at that point, if you like.

<h2>            ddr3 ram not working</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi, </p>
<p>Si i was recently stupid enough tobuy some unbranded ram from chin, which itsaid was only compatible with AMD systems.i bought 2&nbsp; 4 gb sticks, my pc already only has 2gb of ram in it, and this fact is only made worse by the fact that my pc cpu is a apu,
 meaning 512 mb of my already scarce 2gb rams was being used by integrated graphics the ram i bought did not work, and i believe they were not compatible with my motherboard. Would there me any way in that would make these ram sticks work the computer does
 turn on, just nothing comes on the screens. Also, one of my dimm slots arent working apparently. Is there any way at all to resolve these issues?</p>

            If they are not compatible, you are likely not gonna get it to work, best you try getting a refund and purchase the right type of RAM for your system make and model.

            Hi  Arastoof,
<br />
<br />Do you have 4 slots or 2 slots for RAM in your PC?
<br />
<br />Remove the old stick of RAM altogether, it may be a different clock speed to the new RAM
<br />
<br />Insert one of the new RAM sticks firmly into one of the slots - they do need a firm push, until both clips engage
<br />
<br />When you star your PC, you should get a message on screen saying, the amount of system memory has changed, if so boot into BIOS and check to see if 4096 MB of RAM is showing
<br />
<br />If not, can you wake a photo of the old stick of RAM and a new stick of RAM, showing the labels and I will have a look to see if the new sticks are at all compatible with your system . . .       
        </p>

            Hi Arastoof, while the clock speed is different, there is no reason why that new RAM should not work in your PC, unless the RAM is faulty . . .

<p>Sorry, that's not correct. That's <strong>not</strong> the way Microsoft uses the<br />
term. The term "Virtual Memory" refers to the full complement of<br />
memory in your computer: it's the sum of physical memory (RAM) plus<br />
the Page File. See<br />

    <title>SSL Error preventing connection in Windows 10 - Potential Culprit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SSL Error preventing connection in Windows 10 - Potential Culprit Malwarebytes&#63;</h2>
                    <div>God bless anyone who can help me with this one...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>About 9 days now that Ive had connectivity problems on my windows 10 laptop. After a myriad of troubleshooting efforts turned up nothing, I finally pinpointed the issue as an SSL error. HTTP sites work fine, HTTPS do not. Some apps fall into the former
 category (FB Messenger works fine), some do not (Netflix, Whatsapp Web). Furthermore, using SSLUnblocker.com allows me to access any secure site without issue. Ive confirmed the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>--Date and Time are fine (synced to web etc etc)</div>
<div>--SSL Certs in Internet Options have been reset</div>
<div>--Issue is Browser independant, but ive still reset all browsers just to be safe</div>
<div>--Disabling Firewall or Antivirus does nothing</div>
<div>--Flushdns, Winsock, Netsh Commands do nothing (Feel free to reccomend incase ive missed some, but ive tried dozens)</div>
<div>--Host File editing or deletion has no effect</div>
<div>--Static DNS (8888,8844) likewise has no effect; SSL 3.0 is innefective&nbsp;</div>
<div>--Disabling or removing VPN adapters does nothing; LAN is not proxy dependant</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Im sure there are some other things im missing here that ive already tried, but to be certain, I uninstalled some different software early on in troubleshooting this, including Avast and Malwarebytes. I decided to reinstall them to experiment in a few
 different ways, tinkering with Avast's SSL Scanning, and scanning for malware once more via Malwarebytes (I checked several times towards the beginning). Doing this has given me my second break in cracking this thing; while running a scan in Malwarebytes,
 during the 3-4minutes the scan takes, I suddenly have full web access - including both browser and apps.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I feel like Im loosing my mind over this. Malwarebytes consistently turns up nothing, but - and perhaps my memory is playing tricks on me at this point - I vaguely remember the start of whole issue coinciding with the end of my Malwarebytes premium trial.
 Could this be something Malwarebytes isnt detecting? Could Malwarebytes itself have corrupted some setting on my system, something it would have left behind even after i'd uninstalled it completely up till now?</div>

            Thanks for such a speedy response Naresh!! Unfortunately, I have already tried all of the things you have listed here, multiple times sadly. The same applies to the steps mentioned on the Network Troubleshooting link, which was the first thing I tried
 prior to pinning the issue to an SSL error

            Naresh, I should add, I actually don't have an option for SSL 2.0 in my internet security settings. I have SSL 3.0, and TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2

<p>So I have some new things I can add here, for anyone who's following this thread: The issue persists in safemode with all visible startup processes disabled; it also persisted after creating a new guest user account and logging out and into the separate
 windows profile. Switched off IPv6 on all adapters and removed Wan Miniport IPv6 Adapter; I also set all IPv4 DNS to 8888-8844. Tried disabling all TLS, certificate warning &amp; certificate checking options in the advanced IE security options; added about:internet
 to trusted sites &amp; reset default security levels. Added port 443 to Windows Firewall (which again, ive disabled repetitively in experimentation). Ran a SFC scan &amp; a Tracert. Ill attatch the output below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that I have two windows updates from right around when this issue began - one right before (KB4023057 for 1803, which had 3 failed attempts in the days leading up, and finally installed right around when I noticed this issue), and one a few days
 earlier (KB890830 Malicious Software Removal Tool, which has somehow updated again since then). Unfortunately, neither of these have options to rollback or uninstall, nor had they created restore points - infact, for some reason, my oldest restore point dates
 to a few days&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>this whole mess began.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And yes, I have malwarebytes again. It has been uninstalled several times but, as I said, running a scan is currently the only way I can get semi-normal network access, so I currently have it installed and run constant scans just so I can use the web</p>
<p>

            Hi,
<p>Thank you for writing back. I really appreciate your time and patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, I would suggest you to uninstall both the updates since these updates may try to reset network settings if problems are detected, and it will clean up registry keys that may be preventing updates from being installed successfully. To uninstall
 the update, please follow the steps mentioned below: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows settings (Windows key + I). </li><li>Then click on Security and Updates. </li><li>Then click on Windows Updates. </li><li>Then click on Update History. </li><li>Then click on Uninstall Updates.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. </p>

            Hi Naresh! Thanks again for responding! Unfortunately as I mentioned, neither of these updates are available to rollback or uninstall. Though they are listed under "update history" they are both notably absent from the list provided for "uninstall updates"&nbsp;

<p>I suggest that you try resetting the media library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:</p>
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt.<br />

    <title>Web Skype dropping calls during meetings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gbann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Web Skype dropping calls during meetings</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently am an offline vendor working for Microsoft in Redmond. I am using the Web version of Skype for my meetings but I keep getting dropped during the meeting. It can happen 3 - 4 times during an hour long meeting. I am wondering if I purchase Skype
 for Business if this will no longer happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I call my husband with Skype Web, I can see him but can't hear him. On his side, he can hear me but can't see me. Again, if I purchase Skype for Business, will this eliminate these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Enterprise, Version 1709, OS Build 16299.192, 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>GBAnn</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Skype for Business is different from the Skype app. I strongly advise you to have the Skype application installed on your device and secure a
 strong Internet connection to avoid any issues on your Skype calls. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can download the Skype for Windows 10 or classic Skype app on this
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<strong>3. </strong>Norton/Symantec could be involved or disguising the issue so fully uninstall it and then run its maker's Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 is a full antivirus.<br />

<br />
</span></a>==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h3> cookymonzta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting an error &#34;Closing 1 app and shutting down&#47;This app is preventing shutdown&#34; While working on the system.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:Closing 1 app and shutting down/This app is preventing shutdown</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba C55T laptop with Windows 8.1 installed; but on repeated occasions, whenever I shut down or restart my laptop, I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Closing 1 app and shutting down.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>This app is preventing shutdown.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been varying degrees of the length of time that message stays there until the machine finally shuts down.&nbsp; It could be on the screen for 1 or 2 seconds, or even 5 to 10 seconds.&nbsp; At least twice is remained on the screen for more than 30 seconds,
 and twice more I had to manually shut the machine down.&nbsp; The program is never revealed alongside the message.&nbsp; All that is displayed is a generic .EXE icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked out this subject at Google, but I have yet to stumble on a Web site detailing the cause of the problem.&nbsp; But the problem has existed for more than a year; which leads me to the conclusion that someone has already discovered the program that
 is taking too long to shut down (or <em>won't</em> shut down), with the result being that this message pops up.&nbsp; With the same message popping up on many occasions from many machines (not just my own but from others), it
<em>has</em> to be obvious that the exact same program is the cause of the interruption, or delay, of the shutdown procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which program is it?&nbsp; And how do I upgrade or replace it, <em>if</em> it can be upgraded or replaced?</p>

            <p>Hi Cooky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you are getting an error when you are working on the computer or shutting it down. It could occur due to corrupt or damaged system files or software.</p>
<p>Is your computer registered under a domain network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the below methods and check if that helps.</p>
<p>Method 1.</p>
<p>Run the system in safe mode.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2.<br />
Run the system in clean boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to <br />
start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just downloaded Windows 10 today and things were working fine but when I was playing a game it gave me the message "Display Drivers have stopped responding and have recovered" and it freezes my screen but I still hear game sounds. I would like to know
 how to fix the problem without doing a lot to my computer. If there is a simple way to do that I'd appreciate the help.</p>

            <p>I did like you said and even re-installed windows 10. I will be in the middle of face book typing a long message and the whole screen goes black even now. I try everything to get it back up but nothing works. I get the warning on the bottom right a bar pops
 out telling me the display driver issue. Why is this such a huge recurring problem now with windows 10. I uninstalled the driver and did the updates and many other things others have proposed. I called Microsoft and talked to a guy in India I did what he said,
 still nothing is working. WTH? </p>

<h2>            Numeric keypad is Upside Down&#33;</h2>
                    New Surface Pro with Windows 10 S. The numeric keypad is upside down! How do you turn it over. How is this not a problem? The only threads I can find are old.&nbsp; Does no one use Excel with a Surface?

                    I'm not the best with technology, and for sure Windows 10 is :/&nbsp; I can't successfully get my printer to work.&nbsp; When I try to print, I receive the message, "Driver is in an error state", but when I go to device manager it says the driver is working.&nbsp; Also,
 throubleshoot doesn't find anything.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks. :)

<p>No, I found it on the list of printers and it supposedly downloaded?&nbsp; I have an older HP printer, but it was on the list so I thought it should work.&nbsp; It's an HP Desk Jet P2305.</p>
<p>

            Hi Patricia, click the link below to download the plug and lay package for that printer
<br />
<br />When that downloads, install that from the file that downloads, hopefully that will get your printer working for you . . .

<p>sem querer tretar com a concorrÃªncia mas acho q a Evolution Studios (de Drive Club) merce e muito esse premio.. prometeram muito, nÃ£o cumpriram quase nada.. e jÃ¡ faz mais de um mÃªs e ainda tendo problemas...</p>
<p>a Ubisoft pelo menos entregou ainda o Far Cry4 e AC Rougue bem feitos, isso sem contar no Child of Light e valiants heart bem elogiados!</p>

<p>Tinha esquecido dessa. Eu mesmo sem ter um PS4 ja estava no Hype pro Drive Club e me decepcionei so com as analise</p>
<p>Sobre a Ubisoft apesar do Far Cry e o Assasains Creed Rogue terem sido otimos nao pode se negar que Watch Dogs e Assasains Creed Unity foram decepcionante</p>
<p>Se a Ubisoft nao foi a pior com certeza foi a mais decepcionante</p>

Zum Thema Originalversionen im Videomarktplatz gab es <a href="http://www.dreisechzig.net/wp/archives/1626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
vor gut 5 Jahren (MÃ¤rz 2009)</a> einen Versuchsballon. Weil halt "viele" nach Originalversionen verlangt haben, wurde testweise ein Film in vier Versionen angeboten: Als HD und SD in eben Deutscher und Englischer Synchro.</p>
<p>Anhand der Downloadzahlen sollte dann festgestellt werden, wie groÃŸ das Interesse wirklich ist, und wie oft im Vergleich zur deutschen Version der Film auf Englisch gesehen wurde.</p>
<p>Auch wenn mich der Film nicht interessiert hat, habe ich ihn damals auf Englisch geladen, weil mich die Originalversionen von anderen Filmen sicher interessiert hÃ¤tten.
</p>
<p><br />
Wie Du aber fÃ¼nf Jahre SpÃ¤ter siehst, war das Interesse der "meisten" Xbox Nutzer nicht groÃŸ genug, dass sich Englische Versionen lohnen.
</p>
<p>Insofern: Du Ã¼bersiehst nichts. Es gibt die Originalversion nicht. :-(</p>

<p>Ich muÃŸ zugeben, ich habe aufgrund meines Lovefilm/Amazon DVD Zusende-Dienstes recht selten den Xbox Video-Marktplatz genutzt, bin also daher Ã¼berrascht, dass Du die Wahl zwischen Englisch und Deutsch hattest.
</p>
<p>Falls sich aber nicht an der Technik was geÃ¤ndert hat, sind die Sprachversionen zwei unterschiedliche Filme. Zitat von der Website (aber bedenke: Auch hier ist der Stand 2009):</p>

<p>Wieso kann ich nicht einfach wÃ¤hrend des Filmes, wie bei einer handelsÃ¼blichen DVD, die Tonspuren wechseln?<br />
Oder war das wieder ein Lizensproblem?</p>

<p>Weil die Filmfirmen in der Regel zwei MasterbÃ¤nder anliefern, die Microsoft nicht nachtrÃ¤glich miteinander synchronisieren kann. Im Videolabor liegt also eine Kassette nur mit deutschem und eine nur mit englischem Ton. Von der DVD rippen kann man auch nicht,
 weil die BildqualitÃ¤t durch Re-Komprimierung schlechter wÃ¤re, als das Masterband speziell fÃ¼r Live zu digitalisieren und komprimieren.<br />
AuÃŸerdem kÃ¶nnte man dann ja nicht messen, wieviele Leute Englisch und wieviele Deutsch wollten.</p>

<p>fÃ¼r mich ein schlechtes Argument, denn wÃ¤hrend der Leihzeit kÃ¶nnte man (insbesondere beim Streamen) locker beide "TÃ¼ren" aufmachen, wenn man auf "Film neu starten" klickt.</p>
<p>Allerdings ist es ein gutes Beispiel dafÃ¼r, was passiert wenn irgendwelche Leute eine Statistik erstellen wollen, die davon keine Ahnung haben. Frei nach dem Motto, traue keiner Statistik, die du nicht durch deine Inkompetenz gefÃ¤lscht hast ! die Leute,
 die sich gerne den Film in beiden Versionen angucken wollen, kommen in der Statistik nicht wirklich vor, selbst wenn sie so blÃ¶d wÃ¤ren 2 Mal dafÃ¼r zu bezahlen...</p>
<p>auch wenns lÃ¤nger her ist, der Zustand hat sich ja leider bis heute nicht geÃ¤ndert...</p>
<p>hab ich das jetzt eigentlich richtig verstanden, daÃŸ das dann sogar bei der Kaufversion so ist ?!? autsch</p>

<p>50mbit uverse using ATT dns servers that show me in the correct neighborhood.&nbsp; Youtube, netflix and amazon prime play fine for the most part.</p>

            Hi Axeman2,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Generic drivers for audio are installed by windows itself, which is the reason its showing as device is working properly in device manager. You may want to install the drivers for ATI High definition audio from the manufacturerâ€™s website.<br />
<br />
Check the link <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/b3c6477e-1111-4b9f-a52a-fffdc51e9c901033.mspx#E6F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>i see with the upgrade there is an option to get the backup cd sent. would i be able to reboot from a crash with this back up cd without reinstalling vista.</p>

<br />
In order to install the upgrade version of Windows 7, you must have a qualifying Windows operating system installed and activated.&nbsp; You cannot install an upgrade version of Windows 7 on a blank hard drive.&nbsp; The installation procedure does not ask you to insert
 a Windows disc in the drive for verification, the actual qualifying operating system must be installed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not have a qualifying Windows operating system installed with a genuine license activated, then you cannot use the upgrade version of Windows 7 - you would need a "full version" Windows 7 license.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. A qualifying Windows operating system must be installed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The qualifying Windows operating system must have a genuine license (product key) and it must be activated.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. To upgrade, boot to the qualifying Windows desktop, insert the Windows 7 Upgrade disc in the DVD drive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. When the setup menu appears, select Custom (advanced) to initiate a clean install procedure.<br />
<br />
That's why I recommend you create a backup image of your installation once you have successfully upgraded to Windows 7 and everything is working great to avoid all of that :<br />

<h2>            Wireless connection delayed on startup and wake - Win 8</h2>
                    Hi guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Need some help here. My laptop's wireless connection doesnt connect straight away after start up or when I start using my laptop after sleep. The delay is of about 3-5 mins. &nbsp;Once the internet is connected everything is normal. I am using an HP dv6 6050se
 with Windows 8 Pro 64. My Wireless adapter is Broadcom 4313GN.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This laptop originally came with a windows 7 however I did a clean install of windows 8 pro on it. Never had this problem for the first 3 weeks but now suddenly on its own something happened. Haven't installed anything recently but a few games. I only
 remember doing a windows update recently.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried uninstalling the driver and running the internet with the windows own driver but nothing is different. I tried searching the internet for solutions but so far found one more guy who had the same problem as me and&nbsp;hasn't&nbsp;managed to solved it yet.
 He listed his problem here:&nbsp;<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Wireless-Internet-Home-Networking-e-g-Windows-8/HP-wireless-connection-delay-problem-after-startup/td-p/2426467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Wireless-Internet-Home-Networking-e-g-Windows-8/HP-wireless-connection-delay-problem-after-startup/td-p/2426467</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone tell me how to sort out this problem?</div>
                </div>
