<h2>            Is DVD &#38; CD burning harmful&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a Windows PC, with a DVD reader and writer, and every know and then I burn some videos or music to a blank disc.
</p>
<p>I heard that it's harmful to burn discs often, is that real? </p>
<p>And another thing, is it fine to multitask while burning a DVD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Nasr, no, it is not harmful to burn DVD's or CD's, that is an Internet myth . . .
<br />
<br />With regards to multi-tasking while burning discs, it depends on your system. If you have a good system (plenty of processing power, RAM and hard drive space) then yes you can multi-task while burning discs
<br />
<br />If you have a less powerful PC, I would not multi-task as it can lead to unreadable media being created . . .
<br />
<br />Though if you are using 3rd burning software apart from Windows burning engine, then yes it is safe as that software will buffer the data being burned better than Windows does . . .

Hello robert3078,</p>
<p>I would really appreciate If you please perform following steps to solve your problem.</p>
<p>REMOVE WINDOWS PASSWORD (WINDOWS 2000,NT, XP, 2003 server): -</p>
<p>1.Insert your Windows operating system CD into your CD drive and start your computer. Make sure that the Drive you selected is the bootable</p>
<p>drive.</p>
<p>2.Usually your computer will state on the screen that it will now boot from the CD or that you will have to press a specific key to boot from the CD.</p>
<p>Select the key to boot from the CD.</p>
<p>3.Now that the computer is booting from the CD, you will see an initial set up screen that says the computer is loading files</p>
<p>4.After the computer loads some files, a welcome screen will pop up, follow the prompts and press enter to set up Windows.</p>
<p>5.The next prompt will be the licensing agreement; presses accept.</p>
<p>6.Once you have accepted the licensing agreement, a set up screen will popup that will give you the option to do a repair. Select the repair</p>
<p>option.</p>
<p>7.The repair option should start running immediately and might take a few minutes to check your disks, files, etc.</p>
<p>8.Once the computer has copied files and scanned your computer it will ask you to reboot your computer or it will automatically reboot your</p>
<p>computer. You might see a message that your computer will reboot in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>9.When the computer reboots, do not press any keys. The computer will automatically reboot and you will see the Windows screen and you will</p>
<p>see the message Installing Windows.</p>
<p>10.It is important to keep your eyes on the lower left corner of the screen. You will see a message pop up. It will state "Installing Devices". When</p>
<p>you see this progress bar, immediately press "Shift + F10"</p>
<p>11.When you press Shift + F10 a command console will pop up giving you access to many system functions.</p>
<p>12.At the prompt enter the following: NUSRMGR.CPL and press enter. This input will give you access to your graphical access of your user</p>
<p>accounts in your control panel.</p>
<p>13.Since you have forgotten your password, you can choose the account that you need to change or remove the password from. If you want to</p>
<p>remove your password so that you no longer have to enter it when logging in, you can enter the following at the command prompt: "control</p>
<p>userpasswords2". Once you have made the changes, close the window and close the command console. You can now continue with the repair.</p>
<p>14.Your computer will continue with the repair and ask you for your product ID, enter your product ID. Once your operating system starts up, you</p>
<p>will be able to access all your user account with either the new password you created or no password at all. It is important to note that this</p>
<p>strategy does not damage any of your files or settings. All of your files and settings should be intact.</p>
<p>If you face any problem, please reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Files stuck in read only</h2>
                    <p>I have recently found files that I intentionally set to read only are not able to be changed back to turn the read only setting off. I have tried to change user privileges on Windows defender as I read that could be the source of the problem after updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The read only box can be blank, checked or filled. For the files which are stuck the box is filled. It seems to accept a change in status but the files are not able to be saved over and when checking again, the box is filled again.</p>

            Hi Andrew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Type Controlled Folder Access in Start Search,
<br />Open Controlled Folder Access Settings, 
<br />Disable Controlled Folder Access.
<br />Test if the problem persists.
<br />
<br />See files stuck in Read Only fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/windows-10-read-only-problem-has-a-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/windows...</a>
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/document-folders-marked-read-only-after-upgrade-to/4f00d3fe-82b0-4e6d-a92a-f81751aa6f51?auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of the above help this an be due to a corrupted User account, so test this by creating  a new Local Admin account, sign into it, move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />When was the last Clean Install?  The reason I ask is because no one who has  followed the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install has ever come back (that I've seen) to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.   It is a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will know what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 
<br />
<br />Short of that there is  an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves only your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>It turns out that the problem is the read only boxes were falsely filled in.</p>
<p>I was trying to change their read only status but when I checked they were still marked with a filled box as read only. After a restart (to try the alternate user approach) it turned out the files were changed from read only, just the boxes were not showing
 that it had worked.</p>
<p>They are working normally now.</p>
<p>Come to think of it I did read someone say that they had this problem - files showing the wrong symbol in a box.</p>

            Yes, Andrew, it was in one of the tutorials provided.  I'm glad you got it fixed.  May I ask why you gave me five bad ratings in a row?  <br /><br />To help others please mark the post which helped most as Answer.  A decent rating would also be appreciated since I spent quite a bit of time researching this for you and others today.

                    <p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the leap to Windows 10 and like it so far, but File history is seriously starting to make me mad. &nbsp;I have repeatedly excluded folders and click on save changes, but once I close and go back in, everything that I excluded is gone from the list. &nbsp;I
 restarted, turned off File History, going through the GUI and clicked each one to select remove but it doesn't. &nbsp;Went into the configuration, deleted it all to start over, but nope still backing up folders that are unnecessary</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Examples.... C:\Users\Junior\Music C:\Users\Junior\Movies&nbsp;C:\Users\Junior\.swt&nbsp;C:\Users\Junior\SavedGames and the list goes on and on</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the exact same behavior on my fresh Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excluding folders does not work... it does not matter whether I try to exclude the folder in the modern file history settings dialog or the extended classic Windows dialog. In both dialogs I can select the folder to be excluded but after returning to the
 overview, no folder has been added to the list of excluded folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition there seems to be an inconsistency between the modern and the classic dialog. In the modern dialog, the folders to be backed up can selected by the user. I wasn't able to find the corresponding functionality in the classic dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

            In my update installation of Windows 10 Pro, all of my settings for excluded folders are ignored &nbsp;or if I delete any folders in "Back up these Folders" are ignored and reset to whatever the defaults are. This makes File History pretty much useless for
 me. Able to reproduce on 2 separate systems. &nbsp;

            <p>I have the exact same problem with Windows 10. It does not matter if I add a folder to the exclusion list, or if I remove it from list of folders to be backed up. Once I save the setting, then return to the menu all of the settings have reverted to default.
<br />
</p>
<p>The inability to customize what is backed up in anyway makes the feature completely useless. So once again we have a loss of functionality going from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The Windows 7 "Previous Versions" backup method was much more functional, and did
 not require a separate drive just to use it. Despite what the media may claim, we can add this Windows version to the list of previous Windows Failures: Windows ME, Windows Vista, Windows 8, and now Windows 10.</p>

            Same issue here,&nbsp;I think. Removing folder from the list does not work, while adding a folder to it works. I haven't really tried to add these folders to Exclude list, since it doesn't make sense to have same folders on both lists,&nbsp;but I'll do it if that
 is the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I have this problem, too, and the file history size is increasing at a prodigious rate - I have to prune it down to "Latest Only", which makes it useless.

            <p>From what I can make out, all folders in C:\Users\Donny (in my case) are backed up by File History by default. The only folder which is not backed up is C:\Users\Donny\AppData .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crucially though, Windows 10 will not allow any of these folders to be de-selected from the backup. Any changes made to the backup selections will be overridden when the next backup is started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to correct this.</p>

<p>mick, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only Windows updates which are around at the moment are definition updates for Windows Defender.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I suggest you do is to run System Restore and wind back the clock to a date when you know Netflix was working properly. Here are the steps to take.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to System.</li><li>Click the link to "System Protection" on the left near the top and then click the System Restore button.</li><li>In the menu which appears next, checkmark the option at the bottom to "Choose a different restore point" and then click Next.</li><li>Choose a date from the calendar when you know the connection waa working properly and then click Next.
</li></ol>
<p>System Restore takes a few mins to run during which time the computer will reboot. Don't interrupt this process even though you'll be faced with a black screen at some point. Eventually, you'll see the usual lock screen where you have to log in again.</p>

<p>Mick, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Which antivirus application are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's always wise to disable Windows Defender prior to installing a third party AV though. Two antivirus programs on the same machine can cause system instability. All you need to do to achieve that is launch WD from Windows Control Panel, go to the "Settings"
 menu and remove the checkmark from "Real Time Protection".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp; before you install any software at all, always create a manual Restore point so that if the application causes instability, you can revert to the time prior to installing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a manual Restore point, click the "Create" button at the bottom in the same System Restore memu which you used to fix the Netflix problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third party AV have been known to create havoc with Windows though. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>Robert, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows Defender and I also have a paid for license to Malwarebytes Pro. In "Protection" mode, that prevents the installation of malware as well as blocking infected sites. Here's a screenshot of the Protection mode settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c17ed389-28e2-43b1-a835-d3b450fae4e1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's a one-off lifetime license fee which costs about $21. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives me peace of mind though and doesn't conflict with Windows Defender at all.
</p>

    <title>Error 43, problems with graphics card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cj.75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 43, problems with graphics card</h2>
                    I have recently finished building my gaming PC and have got an 'Asus GTX 1050 Ti 4GB Phoenix graphics card' and my computer seems to be running alright but not as well as i'd hoped. I noticed that in device manager there was a little exclamation mark next
 to my graphics card and when i checked properties it says "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)". I have searched online and have been prompted to update my driver, which I've done (from their website and automatically).
 I have also tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it however nothing seems to work. If someone could help me out here i would be very grateful.

<p>Hi CJ.75,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Graphics card issue on Win10 is certainly the biggest and most encountered issue so far...</p>
<p>I have had my frustration over it many times. Here's my suggestion to help you either clean install, update driver, or install necessary upgrades -- all smoothly without any hindrance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you have an internal iGPU/onboard display, then I suggest you remove the discreet graphics card... and, freshly install your Windows 10. You will be amazed the amount of updates that will be installed; microcodes etc., I have had not noticed such updates
 when I had only discreet GPU attached. Once you've installed Windows, use only Windows update to let it find the drivers for iGPU/Audio etc.,. You can also right click on the missing device and then click update(to manually update it over the internet). I
 usually let Windows handle all the necessary drivers that it could find and install without any interference from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once that's done. Now, turn of your machine, and install your discreet GPU(nVIDIA or AMD whichever it is). Hopefully, your GPU supports UEFI driver if you've Windows 10 installed with CSM disabled in bios. If you do, then you should see the Windows logon
 screen. Login in, and wait for Windows to do its updates routine. If you keep getting this error: "nVIDIA.. blah blah failed to installed. We will try again later...."</p>
<p>Just click that device and update it manually, but via the internet.... not by clicking 'Browse' and locating it... Let Windows install it for you. You should be on 'Microsoft Basic Display' in order to update/install the graphics driver.</p>
<p>Often people try running nVIDIA/GeForce setup while Microsoft tries to rerun its update for the graphics --- resulting in the device going back n forth between 'Microsoft Basic Display' and 'Video/VGA compatible controller'. nVIDIA setup won't run without
 seeing 'MS Basic Display'. It gotta be there in order to be updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If MS was successful in updating your graphics card driver. Usually, it's ver 373. something, then now you can run nVIDIA or GeForce setup. I suggest using GeForce utility. It works like a charm. Also, I'd install only the display driver and HD audio(given
 if I m using HDMI connection). Physx if you're into gaming. 3Dvision if you've 3D glasses. Don't install any unnecessary baggage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I find that once you let MS pick up your devices(iGPU and Discreet Graphics card), the updates and future upgrades -- all go nice and smoothly. Before, I had my iGPU disabled in the BIOS, cuz my ASUS PC came with the discreet GTX660 card. And, I ran into
 many issues on Windows 10. However, once I enabled both integrated and discreet GPU.... voila! MS started installing updates in a jiff!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, whatever CPU processor you got... just make sure it's drivers are updated. Then, add your big card. Also, remove external storage cards, wifi lan card etc., ...they often cause Blue Screen of Death!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Computer slowed to a crawl after Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I upgraded to Windows 10 some months ago and have had no problems until now. Windows released an update not to long ago. Since the installation of that update, my computer has slowed to a crawl. It will take 30 minutes sometimes for it to load, getting
 files open or programs started is impossible.</p>
<p>I would like to remove the update but I can't even open the Start menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this problem? Does anyone know how to remove this latest update?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that the icons for Adobe Acrobat Reader are black and this issue occured after installing the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try these methods to check if the issue gets resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the Fixit for broken desktop shortcuts and common system maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/system_maintenance_for_windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/system_maintenance_for_windows/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Rebuild the icon cache.</p>
<p>a)Press "Windows key + E" to open My Computer.</p>
<p>b)Click View on the navigation ribbon on the top and check the "Hidden Items" box.</p>
<p>c) Navigate to this location "C:\Users\(User Name)\AppData\Local" and delete "IconCache.db".</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This deletes the file to the Recycle Bin. It is safe to empty the Recycle Bin when finished.<br />
d)Close the window and&nbsp;&nbsp;empty the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>e)Restart the computer.<br />
When you go back, you will notice the Size of the IconCache.db file is smaller, and the Date Modified is now the current date.
</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If for some reason IconCache.db is not there or the size has not changed much, then just restart the computer again. You may need to restart a couple of times in some cases.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Reinstall Adobe Acrobat Reader.</p>
<p>a)Press "Windows key + R", type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter.</p>
<p>b)Uninstall Adobe Acrobat Reader IX from here.</p>
<p>c)Restart the computer and download it again from <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.adobe.com</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to search content of a text file in windows explorer</h2>
                    I 've turned on indexing and other setting, everything is working fine when i search inside a .txt file. But the problem is i can't make it work when finding word/string inside a python file (.py). This is also just a text file , but why it doesn't work?
 i already add a new extension to the indexing options -&gt; advanced and the .py is already listed. But still it doesn't work. What is the problem ? Really frustrating when most things doesn't work in windows.

<h2>            ease of installation Windows 10</h2>
                    I am a senior citizen so some of the technical stuff in the FAQ is not that helpful. I would like a simple answer to a straightforward question please. Will Windows 10 install all by itself like other upgrades or am I going to have to do more than follow
 an installation wizard? I can install most automatic software but anything that requires me to set up "bootable" things or get into the actual program files on my computer is beyond me. Would I be better off paying my computer store to install it for me? Sorry
 to be so clueless but some of the "helpful" content on your site is making me very insecure. I would almost rather keep W7 that risk messing up my computer. Middie

    <title>August Xbox One update has broken my Turtle Beach x42 transmitter. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ov bane  say:</h3>
<h2>            August Xbox One update has broken my Turtle Beach x42 transmitter.</h2>
                    
<p>I just plugged my transmitter and optical cable into my XB1 turned the console on, the transmitter turned on then it turned off because I did not turn my headset on as well, the console did the latest August update and restarted, and then when everything
 was done I turned on my headset which usually turns on the transmitter as well, the transmitter would not light up, as if no power is going to it, I tired un plugging the usb and plugging It back in, turning my headset off and on again, restarted the console,
 and even tried to get It to work with my xbox 360 and still nothing happens, so now I have a headset with no in game audio, thanks microsoft. to get another transmitter I would have to buy the £100 headset again because nowhere sell the transmitter separately.
 Has anyone else had this problem? Please let me know and tell me if there Is a fix, or tips to get the transmitter to work again.</p>

<p>I think I bought another pair of x42s from the Turtle Beach's ebay store so I could have spare parts (http: // stores . ebay .co .uk/ Turtle-Beach-UK) take out the spaces, I could of sent it off to TB to get it repaired but I couldn't be bothered to wait
 so long. It says on the ebay store that the shop seller is currently away, and they don't seem to have hardly any stock. you can also buy the transmitter on the turtle beach website, It was out of stock when mine broke. Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I've been through three XP400 transmitters that all died in exactly the same way, for no apparent reason, while connected to my One. Turtle Beach could not have been more helpful (transmitter was in warranty) and eventually offered me an upgrade to the XP510s.
 Excellent headphones. But.... Have had them a few weeks, flawless performance, go away for a few days and now the XP510 transmitter is also dead. While I was away, there was an update to the OS on the One? Coincidence?

<h2>            Media Player - &#39;find album info&#39; not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>This past month, Media Player has ceased being able to locate album information for audio CDs.&nbsp; It used to work, but now it doesn't.&nbsp; When I request that it finds album info, the Internet Explorer 'website cannot be found' error is displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CDs I am using are normal commercial CDs - nothing that I have personally created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please how I can resolve this</p>

<p>Hello Amit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the steps above - and the 'private' and 'public' tick boxes were indeed, un-ticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore ticked them, but the public box for 'Windows Media Player Sharing Centre' is greyed-out - I am unable to tick it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly as a consequence of this, I still cannot access album information from the internet.</p>

<br />7. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>New version of Skype a&#47;o 1&#47;12&#47;18 gives a view with no - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New version of Skype a&#47;o 1&#47;12&#47;18 gives a view with no &#34;end call&#34; icon or path</h2>
                    <p>The current Skype has been opening with two different views ... one that has the functions fairly well defined however another view that does not have a "end call" icon or path visible.&nbsp; First day or two the view was normal ... today the view has the "dead
 end" view.&nbsp; The new Skype has given more problems in three days than the old Skype did in 3 years.&nbsp; Is there a way to get to "settings" that will yield the proper view of a call being made and ended?&nbsp; Thanks</p>
