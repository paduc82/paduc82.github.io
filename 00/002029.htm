<h2>            Windows Defender .... Driving me nuts</h2>
                    Hi all, <br />
<br />
I am hoping this is the place where I can really find my answer. I am using Windows 7, 32 bit Home Basic on my HP laptop.
<br />
<br />
I am not known to ever get a virus and been with McAfee for years to protect me. I am studying for a very important national board exam and needed to download something to read.<br />
<br />
On 5/3 I downloaded the item and read it. Approximately 22 hours later on 5/4 while I was eating my breakfast and looking at my computer some annoying weird messages were popping up and McAfee was asking me if I want to give them internet access. Obviously
 not, so I blocked them. Next things go even more crazy and I see a bizarre, never before seen "Virus scan" called System Care Antivirus running. It blocked my Firefox and shut down my McAfee.
<br />
<br />
So I called McAfee. I ran their tool including Stinger (and my virus scan which failed to acknowledge a virus is running rampant). After futile attempt, I ran on Safe mode. I downloaded Malware Bytes Anti-Malware and killed the bug. I also re-ran this software
 on normal mode to make sure I am safe. Things were behaving.... until I came back home after work last night. McAfee firewall was down. I know this firewall relies on Windows Firewall so I noticed Security System and all it's components are not on and missing.
 When I tried to turn them I was getting error messages.<br />
<br />
So I do another hunt for any remaining bugs. I re-ran Mayware bytes, along with HitmanPro, Norton Power Eraser and Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool. All came negative. Went to sleep and this morning I saw a thread by Bleeping Computers and downloaded the Windows
 Repair Tool from Tweaking.com. It ran it's magic, Windows Firewall was on, all missing components are back on.
<br />
<br />
I decided to look in my Services one last time. I noticed Security Center was off, which I turned it back on. Windows Defender was not. If I go to the search box and find and click on Windows Defender I get, "Windows Cannot Access the Specified Drive, Path,
 or File. You may not have the appropriate Permissions to Access Them". <br />
<br />
So issue how to get Windows Defender back on? Oh and it works side by side nicely with McAfee. I highly doubt McAfee shut it off when it never did so prior to this incident. One last question.... on my notifications area the white flag of action center is gone
 too. When I hit customize &gt; turn system icons on or off .... it's grayed to off. So I can't change it. And the creepiest part when I hit customize I see an image of that virus called 474E.temp (to pop on if a notification comes). Those programs can't find
 it, I can't find it. It's a mystery. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the long rant, I really need help and I am stressed and frustrated with this with my upcoming test. I just put a new hard disk on and the virus had to stain it.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<h2>            Number to call in order to reset my Microsoft Office activation key</h2>
                    Hi. My harddrive was recently replaced but when I try to activate the pre-installed Microsoft Office 2007, my activation key is invalid, due to it being used when I had my old harddrive. When I called my computer manufacturer, they said Microsoft should
 be able to reset the key - anyone know the right number to call?

    <title>Formula to add negative time value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micktgfd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formula to add negative time value</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a time sheet in Excel which will occasionally need to show a negative time value if my hours are down for a particular week, for instance I need to work 18;30 hours one week but have only managed 15:40 so I am down by 02:50. I have
 cracked most of it but can't get around the next bit which is when I try to sum my hours down (-02:50) with the previous weeks hours which in this case are up (01:15). It would be simple enough with a positive value but the negative answer causes problems.
 I found that if I convert the time to a decimal value I can work out the answer but only in a decimal format and cannot convert this back to hours and minutes. I'm not great with Excel so the answer may be obvious, can anyone help please?

            One method would be to select the 1904 date system in your Excel Options.&nbsp; This will change dates that have been previously entered to be "off" by four years and a day. But it will allow negative&nbsp; times.<br />

    <title>Is Access the best option&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christinahoffman924  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Access the best option&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am an intermediate level user of Access and I am wondering if there is a different product I should consider using for my project or if there are ways to optimize my process for better performance that I am unaware of due to my inexperience. Any new product
 would have to be very user-friendly so the end-users would not have to train extensively as they are very basic users. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Below is some rather lengthy background on the project. &nbsp;Thank you, in advance, to anyone who
 is willing to weigh in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a master Access database of employment testing scores.&nbsp; There are over 100K records and continued growth is expected. Most raw data is exported from a scanner application into Excel and a few others are web-based scores and &nbsp;provided via csv file.&nbsp;
 There are about 7 tests in all. &nbsp;From Excel, the data is imported to Access where a series of update queries/macros are performed to calculate scores, round up, and determine whether a candidate is recommended for employment - either R or NR is placed in the
 result field. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the master Access database, a second database is created from the Master for recruiters and HR personnel who, for various reasons, should not see the actual scores - not to mention the full SSN number of the candidate which is included in
 every result record as an identifier. When the tables are created for this secondary database, a new SSN field is created with only the last 4 of the SSN. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has a very busy testing program and has offices in several states that are testing almost daily and their results need to be added to the Master database weekly. Therefore, the tables in the secondary database need to be updated as well. Employees
 from all offices need to be able to access the secondary database to verify if a candidate is eligible for employment or promotion based on their test results. However, security at this company is rigid.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you may already have guessed, this is a problematic scenario for many reasons, but these are the main areas of concern:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Because many HR personnel across multiple locations have access to the secondary database, updating it presents a problem because you can’t update a table if it is open and more often than not, at least one person is either actively using it or forgot
 to close it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Also, automation tasks are nearly impossible because the drive letter where the database exists differs among the users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Access is being used since everyone has Office. However, because of #2 above, we can’t use Import/Export Specs. In addition, even the main user is very inexperienced and is copying rows from Excel and using paste append to get them into the master database.&nbsp;
 Due to security clearance, this user is the only user with permission to access the master database and create the secondary database.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            In addition to the points Scott has made, you need to appreciate that Access per se is a development environment.&nbsp; The application used by the users is developed in Access, so the 'user friendliness' of the application is a matter for the developer, which
 I assume is you.&nbsp; This includes the design of the logical model, represented by the tables and the relationships between them, and the design of the interface through which the users will interface with the data by means of forms, reports and the underlying
 queries in which the base data is managed so as to be presented to the user in a manner appropriate to the requirements of the business.&nbsp; It also includes the management of the security of the database, which seems to be an important factor in your case.&nbsp;
 You should be aware that Access does not have strong security functionality, so you might wish to consider using Access as a front end to an SQL Server or similar back end.<br />
<br />
While Access could almost certainly provide you with a superior solution to your current use of Excel, the fact that you are having to ask these questions does suggest that your relational database development skills are of a relatively low level for a task
 of this nature.&nbsp; Consequently, your company should perhaps give consideration as to whether the hiring of competent professional help would be the sensible business decision.<br />

I have no formal training, but have the responsibility for this in any case. My comment about updating the tables was inaccurate/incomplete - "update" was the wrong term for me to use here. The problem is that the master user wants to run a new Make Table query
 for each weekly update, then replace the entire table in the secondary database with the new table which is why it can't be done while other users are using the secondary database. The reason behind this request is to assure that the original data is not changed
 and why Company security will not allow a direct link to the master.
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Your input about linking and appending as well as the mention below about a front end database made me think and have given me some ideas for a workaround. I think I will "split" the secondary database and have the master user append new data to the back
 end which should make the front end less cumbersome. The master user will still have to schedule downtime if they really insist on periodically replacing the entire table in the back end.</p>
<p>Thank you for the UNC comment, that solved my mapping problem.<br />

</p><blockquote>In addition to the points Scott has made, you need to appreciate that Access per se is a development environment.&nbsp; The application used by the users is developed in Access, so the 'user friendliness' of the application is a
 matter for the developer, which I assume is you.&nbsp; This includes the design of the logical model, represented by the tables and the relationships between them, and the design of the interface through which the users will interface with the data by means of
 forms, reports and the underlying queries in which the base data is managed so as to be presented to the user in a manner appropriate to the requirements of the business.&nbsp; It also includes the management of the security of the database, which seems to be an
 important factor in your case.&nbsp; You should be aware that Access does not have strong security functionality, so you might wish to consider using Access as a front end to an SQL Server or similar back end.<br />
<br />
While Access could almost certainly provide you with a superior solution to your current use of Excel, the fact that you are having to ask these questions does suggest that your relational database development skills are of a relatively low level for a task
 of this nature.&nbsp; Consequently, your company should perhaps give consideration as to whether the hiring of competent professional help would be the sensible business decision.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>While I am not an expert, I never implied I had any trouble whatsoever with the design, queries, relationships, or interface of my solution. The tables were created in such a way as to avoid duplication among them and queries perform their functions accurately
 and efficiently in an attractive and easy to use interface - users need only click a single button. Therefore, the lecture on the description of Access and my responsibilities is not very helpful. &nbsp;My problems relate to deployment in the current environment
 which has grown beyond users in one office to many users in multiple locations as well as the growth of the data itself further compounded by security restrictions. I thought this forum was about community and conversation, not withering commentary - my mistake.</p>

<p>Yes, Access can do everything you need it to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scott and Ken have address most of your issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On #3 your "users" should not be using the Access application that comes with Office. That should only be used by the people building and maintaining the application.&nbsp; For the everyday users you should be only giving them a "front end" application they run
 that access the "back end" database.&nbsp; This article provides a good overview of the concept:</p>
<p>http://www.opengatesw.net/ms-access-tutorials/Access-Articles/MSAccess-Deployment-Best-Practices.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>An additional point that has not yet been made is that it is bad design to use the SSN as a key. You've already identified that many of your users should not have access to it.&nbsp; Instead, what you should do is create a new key field that is auto populated
 by the database each time a new employee record is created.&nbsp; You can then use that number to connect all of the associated tables along with secondary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to agree with Scott. Getting everything you need done in an application this big (large number of users, distributed user locations) and complicated (data validation, data import and export) plus integrating the required data security is apparently
 beyond your skill level. Despite what MS (and too many other programming tool companies want you to think), application programming and database design for this sort use is not a DIY project that anyone can do.&nbsp; To get the most working functionality from the
 tools you need years experience, which you don't have based on your questions.&nbsp; Yes, you could eventually make something work, but it would still be a cludge. On-The-Job Learning, BY YOURSELF ALONE, is an inefficient way to learn the tool and it is a very
 efficient way to create, or enhance, an application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should contract the job of making this application and database out to an experienced developer or company.&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing to avoid is insisting that they use the existing application as the starting point of an "enhancement". Give them the option of starting
 fresh. Quite often the DIY app is such a mess from a "best practices" point of view that it is cheaper and faster to start from scratch.&nbsp; Of course, you can should use it as a "prototype" to give them an idea of what you want.&nbsp; And of course they will have
 to import the data from the old DB into the new one as part of the cost of the project.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that you'll find that professionals will be able to suggest a lot of features and development ideas that you have not considered. New types of validation, different ways of getting the same jobs done, more efficient ways of importing and exporting
 the data etc. </p>

<p>First, I would not bother with the Make Table queries.&nbsp; Instead, I would use a datestamp in each record and then filter out any older records to protect their data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, you can create a query using a IN Clause and make the Recordset type a snapshot to prevent editing. Even better move the data to a SQL Server back end,</p>
<p>

            Believe me, I/we do understand the security issue surrounding the SSN, but with this being a very large company and so many people with the exact same name in the database going back to the mid-1990s that without the SSN there is no way to tell one from
 another. We attend two industry summits each year where this topic is discussed and each time there is no solution.

<p>I disagree, the solution is simple. Add an autonumber field to your table. Then add corresponding fields to the child tables and update them based on a SSN match. Once that is done, you remove the SSN from the child tables.</p>

<p>OK, you have considered the issue (at length) and concluded that you need to use the SSN to uniquely identify individuals with the same/similar names.&nbsp; I understand that, and it is fine (reasonable).&nbsp; That is an issue on the user side, that only requires
 the SSN DATA to be stored in one place, in the "customer" (or whatever you call it) table/record. You do NOT need to carry the SSN over to other subsidiary tables for use to join them. Actually it is one of the "Normalization" rules that you do not duplicate
 it because it is not DATA. This is a database design issue that you do not recognize, but that someone trained in database design and normalization would. One of the advantages of hiring a professional&nbsp; company to help you with the design and building of your
 application. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And although I didn't say it before, once the application has been professionally designed and built, there is no reason you couldn't take over the maintenance of it. You could use the project to build it as a learning opportunity. A chance to be a PITA,
 asking "why this ... "and "how come you did that ... " and "why not do it this way ..."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that a professional design could/would give you include a consistent naming standard for data fields and tables.&nbsp; The first (and I have to say best managed from an IT development POV) company I worked for used a naming standard called the "IBM OF"
 language. It was based on a standard dictionary of 3 letter abbreviations (with a few 2 letter exceptions) of standard words used to name data fields and a short (less than 1 page) list of 1 character data type codes. As well it used a standard syntax to piece
 together the abbreviations.&nbsp; After about a year any programmer could read any field code name and translate it on the fly, and get it right most of the time.&nbsp; The advantage of this approach is that every time you saw CUSN, customer number, you knew exactly
 what to expect and how it was used to join the various customer related tables. The same with SO (one of those local exceptions). It was the Service Order Number given to the customer and service rep to uniquely identify each order.&nbsp; It takes discipline to
 implement in the first place, and discipline to continue use consistently, but the benefits are huge. There is no guessing, is the data in the "customer" field in this table supposed to be the same as the "customer name" in different table.&nbsp; The answer was
 simple, a "customer" really is something different from a "Customer Name", so go back and figure out what the difference is.

            <p>You're right..............Internet Explorer 11 is an integral part of the Windows 8.1 operating system and cannot be replaced with an earlier Internet Explorer version (e.g. IE10).&nbsp; If you have a website that will only work on IE 10, there are only two things
 you can do........</p>
<p>
</p><p>o&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Add the website to the Compatibility View Listing.</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Internet Explorer on the Desktop<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the website address into the box, and click "Add"<br />

<h2>            uninstalling AVG&#47;VAF toolbar</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to uninstall an AVG Safe Guard toolbar, which is also known as VAF music toolbar.&nbsp; Normal uninstalling doesn't work.&nbsp; I had my internet provider try, but that failed also.&nbsp; Another thing I have to learn how to do is get rid of "left overs"
 from OtShot.&nbsp; When powering up, I get messages about "not being able to load OtShot skin"???&nbsp; I click NO...then another message appears asking if I want to send all my messages through Outlook (part of OtShot)..I click CANCEL.&nbsp; Any sugestions????</p>

<h2>            Windows Image Backup with Microsoft Security Essentials active on a computer with KNOWN false positives fails.</h2>
                    <p>Scenario: windows 7 machine (x32/x64 doesn't really matter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say a company machine with proprietary files with macros etc (all this kind of stuff that makes antivirus software crazy)</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSE sees these files as malware/virus, so I have excluded them from their original location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initiate a manual Windows Image Backup (on a remote network drive, but that doesn't really matter in this scenario)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, the backup fails because the Volume Shadow Copy of the (already excluded) "infected" known false positives is flagged by MSE again</p>
<p>as malware and blocks the Windows Image Backup process from continuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Workaround so far: disable MSE (not really a very nice option).</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>It's a known issue that Windows backup will not continue if it finds malware during the backup. I suggest you use a different backup software or you can disable MSE during the backup or have MSE do a scan and clean them before the backup.<br />

<h2>            Groove Music offline access, impossible to listen MY musics</h2>
                    <p>I have a lot of music stored on OneDrive (about 40gb), and it works fine with the app Groove Music, until I try the Groove Music Pass. I bought that songs on iTunes, or get via CD. It is legal content, but not from Groove Music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I use Groove Music Pass I need to be logged in to access my music, even when I don't have internet connection. I understand that Groove Music needs to confirm my id to listen the musics that I download from GMPass, but what about my iTunes collection?
 If I'm offline, I can't listen it on my PC. But&nbsp;this does not happen on mobile. I can download from Groove Music my music stored on Onedrive, and still listen even when I'm offline.&nbsp;</p>

            did you check in Groove "settings/choose where we look for music" and see if the location you are storing your music in is listed? This is similar to Windows Media Player, Zune Software, MediaMonkey, etc.---you have to tell the player where you are storing
 your music (it usually only has the default saving spot when you first use it).

            This is the &nbsp;issue I am upset with as well. I spend a Lot of time with my music where I DON'T have Internet access. Now I can't listen to my music. That was the reason I have LOVED &nbsp;my ZUNE. Microsoft didn't think this through very well. &nbsp;My phone doesn't
 play my music like my Zune did...not good quality. Very very dissatisfied. I have been a loyal zune pass customer for YEARS. the fact that they want to move to groove is fine, but make it supported on the zune.&nbsp;

            It isn't suppose to do this by design. It's suppose to work the same as Zune does as long as the song is local. I'm offline quite a bit. You guys are&nbsp;all using it on Windows 10 desktop?

                    <p>I have an HP Probook 4530s with the above scanner, it is in device manager and running and enabled, but for the life of me I can not find away to use it or setup my fingers to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not believe that this does not work, since windows 10 was said to work with everything OOTB and everything work with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using 10 now since the second preview release and it still does not work.</p>

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can understand that your biometric sensor is not working in your HP Probook model. I'll certainly help you find and troubleshoot the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>If the utility was working with the previous versions of Windows, it is expected to run normally with Windows Insider Preview as well. In fact, Windows 10 RTM is expected to release with some features facilitating validity sensors enabled with the hardware.
 The issue might arise if the corresponding hardware is not compatible or has got corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</span></span>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter:

a. Press “Windows key + W”.<br />

d. Select “Hardware and Devices” under Devices option.<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>

            <p>Hi, I have downloaded the VSF471 driver from above provided link (V.4.4.234.0) and installed manually by selecting driver in the driver pre installed directory "WBF_003c_DRV". Driver worked and my login setting showed the Hello Finger Print. I had enrolled
 my finger prints. Then I had locked my computer to check the finger print login validity, it worked correctly. In the mean while after 10 minutes system restarted and every thing goes black for 5 minutes then in the login screen a message appeared your finger
 validity sensor is not working properly I login and uninstalled the driver to off this message. Its my story, Now is there any way or solution to get rid from this problem.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>same problem here. I've installed the driver "WBF_003c_DRV" and the software provided in the package sp58900 "Validity WBF DDK", windows hello works correctly and I can set up the fingerprint sign-in option. If I put my laptop in standby mode I can use finger
 print access on wake up. The problem is that if I restart the laptop the finger print reader is not working, I've to use password or PIN. Once I log in I'm able to use fingerprint again on wake up after standby.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like something is not loaded when the laptop starts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please give us a solution!</p>

            <div>
<p>It (almost) works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how I did it after a lot of attempts. Please note that I cannot be sure it will work for you because during all the attempts I could have done some key passage without knowing it. Anyway, I could say that drivers in packages sp58000 and the newer
 sp66915 doesn't work in my laptop (Elitebook 8560w with VFS471 sensor). So I found a previous version of the driver and of the software WBF DDK. Below all the passages:</p>
<div>
<p>1) carefully unistall everything related with validity and biometric: go to control panel and from "uninstall a program" uninstall Validity WBF DDK or other validity software<br />
2) in device manager uninstall the biometric driver (checking the box "delete the driver software for this device") if you have one<br />
3) download the package sp56957 from <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp56501-57000/sp56957.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a><br />
4) extract the package and run "WBFDDKSetup.exe" (located in c:/swsetup/sp56957/) and install WBF DDK (version 4.3.304.0) &nbsp;<br />
5) go in device manager, identify the biometric sensor between the unknown devices (if you have more than one, right click on it, properties and go in the details tab and look for something like WBFPID=003c) and manually install the driver (version 4.3.304.0)
 picking it from the folder c:/swsetup/sp56957/<br />
6) always in device manager go on the device installed, right click on it, properties, go in the power managment tab and uncheck the box "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" (this passage was needed because the fingerprint reader didn't
 work after standby or WINKEY+L) <br />
8) go on log-in settings and setup windows hello with your fingerprints, if it doesn't show, try to restart the laptop<br />
7) Restart the laptop and try if it works</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>For me&nbsp;it worked, I say "almost" because when I leave the laptop in standby for a lot of time, like the entire night, it doesn't work on wake up...but I don't know why...</div>

<p>Hi Frans,</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm whether you have been able to update the credit card information using the new one. If yes, please check on the next due date to see if the new card is charged.</p>
<p>If the card is not charged properly, please don’t hesitate to post back. I can submit a request to check the details for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

                    I recently have been having issues with my minecraft and technic launcher. When I try to sign in it tells me that I entered invalid credentials. I think this is because of windows ten. My friends have been having the same issue on their windows ten laptop,

<h3> calmstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search Error - Outlook Indexing is Incomplete</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded just my Outlook. I have Office 2003 installed, and upgraded my Outlook to 2007. After upgrade, I found that I could not do a search in my emails. An error message would come up that says, "Outlook is currently indexing your items. Search
 results may be incomplete because items are still being indexed. 21519 items remaining in "pesonal folders". 46697 items remaining across all open mailboxes.</p>
<p>It has now been six days since I upgraded. I used the help feature, thinking that if I work or rework the indexing it might help, but it indicated that I just needed to allow it time to index. And it indicated my 'computer needed to be idle to do so'.&nbsp; So,
 I have left it idle for two nights now, hoping it would finish indexing, but it has not. Also, these numbers that it says still have to be indexed...are obviously including my Archived folders as well. I do not have over 50,000 open items in my email, unless
 it includes my archived items.</p>
<p>So the search feature is still malfunctioning.....And I'm at a loss for what to do. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the following questions so that we can help you.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Are you using a Local account or Microsoft account?</li><li>Are you not able to boot to normal mode?</li></ol>
<p>
<span>I suggest you to perform a System Restore and check if the sleep option appears back, you may refer to the article below and refer the section “<strong>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</strong>”:</span></p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change
 your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers and also reset the recently changed settings on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            If you have really deleted the dictionary (one or more of the *.LEX files located in the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Proof folder), then running a repair of the installation will put it back. To do that, go to the Programs &amp; Features dialog
 of the Windows Control Panel, choose Office 2010, and click Change, then choose the repair option.<br />
<br />
However, it isn't very likely that the file is really deleted. More likely, you've changed some setting in Word that disabled the spelling and grammar checker. Work through the steps in
<a href="http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/MasterSpellCheck.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/MasterSpellCheck.htm</a> to make sure you have everything set properly.<br />

    <title>How to Sync all Outlook 2007 accounts &#40;&#34;Personal&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Sync all Outlook 2007 accounts &#40;&#34;Personal&#34; folders&#41; with Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I use&nbsp;Outlook 2007 to manage my emails, contacts and calendar information.&nbsp; I have a internet provider email account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), a POP account but I do not give it out.&nbsp; Instead I use&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;as
 my primary address and all Yahoo emails get fowarded to my 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therfore, I manage everything under&nbsp;one account&nbsp;labeled as&nbsp;"Personal" folder and this is where&nbsp;all my&nbsp;email, calendar and contact data is.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to change my&nbsp;primary email address
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** but I do want to syncronize with Outlook.com.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed Outlook.com and added it to my Outlook 2007; I named the folder Outlookdotcom.</p>
<p>So now I have two separate "Personal" folders or are they called email accounts;&nbsp; namely; Personal and Outlookdotcom
</p>
<p>The information in the Outlookdotcom folder syncs with Outlook.com but how do I integrate the data in the Personal folder with the data in&nbsp;Outlookdotcom folder so it all gets syncronized with Outlook.com?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More specifically, how do I move or convert or sync&nbsp;the two Outlook 2007 acccounts/folders so everything is managed in one folder and gets syncrozined with Outlook.com?&nbsp; I will want to&nbsp;continue to use Outlook 2007 to:</p>
<p>1) receive and send emails&nbsp; via 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) manage my contacts&nbsp;and calendar under&nbsp;one Outlook 2007 account/folder</p>
<p>3) keep everything in sync with Outlook.com (including email folders, calendars and contacts)</p>
<p>Note, I do not want to&nbsp;change my&nbsp;primary email address, I want&nbsp;everyone to continue to communciate with me via&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Put another way, keep the
myname@outlook,com emaill address&nbsp;transparant to the people I send/receive emails from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions are most welcome</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
