<h2>            Showing Multiple Remote Screens on Separate Monitors</h2>
                    <p>Good morning. I recently had a colleague share their screens over Skype. He had two screens on his end and shared them both. So this is a two part question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there a way to "zoom in"? The letters on his screen were so small I had to open the file we were discussing on my own computer to see what he was talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)Is there a way to show each of his screens on my two separate monitors?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e5e7f961-8e79-4639-9daa-39433b1cb1af" title="Shrove">
<p>
</p><p>Here are&nbsp;my answers for your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You do not have the option to zoom in a screen that is being shared to you in Skype. Ask the other end to enlarge the font size of the app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For classic: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA338/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA338/">
<p>For new Skype: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34825/">
<p>
</p><p>2. This feature is not yet available on Skype. I will take this as a feedback and let our developers know about this.</p>

            Thank you for your reply. It would be a really cool feature to be able to expand the Skype window to match the physical monitor setup, assuming you have enough screens to accommodate the remote user and how many screens they have.

</p><p>Exactly, that really&nbsp;makes sense. I have noted it and added to the list of the suggestions from other Skype users. It will be forward to our developers to review and consider it to the future Skype updates.</p>

<h2>            Skype Preview for iOS has just lost its iPad layout &#40;version 8.18.10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using the beta version of the Skype for iPhone app on my iPad. It used to have a tablet layout, which looked really similar to Skype v8 on the desktop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the iPad layout is gone in the version 8.18.10, which was released today for beta testers. Now, the app just looks like a blown-up iPhone app, and I won't use it anymore.</p>
<p>Could someone in the Skype team explain the reason for this removal? Also, when will the regular Skype for iPad app will be updated to v8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>Technically, the Skype for iPhone is not designed for iPad. That is the reason why it has a different lay out. Also, there is still no update on when the new Skype will be available&nbsp;on iPad. Rest assured it will be posted once there is already a release
 about the new Skype's availability on iPad. Keep an eye on our <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34770/release-notes-for-skype-on-mobile?q=release+notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thanks, but you didn’t really answer my question. Like I said, the iPad layout has been present for months, now it’s gone in the latest preview build... I just wanted know why it has been removed, it used to work perfectly 🤔

            I just received an invitation to Skype for iPad beta testing today, so it is no longer necessary for Skype Preview for iPhone to support for iPad.

            Yeah I got the invite too. Pretty much all of Microsoft apps for iOS are universal for iPhone/iPad, so not sure why Skype needs two separate apps 🤔

<h2>            USB Device Not Recognized - Virus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, recently, a friend was having problems with his mouse. His cursor was not responding and every time he plugged it in, he would get the error message "USB Device is not recognized". After attempting to help him fix the problem, I noticed a lot of people
 were having this problem and had solutions such as: 'Unplug the computer', 'Reinstall drivers' and several others. Unfortunately, none of these solutions worked on my friend's computer, and so, to decide whether the problem was his computer or mouse, I plugged
 in my own mouse. My mouse showed the same error, so I figured it was his computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now, I plugged my mouse into my computer and got the error "USB Device is not recognized". I tried all the solutions people were having on the internet, again, and still no fix. It confused me because this mouse had worked with this computer for six
 months with no issues. This made me wonder if my friend's computer had a virus, which traveled through his computer to mine, through the mouse. I contacted online tech support here on Microsoft, and they told me my mouse was broken and I would have to buy
 another. Well, I have plugged in two other mice into my computer and they worked for two minutes, but then had the same issue! This, altogether is beginning to make me believe there is a virus that travels through USB mice and kills them.</p>
<p>I am extremely confused and upset because my mouse cost around $80 and no USB computer mice seem to work with my computer any more. I have scanned my computer with Panda Antivirus, but nothing was detected and my computer shows no signs of being slower than
 normal. If it helps, my computer is running Windows 10, the mouse is a Mionix Castor Optical Mouse and my motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-970A-D3P. I am completely open to suggestions but am not willing to buy a new mouse quite yet.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reinstalled the drivers exactly as you described, going through Device Manager. I aslo tried reinstalling the drivers for the mouse from the website. As for make and model, this is a personally built computer. I have tried plugging the mouse into every
 USB port, including the front ones.</p>
<p>I had high hopes for method 1, as I had never tried that or seen this solution while searching the web. But after trying it, I got the message 'Problem detected with Unknown USB Device'.</p>
<p>As for method 2, I assumed you wanted me to 'search automatically for updated driver software', so after clicking that I was told the current driver is up to date.</p>
<p>I would like your honest opinion; is this mouse dead, or do you think it's fixable?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Backup and Restore Error 0x8078012D - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gonzo757  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Backup and Restore Error 0x8078012D</h2>
                    
<p>Just bought a Western Digital - WD Elements 2TB External USB 2.0 Hard Drive, using a Sony - VAIO Laptop i7 (Model:&nbsp;VPCF126FM/B). Every time I attempt to run Windows Backup it fails around 60%, and gives me the&nbsp;error code, 0x8078012D. I've checked the external
 hard-drive with chkdsk c:/f/r, but no problems were discovered. I also have tried disabling Norton 360, still got the error, and I've tried reseting volume shadow copy, as well as windows backup.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>Dave,<br />
<br />
I was a bit confused by the article ID:886549 to fix the&nbsp;1606 -ERROR.&nbsp; I found the Vista list of changes for the first HKEY_CURRENT_USER and made those changes in my Vista Home Premium software registry but the second list concerning HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&nbsp; there
 was no specified change specific to Windows Vista.&nbsp; When I went into the 2nd area specified, all the strings were totally different from what my machine was showing.&nbsp; Are those changes for use with both XP and VISTA or was a mistake made?&nbsp; I don't want to
 change them until I am certain.<br />
<br />
Please reply as soon as possible because I have completed the first group of changes and now I am stuck!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi Hangels777,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
As I never test the change myself, I can't promise you anything.&nbsp; However, the article seem correct.&nbsp; I think the second steps is the same for both XP and Vista.&nbsp; To prevent damage, backup your registry before make the change so you can load it back in case
 it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Manual steps to back up the registry in Windows Vista or in Windows XP
Windows Vista
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <span>
systempropertiesprotection</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<div>
<div>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</div>
</li><li>Wait for Windows to search for available disks and most recent restore points. In the
<strong>System Properties</strong> dialog box, on the <strong>
System Protection</strong> tab, click <strong>Create</strong>, </li><li>Type a name for the restore point and then click <strong>Create</strong>.
</li><li>After the restore point has been created successfully, click <strong>
OK</strong> two times. </li></ol>
<strong>Note</strong> If System Restore is turned off, click to select the local disk, click
<strong>Apply</strong> and then click Create.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have to take into consideration different factors why Microsoft Sudoku is not working properly on your Windows 10 device. To gain a better grasp of your case, we need the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to launch the game successfully?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages upon trying to access the game?</li><li>Is this issue happening to other games as well?</li><li>Have you made any changes on your device prior to this concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend running the troubleshooter for Windows apps that can help resolve issues with an app from the Xbox Store. Refer to this

link</a> and follow the prompts on your screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, ensure to check for updates for apps and games from Windows Store. All the steps are provided

<p>There seems to be a recurring problem with the ADS on Microsoft's Sudoku game.&nbsp; The game either quits or freezes until the ad is over.&nbsp; It is a pain in the butt.&nbsp; I guess that whoever is in charge of the programming of this game gets it patched, and then
 the programmer who fixed it is promoted.&nbsp; A lower jerk on the totem pole now gets to fart around with the code and manages to screw it up again.&nbsp; This is called the<em> Peter Principle</em>.&nbsp; I firmly believe that these MFs are wanting you to
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased the Solitaire game and the Bingo game.&nbsp; They appear to work fine.&nbsp; Bottom line:&nbsp; It's the ADs in the Sudoku game that are contributing to the problem.</p>

<p>I played the game successfully through January 20, 2018.&nbsp; I didn't try to open it on January 21st.&nbsp; Last night (January 22nd), I began getting the message "A connection to Xbox could not be established."<br />
<br />
I've reset the app. No change in status.</p>
<p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app.&nbsp; No change is status.</p>
<p>I've reset cache for the Windows Store app.&nbsp; No change in status.</p>
<p>I can access my Xbox profile from Microsoft Solitaire.&nbsp; From that location, I clicked on "my games" and selected Microsoft Sudoku.&nbsp; I clicked "play" and, even though I launched the app from Xbox, I still get the same error message.</p>
<p>Xbox live status suggests that everything is working fine.</p>
<p>There are no error messages logged in Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, I've tried intelligent thing I can think of to no avail.&nbsp; I can login to 4 other Xbox games for Windows.&nbsp; Just not Sudoku.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game alerts me that I can play without connecting to Xbox but that forces me to start all over for this month which seems like a wrong way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi leeflea_734,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. Refer the information provided with regards to Network Access protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Built into Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7, NAP evaluates and responds to the security state of any computer or device attempting to connect to your network. It works with a host of Microsoft products such as
<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/India/productssolutions/40029561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Forefront Client Security</a> and <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/India/productssolutions/40037273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft System Center</a>. It also integrates with third-party networking and security products - offering you more opportunities to provide services to your customers and build revenue. NAP enables customised endpoint security policies to validate computer
 health before allowing network access or communication. The platform automatically updates compliant computers to ensure ongoing health. And you can set it to quarantine questionable computers to a restricted network until they become compliant.</div>
<div>NAP complements gateway security - which typically includes malware protection, intrusion detection and content filtering - to provide comprehensive network access control capabilities.

<h2>            I cannot right click on Computer&#124;Manage &#38; get it to work.</h2>
                    When I right click on Computer and select Manage I get an error message every time.<br />
<br />

Windows cannot find 'C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools\Computer Management.lnk'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.<br />
<br />
[OK]<br />
<br />
I have completely formatted the HDD and reinstalled W7 Ultimate SP1 and I am still getting the error message. I have done a Search looking for every item in the above message to no avail. As far as I can tell Computer|Manage does not exist on my computer. When
 I do a search for Administrative Tools the onlt thing that shows is Print Management. Can someone help please? I have, from Dell, the following disks (all of them have been installed): Operating System (Windows Reinstallation Ultimate 64-bit), Drivers and
 Utilities, Application, Drivers and Utilities. Can you tell me what is missing? I would like to change drive letters on my CD/DVD drives.<br />

<h2>            HP Laserjet Pro CM1415fnw color MFP can no longer scan</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Laserjet Pro CM1415fnw color MFP printer that is a wireless multifunction printer. It scans, prints etc. The printing still works but the scanning does not. I downloaded the latest drivers from HP but that leads to more problems. For one. I cannot
 uninstall the HP software, which is what they recommend. When you try to uninstall it says you have to wait for the process to finish. Then it throws up an error. The new software install doesnt seem to do anything. Didn't have this problem until upgrading
 to Windows 10. Worked perfect before using Windows 7.</p>

    <title>Media Foundation does not work with capture cards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parvez_ahmed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Foundation does not work with capture cards</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Media Foundation to enumerate and capture from camera devices. It throws up an error when I try to select a capture card device . Same behavior is seen on the application that builds out of Microsoft's sample code of media foundation. Error code
 received is&nbsp; <strong>0xc00d36b4 </strong>or <strong>0xc00d3704</strong>.</p>
<p>This however works fine on a direct show based app. <br />
</p>
<p>Does media foundation not support capture cards like Magewell, Osprey, BlackMagic intensity etc ? If yes, then when is this support expected to come ?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
Parvez

<h2>            Webcam is being used by another application</h2>
                    <p>I think I already know the answer to this question, however, I do not know the solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 laptop and have not been able to use Skype because the camera feature is either missing or blanked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Camera Permissions to allow Skype, I noticed the icon is a different color configuation as the one I just installed.&nbsp; A-HA!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the latest verison I just installed 12. something is NOT the same version that is on the page where I set permissions for my camera, therefore, I'm guessing that the computer thinks that the other version is already running and I need to change the permission
 to the updated version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, I have no idea on how to do that!&nbsp; Tried looking it up to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas whether this is an appropriate fix and if so, how to do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>I'm not the worst, I'd consider myself an Average player. Halo Reach is such an easy game to be good at, really, if you don't have a K/D above 1, I'd hate to see how bad you are at Halo 3.</p>

Actually:</p>
<p>My K/D is so low in Halo 3. A .80 in Ranked? A .97 in SOCIAL? Thank god Halo:Reach is such a Easy game where almost anyone can be good

<p>or you can understand people play games for fun, and losing to a janky buttmunch like you makes people NOT have fun, so they quit. it's a tough concept but follow me here: K/D does not mean anything except how much you jerk it to the BR. tell me, when was

<p>In Rumble Pit, you don't have a team, everybody scrambles for 1st place!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's people like the OP that enrage me and cause me to avoid team based games. They sit somewhere and camp and spawn kill so they can get a major boost in their K/D ratio. There is nothing fun about getting my brains blown out every 5 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I play Rumble Pit, I have fun because I know my team won't abandon me and I won't have to quit the game because of spawn killing and have to worry about how many games I quit before I get another probation!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been put on probation once! I DON'T want to go through that BS again!</p>

<p>You're the one that is bad at the game. It's sad that you and your friends have to rely on a cheap tactic to win a round. NOBODY should have Unfrigginbelievable! NOBODY! If anybody has this medal, they most likely obtained it by, like you, OP have stated,
 by spawn killing the opposing team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have obtained it legitimately, then please, do post the Youtube video of you getting 40 kills. Spawn camping doesn't count because it's a cheap tactic!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have killed 10 people in a row once! I have killed 5 people in a row 23 times! I have never achieved a killstreak higher than 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hate the energy sword and the rocket launcher as well! I will be honest, I have killed over 76 people with the energy sword and 8 people with the rocket launcher when I first received the game from Gamefly. I don't use those two weapons anymore. Why? They're
 cheap!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what some of you are going to say, "why do you still use the Needler?" Well, the Needler is NOT a one-hit kill weapon!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See what I'm getting at? Cheap tactics! Whether it's spawn killing, camping, using rocket launchers, energy swords, etc. They're cheap tactics. Do you know what's fun? Going out and hunting your enemies with a MA37 ICWS Assault Rifle in your hands.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sudoku won&#39;t run windowed.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Pro on a Surface Pro 3 and Windows 10 Home on my desktop computer. When I play Microsoft Sudoku on the Surface Pro 3, I can resize the game or choose to make it full screen. The top right corner of the title bar has an exit button, maximize
 button, minimize button, and full screen button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I want to play on my desktop PC while I'm watching Netflix or something, so I don't want Sudoku to take up the whole screen. However, on my desktop there is no option to make the app windowed. The "full screen" icon does not exist at the top right
 of the title bar - only minimize and exit. I can't seem to figure out why the two are not behaving the same way. Other Universal apps give me the choice between full-screen and windowed, such as solitaire. I am not using tablet mode on either device. The Surface
 Pro 3's resolution&nbsp;is 2160x1440 and my desktop's resolution is 1920x1080. Both instances of the Sudoku app are up to date, and so are both PCs. I'm baffled.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first step in getting the issue fixed is to re-install Microsoft Sudoku and then check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the

</strong>This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</p>

            I ran the troubleshooter, it found no problems. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but there's no change. It doesn't seem to be a problem with the app, it seems like it was designed that way, but I don't know what's triggering it to display
 the full-screen button on my laptop and not on my desktop. It's the best Sudoku game in the Windows store, but it's not really worth playing if that's the only thing I can have on my screen at a time.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Understanding Product Activation in Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p>In previous Windows releases, when you installed an upgrade version of Windows, if you wanted to reinstall the upgrade version, you had to first reinstall the qualifying version from which you upgraded, reactivate it, then upgrade again and reactivate again.</p>
<p><br />
With Windows 10, this is no longer the case. Once you have upgraded to Windows 10 and activate, you can simply create a bootable copy on DVD or USB and reinstall just Windows 10 without the need to reinstall the qualifying version and it will reactivate automatically.</p>
<p><br />
Quote:</p>
<p>"Windows 10 handles keys differently. When you upgrade to Windows 10 via Windows Update from Windows 8.1 or Windows 7, the process&nbsp;registers your computers hardware, and qualifying OS with a Microsoft Product Activation Server. The device is then considered
 a Windows 10 device.</p>

            <p>This is not helpfull at all!<br />
<br />
I've been using Windows 10 Pro (upgraded from Windows 7 Pro) for a few weeks, and I've been playing around with some defenitions and installing some things just to make shure everything i want works (or not) correctly with W10Pro...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my thinkering, i've created a bootable USB drive with Windows Media Creation Tool (on another PC), disconected my storage HDDs from the SATA ports, leaving just my SSD to clean up and re-installed Windows 10 Pro... just to find out I cant activate
 it and it keeps asking for a product key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>this process is deeply flawed, how can a true Pro like me have any trust in a system that doesn't work as advertised? digital entitlement doesnt mean sqat if it does not give me a key so i can have something to grasp when everything else fail!</p>

<p>Il punto è che metto un gioco e mi dice "impossibile avviare il gioco, reinstallalo di nuovo" cose c'è da installare se ho il DVD? io ho un HDD interno comprato a parte da 320GB e mi è stato detto che mi mancano i file dell'emulatore.</p>
<p>Allora io vi chiedo come posso fare per giocare a questi giochi? meglio ancora come faccio ad installargli l'emulatore e cose simili pur di giocare? Grazie a tutti in anticipo.</p>

<p>mmm scusami Rino..non comprendo una cosa.. te hai una 360 Slim sulla quale hai installato un HDD giusto? (intendo l'HDD per Xbox 360 da mettere dentro la tua Slim).</p>
<p>Prova a fare così: trasferisci tutti i dati che hai nella memory card da 4 GB dentro l'HDD (compreso il tuo profilo). Spegni la console e scollega la memory card e accendi la console SENZA la memory card (utilizzando quindi l'HDD). Ora prova ad inserire
 un vecchio gioco della prima Xbox e fallo partire e guarda se ti scarica l'emulatore correttamente.</p>
<p>Ricordati che</p>
<p>1) per giocare a quei giochi devi avere la console connessa ad internet e al live (in modo tale che possa scaricare e lanciare l'emulatore)</p>
<p>2) NON tutti i giochi XBox 1 girano su 360..o meglio, microsoft non ha rilasciato un emulatore per OGNI gioco per XBOX 1 ma solo per alcuni titoli (molti titoli, ma non tutti) quindi può darsi che tu stia facendo girare un gioco per il quale microsoft non
 rilasciò l'emulatore. Ricordo che, all'epoca, vi era una pagina sul sito di supporto microsoft che tracciava la lista dei titoli che funzionavano sotto 360.</p>
<p>Spero di esserti stato utile</p>

<p>Ragazzi vi ringrazio per i vostri suggerimenti però quello che voglio dirvi è come faccio a disabilitare la flash memory della mia xbox 360 slim? non è possibile perché i 4GB sono interni alla consolle e non posso in alcun modo escluderli.</p>
<p>Vorrei sapere come posso installare l'emulatore perché i giochi che ho io sono tutti compatibili.</p>
