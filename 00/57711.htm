<h2>            Unable to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7 preceding error is the free space validation.</h2>
                    <p>Have been trying to upgrade for the past 4 days and the closest I have come is by running the media creation tool and creating an DVD and attempting to upgrade using this method.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is did not work either, this fails in the checking your system phase returning 'Something Happened. Sorry we are having trouble &nbsp;determining if your PC can run Windows 10. Please close Setup and try again'.</p>
<p>Upon viewing the log (setuperr.txt) the error that is in the beginning is the frees space validation error. The following is the contents of said log:</p>

<p>
</p><p>What i am observing is that the installation is checking this partition \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1\. &nbsp;The following are the DISKPART details of this partition:</p>
<p>Partition 1<br />
Type &nbsp;: 07<br />
Hidden: No<br />
Active: Yes<br />
Offset in Bytes: 1048576<br />
There is no volume associated with this partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This partition is view able only through DISKPART and &nbsp;DiskManagement. Apparently this is a hidden system partition that contains the bootloader. I am sure of this since I deleted it resulting in Partition 2 (the one containing OS) only listed, Win 10 install
 still failed, this time claiming that no system disk was identified. I rebooted and Windows 7 would not start up. I had to recreate the partion, format it, activate it, rebuild BCD (through BOOTREC /rebuildbcd) and perform a Startup Repair to fix BOOTMGR,
 in order to be able to start up again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the setup program only check Partition 1? Is this the reason why my upgrade is failing? Since if this is the case and there is no work around I do not know if I will be able to upgrade. Has anybody else come across this issue and found some workaround?</p>

<p>Hi AnthonyJose</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply I have read the links you suggested, the closest to my case was on page 7 of &nbsp;the Bennet Article thread, where I also communicated with tdug who had a quite similar issue but which was not exactly as mine. From this I am deducing that
 as the error states '<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ConX::Compatibility::CSystemAbstraction::GetDiskFreeSpaceW: Failed to retrieve disk space info for [\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1\].[gle=0x00000003]'
 my issue is that upgrade setup program checks Partion 1 of Disk 0 for the OS, in order to verify disk space. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In my case this is a 'hidden' partition, this the installation program is unable to get the size, and moreover Windows is not on this partition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So in my case is due to '</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Failed to determine the free disk space on the system partition.', since Windows
 is not on the partition that the setup program is checking.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Has anyone come&nbsp;across&nbsp;this issue? How can I solve it? Will Microsoft come up with a fix to this?</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi. Thank you for raising your concern. Is it the outlook app from the Microsoft Office? There are many possible reasons why you are encountering that kind of issue. If its the outlook from The Microsoft Office, most likely the reasons are the following:
 no internet connection, incorrect username or password, needs to activate the office subscription.</p>
<p>You may also try to perform a clean boot to your computer. Please refer to this link:</p>

<h2>            Making  Xbox Live a Safer Place</h2>
                    <p>What we&nbsp;need to allways ask ourselves when we encounter any malicious activity on Xbox live.First and foremost allways go back to the Code of Conduct I read through it regularly.The code of conduct will allways help you spot any report worthy activity.So before hitting that report button, make sure that you have evaluated the situation completely.This method will hopefully help others make sharp decisions when filing a report.Remember we do this to keep the Xbox Community safe and not for selfish purposes. Thank you and lets keep the community safe.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Win10 won&#8217;t boot after installing new ram, can&#8217;t boot into recovery tools.</h2>
                    <p>I installed 8gb (2x4gb Corsair Vengeance LPX ddr4 3000Mhz) on top of the 8gb already in my Ryzen 5 1600 system (ASUS ROG Strix B350F-Gaming motherboard)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. The ram is compatible, and not defective</p>
<p>2. my motherboard supports up to 64gb of ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 10 boots just fine with the 8gb but as soon as I install the rest, it gives me an error code 0xc0000221 and shows me a different file every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my options are enter to try again, f1 to enter recovery environment (which just reboots me to the same screen), f8 for startup settings, and esc for UEFI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using recovery tools, i have a USB recovery drive and a USB windows installation drive. both of which show the same “your pc/device needs to be repaired” BSOD upon attempt to boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>when trying to boot into the OS, i press f8 and it does nothing, it is supposed to open the windows recovery environment, but it does not. Since i cannot get the recovery environment open, i cannot use the troubleshoot feature in there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>since my recovery drive and installation media wont boot, i cannot use the recovery tools there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>how am i supposed to get my PC to boot with this new ram?</p>

            If you try just one of the new 4GB modules and it works you could have the same issue as in the following link as your motherboard has the same disclaimer (Due to the limitation of AMD Ryzen processors, memory frequencies higher than DDR4 2666 MHz are supported only when using one DIMM.)

            This did not help at all. I am running 4 DIMMs of 4GB each, and no matter the speeds (2133-2933Mhz), i get a post, all ram detected and then a windows error saying my pc/device needs to be repaired whether i try to boot into my installed OS, my USB installation
 drive, or my USB recovery drive.&nbsp;

            If the system starts fine removing the new RAM it may be an issue with the RAM itself - check "Resolving a RAM problem" in the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0xc0000221--status-image-checksum-mismatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>
<br />
<br />Also, make sure you have the latest BIOS update installed as may need a microcode update.
<br />
<br />If updating the BIOS backup any critical files beforehand as the rare chance of a failed BIOS update may result in system failure.
<br />
<br />Also, follow "Recommended memory configuration" in Section 1.1.4 System memory in the motherboard manual detailing slot placement for 4 DImms. 
<br />
<br />If issue persists consider trying one set of 2x8GB modules.

<p>I have run Windows memory diagnostic, and aida64. both told me that “hardware issues were detected”, yet the hardware is not the problem, as each stick individually works just fine, they proper pairs of dimms work fine, mismatched pairs of dimms work fine,
 all the slots on my motherboard work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc occasionally will boot with 16gb of ram after repeatedly attempting to reboot into my OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to attempt to repair my pc as well as reset it. however, both times i received an error code saying that it could not reset this pc, no changes were made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a 2x8gb kit is not an option due to the insane pricing on them, and i have found absolutely 0 similar issues on any forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my bios is updated, my pc runs just fine with either 8gb kit but as soon as i go to 12 or 16gb, it runs in to problems.&nbsp;</p>

            Sounds like a motherboard issue.
<br />
<br />Can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s): 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .evtx file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:

    <title>Lost Hard Drive Space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Hard Drive Space</h2>
                    <p>Last night before I went to bed, I had about 70-80GB of hard drive space left on my C: drive. It's an SSD, I think, with only 110GB of total space. I had to format my computer, and since then I have been taking extreme care to make sure that I do not install
 any programs onto it that can be installed elsewhere. I woke up this morning and now it's at about 60GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked every folder in my C: drive and even the hidden folders. It doesn't amount up to the space I lost, only roughly about 30GB in total, and I'd like to have help trying to find where that lost space went. I have right clicked each folder, added
 up their total space taken, including hidden ones, and as I said it does not add up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recycle bin is empty. My file history is set to only use about 3GB, but that's empty as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since lost another 15GB of space as of a few days after I originally made this post. The only thing I have put on my C: drive is just updating my drivers, and I just added up the total of every folder - including hidden folders - in the drive, and
 it's only about 27GB in total. What is happening to my computer?</p>

 &nbsp;Skype is taking advantage of it’s clients.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hello Justamerefox,</span></p>
<p><span>A webpage tried to install an ActiveX control and Internet Explorer blocked it. If you want to install the ActiveX control, click the
 Information bar, and then click Install Software. Because ActiveX controls are potentially hazardous to your computer, you should be certain that you trust the publisher of the ActiveXcontrol before you decide to install it.</span></p>
<p><span>To help protect your security, Internet Explorer has restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls that could access
 your computer. Click here for options.</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe. You should be cautious about installing ActiveX controls, sometimes called add-ons, on your computer, even if they have a valid digital signature.
 While ActiveX controls can enhance web browsing, they might also pose a security risk, and it's best to avoid using them if the webpage will work without them. However, some websites or tasks might require them, and if the content or task is important to you,
 you will have to decide whether to install the ActiveX control.</span></p>
<p><span>Before installing an ActiveX control, consider the following:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Were
 you expecting to receive this control?</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you trust the website providing the control?</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you know what the control is for and what it will do to your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer the below links:</span></p>

<p>The initial reply did not really help because:</p>
<p>1) The links were very general in nature and I was looking for detail</p>
<p>2) They focused on how to invoke Windows Media Player - I have no problem accessing and invoking it</p>
<p>3) In the 2nd link at one point it did show me how to bring up the menu list in WMP and click on HELP. That however lead to more general information about Windows 10, not WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that few hardware or software providers include detailed and thorough manuals anymore but many DO provide a link to download them. That is more what I wanted. So-called "intuitive" user interfaces do not provide this.&nbsp; My preferred method of educating
 myself about a product like WMP is to read about it and how it is organized. Clicking here &amp; there in a trial and error fashion does not provide this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Old school perhaps, but still better for me.</p>

But I know I’m entering the correct password.<span>&nbsp; </span>What should I do?</span></p>

</p><p><span>We have confirmed an issue in Windows 10 that may cause this error even when entering the correct password, if the following conditions are true:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You were running Windows 8.x, and signed in with a Microsoft account.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You then upgrade to Windows 10.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>On your first attempt to sign in, you entered an incorrect password.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>A fix was&nbsp;released&nbsp;through&nbsp;Windows Update&nbsp;in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB3081444</a>&nbsp;that will prevent additional customers from experiencing this issue, but this&nbsp;update will not resolve customers who encountered the&nbsp;issue prior to its release.&nbsp; If you encountered this issue prior to August 18th, try the following steps to resolve
 the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, confirm the correct password is getting entered with some simple checks before resorting to more extreme measures:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on the “eye” icon in the password field and view the password before hitting Enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Verify the keyboard layout wasn’t changed during the upgrade, causing you to enter unexpected characters when typing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows Key and the Spacebar at the same time to check the keyboard language and layout.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While holding the Windows Key, press the spacebar repeatedly to change the keyboard layout.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>From another device, verify that you can successfully sign into
</span><a href="http://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://account.live.com</span></span></a><span> with the same Microsoft account email and password.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Now that you’ve confirmed you’re entering the right password, if you upgraded from Windows 8.x on a Microsoft account, and you’ve never been able to sign into Windows 10, then you are likely impacted by this issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To recover, you’ll have to roll back the operating system to Windows 8.x, redo the upgrade to Windows 10, and make sure to enter the correct password on your first attempt:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Insert Windows 10 installation media and boot to the media to enter the Windows Recovery Environment.&nbsp; You can create media from another computer using the

            <p>The 7600 credits is the total amount of credits you have earned since the program started awarded credits in 2013. That total includes credits you have pending (2,000) and any credits that have already been deposited (5,600). Credits are automatically deposited into your account by the following 15th or 30th of the month after you have at least 5,000 pending or you can request a deposit once you have at least 1,000 pending. Once credits are deposited, they are added to your Microsoft account balance as currency. So you would use your account balance when you make purchases over Live to use your currency.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Microsoft points would have been deposited prior to 2013 before the point system was discontinued. Your statement on the MyRewards page will list when any deposits took place. You can also verify deposits by checking your returns at http://commerce.microsoft.com</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 restart loop after recent update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading some threads in a similar subject to mine I find myself totally lost. So I want to present my problem in detail and ask for some easy to understand and follow steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my laptop being stuck in the restart loop after recent update in Windows 10. I have this version of windows for around 5 months and have never experienced such situation. During the long update, which took me by the surprise, my computer
 screen went black. After long wait I decided to restart it. Then I found myself in never ending restart loop. I don't see any error info. nor I can access any safemode or log-in screen. I have tried to push F8, F12, every F really, as it was mentioned with
 no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am scared to use any kind of start-up repair thing as I didn't make a back-up of my data and I don't want to lose all of it. Can you help me please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS sorry for bad English</p>

<h3> manifoldpack1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I just got my XBox, so if this is a stupid question I apologize in advance :P</p>

<p>I created my profile, with my preferred gamertag "Name"</p>

<p>I then signed up for XBox live, and it changed my gamertag to "AlternateName"</p>

<p>When I try to change it back, it says that I can't use "name" gamertag, however when I try to find out if it is in use I get the following error:</p>
<div>
<div><span>"Your request could not be completed at this time.</span> <span>This gamertag is not valid."</span></div>

<div>Now I may have created this profile on a friend's XBox, but I don't think it was as an Xbox Live account.&nbsp; "Name" is quite unique so I doubt anyone else has it...</div>
</div>


<div>At any rate, is there any way that I can use this gamertag that I want?<span>&nbsp; Is it already in use?</span></div>

<div>Any help is appreciated :)<span><br />
</span></div>

<p>Sorry I wasn't as clear as I meant to be.</p>
<p>I put "name" as a generic placeholder. &nbsp;The actual gamertag I'm trying to sign up with is "EvilDH" which I use for most of my online stuff, being pretty unique I've never seen it used anywhere else.</p>
<p>But when I try to find that profile, it comes up with the error I posted above. &nbsp;Is there any reason why it wouldn't let me use if it doesn't appear to be in use?</p>

You may notice that the gamertag I showed was "Evil&lt;space&gt;DH", while the name you were after was "EvilDH" (no space). &nbsp;Xbox Live does not recognize the difference in the two, and considers them both to be the same thing.</span></p>

<h2>            How Do I FIX Windows 10 Install Error &#34;C1900101-20003&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Today I've made 3 attempts to upgrade my OS to Windows 10 (Currently 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each attempt has resulted in failure. The update will download, the install will prepare, my computer will restart after windows configures, and my monitor connected via HDMI will say there in no signal. Nothing I press during this time will do anything;
 I've also attempted unplugging and replugging the HDMI cable with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restart my computer and it recovers Windows 8.1, Windows Update then tells me the update failed Error(s) found: C1900101-20003</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem doesn't lie with the HDMI cable, it works, but it is not recieving a signal after my system reboots after failing to install Windows 10. I don't have any other video cables to test, so I need it to work with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that the Windows 10 install is lacking some video drivers? I have never encountered a problem like this with installing/updating an OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has this problem or knows how to fix it please let me know. All help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>I have the same error code when trying to upgrade from 7.1. On four occasions now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When W10 upgrade downloads and states ready to install, the computer closes down and reboots to install W10. The large circle with the %age populates in blue and it gets to 10-14% during the copying files stage where that gave 30-40% when the computer closes
 down completely with no warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The booting of the computer returns the OS to 7.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows icon in the app bar, when you right click it to go to check your update status takes you to that box that states W10 is ready to install, etc. Will it tell you that if it is not ready to install? Does Microsoft send an email to tell you that
 W10 is ready to install, or do you have to check the icon periodically?</p>

 I power back on I receive message that my previous operating system is being restored (and that works).&nbsp; Then a window appears with error C1900101-20003.&nbsp; Here is a link to the error window image:&nbsp; http://1drv.ms/1T0JuOd</p>

            <p>I had the same error code (C1900101-20003) upgrading a laptop from Windows 7 SP1</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you can save yourself a lot of time if the first time you attempt the upgrade you choose the option to create media from which to upgrade another PC - by creating the media (DVD or USB) you don't have to download the 3GB installation again for each
 new attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth checking the Windows Update history after a failure and restoration of the original OS&nbsp;to see if that offers any clues to what went wrong. Unfortunately the links to information about the above error code were pretty much worthless, but I did
 notice that my failure was related to "INSTALL_UPDATES", or something similar (sorry, I wasn't taking notes or screen shots).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at my third or fourth attempt, I disabled the option to download updates during installation - you can run Windows Update after the upgrade so although the option is "recommended" during the upgrade, it's not critical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, before starting the upgrade, I disconnected from my network and turned off Wireless, to ensure a completely off-line upgrade from the previously downloaded media on my USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One or both of those changes has done the trick and I'm reporting this from my freshly upgraded Windows 10 laptop - this was an upgrade over the top of Windows 7 so all my programs (call them "Apps" if you prefer) and files have been preserved, and so far
 all I've tried are running OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say whether I just got lucky or this is a general solution, but if like me this was one of the few threads you could find relating to this specific error code (C1900101-20003) then the above may be worth a shot for you too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            I decided to not update quite yet. When I do, perhaps a fresh install from USB will work much better. I just need a way to back up all my files first.

            <p>I found the same solution. If you are using a laptop computer then hopefully the following will be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an identical problem with a Toshiba Satellite laptop i.e. machine would power itself down during the installation phase and then my previous Windows 7 OS would be restored when the machine was powered back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading MANY different potential solutions my problem ended up simply being that the machine was overheating presumably due to the high disk / processor tasks during installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After failing to upgrade 4 times I simply placed my laptop in a position where I could have a cheap fan blow cool air to the underside of my laptop during the entire installation phase. I did not make any other changes to the installation process that had
 failed the previous times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 upgrade finally completed successfully without any additional problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps some of you out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />

            <p>I had the exact same issue. However, after reading through this thread, I tried just blasting a fan at my laptop and propping it up so that the bottom of it got cool air. This seemed to be the solution for me, so I would suggest that you try it as well.
 Windows 10 literally just finished downloading like 10 minutes ago for me.</p>

<h2>            Startup repair cannot repair this computer automatically</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I ran a system restore, because neither mouse I own would work at all (a microsoft mouse and a dell mouse) and the computer was running incredibly slowly.&nbsp; Now the computer is stuck on Startup Repair. The message I get is that "Windows cannot repair this computer
 automatically. I've removed devices and clicked finish, but when I try to startup again the same thing happens.&nbsp; I tried running it in safe mode but it still just opens startup repair.</p>
<p>Can I fix this or will I need to take it to a repair place? I've got my files backed up from when I upgrading to Windows 7 earlier this year, could I try reinstalling windows 7 using the upgrade cd?<br />
<br />
When I view diagnostic and repair details, all tests say successful, error code = 0x0, and the root cause found section says that startup repair has tried several times but still cannot determine the cause of the problem.<br />

<span>Hi Spanny_t,</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to scan the Computer for error using chkdsk command in the Command Prompt from the System Recovery Options Menu.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To open the System Recovery Options menu on your computer</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.Do one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span>•If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears,
 you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>•If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press Enter. (If Repair your computer isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't
 include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator has turned them off.)</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.On the System Recovery Options menu, click a tool(Command Prompt) to open it.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6. At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r . Press Enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Refer the following link for more information:</span></p>

<span>What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows Login Screen always shows different pictures for like/dislike (I know this is optional if you can find where the option is without scracth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be wise if you;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Add a checkbox to Like/Dislike screen for 'Do Not Show Me Pictures At Start' for easily making this off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-Checking 'Show Picture With Login/Password Box Together' resulted as the picture attached below. No picture showing but asking you whether you Like it, just fun...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your kind information (screen language is TR)</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although this solution brings the situation to the default, still there is problem as I stated above, namely;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Need I checkbox for faster off the Fun Picture</p>
<p>-Black Screen showing if you set on again (off course this has a programmatic remedy from MS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best</p>
<p>Tarik</p>
