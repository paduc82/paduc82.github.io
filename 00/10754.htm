<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Create custom response options for Calendar meeting requests</h2>
                    <p>I manage a biweekly meeting with a large committee, some of whom attend in person and some via teleconference.&nbsp; When they respond to the regular meeting request, in addition to the options for attending/declining/tentative, I would like to find a way for
 them to indicate&nbsp;if they will&nbsp;attend in-person or via teleconference&nbsp;without them having to key in&nbsp;text and my having to scan each response and note outside of Outlook.&nbsp; I've thought about a custom form design but I'm not sure how to go about it as I only
 seem to be able to initiate designs for the meeting request, not for the recipient response.</p>

            <p>You could send the invite as an iCalendar attatchement to an email message and use voting buttons in the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they get the email, they click on the attached icalendar and it puts it in their calendar and they also vote as to whether they will attend in person of teleconference. You can use the vote tracker to track who has accepted and how they will join.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would that work for you ?</p>

<h2>            Data type mismatch in criteria expression...</h2>
                    <p>I have a query which pulls data from another query. the first query returns a T/F value (-1,0) comparing values:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compare: [ValCompDate]&gt;[ValComp]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the SQL for this query:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT tblITPs.Name_, Year([T_Date]) AS Yr, Format$(Month([T_Date]),"00") AS Mo, Format$(Day([T_Date]),"00") AS Dy, [Yr] &amp; [Mo] &amp; [Dy] AS [Comp], tblITPs.CompDate, Val([Comp]) AS ValComp, Val([CompDate]) AS ValCompDate, [ValCompDate]&gt;[ValComp] AS Compare,
 Date()-7 AS T_Date<br />
FROM tblITPs;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This second query takes the [Name_] value and the T/F value [Compare].&nbsp; If I want all data returned, this query works perfectly.&nbsp; However, if I want just the true values,&nbsp;I get the data mismatch error.&nbsp; This query worked last week, but now, nothing.&nbsp; I've
 tried a couple different criteria, but no such luck, unless I remove the criteria completely:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT qryAllTasks_CompDate.Name_, qryAllTasks_CompDate.Compare<br />
FROM qryAllTasks_CompDate<br />
WHERE (((qryAllTasks_CompDate.Compare)=-1));</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT qryAllTasks_CompDate.Name_, qryAllTasks_CompDate.Compare<br />
FROM qryAllTasks_CompDate<br />
WHERE (((qryAllTasks_CompDate.Compare)="True"));</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help are guidance is appreciated.</p>

            I never use an alias created as a column in an expression in any other column. T_Date, Yr, Mo, Dy, Comp, ValComp, and ValCompDate are all created in the query and in my experience shouldn't be used in other expressions since it sometimes leads to errors.<br />
<br />
SELECT tblITPs.Name_,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Year([T_Date]) AS Yr,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Format$(Month([T_Date]),"00") AS Mo,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Format$(Day([T_Date]),"00") AS Dy,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;[Yr] &amp; [Mo] &amp; [Dy] AS [Comp],&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;tblITPs.CompDate,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Val([Comp]) AS ValComp,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Val([CompDate]) AS ValCompDate,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;[ValCompDate]&gt;[ValComp] AS Compare,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Date()-7 AS T_Date<br />
FROM tblITPs;<br />
<br />
Can you provide the logic of what you are attempting to accomplish? It seems like you are converting dates to strings then to numbers. Can we assume CompDate is a date field? Do you just want to compare CompDate with the current date - 7 days?&nbsp;

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I assume that CompDate is not a column of date/time data type as, if it were, VAL(Compdate) would return the value of the first element of the date in the system's short date format, i.e. the month in the USA, the day in the UK.&nbsp; As you are apparently
 trying to compare it with a value in the format yyyymmdd, I can only assume that it is itself a string expression in that format.<br />
<br />
It appears that you are trying to return rows where CompDate is later than the date 7 days prior to the current date, so if CompDate&nbsp; is a string expression in the format yyyymmdd, then why not simply use:<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM tblITPs<br />
WHERE CDATE(FORMAT(CompDate,"0000\-00\-00")) &gt; DATE()-7;<br />
<br />
If CompDate were a column of date/time data type, as would normally be expected, then it would simply be:<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM tblITPs<br />
WHERE CompDate &gt; DATE()-7;<br />

<h2>            Nokia Navi&#47;Maps&#59; Enter destination</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to enter a proper destination with street and city to nokia maps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually I just may enter a street name, press search and obtain some hits.</p>
<p>If i misspelled I get nothing.</p>
<p>Alternatively I go to the map and search manually - but this also can not be true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The navi is great, hopefully a software update let us enter postcode, city and street</p>

<p>Unfortunately you will have problems if you spell the name wrong. If your misspell is close enough, it may be listed in the list. If not, you will have to try other combinations and permutations. Sometimes it may be better to truncate the search string.
 Say if you are searching for Cornwall and you can't remember if there is 1 or 2 l's at the end, you could just search for Cornw and it would probably list all towns matching the string. You will get a longer list but it should at least be listed.</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I have sent out an internal Sway Newsletter to our peers within my company.&nbsp; I want to use the Analytics to report back to high level management on how many people have read each communication, however on this particular Sway, the view count is not going
 up, only 0 people so I cannot see the Analytics.&nbsp; See screen captured below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there an issue with analytics on the program?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I could share my Sway URL if required to trace the problem and solve the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi Lee,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why you keep suggesting to post our issues in the sway community?? Fyi I did report already there, but I am thinking in here we will get answer and solution more quickly, i.e. to debug the the page which has an issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I notice you always introduce you as Independent Consultant then divert to link you given.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For my case, I have seen some similar issue which users has trouble with the page views and/or Sway analytics.&nbsp; And they're posting here, with the real solution given by the Microsoft Employee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, I hope my case also have the same real solution.&nbsp; Not just diverting to another place, which I couldn't find any similar issue or any helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the same issue. Analytics are way lower than our integrated poll (Microsoft Forms) are showing. Curious to know if we're going to lose all the analytics from the weekend or if it's just taking a while for them to show on the site.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently had to purchase a new iMac.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have all my files, images etc retrieved and transferred to the new iMac.</p>
<p>However, on purchasing and then opening Outlook 365 I could (and cannot) find the emails I hope would have been automatically transferred from my 'old' email program Outlook Express (in Office: Mac 2011 - home and business).</p>
<p>I'm hoping to retrieve all those in my inbox, strored in folders, sent emails and my contacts lists (names, addresses etc).</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any advice.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Hello Paul Ford,
<br />Unfortunately your emails are not retrieved automatically as the rest of your files did. You need to export them from your former Mail Client (Outlook Express) and importing to you new Outlook for MAC. See below the possible ways you can use for such purpose.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor wiling to help.
<br />
<br />Is your account configured as IMAP.? 
<br />
<br />The option have to be there. To access these settings, click Outlook &gt; Preferences &gt; Accounts, select the IMAP account, and then click Advanced.

            I don't know how to configure the account as IMAP. &nbsp;It says "google account" on my new mac and "IMAP account" on my old.

            That is why.!  the advanced option that you are looking for, is for imap accounts, the settings for accounts configuration changed for users who are on Build 16.15.18070902 and higher.
<br />
<br />Please check the new options for google accounts from the link below <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b#bkmk_improvedauth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an...</a>

            <p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are too many variables. Which Lumia, pictures displayed in gallery or elsewhere, were the pictures and videos uploaded via mobile or WiFi, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Lumia is on its last legs, I suggest first copy all pictures and videos that are stored on the phone via a USB data cable to a PC. Use the file manager on the PC to ensure that the full resolution files are&nbsp;securely backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, from a PC, log on to&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/</a> with the Microsoft user name and password used on the phone, to check what is stored, in which folders, and in what resolution, on your OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not familiar with Android and any particular issues the OneDrive app may have on that platform. My main concern would be to secure an extra copy of everything valuable in local storage while the old phone works. I suggest keep a local extra copy of everything
 on OneDrive as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- <br />

</p><p>An IMAP account may not connect to Outlook if there are issues with the connection with the email server itself. Since you already tried connecting this account with two versions of Outlook, it would be best to contact your email service provider for more
 in-depth troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            VBA to Duplicate &#47; copy slide when in presentation mode</h2>
                    <p>Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now auto created an entire presentation of full size images using VBA, which is to be used for photographic competitions. What I'd hoped to do, but haven't yet found out how to, is to&nbsp;enable the duplication of certain slides when a judge deems them
 worthy of shortlisting. I'd hoped to be able to trigger a macro to do this from a button press or other slide event that copies the active slide to the end of the presentation,&nbsp;but&nbsp;do all this while in presentation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if this is possible, and could you give me any tips?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            I'm not sure how to explain it clearer. I need you to answer these questions so I can try to figure out the issue (hopefully). So using &nbsp;a PC, if you go to www.outlook.com, can you log into your Microsoft Live account?

            <p>OK, now when you setup your device initially, did you sign in with your Live ID as you were setting up the device? (That is to say did you use the same Live account you just used to get into outlook.com?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND you never told me what device you have and what OS is on it, so what device do you have and what OS is on it? Is it 8, 8.1 or 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming it is 8 or 8.1. If that is correct, if you go to Settings/email+account and look at the email account listed under your Microsoft account is it the same account that you used to log into your account when you just used the PC?</p>

<h2>            Synced OneDrive Files missing in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I have synced to a number of document libraries on our SharePoint Online site. I am doing so to move hundreds of files around so Windows Explorer is the easiest environment to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open my OneDrive folder, I see a green checkmark next to EVERY folder, however, some of these folders are missing the files in them. When I view my OneDrive folder online, I see all the files I should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are my files not appearing in Windows Explorer? I will admit, I'm a bit low on space but I just cleared 7GB, which is more than enough to account for the missing files. And anyways, shouldn't it show a red x indicating that files are not all synced?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: the marked answer below did help re initiate the sync, however, I was alerted that the file names were too long and I must've skipped them and forgot to fix it the first time around. Just a heads up in case this is a contributing factor as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Software to play RMVB</h2>
                    Hi there, I'm new around here and just bought a E65... does anyone know how can I play RMVB(real media video broadcast) in my Phone?

            Actually RMVB stands for RealMedia Variable Bitrate.<br />
<br />
E65 should play it if it's based in the Realvideo 8,9 or 10 AND if the maximum bitrate is about 200kbps AND if the size is QVGA (320x240) or CIF (352x288). At least that's my understanding...

            Oh you're right, my bad...<br />
My idea was to see some tv shows i have in my laptop to see on the mobile while i'm on the way to work... they are saved in RMVB but i don't know the size, etc(newbie...) The phone only plays the sound of it...

            Unlike the mad one, I'm no expert, but my guess is that it's to do with something like screen size/bitrate. There are a number of conversion packages around that could probably fix the problem for you .. unfortunately, I don't recall the names however
 a quick search will find them as they get mentioned on here about twice a week.

            Merging of 2 Microsoft accounts is not possible. This is still a feature being considered by Microsoft.
<br />
<br />But you can link 2 accounts using alias.
<br />

<p>To the best of my knowledge they don't work and that is why you probably cannot find anything.</p>
<p>I would be interested to know why your company wants every chapter of the manual in a separate file (I can think of no good reason for doing that).</p>

<p>The master document feature is buggy in Word; most if not all experienced users avoid it. For more, see&nbsp;<a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/General/RecoverMasterDocs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/General/RecoverMasterDocs.htm</a> ("How to
 recover a Master Document").</p>
<p>Making use of a single document would be the easiest solution, by far.</p>
<p>However, you can use INCLUDETEXT fields to include separate files into a "master." See:</p>
<p>How to Use IncludeText Fields<br />
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/tblsfldsfms/includetextfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/faqs/tblsfldsfms/includetextfields.htm</a></p>
<p>Note that in recent versions of Word, to display the Insert File dialog box, you must click the arrow next to Object on the Insert tab, and then click Text from File. (The command is misleading, as not only the text but all contents of the referenced file
 will be included.)</p>

<div>You can create a master TOC in a separate document using the RD (Ref Document) field. MasterDocs are deadly as a minor error can trash whole documents.</div>

<p>But, of course, RD fields wouldn't help with the creation of cross-references across files.</p>

You can create a master TOC in a separate document using the RD (Ref Document)<br />
field. MasterDocs are deadly as a minor error can trash whole documents.<br />

My company has a policy that every chapter of a manual has to be in a separate<br />
file. I would like to link all these files in order to do things like<br />
cross-referencing a section in another chapter, or building a table of<br />
contents for the manual.<br />
<br />
I remember earlier versions of Word had something called Master Documents; it<br />
seemed to be for doing this kind of thing. I haven't found any mention of<br />
master documents in Word 2007 Help.<br />
<br />
What happened to master documents, and how can I cross-reference between<br />
documents and build a TOC for file-segmented documents in Word 2007?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Building Relationships Between Tables on Excel 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to build relationships between tables on Excel 2016 for Mac, and I can't seem to figure out how to do it. The goal is to build a relationship between two tables and then to create a PivotTable for them. How do I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a brand new Excel user, so, if possible, a step-by-step walkthrough would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016&#58; Mailbox items not visible</h2>
                    <p>Recently we've noticed a performance degradation in Outlook 2016. It takes some time for emails to hit the mailbox, but the weirdest part is when switching folders like going from inbox to sent items the sent items appears to be empty. Or when going into
 the other folders you'll notice the folder may appear empty but show an item count that is either static or rebuilding. I don't think this is being caused by an update as I've gone through all the updates checking for known issues and also uninstalled the
 most recent updates. Ran Outlook in safe mode same issue. Has anyone else experienced this issue before? if so any suggestions or resolution to this issue would be helpful.</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue occurs if a filter was applied to the default view settings of the Outlook folder. The items are not actually deleted but are being filtered from view in some way. Let us try to check your filtering options. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the ribbon, select the <span><strong>View</strong></span> tab.</li><li>In the <strong>Current View </strong>area, click <span>
<strong>View Settings.</strong></span></li><li>Click <strong>Filter</strong>, and then review the following tabs for any selections that could filter out specific messages:</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Messages</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. More Choices</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Advanced</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also repair your Office application to refresh it further. Here's the <strong>

            Thank you - unfortunately there&nbsp;are no filters currently applied. And it will be pretty tough to repair Outlook/Office on multiple computers as this is happening with a few users. it's just strange that the folders would go blank then rebuild or stay blank.

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. We understand that the steps might be pretty tough; however, we may still need to perform some troubleshooting steps to properly isolate the issue. If you want, you can have the steps tried by a single user first. If it
 works, then the rest would follow. Along with repairing the Office application, you can try to sign out from your account and then restart your device. After that, please sign back in to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted for us to assist you further.</p>

<p>I have the same problem for the last few weeks. its 100% an outlook bug, i am just trying to find more information now. You can go to webmail and the items are there. restarting the outlook client, and the items then resume downloading fine. It does not
 affect all of my users, only a few. The user is not in offline mode, which is usually the cause of these sorts of problems. Interestingly, they can still send mail, but those mails are not copied to the server at all. if you rebuild the profile, any changes
 they have made locally are lost. restarting the client does make everything sync back up however.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There have been quite a few bad outlook patches in the last month. There is one where attachments that are forwarded are dropped silently as well. microsoft must have fired their QA guy or changed procedures or something.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will post back if i find more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i should also say that we are in cached mode where i am seeing this problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10041 Windows Update Error 0x80200068</h2>
                    <p>Getting a weird WU error. Here's a snapshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47e9b33d-197f-45e8-99ca-daa861395a60" height="409" width="658" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Background Information:</p>
<p>- Running Windows 10 Pro Build 10041 on a Surface Pro 3</p>
<p>- I recently installed Visual Studio 2013 Update 4, which is why these errors are coming in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Main Question:</strong></p>
<p>What is the meaning of error code 0x80200068? How can I resolve this?</p>

            <p>I managed to fix this issue by digging into this further. This was being caused by&nbsp;battery saver mode being turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the BITS Jobs I was able to find the following.</p>
<p>ERROR CODE:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x80200068 - Battery Saver mode is preventing the job from transferring. The transfer will resume when the system exits Battery Saver mode or reconnects to A/C power. If this job represents foreground work that should proceed even in Battery
 Saver mode, use priority BG_JOB_PRIORITY_FOREGROUND.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Command: bitsadmin /list /allusers&nbsp;/verbose</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery on my laptop is dead and I keep it plugged in (like a desktop). This caused the Saver to be greyed out at on and hence I could not turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went into device manager and disabled my battery altogether. WU works like a charm now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you guys too.</p>
