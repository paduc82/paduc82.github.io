            Hello  PetrinaButler,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor willing to help you,
<br />
<br />How do you exported those contacts? I suggest to export with Outlook client, that way can help you expoting contacts and email as well.
<br />
<br />An easy way is creating two outlooks profile, one for personal and one for business account, then export a pst file with contacts and emails that you need from your personal and import to the business account.
<br />
<br />Please follow the article below to export content to a pst file suing Outlook client From <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export...</a>

<br />I hope this works, please let me know if you have further questions.

            Hello PetrinaButler,
<br />
<br />Have you tried:
<br /> Opening both Microsoft Outlook and Windows Live Mail email clients, Now in the main screen of Windows Live Mail Click on the File tab and then select Export and then under Export select the Email Messages option. ... Now a dialog box "Export Message" will appear. After that click on the OK button.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that works.

<p>Hi Petrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the start, please recheck (in the .csv file) whether the mail address is in the right column. The behavior you described could be caused by having email address in name, instead email tab.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 920</h2>
                    <p>HI ,</p>
<p>I downloaded mobile preview build 10512 for my Nokia 920. The first few days it was slow in responding but was manageable. However on the 3rd day it wouldn't open any apps in fact it wouldn't go to main screen. It would allow me to use the camera by pressing
 the side button. After lock screen just kept saying loading. Tried a soft reset but no good. Finally I had to download and use the windows recovery tool. Such a shame as windows mobile 10 looks great and hope when finally release happens my Nokia 920 might
 get update????</p>

                    <p>Tried many different things recommended by MS.</p>
<p>Nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest so far has been this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the normal.dot file and am able to start Word normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But only once or twice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then back to the same ol', same ol'.</p>
<p>Word won't start, asks if I want to send an error report yada yada etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for WinXP. Word 2002.</p>

<p>Thanks, you guys are great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I found the solution.</p>
<p>I didn't pursue the add-on route until now because I couldn't think of any I added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time when Word started I noticed on the toolbar an icon saying Foxit Reader PDF.</p>
<p>That is the culprit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can an established company hijack Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I couldn't find a way to remove the add-on from the toolbar (it's still there)</p>
<p>but I did delete the .dlls in the C:\Program Files\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\plugins\Create\x86"</p>
<p>folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That did it! I am now able to start Word and not have any of the previous pop-ups pop up.</p>
<p>Also able to open/create files, save them etc.</p>

<h2>            Email Attachment downloads as html</h2>
                    I am having trouble with downloading Excel attachments, I currently have Microsoft Office 2007 installed, and I am using google chrome as my browser. When a .XLSX attachment is received I can view the attachment however when I download the attachment it
 will only save it as an html, when I open the html and try save as excel workbook the same file remains as an html. I can open excel and create my own workbooks and save them normally, I am just having issues with the ones attached in an email. The same files
 can be accessed normally on other computers so I am not sure if it is a settings issue or not.

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step (1 you have already done. First do point 10) -<br />
<br />
1. Please try to perform a quick repair of your Office.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.

<p>Hi Ileana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your information. You have a lot of product licenses in your account. And it's a business account with Office 365 Enterprise E4 license, which is no longer available to purchase anymore. From your screenshot, you can sign in Planner portal
 but cannot open the Conversation or Members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is because Office 365 integrates many features and service among applications. When you create a new plan, you also create an Office 365 group in your Office 365 tenant. To learn more details about Office 365 group, you can refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/learn-about-office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. When you click Conversation or Members, it will navigate to your mailbox to access the group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While based on the error message "UserHasNoMailboxException", you may haven't created or set up the mailbox of your Office 365 account completely. And that's the reason you received the error. To create the mailbox, please use your account to sign in
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> (OWA).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you have created the mailbox but still cannot access the group, it could be a private group that only members can see the contents. And only group owner has the permission to add you to the group.</p>

<p>Hi IIeana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot sign in your account in OWA, we suggest you contact the admins in your organization and get them involved in this issue. Because some operations can be performed only by the admin accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use admin account to sign in <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Admin center</a> and navigate to Users &gt; Active users, then check if the Exchange Online Plan has been turned on.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/892853c9-6baf-4bce-b2cd-c7f616762aaf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/892853c9-6baf-4bce-b2cd-c7f616762aaf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If it's already turned on, I'd like to confirm the deployment situation in your organization. Please contact the admin to check if your organization deployed on-premises Exchange server in your organization, or deployed Exchange hybrid. Since the OWA
 link I provided is connected to Exchange Online server, if you have created the mailbox in on-premises Exchange server, you may receive the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<h2>            Windows Security Certificate Errors.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 8.1 and a few days ago, two problems arose with IE 11. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Every site I try to access, such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, has a security certificate error with it. and it always says "it is not recommended to continue to this site"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. My proxy server is enabled, and it temporarily turns off when I disable it in Internet options &gt; connections &gt; lan settings. But when I turn on my computer again, the proxy server setting is enabled again.

<h3> peggy the searcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            View and manage your Internet Explorer add-ons screen.  Red circle with red &#92; in middle over Tool Bars and Extensions.</h2>
                    <p>Computer is Windows XP and Internet Explorer 8.&nbsp; I assume the red circle with red \ going through it&nbsp;on the left hand corner of Tool Bars and Extensions bar means that IE8 is being run with no add-ons even though the add-ons show that they are enabled.&nbsp;
 I have tried replacing the desk top Internet Explorer with the Fix 50228 and it just replaces it with the same icon that browses without add-ons.&nbsp;The Start Programs IE icon&nbsp;is the same and when right clicked and&nbsp;Properties selected shows Tools Options screen.
 &nbsp;I have done the Tools, Options, Advanced and the third-party browser extensions was already checked.&nbsp; I don't want to do a reset as this supposedly eliminates all the present add-ons.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is there some other way to get IE8 to run with add-ons?</p>

            <p>I'm sorry, your links do not help -- been there, done that, except for the Do It Yourself instructions that I don't want to even think about.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Perhaps, I should have mentioned that after the following notification appeared is when I noticed the red circle with red \.&nbsp;&nbsp; McAfee Internet Security installed on my computer may have terminated Tool Bars and Extensions.&nbsp; I was looking at the screen that
 shows the list of add-on.&nbsp; A pop-up sigh appeared.</p>
<p>Accross the top:&nbsp; McHlp 32.exe - Application Error</p>
<p>Text:&nbsp; The instruction at "0x02fefa1b" referenced memory at "0x02fefa1b".&nbsp; The memory could not be "read".</p>
<p>Instructions:&nbsp; Click&nbsp;on&nbsp;OK to terminate Program or Click on CANCEL to debug program</p>
<p>Because I had been having a third party pop-up problem connected to malware on the computer -- hopefully fully removed, I chose not to click on either option and exited using the Task Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to get an answer from McAfee as to whether or not
 this was actually one of their notifications but did not get a satisfactory answer.
</p>
<p>At this point in time, I will contact Tech Support regarding IE8 destop icon and all other IE8 icons starting without add-ons.&nbsp; I'd stil like to know if any one has ever seen the restrict red circle sign.&nbsp; I will also try to get more info from McAfee regarding
 Application Error.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help.</p>

<p><br />
In IE9 you can see that icon in Manage Add-ons when ActiveX Filtering is enabled.&nbsp; Perhaps you have made some analogous modifications in your Security Settings?&nbsp;&nbsp; Try setting them to All Defaults?</p>

            <p>You caught me!&nbsp; Yes, this is the same computer, and I'm still not sure there is no malware on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have continued to try and resolve this problem without having to flatten computer and start all over again.&nbsp; On Feb 16th, I ran Microsoft Safety Scanner
 and it found win/32PowerReg Scheculer and removed it and four additional files.&nbsp; Malwarebytes. McAfee Stinger&nbsp;and SUPER..... did not detect this and they were run before Microsoft Safety scanner.&nbsp; There is still a PowerReg Schedulerv2.exe that starts when
 computer is turned on, but this appears to be legit.&nbsp; I have had no other suspicious pop-ups, except for the one I mentioned in this thread on March 2nd.&nbsp; I will say that I have tried to verify that all malware has been removed from the computer by going to
 PCH games.&nbsp; A new pop-up is there; however, I have exited the site using the Task Manager.&nbsp; I&nbsp;ran Microsoft Safety Scanner on Feb 22nd.&nbsp; Extended Scan Results are below:<br />
----------------<br />
-&gt;Scan ERROR: resource file://C:\hiberfil.sys (code 0x00000020 (32))<br />
-&gt;Scan ERROR: resource file://C:\hiberfil.sys (code 0x0000054F (1359))<br />

-&gt;Scan ERROR: resource file://C:\pagefile.sys (code 0x0000054F (1359))<br />

-&gt;Scan ERROR: resource file://C:\pagefile.sys (code 0x00000020 (32))<br />
No infection found as part of the extended scan<br />
</p>
<p>I have not a clue as to what the above Scan ERRORs mean.&nbsp; I have been running scans in Safe Mode with System Restore turned off.</p>
<p>At this time, I have completely stopped&nbsp;playing PCH games.&nbsp; I read and don't completely understand an article "GAMING THE GAMERS: TRICKS OF THE TRADE IN THE WORLD OF PWS WARCRAFT" by Chun Feng, that I found on some Microsoft web site.&nbsp; All I can understand
 is that game web sites are being attacked and as a result, the gamers get attacked.&nbsp; I feel PCH games is a gateway fo trouble.</p>
<p>I don't know whether or not the above information helps to clarify the present IE8 being run without add-ons and the red logo.</p>

            <p>No, I have not formated the hard-drive (whatever that means) nor done a clean install of WinXP.&nbsp; I read the article when you were helping be before.&nbsp; Flatten and rebuild seems to be an unreasonable solution since there are so many threats out there that
 seem to find their way into computers fhat are running anti-virus programs.&nbsp; From my past experience, flatten and rebuild would be necessary about every two years.&nbsp; This solution also seems to indicate that once some type of malware invades a computer, no
 downloaded fix it product like Malwarebytes or Microsoft Security Scanner can remedy the problem -- so, why bother using them.</p>
<p>I have recently discovered that Microsoft will no longer be supporting Windows XP or Office 2003 -- both on my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really don't know what will happen, but&nbsp;it appears the computer is going to be obsolete -- sort of like me:)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have had new credit cards issued, closed on-line banking and credit card sites that would show new credit card numbers.&nbsp; Also, I don't plan to make any on-line purchases where any of the new cards would have to be used.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So, I think we are finished with this unless you have any other suggestions regarding the IE8 add-on screen with the red icon.&nbsp; I have the feeling that you are a little disappointed and frustrated with me, because I didn't follow you advice.&nbsp; This is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 understand.&nbsp; Get a pillow and pucnh it!&nbsp; This might help release frustration.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help.&nbsp; I&nbsp;did learn&nbsp;a lot through this searching experience.</p>

Since I have been "around the block" mega times since receiving your 11-step "fix" of January 30th, I decided to at least give the "fix" a try and just completed.&nbsp; At this point in time, I don't know whether or not it will do any good.
<p>I would like to respond to item l0. if I have not mentioned before.&nbsp; The web site was not telling me to update IE.&nbsp; The third party pop-ups were telling me to renew the browser.&nbsp; The only to determine whether or not the pop-ups will appear is to go to PCH
 games and play a game.&nbsp; I don't think I want to do that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Item 5.&nbsp; I did go back to double-check the setting.&nbsp; Upon opening Custom, the Use my current is is the designated option, but it wasn't pointing anywhere.&nbsp; I checked The Windows pull down screen and it is showing IE.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I followed your instructions
 correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp

<p>Item 9. Fix it -- I had already done through Tools, Options, Advanced; however, I did it again with Fix it.&nbsp; The red circle has continued to stay on Tool Bars and Extensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I did it&nbsp;the Sun Microsystem's Sun Java Console and SSVHelper Class,
 Verizon Tool Bar, McAfee's Site Adviser Tool Bar, And Microsoft Corp's Research&nbsp;were disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I enabled all of these.&nbsp; Of course, they are disable again.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I want all enabled.</p>

Im sorry, I meant to say Office Home and Student Edition. I forgot to mention that my computer came with a version of Office that seamed to not work properly at times.&nbsp;Im just realizing&nbsp;what the error means.&nbsp;When I try running the Setup im encountered by this
 error: "There was a problem settin gup Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010: You cannot install the 32-bit version of Microsoft Office 2010, because you hace 64-bit versions of Office products installed. These 64-bit products are not supported with 32-bit
 installations: Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means i will have to uninstall the old "Professional Plus" in order to install the "Office Home and Student" edition right? I'd hat to lose all my emails and contacts, how could I do the install without losing anything?</p>

<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling Office should not touch your data.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it's prudent to back it all up.&nbsp; Make a copy of your Documents folder (and its subfolders)&nbsp;to aother&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;if you have more than one or some other folder on your main hard
 drive if not.</p>
<p>Let me repeat something I said earlier: Office Home and Sudent does NOT include Outlook so if you had been using Outlook in Office Professional Plus, then you will be removing Outlook altogether by installing Office Home and Student, whether you install
 the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version.&nbsp; The minimum Office suite you need to include Outlook is Ofice Home and Business.&nbsp; You can supplement the Home and Student suite by purchasing Outlook standalone.</p>
<p>Did you PC come with a trial version of Office Professional Plus?</p>

<h2>            Outlook desktop app &#34;appointments&#34; made showing up as &#34;meetings&#34; in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
<p>If I make an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">appointment</span> in the Outlook desktop app (it doesn't matter if using Office 2013 or Office 2016 but is from an Office 365 subscription), when I go to Office.com, it is a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">meeting</span> instead of an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
appointment</span>.</p>
<p>The problem this causes is that as Office.com then syncs to my Android phone to update the phone with the new appointment, it makes it a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">meeting</span> in the phone's Office Outlook app instead of an
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">appointment</span> - and the meeting cannot be edited. Thus, if I need to add notes , change time, etc., to the appointment (but showing as a meeting) on my phone, there is no edit button (since it is a meeting). There
 is only the trash button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: On my desktop computer in the Outlook desktop app, I make a doctor appointment at 10:00 am on 6/1/2018. It shows as an appointment in the Outlook desktop app, if I look at it on Outlook.com, it shows a meeting and if I look at it on my phone, it
 shows as a meeting.</p>
<p>A few days later I'm out and about, the doctor's office calls and needs to change the appointment to 11:00 am on 6/4/2018. After hanging up, I go to Outlook app on my phone to change the date and time. But it is a "meeting" instead of an "appointment" and
 it does not have an edit button. So, I either have to wait until I'm back at home or the office on my desktop OR make a new appointment on my phone and delete the "meeting" appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An interesting note is that if I make an appointment in the Outlook desktop app that is one of my Office 365 business domain (Office 365 email address) calendars, it stays as an appointment in the Office 365 Outlook.com&nbsp; and stays as a appointment on my
 phone. So the problem seems to be with Outlook.com syncing with outlook.com email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap:</p>
<p>When make an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">appointment</span> in Outlook desktop app:</p>
<p>&gt;If made with an *** Email address is removed for privacy *** calendar, it converts to a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
meeting</span> in Outlook.com</p>
<p>&gt;If made with an email@business domain.com calendar, it stays as an appointment in Outlook.com (Office 365)</p>
<p>

<p>Hi RobJB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the post. I understand the appointment created in the Outlook client would be turned to meeting in website for the @outlook.com account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I know the appointment would be changed to meeting if we invite other users to this appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To move further, would you please capture some screenshots of the appointment detailed information both in Outlook and website?</p>

            The picture Outlook desktop app was where the appointment (not a meeting and no attendees) was made on Outlook Desktop 2016 app on a laptop computer (software supplied by way of Office 365). It looks like a regular appointment (not meeting). Second picture
 Outlook.com is how the appointment looks when go to outlook.com and look at the appointment. Then the third picture, Outlook on android, is what the appointment looks like on my phone. It shows as a meeting instead of an appointment. It cannot be edited (note
 only the trash/delete icon). If an appointment is made on the phone or on outlook.com, it is made as an
 but as a meeting on the Outlook Android phone app (and it can't be edited on the phone). This causes much problem because appointments can't be changed on the go (ex. while meeting with a client, getting more info to add details to the existing appointment,
 etc.). A solution to this problem would be appreciated.

            I use a full exchange mail account (Not outlook.com) and 2016 on the desktop and the mail app on my android from the Play store and I cannot replicate your problem. i.e. an appointment/task is just that, when created on the desktop or on the mobile

<p>I understand what you are saying. When i make an appointment on the Outlook desktop app using my exchange email account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), it shows up as a appointment, not a meeting on my phone. BUT when I use my personal email account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
 and any calendars (for example a shared family calendar) the problem happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So would it be that everyone should eliminate using an outlook.com email account? And what about people that don't have an exchange account? This doesn't seem to be an exchange account problem (having a domain exchange email mailbox set up with Microsoft
 Office 365). I've already communicated with Office 365 support per the Office 365 admin business subscription, and I have already already communicated with the help changed per the Outlook Phone app menu. Both have said that this appears to be an Outloot.com
 problem which would not be within their support, thus i have made contact through this channel. (The problem appears to be @outlook.com email accounts (where the email database is held by Outlook.com servers) when using Outlook desktop app is used to make
 an appointment (not a meeting) and when Outlook.com servers push the email out to the Android Outlook app, it is changing it to a meeting instead od an appointment on the phone. Surely it is not supposed to be designed to do this. There appears to be a bug
 in the processing of Outlook email. This used to not happen but there have been a lot of changes in outlook.com. (Outlook.com also serse to have been somewhat recently designeddes try to be somewhat smarter - like adding a birthday icon if a birthday is mentioned
 in the appointment. Perhaps it is a redesign of Outlook.com that recognizes to give the icons (on the phone), that are also someway thinking appointments are meetings. I appreciate your help in coming up with a solution for this problem.</p>

go to website</a> for the @outlook.com to modify &amp; create the appointments temporarily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the issue does not occur to Office 365 account, I'll do some investigation and keep the update here.</p>

            since E71 is a Series60 device, i will take a stab here and say you need to go to Tools &gt; Bluetooth and scroll right to the Paired devices/Blocked devices, and delete the devices as appropriate. can't remember exactly if its Tools or Ctrl. Panel (Control
 Panel), but its somewhere around there :)<br />

<p>It is not about deleting the pairing device. If you have E71, pls try send some image via bluetooth, it will apear " Last devices used: " and list of the device which you used to send before. The problem is list does not aprear on page 107 as you mention.
 If appear, it can delete it. The list only aprear when you want to send via bluetooth.</p>

            If it isn't the paired devices you wish to delete, I'm not sure what the query is. On the E90, when I try and send something via Bluetooth, I get a list of 'Last Devices Used'. If I select 'More devices' the list is refreshed. No need to delete anything.

    <title>Gmail not working in Outlook 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jendingbat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gmail not working in Outlook 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Brand new laptop, Windows10 and with newly installed Office 365</p>
<p>Trying to set up a gmail account and it just will not work, IMAP or Pop3. &nbsp;I've tried everything</p>
<p>The configuration is definitely correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>User Name *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Email address as above</p>
<p>incoming server: imap.gmail.com</p>
<p>outgoing server: smtp.gmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outgoing server requires authentication: &nbsp;Ticked</p>
<p>Use same settings as incoming mail server: Ticked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incoming Port SSL 993</p>
<p>Outgoing Port SSL 465 (and tried TLS 587)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When done a window keeps popping up to verify username and password, which are definitely correct as I've logged onto gmail online. I've also enable both IMAP and Pop3 in gmail on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this must be a problem with Windows10 or with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last 3 years I've set this up for 9 different users on that domain and some I re-did due to new machines and whatnot but have never had a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got any ideas please!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jen</p>
<p>

<h3> scottker  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTD TP2 Garbage in the &#92; after hard reset</h2>
                    
<p>I guess my HTD Touch Pro 2 had some serious problems before I hard reset it.&nbsp; After doing the hard reset and waiting a long time for it to get to a stable point the phone restarted with over 1000 "FILEXXXX' in the root folder.&nbsp; I've deleted them to get the
 phone running but would like to know:</p>
<p>- How do you Scandisk/chkdsk your phone?</p>
<p>- How do you ensure your phones root and storage card (4gb) file systems are healthy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

I do not think there is a utility for for that (nor do I think it is needed at this time).</p>

<p>If you are referencing a virus, at this point in time virus protection is not really an issue with handheld devices (although that does not mean it will not be needed in the furure).&nbsp; There are a few virus protection programs out there but I just think it
 is money that does not need to be spent (at this time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was an interesting article I read the other day referencing virus'</p>

            Hi,<br />
I am seeing a similar issue reported by another user on his Samsung Epix. Did you do just a hard reset or a factory restore? Also can you go to the web portal http://myphone.microsoft.com and click Deleted Items - &gt; Contacts and check if you have your contacts
 there. Please let me know if you find all your contacts there.<br />
<br />
So this could be like the below scenario:<br />
1. You have contacts. Synced them to My Phone server. Now you did a delete of all contacts. And now if you have had a scheduled sync in My Phone, My Phone would have treated that you have deleted all your contacts and removed all of them from your account.
 If this had happened, you can find all your contacts in Deleted Items.<br />
<br />

<blockquote>Hi,<br />
I am seeing a similar issue reported by another user on his Samsung Epix. Did you do just a hard reset or a factory restore? Also can you go to the web portal http://myphone.microsoft.com and click Deleted Items - &gt; Contacts and check if you have your contacts
 there. Please let me know if you find all your contacts there.<br />
<br />
So this could be like the below scenario:<br />
1. You have contacts. Synced them to My Phone server. Now you did a delete of all contacts. And now if you have had a scheduled sync in My Phone, My Phone would have treated that you have deleted all your contacts and removed all of them from your account.
 If this had happened, you can find all your contacts in Deleted Items.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

thanks for your reply, what i meant is i synced all my staff onto my phone web using my phone right, and when i perfomed a hard reset on my handset, i discoverd that all my staff on my phone web had been deleted as well, so thats why i dont understand,does
 it mean, if i perfom a hardreset on my handset, after having synced my staff onto myphone web, does it delete all my staff stored on my phone web<br />

            Hi,<br />
Can you check your account on the web? As I asked you earlier: "Also can you go to the web portal http://myphone.microsoft.com and click Deleted Items - &gt; Contacts and check if you have your contacts there." This would help us find out the issue. Also please
 share your live id used for My Phone.<br />

            Hi,<br />
1. If you have done a hard reset, then even the My Phone app on the client would have got deleted. So there is no link with the server. The data on the server should remain intact. So now the question is like - "Did you install My Phone again after the hard
 reset?".<br />
2. What is the OS on the mobile?<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Repeating Animations in One Slide - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothyras  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeating Animations in One Slide</h2>
                    <p>Hello PowerPointers.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have one line of text float in then float out, then have a second line of text float in before also floating out, then repeating that processes indefinitely without having to do more than one click? I know how to add the float in and float
 out animations and how to sequence them to happen in the order I want them, but I can't figure out how to get them to continuously repeat.</p>
<p>The purpose behind this is to have multiple lines of text animating in and out of a title slide for a presentation so as the audience is coming into the meeting room the slide is dynamic and attention grabbing and I, the presenter, can still welcome the
 audience in individually and not be worried about advancing each animation.</p>
<p>Thank you all you wonderful and beautiful people!</p>

<p>Hi Remo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you add an account to the Outlook app using Microsoft Exchange accounts such as Outlook.com accounts, all data including Contacts, Events and Tasks are synced. This also includes the birthdays of your contacts as long as it is saved in that particular
 contact's information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists despite meeting these requirements, we suggest that you log out your account then log back in. If it doesn't resolve it, please clear the app's data from your phone then uninstall the app. After doing so, download and reinstall
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi Katrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice.</p>
<p>I have spent quite some time trying to get those birthdays into the calendar and following the steps you described.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the birthdays are still not visible in my phone's Outlook calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, honestly, with the Google calendar it all works fine. There I can even import the contact data directly from the phone as v-cards, which is not possible in case of Outlook... Consequenty, I have to import the data from the phone to the Google calendar
 anyways in order to then export it from there to Outlook... Seems unnecessarily complicated. Hence, I intend io directly use the Google calendar.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Teams Connectivity</h2>
                    <p>I am on an Office 365 Enterprise E3 license, running Window 10 Enterprise v1709 build 16299.309.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, within the last month or so, I've lost connectivity to Teams via everything but my iOS app. The desktop app and web apps all just spin "Loading Microsoft Teams" for minutes until they time-out. I've cleared cookies and cache. I've tried IE, Edge,
 and Chrome. I've tried launching within an InPrivate tab on Edge. I've tried to connect with and without my company's VPN software connected, and I've tried while connected through my work's WIFI, my client's guest WIFI, and my home WIFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posed the issue to my company's IT group, and they had nothing immediate that came to mind. The situation is perplexing because my Teams&nbsp;app on iOS works, my desktop Yammer works,&nbsp;and the rest of the browser O365 apps work.

<p>May I ask if there is an error code at the bottom left corner of the window? For example, it's like 0XCAAXXXXX. Please check this following article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/why-am-i-having-trouble-signing-in-to-microsoft-teams-a02f683b-61a3-4008-9447-ee60c5593b0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no error code, I need gather Teams debug log and Fiddler log to further investigate this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Teams debug log:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Right-click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">the Microsoft Teams icon in</span>&nbsp;your application tray, select&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Get Logs</span></p>
<p>2.Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both these way can capture the log, after that you can find your log at: %userprofile%\Downloads</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To collect these logs, I will send you a
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox"><span style="color: rgba(46, 117, 181, 1)">PM (Private Message)</span></a>, you can upload it as attachment there.</p>

<p>I tried to open a word document that was created on a later version of Office than the one I'm running. The word document had links with an Excel document that was open at the time. The links between the document and the spreadsheet however did not work.
 So I closed them both. when I tried to open Excel again it asked me for the CD and then brought Error Message 1706. Since then, the only way I can open Excel by run: excel.exe. Word is still working fine. How do I fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Karthick,</p>
<p>Yes, we have Mobile Device Management (MDM) support with Office 365 Business Premium.</p>
<p>You may try the steps in the following article to set it up:<br />

<p><span><span><span>The most common problems sending/receiving email are,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. You are using the wrong mail server settings. Check your ISP's website (or that of your web hosting company
 if your mail host is other than your ISP) for the correct mail server settings for POP (Incoming) and SMTP (outgoing). Most ISP's will also have a "walkthrough" to show you how to set up mail using popular email clients such as Outlook Express, Eudora, and
 Thunderbird. If they don't have instructions for Windows Mail yet, use the ones for Outlook Express.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. You have "outgoing mail server requires authentication" checked when it does not or vice versa.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. You are trying to send mail through an SMTP server that isn't your regular ISP; i.e., you are trying to send
 mail through AT&amp;T's server when your ISP is Comcast. Some ISP's care about this and some don't.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Your user name and/or password are incorrect. Yes, you do have a user name and password for your email. It
 probably has just been a long time since you set this up (or someone else set it up for you) and you've forgotten. Look through your ISP-related documentation or contact your ISP. They will be able to tell you your user name and assign you a new password.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Your antivirus is set to scan emails and/or is one that causes problems with your operating system (such as
 McAfee in Vista). Turn this option off since it doesn't provide you any extra protection and tends to cause problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer the Microsoft article below and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>

</p><p>I am moving from a Company using Macs to another one using Windows, and I would need to transfer all my contacts (they're on Exchange server) from my old Outlook on Mac to my Outlook for Windows. I've seen that I cannot export a CSV, but only an outlook
 for mac archive, that I've read cannot be imported by outlook on windows. Is that true? Is there any workaround?</p>

<p>Well that’s not entirely true. There is a trick…</p>
<p>Select all your contacts in Outlook and drag them to a folder on the desktop of your Mac.</p>
<p>It will create .vsf contact cards for all the contacts.</p>
<p>You should be able to import the .vcf without any problem in Outlook for Windows (or many many other apps).</p>
