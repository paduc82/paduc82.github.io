                    <br />
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>i just bought my N79 and since the very time i inserted my sim, the "new msg" alert has been blinking on top right of the screen constantly even though there is no new msg. I have tried restarting my device couple of times but no use. Has anyone else experienced
 the same problem? how do i get rid of the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any reply is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Cannot Access my Hotmail.com emails</h2>
                    To access my emails, I alway went to MSN.com and clicked on Outllook. Until tonight, it always took me to my Hotmail mailbox. Tonight, when I clicked on Outlook, it gave me the process for setting up an Outlook.com email address. I thought it would be
 creating a separate mailbox. I did not realize or want it to Replace and make unaccessible my hotmail account. Now I cannot access any of my emails from that address that I've been using for more than 20 years.&nbsp; HELP!!!!

            Hi Charles,
<br />You don't have to create a new email just log into <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />with your MSN account. The starting page can be confusing click on Sign in not Create account to access it. But use the link above and book mark it for future use. 
<br />Click sign in put in your email address and next then your password. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

    <title>Transferring music files to 6085 mobile - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Transferring music files to 6085 mobile</h2>
                    I have just purchased a USB cable and PC Suite to be able to transfer music files to my mobile. The software appears to have installed correctly and I can connect okay. Via the Music Manager software I can view my music files on my PC however they are
 all around the 3MB in size. I assumed that by clicking on the 'Covert to mobile optimised format' this would reduce the size of the music files and they would then fit onto my mobile.....my phone memory is only 7.98MB and 3.88MB is already used by general
 mobile contacts etc.....so at the moment I can only basically fit 1 music file onto my mobile. What am I doing wrong?

            I have most of my music tracks in .M4A format, which is the highest compression rate that can be used and the tracks seem to vary from 1.0 MB to 1.8 MB mostly depending the lenght of the song (from 3+ mins to 5 mins).<br />
<br />
So if you have 3 MB free, you really don't have too much chance to put many songs to the phone, you need to buy a microSD memory card and put that to your phone.<br />

            I had an update for the mobile. Some Critical update to fix random booting issue. But after the update, for sometime, it was working fine. Then the issue started while I was using WhatsApp. The mobile booted automatically and went on as I mentioned above.

            <p>Ok, I can think of two neat possible ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First question is when they select an option, do you create one record for a given option, or do several records need to be created for one selection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, if they select 3 options, do you need/want to create 3 records?</p>
<p>If you can answer yes to above, then we can simple this code quite a bit. What I would do is create a table with the possible selections in it. Add a "select" button (or maybe a check box – ore on this idea later).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they hit select, then you create the new record. In other words, records are created DURING the selection process, not after in some loop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could even consider I suppose showing the selected items in a listbox on that form (or even perhaps a check box that shows what records they selected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what road will depend on if a single selection is to create one record as opposed to a single selection having to create more than one record (the second possibility would be rather challenging to accomplish).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you answer yes to the single record issue, then we can pursue the solution further (ie: using a select button or a check box – not sure which approach is better based on info so far).</p>

<h2>            Mail Merge Queries saved to csv file &#124; Using Mail Merge as Pseudo data base</h2>
                    Back in the ancient days we would use Word Star the first "word" program offering mail merge but use it to "sort" data files and save the "sorted" data as a csv file. &nbsp; Mail Merge has all the power needed to sort data files but I find no help in saving
 the result to a csv file as opposed to using the result to insert data into a document. &nbsp;Can the resulted query be saved to a csv file and, if so, how is that done?

<p>In what application was the data source created? &nbsp;You may be able to open it with Excel and then save it as a csv file from that application (after sorting if necessary in Excel)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if you cannot do that, if you use the data source with a Directory type mail merge main document in which you have a one row table into the cells of which you insert the merge fields and then you execute the merge to a new document, that document will
 contain a table with one row of data for each record in the data source. &nbsp;You can then copy that table and paste it into Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, in the Directory type main document, separate the mergefields with a comma (enclosed the fields in double quotes if the data contains commas), and after executing the merge, save the file as a plain text file (*.txt)</p>

<h2>            Upon re-opening a saved Word doc, my tables have shifted--mostly with additional spacing</h2>
                    <p>I am currently working on a 100+ page document that includes many tables. When I saved it yesterday, everything was in place. I then saved it as a PDF (which captured all the tables as they should look). I then closed the document. (It seems to be happening
 NOT when I SAVE it, but when I CLOSE it.) When I opened the Word doc this morning, all the tables have shifted--mostly with weird spacing and font size changes. This has happened multiple times. Previously, I was able to use an autosaved draft. Now it says
 there are no autosaved drafts. (I think because I CLOSED it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c173f92b-858a-4fa8-8cc0-76eb529fcc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c173f92b-858a-4fa8-8cc0-76eb529fcc26" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But it shifts to this (which then spills over to the next page.)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e28033e4-8e04-4376-8acc-eb622db30c23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e28033e4-8e04-4376-8acc-eb622db30c23" /></a></p>

            <p>Okay, so the problem is not styles updating. Certainly using paragraph spacing rather than empty paragraphs is always preferable, though I don't see how the empty paragraphs would cause the problem you're seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to check is whether Word is autofitting the table to the text. On the
<strong>Layout</strong> tab of the <strong>Table Tools</strong>, in the <strong>Cell Size</strong> group, click
<strong>AutoFit</strong> and choose <strong>Fixed Column Width</strong>. This will prevent Word from resizing cells to fit the text.</p>

<p>I am having issues with Outlook 2016 crashing (10-20 times per day).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook will crash and restart automatically (most frequently when it is just running in the background and occasionally when I am actually working in outlook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From looking at Task Manager &nbsp;Outlook is consuming 40-50% of the CPU capacity and initially 100-200MB of memory but the memory increases to 1500+MB just before it crashes.</p>

<p>I checked the refresh time but it as already set at 30 mins and the google&nbsp;sync is really what was driving the refresh in outlook anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking at the logs from google&nbsp;sync - it is possible that the pst file was corrupted so I deleted&nbsp;my pst file, and reinstalled the 64 bit version of Outlook (previous was 32 bit). Additionally, I reinstalled google sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this appears to have resolved the issue.</p>

</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded a trial version of Microsoft Office Power Point program a few months ago and paid $10.66 to use it for the first month.</div>
<div>The program became no longer available after the first month of paying, however, MSFT office kept charging me $10.66 each month even though I cannot use the program anymore.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I tried to search everywhere on the menus to figure out how to cancel the payment but I still don't know where to go...</div>
<div>Can someone please help me cancel the payment?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

    <title>Continuous SPAM from Yahoo.com domain delivered to Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kms1970  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continuous SPAM from Yahoo.com domain delivered to Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I continue to receive the same SPAM emails in my inbox even though I mark them as JUNK again and again.</p>
<p>These emails are clearly JUNK but Hotmail continues to allow them through every day !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example here are a few common themes that show up nearly every day:<br />
Choice Home Warranty</p>
<p>ShadowHawk flashlight</p>
<p>Medicare for Seniors</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sender email addresses are clearly SPAM, but Hotmail is choosing to allow them through. Why is this??</p>
<p>Here is the latest address: "Choice Home Warranty" *************</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even tried setting up a Rule to send particular words to JUNK, but those Rules never work. Hotmail can't even get that right. It's as if the Hotmail team is determined to force us to look at these ridiculous emails again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even identified these emails as a Phishing Scam, but even that doesn't help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get at least 25 Junk emails a day correctly sent to the Junk folder, so why can't these problem emails be sent there??</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course, Hotmail doesn't allow the Yahoo.com domain to be labeled as JUNK. If I want to send all Yahoo email addresses to JUNK then I should be allowed to do that. It's my choice. So it seems that Hotmail is quite aware of this marketing scheme and
 has chosen to allow it. Apparently Hotmail is getting a fee for each marketing email delivered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the Hotmail team doing this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who can fix this???</p>

            <p>There are two problems with your recommendation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First... I can spend everyday adding new domains to a rule, but what's the point??? These obvious spam emails continue to flow into my inbox because the spammers just create a new domain each day.</p>
<p>And Hotmail continues to allow the same emails through!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, these are all common spam messages that Hotmail continues to allow through. I've include a few of the domains so you can see how ridiculous they are. All the spammers need to do is create a new domain and then send out the exact same email they
 always do since they know Hotmail isn't filtering them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second...&nbsp; Yahoo.com is a common domain used by spammers. I've received the same emails repeatedly even though I've identified them as Junk.&nbsp; And the Hotmail rules don't allow me filter the yahoo.com domain. I will try a rule and see if that works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>no email subject&nbsp; [ @orange.fr ]<br />
Brain Power Tactics&nbsp; [@ yahoo.com ]</p>
<p>Brain Restoration&nbsp; [@ yahoo.com ]</p>
<p>Falcon Flashlight&nbsp; [@ yahoo.com ]</p>

<p>Dewalt Tools&nbsp; [ @egmont.se ]</p>
<p>Home Warranty&nbsp; [@ yahoo.com ]</p>
<p>Amazon&nbsp; [ @feelpersonal.com ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So instead of asking each Hotmail user to be there own Spam filter and Rule creator, why doesn't Hotmail just do it for all of us??</p>

    <title>Hotmail attachments &#40;again&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfm_nbpt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail attachments &#40;again&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Just picked up a new Samsung Blackjack II running Windows Mobile 6 Standard.&nbsp; On my old phone (Razr running Symbian), I could access Hotmail just fine and was able to attach files to my messages.&nbsp; Not so with the
 new device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All postings I've read have a very vague resolution: "use Windows Live".&nbsp; Well, I am accessing my Hotmail account via the "Windows Live" menu selection on the device.&nbsp; The URL is mobile.live.com.&nbsp; I've even attempted to sign out and sign in
 again clicking on the "Hotmail Mobile" advertisement on the top of the MSN screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it appears I am using Windows Live, yet there is no menu option enabling the use of attachments.&nbsp; Any guidance would be appreciated, as ATT Customer Service is of little use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI it took 20 seconds to download Yahoo! Go and begin using their email system, WITH attachments.&nbsp; I was hoping that moving to a Windows Mobile platform would provide tighter integration with other Microsoft products.</p>

<p>Also, from the Search page I had the option to go "Home".&nbsp; I clicked on it, and rather than bringing me back to that new blank (white) screen, it brought me to the MSN screen I was presented with prior to the download.&nbsp; I selected Hotmail, attempted
 to create a new message, and still no option for including attachments.</p>

<p>Still no luck.&nbsp; Signed out of MS Live on the PC.&nbsp; Signed out of MS Live on the phone.&nbsp; Rebooted the phone.&nbsp; Signed back in on the phone and same deal: no ability to use attachments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have the sneaking suspicion that I am doing something incorrect or possibly asking the wrong question.&nbsp; The release notes talk about "syncing" the inbox and contacts.&nbsp; I have no interest in downloading my Hotmail inbox to my phone (what's
 the point?!).&nbsp; All I am trying to do is access Hotmail in the same manner as I did with that&nbsp;crude Symbian OS, which enabled me to use Attachments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other thoughts / ideas is much appreciated.</p>

            Using your browser to access hotmail won't let you attach files to new email. The only way to do that is through Windows Live. And for that you need to configure Hotmail on your device. Doing this lets you access your Hotmail on the Go. For me, that's
 one of the reason for which I purchase a Windows Mobile device. That's what mobility is all about.

<p>Exactly the reason I too purchased a Windows Mobile device.&nbsp; It is just baffling to me that Yahoo!'s mobile mail works perfectly &amp; completely out of the box under MS Mobile, yet MS Hotmail does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The software still does not work (spinning color wheel and then failure to connect).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I did not try in the release notes is clearing out my inbox, but I can't imagine that this is the problem (yet),&nbsp;because the Windows Live software isn't even allowing me to sign in to get things configured....</p>

            Do you have a PC that is connected to the internet? If yes, connect your device to that PC. Of course Activesync or WMDC needs to be installed. You do need to establish a partnership, even though it does not matter if you already have one. Your device
 should be able to use your computer's connection to access the internet. Try to sign in to Windows Live with your device connected. See if that makes a difference.

    <title>Security Essentials super-set to Defender&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzzedword  say:</h3>
<h2>            Security Essentials super-set to Defender&#63;</h2>
                    My understanding of Security Essentials is that it is a super-set to Windows Defender, as in similar to Onecare, Security Essentials provides a Defender "upgrade" or plugin, and replaces the engine. From what I can tell with Security Essentials, yes it
 does replace the Defender engine, it does provide virus and malware protection, but I don't see anything that implies a super-set: all those neat little Defender options like the software explorer are nowhere to be found. Really, the only thing I found "from
 Defender" was the option to enroll in SpyNet and really... that's just expected of Security Essentials. Forgive my facetiousness.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love Security Essentials and what it offers. It is truly phenomenal. I'm giving it a full torture test on a virtual machine with UAC turned off, no additional antivirus, no firewall enabled, and a wonderful macro script to scour the dark
 corners of the internet and accept all downloads, activex, plugins, and scripts on IE6. To my absolute shock, Security Essentials eradicated everything that script could find, and further to my surprise, detected my own macro as a virus. Not even Norton, AVG,
 and Panda could do that feat-- and they're pay services. I honestly congratulate MS.<br />
<br />
The only suggestion I could have is to bring the Software Explorer features of Defender into Security Essentials. As a stand-alone program, Security Essentials really sets a high bar. But as a proposed super-set, it is lacking because all it has done is disable
 Defender. Keep up the amazing, incredible work, and I look forward to seeing the final product.

Hi, Buzzedword.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials is an antivirus software, not an anti-spyware software.&nbsp; Although MSE also detects spyware, it is not a replacement for Windows Defender.&nbsp; So, please do not run a second A/V software with MSE.&nbsp; Otherwise, you may experience conflicts.&nbsp;
 Note on the MMPC Portal that MSE has the same definitions as Microsoft Forefront Client Security
<span>Antivirus</span> :&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/default.aspx</a> .&nbsp;
<p>As you can see in the report by <span><span style="font-style: italic">Computerworld</span> , independent testing results by
<a href="http://www.av-test.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AV-Test.org</a> indicated that M</span> icrosoft Security Essentials (MSE) antivirus software passed a preliminary antivirus exam with flying colors.</p>
<blockquote>"<a href="http://www.av-test.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AV-Test GmbH</a> tested Microsoft Security Essentials, the free software Microsoft launched yesterday in beta, on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7, putting it up against nearly 3,200 common
 viruses, bot Trojans and worms, said Andreas Marx, one of the firm's two managers. The malware was culled from the most recent WildList, a list of threats actually actively attacking computers.<br />
<br />
'All files were properly detected and treated by the product," said Marx in an e-mail. "That's good, as several other [antivirus] scanners are still not able to detect and kill all of these critters yet.' "</blockquote>
<br />
Thus, unlike Windows Defender, which essentially dealt with spyware and PUPs (potentially unwanted programs), MSE additionally provides protection from viruses, trojans and rootkits.

            The only suggestion I could have is to bring the Software Explorer features of Defender into Security Essentials.<br />
<br />
While MSSE is running&nbsp;I&nbsp;start Defender in Vista, go to setting &amp;&nbsp;disable auto scanning - and use the Software Browser.<br />
Then exit Defender when I'm done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Simple.&nbsp; It only uses the GUI while its open.

            Adding to what the others here have already mentioned, MSE is a new interface for the Microsoft antivirus and antispyware engines, built from the ground up to be simple to use and as minimal in use of PC resources as possible.&nbsp; It's only relationship to
 Defender is that it uses the same spyware&nbsp;definitions/engine and thus it disables the Defender interface when installed to avoid any conflict.<br />
<br />
Since&nbsp;a primary reason for the creation of MSE is to minimize both the configuration and the resource usage, I doubt we'll see many additional controls added unless they are found to be absolutely necessary.&nbsp; Efficient operation on both netbooks and limited
 resource PCs sold in emerging markets (international) is a primary goal.&nbsp; Controls such as those you are requesting are being left to either the operating system or other tools like Defender or third-party products, since MSE is keyed to the "set-and-forget"
 crowd, not the techno-fiddler.<br />
<br />
The problem Microsoft is trying to resolve is basic protection for the ~60% of PC users who have outdated (lapsed subscriptions) or no antimalware protection&nbsp;installed at all.&nbsp; They have no interest in competing with other more feature filled products or complicating
 a product they will be providing free in any way that might add to the support burden.<br />

<blockquote>[MSE] disables the Defender interface when installed to avoid any conflict...<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
FYI, I just installed MSE v1.0.1407.0 (having downloaded/saved the installer on 23 June) in WinXP SP3. After doing so (and updating defs), I found that Windows Defender&nbsp;had been&nbsp;removed/installed, not disabled,&nbsp;and that the&nbsp;contents of its Program Folder had
 been removed. YMMV.<br />
<br />
QED: Will uninstalling MSE restore Defender? (I'd very much doubt it.)

<p>Yes, that's correct.&nbsp; I don't recall if I knew this when I posted my earlier&nbsp;response to this thread, though I did discover it fairly early on.<br />
<br />
This actually isn't surprising, since this has been the recommendation for those installing Windows Live OneCare since it was released.&nbsp; Since Windows Defender wasn't shipped with Windows XP, it's not native within that OS, so an uninstall has been the recommendation
 from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt there is any automated method to reinstall Defender.<br />
<br />
Rob<br />
<br />
&lt; EDIT &gt;&nbsp; I believe the reason for the complete uninstall with Windows XP might be related to the original Beta version.&nbsp; Though that version ended support years ago, it can lie dormant in the background until something that conflicts with it is installed.&nbsp;
 The uninstall&nbsp;from Windows XP will completely avoid this problem if it exists and always require a&nbsp;fresh installation of Windows Defender once MSE has been removed.&nbsp; I&nbsp;suspect that few&nbsp;users would ever return to the Defender only state once they've installed
 MSE anyway.<br />
<br />
THough it might seem to&nbsp;be a good idea to notify the user that this has occured, we've often seen in the OneCare forums that the greatest number of users are simply confused by such information, especially in a case where they might not even be aware that Windows
 Defender was already present.&nbsp; This could easily occur in cases such as a PC which has been sold or is a hand-me-down.</p>

Defender can't be uninstalled from either Vista or Windows 7, it's embedded in the operating system and so must be disabled.<br />

I aslo need to disable it.<br />
However I am required to it using command line.<br />
When I tried ... <br />
(in the command prompt window)<br />
<br />
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v "DisableAntiSpyware" /t REG_DWORD /d "00000001" /f</p>

Error Editing Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot edit DisableAntiSpyware. Error writing the value's new contents.<br />

So guys, any way out of here?<br />

<p>You’ll notice that the link you referred to has an option called “Ask the Community” that sends right back here :-&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drag and dropping events between windows should be supported indeed. Not sure whether this is a bug or a limitation though.</p>
<p>What version of Outlook are you using&nbsp;johndeed?</p>
<p>If you are in the Insider Fast track, you might consider reporting the issue using the Help menu to contact Microsoft directly from there and make sure they are aware of the issue.</p>

<p>That’s virtually an antique ;-)</p>
<p>It’s about two years old. You might want to try and update Outlook. You can find the auto-updater int he Help menu.</p>

<p>Thanks Corentin. It was set to automatically update, but it wasn't up to date. &nbsp;It's now updated to 15.35 (170610). &nbsp;I have subsequently tried to move appointments between weeks in two separate windows and it still doesn't work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts?</p>

<p>Then it obviously is a limitation in Outlook. The only thing you can really do at this point is to post a message on UserVoice to get the attention of MS.</p>
<p>You can also try installing the Insider Fast builds (β versions — you have an option to do so in the Auto-Updater) and if the issue persists there, you can use the Help menu to report it straight to them by opening up a ticket about it.</p>

<h2>            Stuck on build 9879</h2>
                    <p>I have build 9879. It's working OK, no major problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it refuses to update. Updater will show "New preview build". I choose "Download now", and nothing happens. There is just that annoying windmill spinning. One time I got an error message 0x8024001E .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Fix problems With Windows update. &nbsp;And get "potential Windows update database error 0x80070490" and "Windows update Components must be fixed", both of the appearantly gets fixed. If I run it again it will find and fix the same problems again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried stopping and starting the updater components one by one, but it did not help, the updater is simply not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is working fairly well else - no connection problems or anything. (However, I'm in China, and the Internet here is a mess at the moment!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Email Page in OneNote Delayed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meredith townsend  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Page in OneNote Delayed</h2>
                    <p>The Email Page funtion in OneNote is very delayed. I will email a page, doesn't matter if it is to a group or a single person, but it will not send until hours or even days later and then they will all go through at one time. Most of the time you don't think
 it sent and if you send again, multiples of that email will eventually be sent. I didn't have this problem til a few weeks ago. We have tried logging in and out and yes I have internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other thoughts?</p>
