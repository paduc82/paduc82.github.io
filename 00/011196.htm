    <title>Can&#39;t paste images into Word 2010 from IE - Proxy issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t paste images into Word 2010 from IE - Proxy issue</h2>
                    Had an issue in my organisation where Word (and other Office applications) would present an error message when copying an image from IE and pasting it into Word 2010. The error was due to our proxy server using basic authentication without SSL. I enabled
 basic authentication for Office applications using the advice in this KB:<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2123563<br />
<br />
Now, when attempting to paste images, I don't get the error message. I get nothing. There is a split second "loading" mouse cursor, but the image still isn't pasted in to Word. When I switch the proxy to an un-authenticated proxy, the image pastes correctly.<br />
<br />
Hoping someone can shine some light on the subject.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

            Does your company allow use of other browsers?&nbsp; Every browser has different approaches to the many technologies that contribute to the internet. Simply using a different broswer can "fix" problems.<br />
<br />
Your simplest fix may be to use an alternate browser. That is what I do. I normally use FireFox and keep it locked down. If I have a problem viewing or doing something I switch over to IE.&nbsp; Often the problem is resolved without any further effort.&nbsp; You could
 try going the other way, from IE to an alternate browser.<br />

<h3> outofpark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom rule in outlook returns &#34;rules in error&#34; dialog box saying &#34;the operation failed&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>I have written a custom VB for application script that processes the body of an email
</p>
<p>message and saves an attachment from the email to disk. Microsoft Outlook 2007</p>
<p>intermittently throws up the "Rules in error" dialog box indicating "the operation failed".</p>
<p>This results in my rule being disabled by Outlook. When I then run the rule manually,</p>
<p>all is processed without error.</p>
<p>The script is called from a rule. The rule is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apply this rule after the message arrives</p>
<p>from &lt;my email address&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with &lt;specific text&gt; in the subject</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on this machine only</p>
<p>run &lt;my custom VBA script&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and stop processing more rules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My script first Dims some variables and then opens a log file. If an error is encountered when&nbsp;opening</p>
<p>the log file, the script will throw up a MsgBox. If an error is encountered after the log file is opened
</p>
<p>successfully the error is logged to the logfile. My attempts to catch an error in my script have failed.</p>
<p>The only error I ever get is Rules in error; the operation failed. It appears that the error is occuring</p>
<p>prior to my script being called. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening? Is it problematic to split the processing</p>
<p>between the rule and the script? By this I mean the rule checks for certain criteria and if the criteria</p>
<p>are met, only then is my script called. Thank you for any ideas you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Outlook 2010 by default creates seperate data files for each mail account, ie seperate Inbox/Sent etc</p>
<p>It also depends how you have configered the gmail account, ie pop or imap</p>
<p>If pop the mail accounts can be configered to use the same data file</p>

    <title>My Nokia E7-00 Belle update - the good, the bad, and the not so good - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t9rfbb  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Nokia E7-00 Belle update - the good, the bad, and the not so good</h2>
                    
<p>Late last night I installed Belle on my E7-00 Anna.&nbsp; It was a completely hands-off install using the USB cable connected to my PC.&nbsp; It took about 15 minutes with multiple restarts of the phone all done by the software update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 12MB Internet connection (or so my service provider claims) and a UPS backup to reduce the chance of failure due to a poor Internet connection or untimely power outage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update was uneventful and the update software did perform a backup before the actual update began.&nbsp; I did do a backup myself of the Anna install before doing the Belle update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I am technically very experienced and competent with Windows based computer hardware and software,&nbsp; I don't consider myself particularly knowledgeable in cell phone technology.&nbsp; So I was glad to see the update go smoothly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, all was not peaches and cream after the update completed.&nbsp; Once I started to use the phone I found that many, though not all, of additional application I had downloaded under Anna were no longer on the phone.&nbsp; Also, many settings were gone as well
 such as my WLAN settings, and later I found all my Favorites gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent a couple of hours going through all the menus reorganizing the interface and the various options to get the phone in what I consider to be a usable state.&nbsp; These things are made so that one can optimize to suit ones needs and I take advantage of
 that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm disappointed that I had to spend so much time and effort doing this (actually redoing what had been done in Anna) and feel that the update should have, and could have, kept many of my settings.&nbsp; I understand that the new widgets and home screens meant
 a re-jigging of those things but, for example, why did I have to re-enter all the WLAN settings required to connect to my home router, including a very long security string? More below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad that I did the update in spite of all the time and trouble to get everything working again and to suit my personal preferences.&nbsp; I suspect a lot of users who have less experience than I in these things will be seeking help to get all their phone
 features working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be useful to explain how I use my phone.&nbsp; This is my 6th or 7th cell phone and I'm on my second cell service provider (about 8 years).&nbsp; I have had cell phones continuously ever since they were small enough to carry on one's belt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a power user.&nbsp; I use the camera occasionally for recording information.&nbsp; I don't download music for listening but occasionally listen to music from the Internet via WLAN.&nbsp; I have not sent more than about a dozen text message in my life, though I
 have unlimited texting in my cell service package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my cell phone mostly for business calls.&nbsp; I do not have any data service from my service provider.&nbsp; I tried the data service for about 3 months but found that I used it very little.&nbsp; I don't have a Twitter account (thinking about it) nor a Facebook
 account (and not thinking about it) so other than the rare instance to search the Internet for some information (when not near my own WLAN connection) I found little use for it.&nbsp; Data service here in Canada is one of the most expensive of any country (or so
 I have seen reported on the Internet).&nbsp; So I decided to save the money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do all of my email at my office or at home on desktop PCs with big screens and full size keyboards.&nbsp; Occasionally I connect to my home WLAN with my phone to check email or to check for updates to the phone software.&nbsp; But I don't like to do much typing
 on the phone keyboard, even though it is really a very good keyboard for a cell phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do use the map/GPS feature regularly and think it is one of the best I've used.&nbsp; I've gone through about five stand-alone GPS units which gives me some reference for comparison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not much of a game player, never have been, even on my computer.&nbsp; I do have Angry Birds because it was free, and it is nice once in awhile to have something to occupy time when waiting at a doctors office or for a haircut, etc. and all the newspapers
 and magazines are old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here are things that I especially like about the new Nokia (Symbian) Belle software update:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the clock screen saver (I use the digital version rather than the analog display) because I can quickly look at my phone without having to unlock it and see the time/date (I've stopped wearing a watch).&nbsp; It is also a great nightstand clock and alarm.&nbsp;
 With the Light Bar app installed it is not too bright for sleeping but visible when needed.&nbsp; I suspect though that it is sucking a lot of battery power and I may have to disable the clock screen saver if battery charging is too frequent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user interface is very good.&nbsp; It is terribly easy to add or remove widgets and move them around on the home screen to suit ones needs.&nbsp; The bar across the bottom makes accessing the applications menu, phone dialer, or options menu extremely quick and
 easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pull down connectivity menu is superb.&nbsp; With one touch I can turn on or off my Bluetooth, which I use with my car hands-free feature everyday.&nbsp; Turning Bluetooth often when not need saves power.&nbsp; With three taps of the screen I can connect to my home
 router, or disconnect with one tap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new capability that I now have and wished for previously on my E7 (but couldn't figure out how to do) is being able to put my phone in Off-line mode and still use the WLAN feature.&nbsp; This is great in the evening at home when I don't want to be connected
 to my cell phone provider, but I do want to look up something quickly on the Internet without going to my desktop PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>After the Belle update I found that I still had the following applications (originally installed in Anna) still available on the phone:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; Angry Birds</li><li>&nbsp; US and Canada Maps plus voice guidance</li><li>&nbsp; App Stop Camera Lover Pack (multiple apps)</li><li>&nbsp; Opera Mini</li><li>&nbsp; Sticky Notes</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is a list of software and setting that were no longer on the phone after the Belle update:</strong></p>

<p>Since I have had the Belle update for less than 24 hours I am certain that there is more for me to discover.&nbsp; But I thought it may be useful to provide this experience report as a heads-up for those about to do the same.&nbsp; And now I will have to update my
 E6-00.</p>

<p>My E7-00 has been rendered unusable thus far by the update. During the final portion of the install, I was greeted by a plesant "somethings wrong" error in Nokia Suite. After clicking the okay button it brought up a "Installing Support Software" message,
 which also failed. The phone still seems to work, but its <strong>extrodinarily</strong>&nbsp;slow. Restarting (several times) did nothing to help, nothing seems to be running in the background. About 40 minutes ago I opened the Store application which prompted
 for an update. The update is still running, the progress bar just hit the 2/3rds mark on the preparing installation dialog box...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update went smoothly on my N8 last night, unfortunately the E7 is my primary phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the plus side, the game Slice It! seems to have survived the transition on my E7, it vanished on my N8 and now seems to be completely missing from the store.</p>

<p>Since my first post about my update from Anna to Belle on my E7 (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/4A368AC0-A942-401E-A246-6347302D9F1B">/t5/Software-Updates/My-Nokia-E7-00-Belle-update-the-good-the-bad-and-the-not-so-good/m-p/1301411)</a>
 I have tried to get Nokia to resolve some issues, so far without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I am asking Nokia to recover the many map Favorites which were lost during the Belle update.&nbsp; It would take a lot of flying and traveling thousands of kilometers to get those GPS locations back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a full backup just minutes prior to the Belle update, so I believe that all the data is still there in the (Anna) backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Belle update I did <em><strong>not</strong></em> lose my contacts, calendar, notes, messages, photos, music, videos, maps, or voice guidance files, therefore it seems to me that the map favorites should have been retained as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly I don't understand why <em><strong>any</strong></em> settings or data should have been lost during the Belle update.&nbsp; I did not loose any data when I did the Anna update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data I lost, such as WIFI settings, Favorites, startup text message and many settings do not require any significant file space for backup and are all text files.&nbsp; Saving and reinstalling such data after the Belle update should have been a no-brainer
 for the Nokia Belle programmers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Belle update FAQ</p>
<p><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/nokia-belle-update/nokia-belle-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/nokia-belle-update/nokia-belle-update-faq</a></p>
<p>does not mention the loss of map Favorites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Belle update FAQ has other misinformation, such as "All apps are deleted on Nokia Belle ...&nbsp;please reinstall them via Nokia Store."&nbsp; This is not correct information.&nbsp; As mentioned in my first post some of the applications I had downloaded and installed
 from the OVI store into Anna were still there after the Belle update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have decided to wait a long time before updating my Nokia E6-00 to Belle as I don't want to have all these hastles again.&nbsp; Perhaps things will be fixed in a couple of months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some really good things about the Belle update, but the problems make it difficult to enjoy them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am supposed to get a reply back from a second level tech.&nbsp; I will post it if the information is useful.</p>

<p>If you never sync'ed the favorites with the Ovi/Nokia online service, then I'm afraid it is lost. Otherwise the Maps favorites and routes&nbsp;should appear after sync:</p>
<p>1: Open Maps&nbsp;(the one with the compass needle)</p>
<p>2: Click the magnifier icon in the bottom line</p>
<p>3: Click the star icon at upper right</p>
<p>4:&nbsp;Click the&nbsp;round double arrow icon at bottom middle</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback hpholm.<br />
<br />
I hope that you are very wrong about having to sync with OVI online services.&nbsp; I have never done that.&nbsp; Nowhere have I seen that as a requirement to store all the data on my phone.&nbsp; And as I said, I do not pay for a data service with my cell provider and only
 connect my phone to the Internet through my home or work router, or through my PC via USB cable. So syncing to a remote site is not attractive to me.<br />
<br />
My impression from Nokia on-line information is that the Nokia Suite application, which runs on my PC, backs up my phone - everything.&nbsp; Where is the logic in backing up everything
<em>except</em> my map Favorites.&nbsp; Why would those be an exception?<br />
<br />
Additionally, I am not interested in having to backup my confidential information to someone else's server where (in my opinion) I have less security than on my own PC (I do tech support and know how to lock down a computer).<br />
<br />
Also, in most cases when one puts information on someone else's server, especially a free service from the like of Google, Facebook, Twitter, (might I suggest Nokia?) etc.&nbsp; one loses control and rights to that information.&nbsp; I'm unwilling to do that simply because
 someone else thinks it is good for me to do.&nbsp; Ha!<br />
<br />
Nothing is truly free.&nbsp; You pay somehow.&nbsp; These service aren't there because they are altruistic.&nbsp; How many billions is the IPO for Facebook worth?&nbsp; Gotta be a reason.&nbsp; All that information that people put there about themselves and others is the reason.<br />
<br />
I doubt Facebook would pay me anything to put personal info on their site.&nbsp; I assume most people would think me a bit loony to expect it.<br />
<br />
In any event, though there is a lot to like about the Belle update, there are a lot of unnecessary complications, with no warnings!<br />
<br />
As I read the posts about peoples experiences with the Belle update I'm seeing a lot of disappointment.&nbsp; From my experience in computing hardware, software and network support it is my opinion that the Belle update was rushed and was done in a less than professional
 manner.<br />
<br />
From what I've been reading, people who have updated to Belle have generally expected it to be near perfect and hassle free, and many are really disappointed.&nbsp; The end experience with the Anna update was much better in my opinion.&nbsp; Not good for Nokia customer
 relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia customer loyalty easily rivaled that of Apple.&nbsp; But that has been seriously damaged with things like trashing Memo, going with the MS Windows phone OS, and a disappointing Belle update for all those expensive Nokia smart phones.&nbsp; Kinda dumb.<br />
<br />
I suspect that most if not all of the first line developers have been pulled off Symbian to do development work on the Windows phone OS.&nbsp; The missing or incomplete bits and pieces in Belle, plus some gratuitous changes suggest less then experienced software
 developers working on Belle.<br />
<br />
Enough grousing.&nbsp; I just hope that things get fixed, but I'm feeling very pessimistic right now.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind being proved wrong.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting point you bring to discussion and I'm so agree with you about our own privacy. That's something all Android / Google and Facebook users must take in it's real perspective. Google will start from march 1st to cross user profiles
 and information (officially at least, if they're not doing that right now unofficially) and Facebook is doing something just like that with their "Timeline", but Google is worst because it will even take a log of all the user calls (numbers called, time, location,
 etc.).</p>
<p>Europe has stopped Google somehow with this privacy policy modifications but in the rest of the world our consumers defense is not so good and they're doing as they please.</p>
<p>If this is where they're going I'm very well far away from them and sincerely hope Nokia is not going that way at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

            my widows 10 is just fine before installing kb3074681. after I installed it I noticed my laptop and system is a bit laggy now. kb3074681 caused a major crash in explorer and control panel whenever I uninstall the said update. it also affects my system,
 it started to a bit of glitch in start menu and Cortana just like in a previous builds. this kb3074681&nbsp;is a useless update to my laptop.&nbsp;I removed the update using command prompt. and it&nbsp;went fine now.&nbsp;now Microsoft should stop sending updates which will cause
 the users laptop or windows to bug down. it will only cause a bug.

<h2>            Cannot install Office Home &#38; Student 2019</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem activating my copy of Microsoft Office 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep receiving this :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ef188e8-7d75-4712-809e-22eb67b30c3b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ef188e8-7d75-4712-809e-22eb67b30c3b?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>It is in french, but it basically says that my&nbsp;product key has been activated the maximum number of times. I bought my new laptop about a month ago and also purchased the full permanent Office 2019 with it. I have only ever installed it on my recently purchased
 laptop ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the product key and everything, I don't see why I should have any problems activating it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried and followed the steps and instructions on how to activate Office 2019 in the support section but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated, thank you.</p>
<p>

            Sounds like your profile got corrupted. In the link below:

    <title>Onenote for MAC has crashed yet again - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Onenote for MAC has crashed yet again</h2>
                    <p>Onenote for MAC app crashes immediately on opening and giving error report. Have looked through countless threads and tried to resolve. Last time this happened was unable to fix and had to erase the entire hard drive and lost 8 months worth of study notes.
 Please help I have an entire semester of notes and looming exams, this is very unneeded. The online version is working but is incredibly clunky to use. I have uninstalled and re-installed, cleared cache deleted folders but still no luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Keiran,<br />
<br />
We need to check the <strong>Show Library Folder</strong> option to find the Library &gt; Containers folder. The steps are included in the section
<strong>Remove files from your user Library folder</strong> of <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>.<br />
<br />
Please share any update after you try the steps in my previous reply.<br />
<br />
@Eli,<br />
<br />
Joanne was asking you to back up the two folders (<em>~/Library/Containers/</em> and
<em>~/Library/Group Containers/</em>) on your Mac. Deleting these two folder won’t affect you notebook content on OneNote Online.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, since similar issue may have different causes, we suggest you post a new thread with detailed description, and our related engineer will help you further.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing

I don't know if it is 32 bit?<br />
I don't quite understand about downloading IE 8 - or 9 or 10?&nbsp; If there is a 9 why would I want to download an 8?<br />
If I download another than 7 will 7 be uninstalled automatically?<br />

<h2>            Deleted Notebook ghosting in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I deleted a notebook named XXX. &nbsp;I closed via OneNote and deleted the file in OneDrive on my hard drive and I cleaned out the online Recycle Bin in OneDrive. &nbsp;Many weeks later I decided that I wanted to recreate a notebook using the same name. &nbsp;I received
 the error that a notebook with this name already exists. &nbsp;I've tried searching for this notebook online and on my hard drive; can't find it anywhere. &nbsp;Even OneNote says "all existing notebooks are open." &nbsp;Any ideas on how to remedy this dilemma? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />

                    <p>I followed the instructions on the upgrade.&nbsp; I had bought a Lenovo laptop at the end of the year, and also bought the Office 2010 with the free upgrade to Office 2013 when it came out.&nbsp; The upgrade left both 2010 and 2013 on the laptop.&nbsp; If I delete Office

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Video calling to work now, did work before</h2>
                    <p>Video calling was working, now not! (audio calling is still working)!..... I Check the things suggest in Tools setting&nbsp;(check share video with anyone and only on contact list), also downloaded latest version of Skype.....still no good.&nbsp;My camera is working,
 it shows my picture of me when I'm in front of it.&nbsp; When on the Skype page to make a call, the video camera icon is not lid up (and does not have a line through it either)&nbsp;like the audio icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When trying to make a video call I get&nbsp; popups that say&nbsp; "Invalid!",
 or" oop, something went wrong! "&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOPE SOMEONE HAS A ANSWER FOR ME !</p>

            It would help to have the exact error message.&nbsp; You supplied "invalid".&nbsp; Is the error "invalid window handle" or something else?

<h2>            Unable to connect my Nokia lumia 710 with zune</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually I got my data transfer according PC. However, the Nokia lumia 710 wp7.5 from Wind Mobile cannot connect to the computer. I tried to download Zune software which you suggest to sync the data to phone, but I still cannot access my Nokia phone,
 it stated "phone locked" each time I connect the phone to my computers; and my both laptop and desktop did not show any removal device in " my computer" also. Because of this locked phone, I cannot use any connection function?!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please anyone tell me the solution that I can fix this bug.<br />
<br />
phone manufacturer: somewhere in Korea<br />
Phone Model: Nokia lumia 710<br />
Phone Operator: Wind mobile Canada<br />
Phone OS: 7.10.8773.98<br />
Zune version: I cannot find the version, but it stated as latest version during update.<br />
Computer System version: Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition Version 2002 Service Pack 3<br />

            Ur answer is really impress me........all links without any solution. As I said not computer or software problem. For sure is the software SHOWs "phone locked" every time I connect to the phone- -, I try to find the device option in setting, it still stated
 that phone locked and cannot access the phone. If I dont use USB port, how can I connect my phone to computer? Pls read through before ANSWER my question pls. If your link can help me, I can solve the problem by search from the internet and no need to ask-

<p>Hi Didier,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, do you mean that you want to find the Check in (comment)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do it, you can find it in 
Version history.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the library or list and select the document you gave the comments.</li><li>Click the ellipses (…) next to the document.</li><li>Click <strong>Version History</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c17c8457-d75b-4514-83a7-c25012b85329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c17c8457-d75b-4514-83a7-c25012b85329" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Then you can find the comment there. End user can also find the comment in the Version History.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e993d2aa-4a4a-463e-8bb2-64be3ab36299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e993d2aa-4a4a-463e-8bb2-64be3ab36299" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above isn’t your scenario, could you help to further clarify the situation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Rodney</p>

<p>Hi Didier,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In your scenario, as a workaround, you may try using Alert Me feature to see if it can achieve your requirement.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Go to the SharePoint library and click go to the classic experience on the bottom left corner.</p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Then go to the top ribbon and click Files&gt;Alert Me&gt;Manage Alert&gt;Add Alert.</p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Choose the corresponding library.</p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Input the email address and User you want to receive emails which contain changes.</p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You will see the comments and any other changes in the link via the email notification.</p>
<p><span>Moreover, you can check this </span><a href="http://aspetraining.com/resources/blog/how-to-create-an-approval-workflow-sharepoint-2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>article</span></a><span> on how to create a workflow task approval. And since

<h3> laserray70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to edit a meeting forward notification&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I forward a meeting I have organized, Outlook sends an email notification to the new attendee and updates the meeting to include same. Great.</p>
<p>Now, the problem: the notfication that is sent is saved in my Sent Items folder as a new meeting, not as a message. Since it is a meeting, I cannot edit it like I can edit a message (don't ask me why I want to edit it, suffice it to say I want to edit it).
 The new meeting however is not on my calendar such that I can edit it from there, so essentially it is an uneditable message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know a way around this dilemma?</p>

            <p>Well, I though before that it wasn't possible, but your response prompted me to think more on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realized the only reason I couldn't edit the message was that I didn't have the edit message command on my ribbon. Duh, i added it and its fine. I had already added it to the ribbon for messages, but never though I would have to add it for meetings also.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably same is true for meeting response since it shows up as yet another type of item in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, thanks for responding!!!! Maybe this thread will help others too.</p>
