<h2>            Printing from the browser Microsoft word</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to print a document from the browser version of Word on a PC (with Windows 8), the actual printout is different from what I'm seeing on the screen, ie, the line spacing and character positioning change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be rectified?</p>

<p>Hi Ankh Rah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us.</p>
<p>By default, Word online uses a PDF reader to print document, you can try to click Open in Word, and print in the Word desktop app and see if it helps.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/differences-between-using-a-document-in-the-browser-and-in-word-3e863ce3-e82c-4211-8f97-5b33c36c55f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            You would have to look up the devices from the vendors and see.&nbsp; That is a long list!<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, I was reading yesterday that there are devies that have an accelerometer and do not use them ... yet.&nbsp; Not sure which ones though.

                    I have typed my resume and saved it, however, when I pull up the saved document, it shows the ribbon and toolbar that were on the screen when I originally typed.&nbsp; I want to send this to potential employers, but want it to look like a resume, not something
 I am typing.&nbsp; What to do? I don't know what commands to use in order to save the document without the word screen?

            Create a .PDF from the Word document and send that. Your prospective employer(s) will appreciate getting something that has no macros or other potentially debilitating content.

</p><p>I've heard nothing but crickets since I gave Ruth the data points she was looking for. &nbsp;I'm surprised that no one in the community has an answer on this, even it that answer is that the functionality doesn't exist in Outlook.com. &nbsp; This is even more challenging
 for me as I don't have a company email to refer to when I get the proposals from attendees. &nbsp;I need to contact them and ask them to tell me what their proposal was. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose Microsoft would just tell me to buy an O365 subscription if I want such "advanced" functionality.</p>

<h2>            WDMC 6.0, 6.1 with any Win Mobile using RNDIS connection.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WMDC driver files and how it uses it to register on VISTA is the wrost method. This issue is discussed over and over again. I have tested multiple windows mobile devices using the Advanced network functionality connection (RNDIS) and have failed.
 I am sure everyone out there is having this problem, if you check device manager your device will register as a Windows mobile remote adapter but fails to load the second set driver which is for the portable device (Mobile device). This is by far the wrost
 driver installation I have seen with microsoft software application. If they&nbsp;had left the drivers install for one device just like on XP with activesync would help all of us with sync related issues. So my question would be WHY DOES SYSTEM NOT LOAD THE SECOND
 SET DRIVERS FOR MOBILE DEVICE IN PORTABLE DEVICES? COULD THIS BE PROBLEM WITH IN THE OPERATING SYSTEM? IS THERE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT OR INSTALLED IN PC TO TRIGGER SECOND SET OF DRIVERS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I agree with you on that, all the troubleshooting steps which they have it posted does not help. Instead of fixing these problems they cause more issues in the system. Vista developers and WMDC developers needs to get their heads together and come up with
 a solution.

 I needed to pay $199 so he could remove the crcss.exe file from my computer because my email was being hacked.&nbsp; He then told me that he disconnected my computer from service for 2 hours until I decide what to do.&nbsp; I did not subscribe (needless to say).&nbsp;&nbsp; Also,
 when I am somewhere else other than on my laptop at home--I&nbsp;CAN open my emails.&nbsp; So what was that about??&nbsp; I am going to report him as soon as I can.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime,&nbsp; what is being done to help us open our emails??

Can you elaborate a little more as to what is happening?<br />

So does that mean you cannot access your provider to make a call or use the data plan?<br />

Not sure what you are saying here.&nbsp; Can you explain?<br />

September 2016 anti-malware platform update for Endpoint Protection clients</a> .

<p><span>"This anti-malware platform update contains the following improvements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Better support for Proxy Pac usage for Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) and Cloud-protection connectivity
<ul>
<li>Improved MAPS reliability and additional support to MAPS for proxy auto-configuration. Administrators can configure the URL of a proxy .pac file that System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP) or Windows Defender's MAPS reporting by setting the<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Define

</li><li>The Microsoft anti-malware platform previously introduced the Network Real-time Inspection (NRI) feature for augmenting the network detection capabilities of the anti-malware client. By default, the existing Network Inspection System feature was disabled
 because of the potential performance impact it may have on systems. This triggered an internal shift in investment to focus only on NRI capabilities and signatures. As there has not been an active NIS signature in more than five years, the capabilities and
 control surface for NIS are removed from Endpoint Protection with this update."</li></ul>

            <p>Thanks for the information on this, Morash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't mind the removal of the right-click scan option so much if - as reported by some users - it didn't also involve the removal of the right-click scan option on individual files etc by MBAM (and presumably by implication any other similar security
 program). Given those reports, I feel disinclined to install this particular MSE update. It would be good, however, to get a definitive answer from MS on all aspects of the update. I would much prefer to install any security update but not at the cost of losing
 functions across my security programs generally.</p>

<p>This is all just adding to the confusion here, since my earlier post about NIS in that thread was only regarding the removal of the controls&nbsp;to disable&nbsp;both it and other protection modules within MSE, not the NIS functionality itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that this new statement regarding NIS is stating is "the capabilities and control surface for NIS are removed from Endpoint Protection with this update."&nbsp; This may include MSE, but still doesn't matter since no one ever had any&nbsp;true control over the
 NIS module itself other than to disable it and it only operated if a current NIS signature was active (a rare occurrence) in any case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally doubt that the removal of the context menu right-click file scan option was intentional, especially if it also actually interferes with this same function in other products as some have indicated, since this sounds more like corruption during
 installation.&nbsp; It may have been a mistake, an oversight or even just unintended corruption as I just mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the only way we'll be certain is if an update to MSE is released which returns that functionality, so everything else here is just wasted effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real question is whether an individual user truly feels that they&nbsp;can't do without that feature, which several people have already explained can easily be resolved by uninstalling the new version and reinstalling the previous version from the official
 Microsoft download site, then using the Windows Update function to hide the MSE update from future install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a newer version of the MSE client is released, the new update package should automatically become visible, so actively monitoring this thread shouldn't be necessary.</p>

            <p>I agree regarding the Malwarebytes scan option&nbsp;Morash and the only reason I even considered it was because the source was Le Boule, whom I know personally.&nbsp; So far I haven't seen any confirmation from others&nbsp;so this was likely a coincidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing I forgot to mention while writing my last response is that&nbsp;someone could easily verify whether the Network Inspection System (NIS) still exists within the 4.10.205.0 version of MSE by selecting&nbsp;"About" from the down-arrow pull-down menu to
 the right of the Help on the MSE GUI page.&nbsp; The various MSE modules are all listed there including the engine and definitions versions for the Network Inspection System, so these shouldn't be displayed if it's been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again though, it really doesn't matter whether&nbsp;NIS is&nbsp;included in a client or not, since it won't operate unless Microsoft releases a new NIS signature, which according to that excerpt you provided hasn't occurred for a few years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find more interesting though is that Microsoft has chosen to release the MSE 4.10.x.x antimalware client version for the Windows 7 os platform, since my own Windows 8.1 system Defender still includes the 4.8.207.0 version of the antimalware client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think for a moment about this, the only two probable&nbsp;reasons for making the effort to update the antimalware client for these older platforms would be either the fact that some [set of] security threats have emerged which require this newer client
 or to make this client version consistent on the other platforms to simplify support.&nbsp; Since the capabilities of the definitions and engines are tied to the monitoring and other abilities within the antimalware client, the latter idea seems the most likely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the initial release of Windows Defender for Windows 8.1, the right-click context menu scan hasn't been available.&nbsp; However, with Windows 10 this feature has existed since at least&nbsp;the version I initially installed when I upgraded a system from Windows
 7 in late July 2016.&nbsp; So why this would be removed from Windows 7, but not the equivalent 4.10.14393.0 antimalware client in Windows 10 Defender is a bit inconsistent.</p>

<p>What I find interesting is the fact that those with MSE Prerelease (beta) still installed were offered the program update to v4.10.205.0 (or v4.10.205.10) on 27 Sept-16, too. Could the release of KB3193414 to MSE public build have been a goof?</p>

            <p><span>I uninstalled Malwarebytes Free from my Win 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reinstalled Malwarebytes Free and the right click option is back for Malwarebytes. &nbsp;Takes longer to load the program and a bit more complex of course than the
 ability to right click MSE and run a scan...no idea why MS changed that. &nbsp;Hasn't worried me enough (yet) to uninstall 4.10.205 to replace it with 4.9.218 since I seldom use the right click malware scan...I keep assuming MS will fix that anomaly with another
 update!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And I know "they" still haven't fixed it since I'm aware of 4.10.205 being downloaded on Friday from WU and sure enough - the right click option for MSE is
 no longer there after it has been installed and the computer hs been rebooted.</span></p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you
<br />
<br />If you have implemented a hybrid environment with Office 365 and have migrated some mailboxes to Office 365, you can do it the other way around with no problem.
<br />If you are referring to any other topic, please let me know so I can explain it with more details.

</p><p>For the EA you mentioned, if you mean the Microsoft Enterprise Agreement? And for moving desktops from office professional plus with SA on premises, would you mind providing more details about it? What's the SA you mentioned?</p>

Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I installed the Windows 10 Technical Preview (Build 9926) on my Surface Pro 3. I was not a part of the Windows Insider Program before that. After installation, my Surface has not worked for more than five minutes after which it restarts. During the five minutes
 the display keeps refreshing (becomes blank for like two seconds), the fan rotates at very high speeds and I am unable to do any work on it.</p>

My Surface has an i7 configuration.</p>

Any help will be appreciated. Thank you</p>

            I had the same issue. You need to uninstall the Intel HD 5000 graphics driver, and let it go back to the "Microsoft Basic Display Adaptor". You should now be stable, but have terrible performance. Then, run Windows Update and it should bring in the right
 driver.

<h2>            Power Point &#40;Office 365&#47;2016&#41; Looses transitions in video export</h2>
                    <p>Transitions do not translate to final video. The presentation displays correctly when reviewing the slide show from the beginning. &nbsp;I have done/tried the following...Saved presentation - File - export to MP4....no transitions. &nbsp;Export to Video - Publish

            <p>Sagnik must have an old copy of Google because that seems to be a different problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this isn't that helpful but it works OK here with Office 365 32 bit (2016) on a very basic laptop even with complex transitions like Orbit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically it looks like the problem is your PC maybe the Graphics Driver.</p>

            <p>Not sure who sagnik is .....but </p>
<p>if the PC is the problem specifically as you stated the graphics driver - why would it work properly until exported to video?</p>
<p>Secondly, If i create the video w/in Vegas (Which is much more taxing on the entire system than power point) it works fine. So with that being said - I have to lean toward not an issue w/ the computer on my end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to get the transitions to work (disable the acceleration within the options&gt;Advanced tab and check the disable slide show hardware graphics acceleration....</p>
<p>but the export / save as....is ridiculous as it takes forever. Again If i use vegas and render the file as an MP-4 it renders w/in minutes. It is not a tremendously large presentation - Less than 2 minutes and does not include any audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a little disappointed in the performance or lack there of and the amount of time expended trying to utilize power point or sway.</p>

            <p>What I meant was for whatever reason your graphics driver doesn't work well with PPT, this doesn't mean it's not powerful enough for e.g. Vegas. If it runs after disabling hardware graphics that would tend to reinforce this. Might be worth checking if the
 maker has an update.</p>

<p>No matter what fix I try from the microsoft site IE8 does not connect to secure sites. I've tried all the 8&nbsp;suggested methods without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have uninstalled IE8 and cleaned out the registry. then turned off the computer and later have reinstalled IE8 same result no way to connect to secure sites (https;//). I guess my only solution is to turn to other browser.</p>
<p>I have tried other brawsers and with those I can access the sites.</p>
<p>Any other solution?</p>

<p>I read all the KBs suggested but decided to Uninstall IE8 completely. Turn the computer off. Let it rest for a little while to drain the memory completely. Turn the machine on. Then ran EasyCleaner to eliminate any unneded files and registry entries. Ran
 a deep scan with Antivirus AVG did not find any problems. Ran a scan wit Ad-Aware two entries that were eliminated. Ran Spybot Search and Destroy clean slate no problems reported. Turn the machine off. Later turned it on again and access the IE site through
 another browser. saved the IE8 installation file on a flash drive. Exited the internet session. Installed the IE8 from the flash drive. and Voila IE8&nbsp;works now! I can connect to secure sites without problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for all&nbsp;your help, time and advice.</p>

QED: Why did Ad-Aware find stuff that AVG didn't?</p>
<p>Comment: Your continuing use of EasyCleaner will only make matters worse. See my previous reply.</p>
<p>Tip: If you don't fully understand what Spybot Tea Timer and Ad-Aware's Ad-Watch do &amp; how they do it, disable both of them &amp; leave them disabled.</p>

<p>Refer Pg. No. 35 and Format it in the phone itself. I think this will remove the Question of File System and do the correct formating on its own..</p>

<h2>            6303i Charging Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>my new Nokia 6303i will only charge correctly when it has been turend off. If turned on, charging does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use the Nokia Charger, I see the battery Symbol "being charged", but even after several hours it is not finished. If I unplug charger, Battery is allmost empty!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use USB, Telefone says that Charger is not valid or something like that. And then also, battery is empty afer short time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions??</p>

<p>Are you using the Nokia charger that come with the phone or another Nokia charger? Some of the older chargers have a lower power output which may just be enough to keep the phone going but not enough to charge the batery at the same time.</p>

<p>I too bought 6303i battery, I am using the original battery charger given by the mobile. I am trying to charge the mobile it is not getting charged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I put it on charging, it shows that it is getting charged, but after some time it automatically gets discharged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a problem with the battery, or the charger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also felt that the back of the mobile gets heated up as I am using the steel body..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide a fruitful solution for it.</p>

<p>Batteries get warm during charging and high discharge but it should not get hot. If it gets hot or if the battery is showing signs of bloating you should get it checked out at your local Nokia Care point straight away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you should try another charger to see if that helps. If it doesn't then it is probably the battery. If neither helps then you should send it to your local Nokia Care point for them to check it out.</p>

<h2>            Get rid of the Archive button on the main ribbon for Outlook 2016</h2>
                    If there any way to get rid of the Archive button on the main ribbon for Outlook 2016 (Office 365)?&nbsp; It's totally useless if you have auto archive set up and I keep hitting it accidentally while trying to hit the delete button! I tried going to where you
 customize the ribbon since I've used it for a few other changes to the ribbon bar but it won't let you remove that button from the bar.<br />

<p>
<span>Office 2010 Starter is only officially installed by computer builders. If you google skillfully, there are a few links to the installation files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Home users do not have access to the installation file so there are only 3 options for ‚Äúre-installing‚Äù it.</span></p>
<p>
<span>This document outlines the 3 options you have to ‚Äúre-isntall‚Äù Office 2010 Starter:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Office Program Manager</span></li><li><span>Recovery Partition</span></li><li><span>Image Copy Backup</span></li></ol>
<p>There is an option that allows users to re-install Office Starter without using the recovery partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It requires that you have the ‚ÄúMicrosoft Office 2010 Program Manager‚Äù installed. If you go into Programs and Features dialog, look for the ‚ÄúMicrosoft Office 2010‚Äù entry.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The link above shows how this entry appears in Programs and Features, and how to use it to re-install Office Starter.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b><span>Starter is Part of the Recovery Partition</span></b>

</span></p>
<p>Hard drive recovery is a requirement for distributing Office Starter 2010 . A hard-disk-based recovery solution enables Windows 7 to automatically recover from most known causes for unbootable systems as a result of loss or corruption
 of files. </p>
<p>This type of recovery will wipe out all of your installed programs and personal data files. Therefore, before starting this type of ‚Äúrepair‚Äù you should make a backup of your disk and make sure that you have the installation files and
 product keys for all of your applications.</p>

<p>Hi I have a 920 and I can get through a full work day no problem on one charge I make it home with 35 -50% battery left</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>make sure you have the lates firmware update avaliable ( i'm on ATT running 1232.5962.1314.0001)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there's a few things you may want to try</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First is go to "settings" the swipe left and go to "Application"</p>
<p>then go to "Games" and turn OFF "connect with Xbox"</p>
<p>(only turn this on when gaming or when updating any leaderboards then it can be shut off)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also in the 'Application setting" check any background task shut down apps you don't need updates for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>next if you sync your email change your email&nbsp;settings&nbsp;so&nbsp;that emails will sync hourly, or longer if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also&nbsp;make sure Bluetooth and and wifi are&nbsp;"off" when not in uses.( download the Dashboard app) and you can make short cuts to your home screen&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>

<p>The firmware version you are on is probably the latest available firmware for your region/carrier. It's also the same version I have on my UK unbranded 920 which will go a good couple of days between charges.</p>

            Try a hardware reset and if it doesn't work take it back for an exchange. There is no software cure for a hardware problem. Your problem has nothing to do with battery saving.

<p>Boys I have one thing to share with you about battery life. I have bought my lumia 920 2 days before and after using few hours i updated my phone to latest amber update. After that i felt that my phone battery was draining 7%/ hour and sometimes more. So
 I searched all over the internet about this problem of battery draining and come to this conclusion.<br />
<br />
Please do the following thing:<br />
<br />
1)Go to Settings&gt; mobile network &gt; Network Selection &gt; Just Select your network( Don‚Äôt put it on automatic)<br />
<br />
Now I will tell you what happened when I did this. I charged my phone all night and unplugged it at 6.00AM (9 Dec 2013) still now it has 55% battery at 00.32 AM (10 Dec 2013)<br />
<br />
18 Hours of usage including whatsapp, Wifi On(all the time), Browsing and random stuff on phone.<br />
<br />
Please do this. I hope it will work for you too.</p>

            Had same problem for a couple of days with my Lumia 920, battery life was like 2-3 hrs. The cause was the weather channel app's tile that I had set up to be the largest (i.e., it showed me current state plus forecast for three days and was constantly checking
 for updates).<br />
Switched it back to the smallest (shows only current temperature) and my battery is back to normal, 15-18 hrs from one charge - I'm playing bubbles, have email syncing every 15 mins, auto brightness, glance set to peek and double tap to wake up phone enabled,
 chatting in Skype/inbuilt Facebook, browsing, locations services on, making photos sometimes, Xbox is connected. Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi off though and I almost don't listen to music. I suppose 18 hrs is ok for all this stuff...<br />
So just in case try to make the weather app's tile smaller if you have it

            <blockquote>Ok let me explain you once again. I am using Northwind 2007 for my office where instead of products Ihave fed&nbsp; services we render to the customers (there are some predefined services of my company). I want that as it appears in customers and employees
 subforms, their individual details,on similar pattern I should&nbsp; be able to see in each service (product) subform date wise record of&nbsp; customers who were provided that particular service. and also which employee provided that service. I am not using other features
 of the Northwind related to shipping etc where details are kept unfilled and my job is done well yet.<br />

First, We are all volunteers here. we donate our time and expertise to help others. But you can help us help you by a) providing a subject that briefly describes your question. We know you need help with Access, otherwise why post here and b) providing examples,
 maybe screen shot that can help us visualize what you need. You can attach screen shots to a shared online storage space like SkyDrive.
<div><br />
<div>As to using Services, instead of Products a service is YOUR product so there should not be much difference. I can see you may need to modify the Products table in Northwind to contain info about a service that may be different from a product.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>if you need to see a list of customers that were provided a service, you would so this with a subform on the Products (Services) main form. As I recall Northwind, there is an Order Details table that lists the Products/Services provided as part of an order.
 So you would have a subform to the products form that lists all Order detail records linked on the ProductID.</div>

<h2>            AT&#38;T Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE Band 3 not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello to the professional community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in Pakistan and I recently received an AT&amp;T Windows 640 LTE from the US and i found it to be a great phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this one particular problem has been bothering me a lot which is why I would like you guys to help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Pakistan, 4G is on the LTE Band 3 i.e. 1800 MHz spectrum which to me was great initially because when i checked the product specifications it said that the phone supports LTE Band 3. To corroborate this claim it was even stated on the AT&amp;T website that
 the phone supports Band 3. It was all good on paper however things took a turn downhill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially purchased a 4g Data sim and started browsing. First i thought the 4G was working great but later on i realized that i am not using 4g and that I had been on 3g this whole time. I used&nbsp; the ##3283# function to start a field test and saw that the
 LTE reception was not there as the 'sys mode' was stated as 'invalid'. The phone however shows the 4g sign next to the signals bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching online i found that the RM 1073 rom by AT&amp;T prevented users from accessing LTE Band 3. There have been ideas that if I were to debrand&nbsp; my phone using another rom, i would be able to use the LTE Band 3 and that this claim has been verified
 by many users alike.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that should I debrand my phone? Is it my only option? If i do have to debrand my phone, which rom should i debrand it with?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any other option, please please please do let me know. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Really hope to hear form you all soon</p>

fm109</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. What we'd recommend is contacting AT&amp;T for info if you can use the Lumia 640 LTE 4G connection in Argentina. For additional information can be obtain from the provider that you're currently using if they support
 the 4G specs on your phone. Let us know if you have other questions.

    <title>I can&#39;t get lines to snap to grid&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macstudent_onward  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t get lines to snap to grid&#33;</h2>
                    Hi--This always seems to happen to me....I experiment with turning on either Static or Dynamic Grids (sometimes both at once) PLUS snap to grid, but for whatever reasons, I cannot get my lines to snap to the grid. &nbsp;In fact, it always looks as if one end
 of the line is being deliberately pushed away from snapping to the grid. &nbsp;It lands just off the correct angle.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My lines thus look ridiculously out of alignment, particularly in an organizational chart or similar graphic where perpendicular lines, for example, should be perfectly aligned (parallel) with either the top or side of the slide. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've googled at length to find guidance on this and the guidance I find is not working for me. &nbsp;Welcome any help!</div>
                </div>

            There's no question that the underlying Grid in PPT 2011 leaves much to be desired -- It's a definite step backward providing no way of displaying or adjusting it, but it
<ol>
<li>Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">View&gt; Guides</span></li><li>Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">Snap to Grid</span> <span style="font-style: italic">
Off</span></li><li>Create any type of shape</li><li>With it selected use the arrow keys to nudge it in any direction</li><li>Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">Snap to Grid</span> <span style="font-style: italic">
On</span></li><li>Nudge again using the arrow keys</li></ol>
<br />
You should see that the object moves in larger increments with the Snap turned on. Also, if you drag slowly you can see the distinction between Snap On/Off. With Snap On the shape 'jumps' from one position to the next based on the Grid, whereas it will move
 more fluidly with Snap Off.<br />
<br />
Having <span style="font-weight: bold">Guides</span> -- either <span style="font-style: italic">
Static</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">Dynamic</span> -- turned on has no bearing on the Grid. Dynamic Guides are intended to assist in accurately aligning one shape relative to another. Static Guides remain stationary as objects are repositioned
 &amp; shapes will snap to them regardless of whether Snap to Grid is On/Off. You can also create multiple Static Guides. See Word Help on

Align objects by using static guides</a><br />
