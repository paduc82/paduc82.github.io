<h2>            Missing the search bar that was in the middle of the address bar</h2>
                    <p>HI: I'm trying to get my home page back to what it waas before.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had it where I could type on the bar in the middle of the screen and now it don't do that.</p>
<p>It only types in the address bar where before I could type in the middle of the screen and nothing in the address bar at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;How can I get it back to where it was before.</p>
<p>Before it would show like different sites that you went into before that was when it was in the middle in the address bar it don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I just can't stand having it in the address bar when I'm used to the other way had it that way since personal computers first came out.</p>
<p>And I had it in windows 7 also but not anymore how can I get it back.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure that I understand your question, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you're asking about the separate&nbsp;Search Box that used to be in the IE&nbsp;Toolbar, that was last available in IE8. The only way to get such a&nbsp;search field in IE9, 10 or 11 is to install a toolbar like Google or Bing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/toolbar/ie/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/toolbar/ie/index.html</a>
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bingtoolbar.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bingtoolbar.com/en-US</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Or, you may have had either Google or Bing as your Homepage. That would provide the search field every time the Homepage was displayed.</p>
<p>From Internet Options (General tab)&gt; Home page, type in <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.google.com</a> or <a href="http://www.bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.bing.com</a> and remove&nbsp;the site that's currently your Homepage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also have to change this setting... Internet Options (General tab)&gt; Tabs&gt; [When a new tab is opened, open: Your first home page]</p>

<p>Don: That's close to it but the one I had was in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Where your home page bar is that's where mine was and you could type in that.</p>
<p>Kind of what you sent me the link too but mine was in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And I have windows 7 with googe chrome as the defalt.</p>
<p>I have been trying just about everything I can think of to get it back to how it was I loved it that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But what do you mean when you say type in www.google com and remove the sites current home page would thaat do it to put it back into the middel the way it was????.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank's Donlet me know</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Don:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried that before that was one of the first things I tried I went though all of the settings thinking something got deleted or something but that's not it but then again you would know that better then I would I set all the settings back to the defalt
 and started over that was the first thing I did then the new tab thing nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I just can't figure out what's wrong with it I have tried everthing I can think of other then re-installing chrome I don't have the disk for windows 7 or chrome so I have to download it ( chrome only ) I wouldn't want to re-install windows 7 without a
 disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And I just tried it again and the same thing it all go's to the top address bar just as before.</p>
<p>Maybe you would know a to how to do this but when you try doing it makes you mad it does me anyway plus NOT having the computer in front of you is kind of hard to fix also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was tempted to go way back to the beginig and re-install windows chrome all over again.</p>
<p>But I don't want to do that again it took me about 6 or 7 tries before I got it in-stalled and that's just window chrome 7 was already in-stalled on the computer thank god for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't want 8 no touch computer but I have to get the middle bar back the way it was when I first in-stalled chrome and it was working the correct the way it should it worked correctly tell about 7 or 8 days ago maybe a little longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And I tried to think as to what I did with it then and the history doesn't show anything that I seen anyway with me re-setting the settings the computer or re-storing the computer back to another time I did try that also it didn't work either there's
 nothing there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now you know why it's very mind blowing and madning to me and I'm NOT a computer programer either so I don't know the in's and out of it &nbsp;I have a brother that is or was a computer programer years ago but computers have changed so much from when he was
 doing it that he can't figure it out either plus he don't know chrome that well he knows IE alot better but then again so do I that was the first thing that came out years ago back then I new the computers alot better also but not any more like I used too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But it has been driving me nuts trying to figure out what's wrong with &nbsp;it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thanks for your help Don let me know if you know as to what to do with this problem</p>

<p>Don:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes I do have chrome as a brosser &nbsp;but the funny thing is now since I haven't used E/I for so long the drivers are all out of date you see I just use I E for a back way in if something go's wrong and can't get in the normal way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And Ilooked at how to up date the drivers there's so many of them it's going to take day's to up date all of them but I am useing your link that you sent me where the address bar is on the screen in the top right and you don't need to keep hitting enter
 to search for something that is what I had before just NOT in that place mine was in the middle as you know already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now that I know that I can't get on IE I'm going to try and figure a way to restore that back or up date all of the drivers for it you would think when the computer up dates the drivers for windows 7 and google crhome you would think that IE would be
 up dated also along with the rest of it but I found out that's not what it does tonight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So Saturday sometime I'm going to have to figure out as to how to up date all of &nbsp;the IE drivers I know where they are but what one are for what that's the thing there's a lot of them that's why it's going to take all day to up date all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then when I'm done with that there's always something else that's wrong with it but who know's I might just get lucky NOT I wish that's the way it works but it don't normaly I don't think that has ever happend to me anyway maybe I'm wrong but it's been
 so long since I have done this it's going to take me forever to find the wright ones to up date.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But I think you have it wright Don I think that's the way it was and some how it got seperated how no clue so &nbsp;the question is how to get them together again but that is the easy part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks alot Don</p>

<p>Don:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got IE up to date now and I can't get IE to where you should be able to type in the middle of the home page and I even downloaded chrome on IE I did what you said to do to the letter and it still wants to go up to the top right the way you had sent

<p>If you mean About:Tabs&nbsp; you need to be using a Default search provider which supports Search suggestions to see that feature.&nbsp; In fact, it looks as if it only works with BING.&nbsp; I was using Google to avoid seeing that and just now switched back to BING to
 see if that thing was still there and it is--unfortunately.&nbsp; I despise it because it is completely redundant if you are used to searching from the Address bar and obviously is only there to try to make people more aware of the possibility of searching from
 the Address bar.&nbsp; E.g. as soon as you start typing in its "search box" you see that you are typing in the Address bar!&nbsp;So, for those&nbsp;who want to use BING as their default search provider and use its Search suggestions feature&nbsp;the addition to About:Tabs is
 "training wheels" that can't be removed.</p>

            If an array with 65536 elements works and with 65537 fails I'd say you have found the limit yourself! {grin}

<p>Are you saying that the problems with the new client, its slowness, loss of functionality and its incompatibility with your customer bases phones is because you moved to the Microsoft azure cloud ? &nbsp;That's hardly a good recommendation for the cloud.... Or
 is there another reason that the Skype 8 client is so bad?</p>

            <blockquote>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I tried to fix per an earlier solution I found when searching - change the registry [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.vsd] to&nbsp;Visio.Drawing.11 but that didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; The kb article wasn't very clear
 on what exactly to change but I assume it is the Default.&nbsp; Anyone able to help out here?
</blockquote>
<p>I too had the same problem on one of our machines - what I found is that I had to go though a number of different registry keys in
<span>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</span>&nbsp;and modify all of them so they no longer pointed to the visio viewer. Once I had removed all instances pointing to viewer I found that it was then working again. Here is a list of my keys and their
 settings that got rid of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vsd - (default) Visio.Drawing.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vsl - (default) Visio.AddOn.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vss - (default) Visio.Stencil.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vst - (default) Visio.Template.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vsu - (default) Visio.CustomUI.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vsw - (default) Visio.Workspace.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vsx - (default) Visio.Stencil.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>.vtx - (default) Visio.Template.11</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Content Type &nbsp;application/vnd.visio</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope this helps resolve the issue if like me the originally posted fix doesn't resolve the issue. Please remember that editing the registry is not to be done without understanding the risks involved &amp; that if you're not careful you can cause irreversible
 damage to your system. As such I accept to no Liability for the information contained with this post.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue and it appears to me that what&nbsp;Visio 2007 is&nbsp;doing is installing the C++ 2010 libraries again each time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has produced multiple copies of the C++ 2010 libraries as well as the 2012 and 2013 versions?</p>
<p>

            this problem is a time waster pain. I found that cancelling the installer launches Visio immediately, but it's annoying that Micro(brain)(and)soft can't fix and update their software. this has been going on since Win-7. Come on microbrain fix it!

            I have found a work around. Take the OneNote page and Email to yourself. Then move the Email to the OneNote folder. Now use Export to WORD. It keeps the Checkboxes and checkmarks.

<h2>            On macOS - exchange profile conflict between Outlook and Mail</h2>
                    <p>On a new MacBook air, I am experiencing an issue where the Office 365 Outlook app will end up in a "connecting to server" status and stop sending/receiving emails until the app is restarted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is resolved by removing the exchange profile from the Mac's "internet accounts." &nbsp; But I am no longer able to view mail or access contacts from any of the Mac applications. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding the exchange profile to the Mac's "internet accounts" and only syncing contacts causes the issue to come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get the Office 365 Outlook App to run properly while also having the corresponding exchange profile loaded into the Mac's "internet accounts?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 Technical Preview, you will not be able to see the charms bar when you hover the cursor to the right top corner. To get the settings option you will have to press the
<strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>C </strong>keys after opening the app. Once the Charms bar appears you may click on the
<strong>Settings </strong>icon to make changes in the app settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply if the information provided is not helpful so that we can help you better</p>

<h2>            I dont always receive emails</h2>
                    <div>Hello. I have been experiencing this problem for a while now with the new Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many times I have been sent an email from family or friends and I don't receive it. they may send the email a few times before it shows up in my inbox and sometimes it will show up multiple times after a few tries.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also had this problem when requesting activation emails when registering for accounts on sites too. usually I do not receive the email in my inbox and I have to contact the site customer support. On occasion I have requested the email to be sent
 more than once and again, after a few requests it may finally show up in my inbox, but multiple times.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand that emails may take a little while to show up but sometimes wait over an hour and the email still does not arrive. I am currently waiting for an email since yesterday and i know it will not arrrive yet I have no option to ask for another
 one! it is very frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Until Hotmail switched to outlook I never had problems with receiving emails and I would receive them instantly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise me on how I can fix this problem as my inbox settings are all correct. I have already read other support answers and have checked to see if this will fix my problem but it has not.</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand how frustrating it is when you are expecting for an email to arrive and it doesn't arrive.
<font>Mail delivery delays are usually caused by one of the following issues:</font></p>
<ul>
<li>The mail servers may be undergoing maintenance, or there may be a service outage.</li><li>The message was large, or it contained one or more large attachment.</li><li>Messages that are sent from Windows Live Hotmail, MSN, or Hotmail accounts are subject to the same spam filtering as incoming mail from third-party email services.</li></ul>
<p>Please verify the following informations to isolate the concern.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this issue occur in this specific account?</li><li>Where do you access your account. Is it on a web browser or through a mail client?</li></ul>
<p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I understand that mail servers may sometimes be undergoing maintenance but I have been having this problem far too often and only with some of my mail, not all. I do receive emails daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages that I don't receive are just random. I have noticed that when I try to register an account&nbsp;on sites, I never receive my activation emails. This is has happened to me numerous times now, and my account settings are all correct and should allow
 them.</p>
<p>I use a combination of 3 browsers to access my Hotmail account&nbsp;: internet explorer, google chrome and safari for iphone.</p>
<p>In the past when I have received email I have used other browsers to see if this resolves the problem but it has not.</p>
<p>I am sure you can appreciate how frustrating this is, especially since important emails that I am not aware of may also have been lost.</p>

            I made the account with my school email address, but OneDrive and Word Online are not provided by my school. I contacted my school's IT and they said they don't have an Admin to contact Microsoft Support for me. I still don't have an option to Email OneDrive
 Support when I click the Help link. As it stands I have no way to get in contact with Microsoft Support.

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I am trying to generate a Consolidated Pivot Table Report. I have the same data on my 3 Sheets. The problem is that when i select Pivot Table-&gt; Multiple Consolidation Ranges-&gt; Create a Single Page Field for Me, and after adding my data from all the three
 sheets, and then clicking next, it does not name the headers on all my existing sheets data. It displays as-&gt;</p>
<p>ROW|Column|Value|Page1</p>
<p>and not the name of headers of my data (Name|Age|____|Location) as in Pivot table report, so that i might be able to drag them according to my preference.</p>
<p>For your reference, below is my data on all the three sheets, -&gt;</p>

            I assume you're talking about a notebook on Skydrive which is shared between multiple devices.
<div><br />
<div>Use File, Info to look at the paths of your duplicate notebooks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe one of them shows a Skydrive link, the other a local file system path ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>The latter could be the old original which was created locally and later got shared using Skydrive.</div>
<div>Unfortunately Onenote doesn't delete the old (now relocated to Skydrive) original notebook. And possibly you have opened it again unintentionally.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this is the case just close it (and delete it with Windows explorer).</div>

<p>Suggest you to delete the 'Cities' folder and the 'qf' file from your phone. You may do it thru' Windows explorer after connecting the phone to PC. Then open the Maps application for about 20-30 seconds and close it. Now reconnect the phone to PC and thru'
 Nokia Suite re-install the Maps for your region. Once done, go to an area open to sky, launch the Maps application and wait. It may take in excess of 30 minutes to get the FIX. If you are in an area with tall buildings / trees and if the weather is rainy /
 cloudy the GPS lock may take much longer than that ...</p>

    <title>Trouble with headset N95 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skeeblix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with headset N95</h2>
                    
<p>A friend of mine just gave me a headset to replace one of mine that had broken. It's model number is N95, and it's small and black, with only one button. I only provide all this because it seems Nokia doesn't support their own products anymore, and I wasn't
 able to find this headset on the site anywhere to see if I was doing something wrong. I tried searching for online manuals for it, but since Nokia was brilliant enough to name a headset and a phone the same thing, all I can find are phone manuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I cant get it to partner with my LG VX8300 phone. It tells me to put the bluetooth device into discoverable mode, which as far as I know just involves turning it on. I don't have the manual, so I have no idea if there's anything special I need to
 do with the heaset to get it to connect with my phone.Any help here would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>It is a Bluetooth headset you are talking about right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To pair it do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Turn the headset off&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Turn Bluetooth on your phone on and start searching for new devices</p>
<p>- At the same time turn the headset on and keep the button pressed</p>
<p>- Then the headset should appear on your phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how and if it worked out! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides of that I´m pretty sure that the headset doesn´t have the same name as the phone...if you can, provide us with a picture of it. Maybe then, someone will be able to tell you what headset it is. :)</p>

<p>Hi skeeblix</p>

<p>I should have thought that the price would have been a clue that perhaps all is not as it seems, which may also answer your query as to why this item can't be found on any Nokia support site.&nbsp;</p>

            So should the model name.<br />
<br />
Nokia headsets are all HS-xx and BH-xx models. "N95" is a handset, a very well-known and successful one at that. How anyone thought they could give a bluetooth headset the same model name and expect people to bleive it was a real Nokia device is beyond me.<br />
<br />
This smells 100% fake.

            Following a W32:FakeAV-FFG[Trj] infection I experienced this MSE install error code too. Symptoms also included:<br />
- Msconfig would not execute or give any error message it is not executing.<br />
- Windows Defender (MSASCui.exe) will not execute or give any error message it is not executing.<br />
<br />
The repair was to:<br />
1. Run Regedit (which ran without error)<br />
2. Navigate to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options<br />
3. Remove any entry which has a "Debugger" REG_SZ value of "svchost.exe"<br />
<br />
In my situation, the entries removed included Msconfig.exe, MpCmdRun.exe, MpUXSrv.exe, MSASCui.exe, msmpeng.exe, and msseces.exe.<br />
<br />
Without rebooting Msconfig and Windows Defender would now run and MSE now installed without error.<br />

            <p>FWIW I had a slightly different experience from Daniel with the wizard4help URL - this is on Yosemite.<br />
<br />
Here, Word definitely got as far as handing something to the default browser, but in this case the URL had been transformed into something else:<br />
<br />
file:///.file/id=6571367.121058786</p>
<p>
</p><p>which is presumably some sort of ID understood by Mac OSX. (Oh, it's a temporary "File Reference URL")</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my default browser is Chrome, the browser displays a new tab with the URL in the address box, but does not display the file.<br />
<br />
When my default browser is Safari, the browser displays the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I don't think this is relevant to the current problem, but recently I spent some time using a protocol analyser to find out what Word was actually doing when retrieving a document from a URL. It generally (a) established that there is something at the URL
 and (b) retrieves that something (in other words, it has then done almost all the work), but will then fail if it does not know what to do with the extension or MIME (?) file type it has received. I don't know whether it has a hardcoded list of types that
 it will deal with, or queries OSX.)</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 Cannot Add Email Account</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems adding an email account onto Outlook 2011. I have a MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, late 2013, with OS X Yosemite, version 10.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have one account set up but wanted to add a second.</p>
<p>When this did not work, I created another user account on my computer and tried adding a first account onto Outlook there and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that I click on the following path:</p>
<p>Outlook / Preferences / Accounts / Add email account</p>
<p>
</p><p>From clicking "add email account", the programme then freezes.</p>
<p>No spinning wheel appears, but it will not let me click on anything else within Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have left the programme for several minutes and have then decided to 'force quit' (none of the toolbar options are clickable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>

<p>Dear Microsoft team and Community members,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>My apology for this oversight:&nbsp; </em>Upon further analysis I discovered this was a user error (<em>my error</em>) and not a product defect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just prior to this issue, I set up a custom inbox filter to automatically sort incoming messages into alternate
 folders based on specific keywords.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal was to<em> exclude </em>the cc: emails from the auto sort/move feature&nbsp;I had set up&nbsp; prior for emails which I had intended to for this purpose.&nbsp; As a result, these cc:&nbsp; reply messages were not received in my
<strong>inbox</strong>; however they were received in an alternate folder which I had designated for an earlier query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email to Microsoft community was prompted after I found a similar issue from another user unanswered.&nbsp; I hope this resolution helps other Outlook.com users with a similar concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest,</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Oliver</p>

<h2>            Stop duplicating backup files each time I save to work in progress</h2>
                    Since 2018, my Word 365 for Mac has been creating multiple backup files each time I hit save while working on a document. It is confusing having all these different versions of the file. I am getting so frustrated with this that I am considering just using
 Pages. Is there a way to save to the same document without creating backup files?

<p>Hi Jennene,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please start Mac in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a> and run Word alone, check if the issue still exists. This may help us determine if the issue is related to incompatible login items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to help us clarify your scenario, please provide some more information:</p>
<p>1. What’s your Office version? Please check in Word &gt; About Word and show up a screenshot of this page.</p>
<p>2. What’s your OS version?</p>
<p>3. Regarding the “multiple backup files”, could you please provide some more information? How many files are created? What’s the name of the files? Are these files stored in the same location as the original file?</p>
<p>4. Does the issue occur to one file or all files? Does the issue occur to other Office apps like Excel or PowerPoint?</p>

    <title>How to Use a Single Path in Multiple Subs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottcnichols  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Use a Single Path in Multiple Subs</h2>
                    <p>Hello all. I have some code that opens multiple files in the same folder, copies certain worksheets and pastes them into a single workbook (also in the same folder). Each sub that I am calling uses the path. Is there a way to create a sub to set the path
 that I can "call" in each sub? In the event we need to relocate the files I would like to change the path once instead of for every file. Below is a sample of my current code in one sub. I hope that question makes sense...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim strPath As String</p>
<p>Dim SourceWbk As Workbook</p>
<p>Dim TargetWsht As Worksheet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>strPath = "I:\ReportSamples\EXPENDITURE SUMMARY ITSD FY1213.xls"</em></strong></p>
<p>Application.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
Set TargetWsht = ActiveSheet<br />
lngRow = 1<br />
Range("A1:S60").Clear<br />
Set SourceWbk = Workbooks.Open(strPath)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>What I provided was just an example to illustrate how to make an variable public and persistent.&nbsp; You don't actually need "MySub".&nbsp; The point is, the first time you set the value of "strPath", it will stay set and ANY sub in that code module will be able
 to use the value.&nbsp; Also, you can change the value of "strPath" in any sub of that module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could change the declaration from:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public strPath as String</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public Const strPath as String = \\This\Is\My\Path\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(setting it to whatever your path is)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't change paths very often, this will work.&nbsp; Then, when you move to a different folder, you can change the value of the constant, and all the subs using that constant will be pointed to the new folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. - to open a specific file in a particular sub, you would not want to make the filename part of the path.&nbsp; Instead, you would do something like this (from your original code):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set SourceWbk = Workbooks.Open(strPath &amp; "EXPENDITURE SUMMARY ITSD FY1213.xls<strong><em>"</em></strong>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>strFile = "EXPENDITURE SUMMARY ITSD FY1213.xls<strong><em>"</em></strong></p>
<p>Set SourceWbk = Workbooks.Open(strPath &amp; strFile)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        </p>
