    <title>Alias issue with replying or forwarding from new Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tjustinw3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alias issue with replying or forwarding from new Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I have just been automatically upgraded to the new Outlook.com interface (my native MS account is &nbsp;an @hotmail.com address). &nbsp;For years I've had no problems REPLYing of FWDing emails that come into my inbox addressed to an alias email address. &nbsp;Until the
 update yesterday...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The alias address in this case is a domain that is being aliased on an Exchange Office 365 server (example: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** [not @outlook.com]);
</li><li>so my registrar is redirecting all incoming mail for mydomain.com to the Exchange server, which is then automatically forwarding the email through to my @hotmail address. &nbsp;</li><li>All POP and SMTP settings in Outlook.com seem to be intact as they were yesterday before the update.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If I send from the Outlook.com client using the alias&nbsp;myname@******.com the email is sent. &nbsp; However, if I receive an email sent through my Exchange 365 server to&nbsp;myname@******.com and then try to REPLY or FWD it from within the Outlook.com web client, it
 gets stuck in my drafts folder. &nbsp;Finding it there and trying to resend it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming there is some SPF spoofing filter preventing Outlook.com from sending. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what exactly is going on and how to fix it? &nbsp;This is like years of email standard practice (using aliases to send/receive) being completely broken... its a business disaster for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx,</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am using office 2016 and there was no error message.&nbsp; I have two email addresses my Hotmail one (*********************) plus my main email address (**************************).&nbsp; When I send email to myself from the Hotmail address to the orange email there
 seems to be no problem but if I send from my Orange address which is the one I use as my main email&nbsp;the email ends up in the draft folder and does not get sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really need to get this sorted asap please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil Graham&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No offense, but these replies are junk. I've been having the same issue, and this is clearly an issue with Microsoft &amp; Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly don't know why MS has these forums when the moderators are giving generic, non-specific links to stuff that has nothing to do with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something changed at Outlook.com in past few weeks, and it is hit and miss (sometimes working fine, and other times not working, until it magically starts working again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending an email through Outlook.com using an alias, right now, appears to send. But no, it magically appears in the draft folders saying 'this message has not been sent'. If you open the email sitting in the drafts and re-send, it disappears for a second
 as if it has been sent, then appears in the draft folder again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the moderator, instead of giving generic responses, how about reporting this issue to your tech department as something is broken.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with what you said.</p>
<p>I have been&nbsp;in touch with&nbsp;both Microsoft and EE (Orange) about this issue and neither could solve the problem. I suggested to EE that they contacted Microsoft and maybe between them they can fix the issue, their reply was "Oh that's a good idea", that is
 true I couldn't believe it, but there we are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to hear if they have consulted each other and am still waiting for either Microsoft or EE to get back to me but I am not holding my breath. I would be grateful if you could let me know if get a fix for this issue.</p>

            <p>I feel the pain. Google is worse IMO...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote another post in a MS tread related to this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue: the new Outlook.com does not support SMTP-Only (send only) email accounts. Users that previously had emails set up as SMTP-only (send only) had those setting migrated to the new Outlook.com. However, those SMTP-only emails are not functional.
 If you send from one, it will go immediately into your draft folder, and will not send. If you try to update the settings for the STMP-only email, it will not work. If you delete and try to re-add, you will not be able to add as SMTP only, it will require
 IMAP or POP settings. In short, SMTP-Only email accounts no longer work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to get that feature back immediately, they need to allow SMTP only email accounts as was in previous version of Outlook.com. It is a gross over sight on their part, and need to be fixed right away.</p>

            <p>Hello Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To further assist you with the concern, may we know if you are using an Office 2016/365 account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may know, there is currently an upgrade rolling out for Outlook.com and may have affected your email in some ways. For now, we suggest that if you are using Office 365, reconnect that email accounts in Outlook.com. Below are the steps on how to do
 this under the drop down option of <strong>Connect an Email account to Outlook on the web</strong>:</p>
<p>

            <p>Dude, don't waste my time. I already know 100% more about this than you do. You have no clue, even though I have posted what the issue is, you just chose to be brain-dead and not look at the other posts, then pretend you are 'helping' by giving bad information.
 STOP IT! </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you actually have something to contribute, once you understand the issue, feel free to post again. And the correct post will be "Microsoft has added back the functionality to have SMTP (send only) email accounts in Outlook..com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until then stop wasting everyone's time.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/cbb03fff-1004-4d25-bd6f-bc305bc31fdc" title="Sivasankari k">
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your inquiry, Skype Names cannot be changed nor edited once registered.&nbsp;Additionally, when Skype accounts were migrated to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016, the option to create a custom Skype Name is also no longer possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can either <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA110/how-do-i-change-my-skype-display-name?ps=chang?q=display+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">change your display name</span></a></strong><strong>
</strong>or <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12413/how-do-i-create-a-new-account-for-skype?q=create+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">create another account</span></a></strong><strong>
</strong>using an email address. Remember, accounts created using an email address will have a system-generated Skype Name which will show as
<strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let us know if you need additional information or assistance.

<p>Hi EugeneYao,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s an expected behavior that Outlook for Mac client will not show the columns of unread emails beside the
<strong>From</strong> addresses when you arranged the email folder by <strong>From</strong>. If you want Outlook for Mac client also have this feature, please share your idea with our related team via this link:

    <title>Help, I&#39;m Crippled after MyPhone 1.6 Upgrade&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help, I&#39;m Crippled after MyPhone 1.6 Upgrade&#33;</h2>
                    I'm running Windows Mobile 6.5 on a Samsung Jack (SGH-I637). &nbsp;I installed Microsoft Myphone through the Windows Marketplace, and it worked great for a week. &nbsp;I got a notice to upgrade to version 1.6 and that's when things started to go downhill. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;The 1.6 upgrade installation locked.</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;I thought that the problem could possibly be solved by de-installation, and then re-installation.</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;De-installation of Myphone locked</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;Attempted re-installation also locked</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(By locked I mean that the screen hung after the last input and stopped responding. &nbsp;I had to kill the process with the task manager. &nbsp;No error messages were displayed)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone has suggestions on how I could get the MyPhone application working again, I would REALLY appreciate it.</div>

                </div>

            Managed to solve my own problem with the forum.
<div><br />
<div>DO NOT USE THE WINDOWS MARKETPLACE!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was able to solve my problem by downloading the application manually and re-installing it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest avoiding the Mobile Marketplace like its a contagious disease for several months, until Microsoft works many of the bugs out of the process. &nbsp;So far only half the applications I've downloaded there have worked on the phone, and there's
 the aforementioned problem with upgrades and updates.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
good to know that you solved your problem, however I'm interested to go deeper on your problem and understand what was happening. Can you please give me the following information:<br />
1. From where did you got the update&nbsp;notice?<br />
2. In what specific screen the update hanged? (if it was in the installation process you can tell me the number of the screen in the upper right corner)<br />
<br />
Alexandre&nbsp;

            Thank you for your response Alexandre, I'll try to be as detailed as I remember.
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;The update notice came when I started the Windows Marketplace application on my phone (Samsung Jack running Windows Mobile 6.5). &nbsp;I have my phone set to sign in automatically, and I moved to the "What's New" section of the marketplace. &nbsp;When I started
 that, I got a notice that there was an upgrade for MyPhone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. &nbsp;I can't remember which screen hung during the installation process. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I can't try to repeat the error. &nbsp;If I select "MyPhone" under the Marketplace "Ready to Install" applications the application will lock. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've also had problems trying to install the .Net Compact Framework and other applications through the Windows Marketplace. &nbsp;I'm batting about .500 for the applications that I've tried to run from there.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Excel 2013 64bit File Overload - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel 2013 64bit File Overload</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I have large Excel files (0.3 GB closed, 2.3 GB opened) that&nbsp;worked properly until recently on my laptop.&nbsp; Now I get an error (image attached) that says cannot be opened -&nbsp;for all of them.&nbsp; Specifically: "Excel has stopped working", and "Checkonline for
 a solution" does nothing.&nbsp; After a recovery attempt, another message is "does not have sufficient resources" - though task manager says there is plenty left.&nbsp; Moreover, other smaller files work fine.&nbsp; And the 'problem' files open &amp; operate on my new desktop.&nbsp;
 Therefore, has something 'happened' to my laptop Excel?&nbsp; What recourse do I have?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leslie</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that the default install is of 32&nbsp;&nbsp;bit Office, even on 64&nbsp;bit Windows, so could you please just confirm you really do have 64&nbsp; bit Office.&nbsp; Go into any application File menu &gt; Account command &gt; About button.&nbsp; It should say 64 bit somewhere near the

            Hi Rohn-system is as specified in original email (all 64 bit).&nbsp; In fact, running 64 bit excel is why I bought a laptop, which has been working fine with these files until last week (yet with no change to the system).

            <p>I just wanted to confirm you really have 64 bit Office as well as windows.&nbsp; If you did have 32 bit Office, it could have worked until your most recent additions to the file pushed them over the RAM limit in 32 bit.

            <p>Didn't work but thanks for the effort Rohn007:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Not using Access</p>
<p>2) Fix method 1 not possible because as soon as the file opens the 'excel not working' appears</p>
<p>3) Fix method 2 is possible, so I tried it - to no avail</p>

            <p>There are two ways to do this, one with code and one without. With code, use the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub AddNum()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim R As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Selection.Cells.Count &lt; 2 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each R In Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If R.HasFormula = False Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If StrComp(Left(R.Text, 1), "#", vbBinaryCompare) &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R.Value = "#" &amp; R.Text<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next R<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the range of cells to change and run the code.&nbsp; You must have at least two cells selected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without code, do the following. Create a new column next to the column containing your data. Enter the following formula in the first cell.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>="#"&amp;A1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where A1 is the starting cell. Now, select B1 (or wherever you entered the formula above), select down to the last cell of data and press CTRL D to fill down the formula into the selected range. Now, select the full range of the cells with formulas. Copy
 that and then Paste Values over the original range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Romhanyi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test and search, it is not achievable to add Groups to Shortcuts Pane. What we can add are the following lists as the image shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56ae4d87-7b1f-4bdb-8af4-83b5bc4249bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56ae4d87-7b1f-4bdb-8af4-83b5bc4249bb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>regarding this feature, I invite your to submit your feedback via the following link:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a temporary workaround, you can use it via Folder lists in the left pane in Outlook client. If you have been a member of an Office 365 group, it will automatically show your Outlook client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding and time.</p>

 pane to do that. Also, if i have permission to access my boss' sent folder, how do i access it? It doesn't show up when i go through file--&gt;open--&gt;shared folders. Thanks!

<h2>            Nokia 301&#58; Supports amounts of contacts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I just bought a Nokia 301 last weekend but I was really dispointed that the phone can't reach it's specification regarding "supports amounts of contact". I tried to transfer my contacts from old phone (E52) to new phone (301) but the transfer stocked at
 No. 1000 contacts. I tried to call Nokia Taiwan because the max amount of contact should be 2000. Nokia Taiwan explained that "2000" is caculated by the amounts of "phone number" instead of contacts. It is really strange that why it shows memory space of contacts
 is 100% used when there are 1000 contacts. Why not "999" or "1001" if it is caculated by amounts of phone number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BR, Dusty</p>

            Sounds like a mistake on Nokia's part while publishing the specs. Else your question isn't practical. If 1000 contacts say it as 100%, its not possible that each one of them contains 2 numbers<br />
<br />
Do you have some phone memory free? Just asking in case the contacts are saved on the main phone memory.<br />

            It is about time these Nokia phones with so much memory also support more contacts too!! Why limit us?? Why? Why? Can't Noia move forward and give us some usage?

            There are no lifetime subscriptions. You can only do yearly or monthly. If you purchase via a volume reseller then you can do up to 3 years.

<h2>            Copy and Paste</h2>
                    Copy and Paste used to function on Skype. My Windows 10 Skype just updated to the version which just has the icons on the left in the blue first column. Functionality lost: ability to copy and paste conversations out of Skype and into word etc for meeting
 minutes and the like. CTRL+C doesn't work. Using the mouse doesn't work. The best I can get is a line at a time, not the entire half hour meeting / IM group session. Any ideas?

<p>I certainly don't consider this is a solution. Can I run both Skype for Windows 10 and Skype for Windows Desktop on the same machine? If so, will they both be able to display the same messages so that I can have the functionality of Skype for Windows 10
 and the cut-and-paste of Skype for Windows Desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have any plans to solve this problem in Skype for Windows 10?</p>
<p>

<p><strong>I am integrating Outlook Office 365 in my web app. I want my app to remain in sync with Office 365 if there is any create/update event in the calendar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Currently I have created one-way sync process, like create, update, delete, and get all events from calendar. The problems are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>how to make two-way syncing with Office 365 for our app? </li><li>How to create notification subscription? </li><li>how to authenticate Notification-URL for subscription? </li></ol>
<p>When we subscribe for notification callback, the returned message through exception with this Notification URL&nbsp;<a href="https://webapp.com/notifications?validationtoken=MmJiM2QwMjYtNjAxYi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://bookafystaging.com/notifications?validationtoken=MmJiM2QwMjYtNjAxYi</a>&nbsp;verification

<p>The question is how we will verify Notification-ULR? I have created app on Window Azure and when i subscribe return same error message. How i fix this?</p>
<p>Following code for subscription:</p>

<p>Hi Omer,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>According to your description, it seems that you are using the web app to sync with the Office 365. If anything is misunderstood, please correct me and we will further assist you.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, it might involve some code (URL)/ third-party tool. As we are not familiar with this, we suggest you contact the<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> MSDN forum
</a>for more dedicated help. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How do i install English canada Speech language inorder tot make Cortana work in Canada&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Cortana Canada</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the insider program and should be able to activate Cortana, my local and language is set to Canada but I cannot change my speech language, English us is the only option, I have tried looking everywhere and cannot find a way to download or update
 anything specific to the speech portion.&nbsp; I understand that all 3 must match as En-Canada but how do you install speech languages?&nbsp; One step by step shows how to get the language file and simply says hit download on speech....&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is no tab, heading,
 button, on any of the screens!?!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried deleting the language, reverting to en-us for everything and re-downloading the language pack, still nothing about speech.&nbsp; Does anyone have a video or screenshots of how this is supposed to work?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is the Windows 10 Insider Preview build installed in your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Cortana is available in the following countries/regions: China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States. Cortana is available in these languages: Chinese (Simplified), English (U.K.), English (U.S.), French, Italian,
 German, and Spanish</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To use Cortana, all these settings must be set to the same language:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) Languages (this is your device language)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) Speech language (language pack must be installed)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) Country or region</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>You are not able to change the speech settings to English Canada because you have not downloaded the speech packs for the English Canada.
</span><span>I suggest you to check the language and speech settings in Cortana as below and check if it helps.

            <p>This does not help.&nbsp;&nbsp; The poster said they had triggered the download already.&nbsp;&nbsp; They seem to be in the same situation as I am:&nbsp;&nbsp; did the download but did not get English (Canada) as a speech option.</p>

            <p>Odd, I just followed the exact same steps and it worked perfectly, no restart or anything and Cortana is working perfectly (Insider build 10586).</p>

            <p>Hmmmm ... Perhaps it is because I am on plain vanilla build 10240 with all available official updates applied ... but as of this week that build is supposed to support English (Canada) and Cortana.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp;&nbsp;IF YOU HAVE UPDATED TO WINDOWS 10 IN THE LAST 31 DAYS YOU WILL NOT GET THE NOVEMBER 10 UPDATE DOWNLOADED !!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the Nov 10 update you will not get Canada Cortana working</p>

Notes
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it’s been less than 31 days since you upgraded to <span>Windows&nbsp;10, you won’t get the November update right away; this will allow you to go back to your previous version of Windows if you choose. After the 31 days have passed, your PC will automatically
 download the November update.</span></p>
</li><li>
<div>If the setting to defer upgrades is turned on, you may not get the update immediately. To make sure this setting is off, select the Start button&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" />,
 then select <span>Settings&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%2fmain%2f5d39d4c5-9d22-4b29-af02-df416d341a19_91.png" />&gt;
<span>Update &amp; security &gt; </span><span>Windows Update</span> &gt; <span>Advanced options</span>, and clear the checkbox for
<span>Defer upgrades</span>.</div>
</li><li>
<p>If you uninstalled the November update from your PC, you won't be able to install it again from Windows Update. Instead, you'll need to go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><span>Upgrade now</span> to upgrade your PC to <span>Windows&nbsp;10 Version 1511, which includes the November update.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Any update installed on your PC before the November update will no longer be listed in your update history.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
2nd Update:&nbsp;&nbsp; I had upgraded 4 PCs in our house to Windows 10 over last half of October, staggering the upgrades over a couple of weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night the 1st PC I had upgraded to Windows 10 updated itself to build 1511.&nbsp; Today I was able to apply the English
 (Canada) language and speech packages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cortana now works on that PC! 
</p><p>
</p><p>So .... to ChrisR466, the original poster:&nbsp;&nbsp; please check if you are at build 1511&nbsp; [FileExplorer ==&gt; File ==&gt; Help ==&gt; About ].&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are at an earlier build, you will never get English (Canada) speech working.</p>

            I am having the same problems as he describes in build 1511, i still dont have "download" as an option under speech in the Canadian English language setting. &nbsp;United States English is still my only option for speech languages.

            <p>It doesn't work.</p>
<p>When I download the English (Canada) language pack it appears to download and I get no error message.</p>
<p>but when I go back to set it as defaul, the default box is greyed out and the ENglish (Canada) option says Language Pack Available. &nbsp;Obviously it did not install. &nbsp;I've repeated the process several times with no success - it seems to download but not install.</p>

            <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get Cortana working on my computer at home but not on my computer at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get the English Canada language pack to install. It never gives the option to download. This is on the latest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9d02d09-9f82-4297-b90f-6f13967f4399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9d02d09-9f82-4297-b90f-6f13967f4399" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no speech language option other than English (United States).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd1229a4-059f-4d41-a6d3-d21a3e6b3eb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd1229a4-059f-4d41-a6d3-d21a3e6b3eb7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the screen where you click on options to download the language pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccdba26d-2127-48af-993c-ad761e7f2e4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccdba26d-2127-48af-993c-ad761e7f2e4b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But as you can see below... It just doesn't come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38b4c9f0-427d-4377-ba2f-b67979530d29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38b4c9f0-427d-4377-ba2f-b67979530d29" /></a></p>
<p>Is there a way I can download the language pack manually outside of this settings app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
