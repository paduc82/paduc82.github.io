<h2>            microsoft account unusual sign in activity</h2>
                    I keep getting an email with this heading. I have changed my password numerous times now. But I am getting this message even more frequently now. I get this email almost every day. The only thing I seem to be able to do is change my password after clicking
 the link. I don't want to keep changing my password daily. Is this some sort of spam? There does not seem to be any easy way to contact MSN to ask about this frequent email, I have tried looking for a phone number or chat, or email to contact customer service
 but I cannot find anything but this forum.&nbsp;

    <title>Lumia 950 XL Micro SD card bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgesbloch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 XL Micro SD card bug</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft Community, I received the new firmware with the last update on my Lumia 950 XL, unfortunately it didn't fix anything regarding my micro SD card: I have a new Lexar 1000X 128 Giga and 200 $ micro sd card and I can't read my videos correctly.
 I cannot visualize my pictures either!The pictures takes a very long time to appear on the micro sd camera roll and it's impossible to read a lot of videos. Can someone by Microsoft give me a solution? ? I am a windows phone user since the beginning in 2010,
 and I'm getting tired of the bugs especially with my new 700 $ 950 XL. I live in France so please excuse my english.

            <p>I agree , The Memory Card could be faulty . The read and write speed are 150Mb/s which is pretty fast &nbsp;so there really shouldn't be much a of a delay at all when you want to view the files on the card . &nbsp;Try using their recovery software and copy all the
 files off the SD Card and then format it and then copy it all back and re insert in to the phone too see if it makes any difference as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I'd also suggest making sure the card is compatible with Phone but i can't see any information to suggest this card isn't compatible with the 950 XL.<br />

<p>microSD contain a controller to translate the requests of the phone to the internal memory address(es). This controller is software. Therefore, you could face an interoperability issue. With an interoperability software-bug both parties are guilty, normally.
 A professionally working company would take you feedback and test your microSD. However, Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers for bug-reporting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am receiving my Lexar UHS-Ⅱ these days and going to double-check your findings. Perhaps just your sample is faulty. By the way, we do not have any indications that Microsoft supports UHS-Ⅱ already. This should not be a compatible issue. However, you are
 wasting resources because the interface might just be&nbsp;UHS-Ⅰ or even lower. Therefore,

            I checked. The listed specs of a 950 XL dual sim give bus speed as UHS-1. I got a 128 Gb Samsung EVO UHS-1 microSDXC card from SamsungUSA (paid tax but free shipping) on 11/30/15. Works great.

            <p>I read in the question that Microsoft have already 'acknowledged' there is a memory card problem
</p>
<p><strong>I received the new firmware with the last update on my Lumia 950 XL, unfortunately it didn't fix anything regarding my micro SD card:</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>As I don't own a 950/950XL I can't add any user experience to the question, but there are too many similar reports to say it is a faulty memory card issue, the answer is to find where the fault is, that we do by elimination

specifications</a> for the 950 / 950 XL include a note #5 in regards to compatibility which include therefore the purchased item
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that there is a significant amount (albeit a low overall percentage of total sales) who have similar problems all being Lumia 950 / 950 .</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The questions posted by 950 / 950 XL now dominate the forum and genuine cards may not be at fault in these cases (Storage battery heat are others.)</strong></p>

            <p>very interessting to see that this is not a single problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it seems that there is a communication issue between OS driver (Windows 10) and the SD card controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also us an 128GB ultra SD Card from SanDisk. I would expect, that SanDisk has a high Quality standard. And therfore I also expect that there might be test with diferent SD Cards on both side SanDisk and Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The used SanDisk Card was properrly working fo quite a long time. And now I get strange behavior and lost my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the beginning, I have recognized that the card was not anymore detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after I have tried to recover and reformat the card it was working again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>then I tried the card again and now I detect that the card still detected, but all data seems to be lost.
</p>
<p>I get the information from the Data Explorer that the card is empty. </p>
<p>The Storage application doesn't detect the card. So it seems that there are also conflicts to give the right information from the OS or teh applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume taht there might be an file system crash, so I wil try again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>finally I will also contact SanDisk for checking the card (if they will be in spec).If they are in Spec, it might be a blame for Microsoft and also for the Lumina phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In best case there migt be an update patch for supporting such cards. So I hope there will be an BugFix soon. I just updating my system up to the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Samsung Card might not have any problems, I will try it as alternative. And communicate this to SanDisk.</p>
<p>

            It's my vague recollection that since the time of my original post on a couple of Fast Ring Insider Builds, I've gotten a message that my card needs to be scanned for errors a time or two, but overall, especially with the most recent Insider Builds, I've
 had no problems.&nbsp; Hopefully, for anyone still having a problem, the official 1607 Anniversary Update of Win10 Mobile will fix you up.&nbsp; If not, maybe it's a disagreement between that specific model/brand card and your device and it's worth switching model/brand
 of card to one that works smoothly or taking your device to a Microsoft Store, if you're lucky enough to have one nearby, for examination of your phone&nbsp; and a possible switch-out while it's still under warranty.

    <title>Install Windows 10 9926 dual-boot from within Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> visageofanangel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Windows 10 9926 dual-boot from within Windows 8.1</h2>
                    The last major build that was released I was able to perform a custom install simply from mounting the ISO in Win 8.1 but that option apparently is no longer available for some reason as the installer just wants to over-write my existing 8.1 install.<br />
<br />
I tried installing from a USB/DVD at boot but have to enable legacy mode which disable UEFI (and GTP access). &nbsp;Not really a fan of VMs either.<br />

Is there a simple way of setting a custom install path with the 9926 build from within a Win 8.1 environment?<br />
<br />
Edit: &nbsp;For posterity, who hopefully don't forget simple things like I have, \sources\setup.exe as opposed to \setup.exe

<h2>            How do I combine slideshows&#63;  Apply keep source formatting to multiple pasted slides&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using Powerpoint 2016 I'm trying to copy slides from different slideshows into a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the "reuse slides" function but it doesn't give me the option to copy individual slides like all the demos say, it just automatically inserts the whole slideshow.....which would be great as that's what I want but it changes some of the font
 colours and backgrounds (eg black to white so you can't see the text anymore).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do this individually copying each slide I can select "keep source formatting" for each slide, but can't figure out how to apply that to copying more than one slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a way??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Changing Conditional Formatting cells an existing rule applies to and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wendy5837  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Conditional Formatting cells an existing rule applies to and clicking &#34;Apply&#34; does nothing</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Excel for YEARS and am fairly proficient at it. What I'm trying to achieve is something I do to my workbook almost every day, but today something is wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a client database that I manage via Excel Workbook, as the database changes I have to download new information and merge it with my existing information. Doing this involves deleting &amp; inserting rows which always throws off which cells my Conditional
 Formatting is assigned to. For example, I'll have a rule which I'd like applied to an entire column, such as
<em>=$AX:$AX </em>but after my editing, will show something like =$AX$1:$AX$6770 so I open Conditional Formatting Rules Manager, fix which cells I want formatted, click Apply and I'm back in business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, however, when I click on Apply, nothing changes. It's as if the rule still only applies to the chopped up bits of my column. I've tried closing Excel and reopening it to see if the Conditional Formatting actually got applied to the cells that are
 designated, but it does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rely on this feature heavily to manage my clients. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit*</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did copy this data and paste it into a new sheet within the same workbook by pasting special "Values &amp; Source Formatting" I didn't think this would be an issue since I know I've done it before, but when I expanded the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager
 to show rules for the current selection, this workbook, and different sheets, the sheet I was working with was not showing for some reason? I don't know if there's a way to take the formatting that is applied to this sheet, which is not listed as a sheet in
 the workbook according to the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager, and somehow get the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager to acknowledge this sheet?</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your input, unfortunately this didn't work. Since I need the formatting to apply to the entire column, I modified the formula slightly since my AQ2 didn't equal Yes. I tried
<strong>Cell Value =$AQ$9="YES" </strong>which was the 1st value in column AQ for YES, nothing changed. I then
<strong>Cell Value = $AQ$2:$AQ$10000= "YES" </strong>and applied, nothing changed.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I think I realized a part of my problem, the workbook's Conditioanl Formatting Rules Manager doesn't recognize my sheet. In my case, I'm working on "Sheet: Running Log" but that's not listed. I don't know how to induce the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager
 to acknowledge this sheet.</p>

    <title>Word 2010 Macro to list if there are modified styles &#40;&#43;&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2010 Macro to list if there are modified styles &#40;&#43;&#41; in a document.</h2>
                    I am trying to create a macro, using VBA, that will list if a modified style is in a document. For example Nomal + Bold. I know these can show up in the Styles pane, so there must be some way to find them. Does anyone know how to find them through VBA?

            <p>"Normal + Bold" is not a style, but a style + direct formatting. These can't be accessed in VBA. Note that you can find and replace formatting, if that helps. What are you trying to accomplish? Please elaborate.</p>

            We have many documents that use a specific style set. When we edit these documents there is an opportunity for additional styles to get into the document. Right now I have a macro that will show if a style is not in our approved list. This macro can not
 detect if there is a style + direct formatting. I would like to be able to use the macro to list if these styles are located in the document.

            If your objective is to get rid of direct formatting, you can simply select all content and press Ctrl+Q (clears direct paragraph formatting) and then Ctrl+SpaceBar (clears direct font formatting). In code, use the Reset method on ParagraphFormat and Font
 objects, respectively.

            Hi Smith,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that your 3G USB modem does not get recognized on Windows 10. This issue could be due to incompatibility of the 3G modem driver software with Windows 10 Technical preview. I will surely assist you in troubleshooting the problem.</div>

<div>Just a few questions to get a clear picture of this issue:<br />
1. What is the make and model of you computer?</div>
<div>2. Have you installed the latest Windows updates available for Windows 10 Technical preview.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the methods below and check if it works.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong>- If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues
 and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>You may contact&nbsp;Huawei Support to see if any software/driver updates are available for Windows 10 Technical preview.
<div>If not, you may try installing the 3G modem software in&nbsp;compatibility mode and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow these steps to install the driver in compatibility mode and <br />
check.</div>
<div>a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</div>
<div>b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘properties’.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Few more questions to get a clear picture:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Is this issue specific to this device? Have you tried other USB devices on Windows 10 Technical preview?</div>
<div>2. Have you tried&nbsp;other USB ports and checked if you are facing this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>Kindly check for Windows updates. Install the latest build 9860. You will find the build version on the right bottom corner of your desktop. Also check&nbsp;for any optional updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out this website for more information on Build 9860.</p>

<div><br />
You may get in touch with the device manufacturer to check for firmware upgrade for the product.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps.</div>

<p>We need to know the make and model of the laptop, what version of Insider you are running. Hopefully we can work out after that.</p>

                    <p>After the patch 16.0.6366.2062 concatenation of non standard types no longer works. Even using cstr() on non-standard types fails.</p>

</p><p>Hello, I work at Microsoft on the Excel team.&nbsp; As you mention, I'm unable to reproduce the problem with VBA's built in standard string types.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could supply the CString class you are using so we can reproduce your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Outlook can&#39;t upgrade your database message on upgrade to ,pst recent version</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Outlook for years on my Mac. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the last two upgrades have resulted in Outlook being unable to launch. &nbsp;The message about upgrading the database is followed by an error log location which does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution has been to use Time Machine to revert the Outlook files to pre-upgrade and hope that it's fixed in the next version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no luck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think it's a virus. I would advise you to try a soft reset by pressing and holding both power button and volume down button for 10 seconds. The phone should vibrate and reboots.</p>
<p>After that, check if this string of characters still appear.</p>

<h2>            Setting up Gmail with Microsoft Outlook 2007</h2>
                    <p>I am going through an initial setup on Microsoft Outlook 2007 and when I attempt to 'test account settings' I can get Outlook to connect to the incoming mail server but when it attempts to send a test email I get the following error response...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Send test e-mail message: Your server does not support the connection encryption type you have specified. Try changing the encryption method. Contact your mail server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP) for additional assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> pat8888888  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook crashing &#38; auto-save not working</h2>
                    <p>In the past&nbsp;4-5 weeks Outlook as crashed on quite a few occasions whilst I am in the middle of preparing an email&nbsp;i.e. 'Microsoft outlook has to close...'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook has crashed&nbsp;intermittently - but&nbsp;has happened 3 times today already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As importantly, my &lt;automatically save&gt; option in settings is set to 3 minutes and, although I've been&nbsp;drafting my reply for more than 15 minutes&nbsp;in some cases, when Outlook re-opens I am unable to recover my draft reply - either in the drafts folder, the
 sent folder&nbsp;or the deleted items folder. Thus, Outlook has not automatically saved my reply as per my settings,&nbsp;but has&nbsp;wiped it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is extremely inefficient to say the least, especially as yesterday&nbsp;I had been drafting my reply for more than 20-minutes and was about to send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;am using Microsoft Office 2013&nbsp;on&nbsp;windows 7 and&nbsp;updates are current. I run Kaspersky internet security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone assist with a solution? </p>
