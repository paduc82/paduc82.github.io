<h2>            PDF Manual</h2>
                    &nbsp;I started the training program for Microsoft Office 2010. I am totally lost as far notes step by step instructions are concern. I like the free training but is there a PDF Manual that I can download also.<br />

<h2>            MS Photo App Comparable to Google Photos</h2>
                    <p>Is Microsoft working on an app comparable to Google Photos? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in an office of a couple hundred employees and need to manage/give them access to over 90,000 photos. &nbsp;We all have a Microsoft accounts. Windows Photo Gallery was working great on our local servers, but now it is not supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Photos is quite amazing for organizing, tagging, searching, minor adjustments, and sharing. &nbsp;Similarly, Windows Photo Gallery was good in all those things, but everybody had access to the photos and it integrated into local storage/copying easily.
 &nbsp;Google Photos isn't exactly setup for multiple users or administrators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me Office 365 or One Drive will be coming out with a photo app that we can all use and upload good resolution at no cost (just like Google)</p>

<h2>            Extremely Troubled and Concerned</h2>
                    <p>I want better security. </p>
<p>with includes the inability for our government to access our machines and implant spy ware.</p>
<p>In to our machines. </p>
<p>
</p><p>it is not right for our antispyware to be bypassed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want windows to lock down our HDD so they can not be tampered with.</p>
<p>And here is where I got that information from.</p>
<p>(Reuters) - The U.S. National Security Agency has figured out how to hide spying software deep within hard drives made by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba and other top manufacturers, giving the agency the means to eavesdrop on the majority of the world's
 computers, according to cyber researchers and former operatives.<br />
</p>
<br />
That long-sought and closely guarded ability was part of a cluster of spying programs discovered by Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based security software maker that has exposed a series of Western cyberespionage operations.<br />
<br />
Kaspersky said it found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs, with the most infections seen in Iran, followed by Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Mali, Syria, Yemen and Algeria. The targets included government
 and military institutions, telecommunication companies, banks, energy companies, nuclear researchers, media, and Islamic activists, Kaspersky said. (reut.rs/1L5knm0)

            <p>I get what you're asking, but when a party is physically intercepting shipments and tampering with the hardware, there's nothing you can do. Once the attacker has physical access, it's game over. You can put as many blocks into preventing tampering and there
 will always be a way to tamper it.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Over the years i have come to accept that any hardware connected to a cellphone service is unsecure and&nbsp; and knowing this, i just dont do it&nbsp; on those devices.banking, pay bills ect. last few years my computer has turned to be the same, i dont bank or anything
 on it anymore. its more secure to just drive to bank or snail-mail payments and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Microsoft dont make it hard for anybody anymore to commandeer a pc, especially in win10. by default anything can use the camera, microphone, HDD's,esata's, and i would even suspect that your cloud accounts to be included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it came up in another thread a while ago that my info was safer being up on microsofts cloud rather than being locked up in my liberty gunsafe. things like the NSA/CIA/DHS are doing make these points pretty moot, infection can run from one device to another
 in most cases probably.The government is not our friend. they have labeled the majority of the citizens of the US homegrown terrorists and i see no reason why they would not use this technology against us.if they are doing it to these people and govts, they
 are doing it to us! Most likely they are in cahoots with hardware manufacturers to put the stuff on the hardware at the manufacturing stage. i doubt they hijack freight trucks to install stuff like this.</p>

                    Access Novice here:&nbsp; I have several combo box lists that when I add to them (I enter them alphabetically), they remove the last item on the list.&nbsp; I never get an error message I just happened to notice it.&nbsp; Also I have them set to No limit on list length.&nbsp;

<p>I'm sorry, you may need to be a little more helpful here.&nbsp; First, let's just talk about one combo box.&nbsp; Is it&nbsp;bound to an underlying field?&nbsp; In otherwords, is the property 'Control Source' set to a field name?&nbsp; Next, how are you using the property 'Row Source?'&nbsp;
 Is it set to a query to look up values from either the field you are working with or some other look up table?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The property 'Limit To List' says that the control will accept values not already stored in the combo box list.&nbsp; That's all it's doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether your control is bound or unbound makes no difference.&nbsp; If your control looks up information from a field that
 it is bound to, then after you update your record, the new value will become available when the control is requeried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it sounds like to me is that your control is bound to a field.&nbsp; Forget for a moment that the combo box has a list to display options.&nbsp; Consider it as a plain text box.&nbsp; What you are probably doing is replacing the current value of the underlying field
 for the&nbsp;current record.&nbsp; That is why you are losing a value after you type the new one in.</p>
<p>Not knowing any more than what you have here, this is the best I can help you at this point.&nbsp;</p>

            Apollo is exactly correct. For us to help you, we need to know the ControlSource and RowSource properties of your combo.

<p>Okay, for some reason the response I wrote yesterday never showed up, so I'll try again.&nbsp; I opened my table, added a field for vehicles and projects worked on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I populated this field list with my own values....not from another list or table.&nbsp; When I look
 at resumes I will see additional vehicles/projects people work on, so I add them to the list by clicking on the list arrow then I click on the very light icon over/under the list for adding.&nbsp; I&nbsp;add the item where I want it alphabetically and&nbsp;I never get an
 error message.&nbsp; When I open that again&nbsp;I just happened to notice that the last item in the list "goes away".&nbsp; On the Property Sheet, the Control Source has the name of the field in it and the Row Source has the list that I typed into it.&nbsp; This is very frustrating...I
 don't want to sound dumb, but I really don't understand computers.&nbsp; (I am using the book "Access 2007 for Dummies"...that should tell you something!!!)&nbsp; I hope I was able to clarify my problem for you.&nbsp; Thank you for any help you may offer.</p>
<p>(I also have it so that I can choose as many of the items on the list as apply.)</p>

<p>You were asked to provide the Control and Row Sources for the control. But it sounds like you are using a Value List. To add items to a value list you need to do it programatically. Which is much harder.</p>
<p>Instead since you want to be able to add whatever is types, set the RowSource Type to Tabel/Query and set the RwoSource to:</p>
<p>SELECT DISTINCT fieldname FROM tablename ORDER BY Fieldname;</p>
<p>Where fieldname is the name of the field you are storing the value in and tablename is the name of the table the form is bound to. The combobox will display an alphabetized list of all the values previously entered. If you then set the Limit To List property
 to No, anything you type will be stored in the field and added to the list.</p>
<p>It is not recommended that you do this, however. A better way is to use a lookup table to populate the list, then use the NotInList event to add new items if necessary. See the links Roger gave you for more on that.</p>

<h2>            Out of office messages - NOT &#34;On Vacation&#34; messages - PLEASE&#33;</h2>
                    in Hotmail/aka Outlook.com - Your auto message says "Out of office VACATION" response even though I have typed a specific customized auto reply that says I am out of office on business - everyone says "you were on vacation" or are "you back from vacation?"&nbsp;
 because the RE: says Out of Office Vacation.&nbsp; I DON'T want a vacation Re: line - people are out of office for other reasons.<br />
<br />
PLEASE change this feature so that people can type their own response without the RE: line saying "On Vacation"&nbsp; The Re: line should say
<b>"Out of Office"&nbsp;</b> ONLY!!! <br />
<br />
Do you programmers have ANY idea whatsoever how people conduct business???<br />

            <p>Again, the "Re" needs to change from reading "On Vacation" to simply "Out of Office"</p>
<p>
</p><p>An easy fix -- then a personalized message can say whatever the individual wants - on vacation, or whatever, point being when the RE says "On Vacation" readers don't even open it and assume you're gone for days or out not doing your job when in fact I am
 out for business reasons.</p>

    <title>PDFs extraordinarily huge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petermairhofer  say:</h3>
<h2>            PDFs extraordinarily huge</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
When I save my notes as PDF (no matter if via Save-As or printing via PDFCreator/Acrobat Distiller) the PDFs become unacceptably huge.<br />
<br />
Handwritten text with some images which took less than 1 MB with Journal have up to 50 MB (!!!) in OneNote.<br />
<br />
I just tested ... a simple, handwritten, letter-size page without any images ... 1.5MB. That's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
That's unacceptable ... how to send such pages via E-Mail?<br />
<br />
Any option to decrease quality/size/...?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

Yes, all updates installed.<br />
No, never worked properly.<br />

Just try it ... write some pages handwritten and create a PDF.<br />
I can also upload a sample file ...<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here are sample files, just one page but the PDF incredible 2.5MB. You can easily imagine that a simple document containing a dozens of pages sums up to almost 100MB.<br />
<br />
Journal as well as PDF Annotator create PDF files in the kb range for the same information.<br />
<br />

https://www.dropbox.com/s/monykrwhegun5ll/HugeOneNote.pdf<br />
<br />
If there is any hope, pleeeeease, I would be very happy.<br />
Currently I have no other option than not using OneNote, these huge file sizes are a desaster :(<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Peter<br />
<br />
PS: Also The OneNote files itself are huge but it is not so problematic in this case. But I need PDFs to archive notes and to send them via email.<br />

            Handwriting / Ink is hard to handle. It creates large files.<br />
<br />
How did you create the PDF? The only built in option I found was Export.&nbsp; It created a PDF about the size you described.<br />
<br />
However, I also have a 3rd party PDR Printer driver. When I used it via File &gt; Print the file size was about half the size:<br />
<br />
*.ONE = 1,192 KB<br />
*.PDF via export = 1,286 KB<br />
*.PDF via Print = 788 KB<br />
<br />
I use BullZip printer driver, but there are other free ones.<br />

<p>Hi Warren,</p>
<p>Given the logs, we find out that the folder /sites/msip-eddr/proj/eddra/arch/Specifications/C*****er T***g B*****s/Calcs" is causing a conflict. Could you follow the steps below to remove the folder and re-sync the library to check the outcome?</p>
<p>1. Exit all Office applications including OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>2. Download and run the Fix it tool from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627</a> to clear the OneDrive for Business cache.</p>
<p>3. After clearing the cache, please make sure the following two locations are empty. If not, please manually empty them.</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\OfficeFileCache</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Spw</p>
<p>4. Navigate to https://contoso.sharepoint.com//sites/msip-eddr/proj/eddra/arch/Specifications/C*****er T***g B*****s/ in the browser and check if the folder "Calcs" exists. If so, remove the folder there. You can backup the contents in the folder by copying
 them to your local computer via the Open with Explorer feature. For your reference:</p>

    <title>Build 10130 update issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10130 update issue</h2>
                    I installed build 10300 as an upgrade over 8.1 pro 64-bit. When I click on settings and then update, I can see a list of updates, one of which says that it is installing, although it's been that way for the past two days. Another group says waiting to
 download, again not doing anything for at least the past day. I thought perhaps it was waiting for the computer to be idle. After being idle overnight, nothing changed. I'm using the free version of Avira AntiVirus and the Windows firewall. I turned the AV
 off and the issue persists. I believe I checked to make sure that the two services for update are running thru the command line. I'm concerned about not getting the next build as well as the security and driver updates. Any ideas? Thanks.

            <p>Hello Randall,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per&nbsp;description, you are unable to install the windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may face this issue due to some corruption in system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps&nbsp;given below and&nbsp; then try to install the windows updates</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step1: Run DISM tool Command</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) installs, uninstalls, configures, and updates the features and CBS packages in offline Windows Embedded&nbsp;images and offline Windows Pre installation Environment (Windows PE) 4.0 images. The commands
 and options that are available for servicing an image depend on whether the image is offline or online. All commands work on an offline Standard 8 image. Subsets of the commands are available for servicing a running operating system.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After running the DISM command I would suggest you to run sfc scan&nbsp;and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 2:</span></strong><strong><span>System File Checker.
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may run the system file checker tool and check if it helps. SFC scan will scan for the corrupted system files on the computer. You may refer to the following article in order to use System File Checker tool appropriately.

<h2>            E6, sync with gmail, error &#38;quot&#59;invalid remote database&#38;quot&#59; ,</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to synchronize my Google calendar with Nokia E6.</p>
<p>I go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>MENU -&gt; SETTINGS -&gt; CONNECTIVITY -&gt; DATA MANAGER -&gt; SYNC&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the new profile I created as guided on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://nokiadownloadblog.com/guides/tipsync-google-contacts-nokia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nokiadownloadblog.com/guides/tipsync-google-contacts-nokia/Ôªø</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I synchronize I got an error:</p>
<p><strong>invalid remote databaseÔªø</strong></p>
<p>I check calendar name in gmail and in Nokia sync profile. In both ways the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea what does "<strong>invalid remote databaseÔªø</strong>Ôªø" mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can synch native Outlook with the Ovi suite, not over the air. MfE works well for Outlook + Exchange and Gmail environments.</p>
<p>There are some things that suck on the E6, but this is not one of them.</p>

<p>thanks a lot for asking!</p>
<p>yes i resolved the issue somehow. i must admit i tried so many different things over the period of many days that i couldnt pinpoint the exakt step or combination of steps that fixed it.</p>
<p>but i do know that i tried something called DISM mentioned on this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness-tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>then a little later i stumbled across this windows-update-fixing-tool and page from microsoft which already really helped me a lot on another machine, so i gave it several tries, where each time it fixed something with incompletely downloaded files but finally
 i believe it failed on not beeing able to start a non-running service related to windows update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and finally- and i think this really ultimately did the trick although it left me a little ashamed that i hadnt known this was part of windows - just quite well hidden in the guts of the control-panel (this was much nicer integrated into windows 10 settings
 with the latest update):</p>
<p>if you search for troubleshooting in control-panel then theres below "System and Security" a point "Fix problems with Windows Update". this took some time and claimed to fix a corruption in some update-database or something similar...i dont remember the
 exact phrase.</p>
<p>here a screenshot of that part in control center:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbf4dc91-7ef4-4a77-8f59-1453a941f8a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbf4dc91-7ef4-4a77-8f59-1453a941f8a9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and here the same today in settings-app on windows 10 after creators-update (sorry for just having a german screenshot, the english machine isnt on redstone2 yet):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca4d4c0d-99ac-46c4-80fa-d1b65e525238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca4d4c0d-99ac-46c4-80fa-d1b65e525238" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;i hope maybe those infos can help others that stumble across the same or similar issues :)</p>
<p>and again-thanks for asking, but its resolved for me so far :)</p>

            <p>Ok, I had this problem for months and no one seemed to have an answer for it (not even Microsoft). Now, we want to blame technology and not own any of the responsibility when it fails to meet our needs/expectations; I am guilty of this too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrated with this "unwanted folder" problem, and seeing that Microsoft itself only gave silly instructions of filtering problems, I looked at it from a different angle and fixed it with no problem whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, we need to step back and look at the problem, which is "somehow, legitimate emails are landing in this outlook folder even though they are not on a spam or filter list." Right? Again, I had this same problem. Why? Because in a world of technology,
 the programmers and code writers can only go so far with their fixes. We, the users, have to own some of the responsibility and realize it might not be a technology problem, but a user problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the answer...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, count up your technology devices (tablets, smartphones, laptops, desktop computers, et cetera). Now, most people are having this issue on their Laptops or Desktops computers that are running Outlook, right? But, they forget about the MailApps on their
 phones and tablets. This problem has nothing to do with Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo or any other web-based email provider. It has to do with our multitude of personal inputs on various technology devices without having the discipline of making sure nothing is conflicting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Easy fix:</p>
<p>Go into the E-Mail app (on the phone or tablet)<br />
Press the Menu Key, select Settings, then General Settings (it may be in different location on different devices).<br />
Select Spam addresses and remove any addresses that should not be in there (i.e. your mom's email address)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the problem. I was looking at Outlook as the problem and cursing Microsoft, but my phone had a separate spam/filter list that contained the addresses/domains that kept showing up in the "unwanted folder". Why? Because outlook is set up (generally)
 using IMAP or PoP3 email accounts. It's the same with the phone or tablet, but the two programs don't communicate. They simply talk to the mail server of whatever email domain you are using. My Outlook was telling the mail server "there are no spam/filtered
 addresses", but my phone was telling the mail server "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" was spam. Outlook got confused, and simply dumped the emails into the "unwanted folder" because it didn't know what to do with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my advice... go into all of your portable technology devices and check the spam lists or filter lists. I bet the addresses somehow ended up on one of those lists in phone/tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            <p>Dr. Duct-Tape,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for a clean, smart answer. It is absolutely correct. My Samsung S6 was the culprit. At one time, I must have swiped or tapped an email (incorrectly indicating it was spam or junk), and the addresses were tagged as such.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into my phone's email menu, checked the Spam Addresses, and there they were. I removed them. All is well. Such a simple, human error cause.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>...sometimes the problem with technology is humans. ;-)</p>
<p>

<p>could you please let us know your detailed steps about how you moved multiple emails with same subject line to a folder so that we are able to reproduce the issue?</p>
<p>moreover, appreciate you could also share with us the following information:<br />
1. let us know your detailed outlook client version you are using. make sure it‚Äôs up to date.<br />
2. if you try it in <a href="http://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>, do these moved emails show up in the new folder?<br />
3. are these unmoved emails still in their original folder? if not, where are they?<br />
4. let us know whether there are some differences between moved items and unmoved items.</p>
<p>in addition, please try to use<strong> conversation view</strong>, you will find all related threads, and move to a folder.</p>
<p><em><strong>use conversation view</strong></em></p>

<h2>            Move Options when right clicking on an e-mail in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    
<p>i am guessing within the last few days there was an update to outlook 2016.&nbsp; i constantly am getting e-mails i want to delete immediately in my outlook.&nbsp; i always just right click then choose delete but now the archive button is at the bottom so i have to
 remember to scroll up to click delete. i want delete at the bottom of my option list, not archive. is there any way to take archive off or move it so delete is at the bottom?</p>

<p>Hi Hale,</p>
<p>I installed OneDrive for Business sync client from your link (kb29039849) but when the installation finished an activation license dialog box appears, I entered my office 365 usermame and password (with Business Essenstial License) but the another message
 appears: "This account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** isn't associated with this office product. To activate this install. please sign in with the account with your product [...]", I tried to insert a office 365 user credential with Business Premium license and the error
 message doesn't appear. Are you sure that a O365 user with Business Essentials license can use OneDrive for Business installed on a Windows Desktop?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
