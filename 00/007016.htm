<h2>            How to get published office365 calendar to have more than 6 months of events</h2>
                    <p>Office 365 published calendars seem to have only 6 months of events even though the original calendars contain data for years.&nbsp; This is true for both the .ics and the .html views of the published calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the calendar to show a longer period?</p>

            <p>Hi Cbhtcomputers,<br />
<br />
The default date range value of the published Office 365 calendar is 6 months. If you want to change the value to a longer period, you need to be an Office 365 administrator in your organization. Here are the steps to change it:<br />
1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online with remote PowerShell</a>.<br />
2. Run the command below. </p>
<p><strong><em><span>Set-MailboxCalendarFolder -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Calendar –PublishEnabled $true -PublishDateRangeFrom SixMonths -PublishDateRangeTo OneYear&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: 1. Replace <strong><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em></strong> with your own email address.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. The date range value can only be change to these values: OneDay, ThreeDays, OneWeek, OneMonth, ThreeMonth, SixMonth, OneYear</span>. So you can extend the value to at most one year.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you encounter any problem during the procedure, feel free to let us know and we will assist you further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            OneNote 2013 Inking Scaling Issue</h2>
                    <p>While taking notes using my stylus and inking I realized I have been zooming in way too close and writing at about 11% zoom. &nbsp;Is there a way I can select all of my text or my notebook and readjust this to where my handwriting is readable at 100% zoom instead
 of having to be zoomed in to 11%? &nbsp;This is causing major issues trying to read things and/or using zoom effectively.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />Do you have an issue only with outlook.com website?
<br />What happens when you download files from different websites?
<br />Could you try to use different browser?
<br />Did you try temporary to turn off antivirus?
<br />

<p>Hi, Mark!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>•I tried downloading a YouTube video and had no problems downloading and opening it. I also went back to attachments in my email account and found ones that I previously had opened are now locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>•I tried Firefox and logged into my email account and could not open the attachments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>• I did not touch the antivirus mainly because I'm not sure if I have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all began Monday. I had not problems opening attachments over the weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>While this sequence is not ideal, I was able to open the files that I needed by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom of the left hand column, select the three dots and open Files.</p>
<p>Under Attachments, open the desired file.</p>
<p>Select Print at the top of the opened file and Save as PDF.</p>
<p>With the file now on the computer, Open the PDF.</p>
<p>Select Save As... under File, name the PDF file, and save it to the computer.</p>
<p>Double click on the saved file and it opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very roundabout but it opened my files. Please tell me that this is not the way that I will need to use to open attachments from here on out.</p>

    <title>Sharepoint Libraries sync for External Users - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spoon_22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint Libraries sync for External Users</h2>
                    <p>I have external sharing turned on i my Office 365 organization, and have site collections shared with external users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until a few days ago, those external users were able to use the OneDrive for Business sync client (groove) to sync Sharepoint Online libraries they had permissions to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, sync for external users appears to have broken - after clicking "Sync" in the site library, users are given a log-in prompt that says "Tell us the account you want to use to open X" - entering the same credentials they use to successfully access the
 site through the browser, they are instead given the same log-in prompt again in an endless loop. Closing the log-in prompt results in the "Can't connect to the specified site" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen posts elsewhere about this log-in loop, but none of the solutions I found resolved the issue, and none of the other posts appear to be specific to external users using the Groove client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know that external users don't have a personal OneDrive for Business library - I'm asking only about Sharepoint document libraries in a site which the external users have full access to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for external users to sync Sharepoint libraries? Any ideas why it was working a few days ago and just stopped (Sharepoint Online update maybe?). Is there a workaround to the log-in loop?</p>
<p />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I think I've come up with a workaround that seems to be working for now. It's a combination of previously suggested steps, but has to be performed in the correct order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Clear the cached credentials in the Windows Credential Manager (or using keymgr.dll, not sure if it matters which you use)</p>
<p>2) Reboot (not 100% sure this is necessary, but had some mixed results)</p>
<p>3) Log in to the site via Internet Explorer and check the "Keep me logged in" box</p>
<p>4) Try to resync the library with OneDrive for Business</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step #3 seems to be the key to getting OneDrive for Business to recognize the credentials - I had tried checking the "Keep me logged in" box in IE before, but it appears to only work AFTER you've cleared the cached credentials first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran into a side issue where it appears that there are some issues with Sharepoint Online granting permissions to the correct accounts when two different external users share the same first/last name - entering an email address into the "Share" box
 converts it to a first/last name, and results are mixed which account it chooses after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have it working for now - but I would still suggest that the "login loop" described above should be considered a bug. When OneDrive for Business prompts you for credentials and you enter a valid account, it should authenticate you (especially when
 you're already getting a valid auth token back over the wire) - not opaquely force the user to have manually run a DLL to clear credentials and then log in via a separate application, with no prompt or instructions to do so.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a sharepoint list - and i like to enter guidelines in the description.</p>
<p>i prefer the look of modern view when VIEWING. as I can show JSON code etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>but editing is far better feel on classic view!</p>
<p>rather than switching back and forth...between views</p>
<p>is there way to improve the way the description shows on modern view?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Classic view on the right you can see its far easier to read because its on different lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Modern just clumps in all together....</p>

<p><span>Hi VDatt,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no out-of-the-box option to change the description format of the column to what is showed in the classic site page in the modern site page in SharePoint Online now. You may
 use some programming ways. I suggest you post a new thread on our <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointdevelopment&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN forum</a> to see if there is a customized way to apply a solution to the modern site page. Meanwhile, if you need an out-of-the-box option to change the behavior, I suggest you submit your feedback on our
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint UserVoice</a> as it is the direct way for our product developers to know users’ requirements and improve our products.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            By Msft's own admission, the modern version is more of a beta test than a finished product so I'd avoid it. It's not hard to replicate the modern look on a classic site if that's what you're after.

<p>
</p><p>As you can see the right hand (modern) side looks much more like a dashboard than the left hand (classic side)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bear in mind i only found this JSON code online!</p>
<p>i am by no means a sharepoint guru! I've just been given my own sharepoint site to play with to work on a potential project dashboard.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>but i would like it to look half decent of course whilst having ease of use!!</p>

    <title>Cannot search Skype Directory on Skype Web - Chromebook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot search Skype Directory on Skype Web - Chromebook</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a chromebook for work. The company I work for uses gsuite but have it locked down so that I cannot access the play store and therefore cannot install the Skype App from the play store. I am therefore using Skype Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Skype Web I am unable to seach for contacts nor am I able to click on contacts shared with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current workaround is to search for the person I am looking for on my Android phone and add them and then they appear on my Skype Web session on my chromebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is anything else I can do as this becomes annoying. I have already tried to delete my browsing history but that did not do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There are times when you will be able to search for an account in the directory using the web version of Skype, sometimes it displays no results found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works when clicking the search directory button, I can suggest clicking it instead of hitting enter on your keyboard.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 - &#34;The server is not available&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Running Microsoft Office Professional 2003 on Windows XP SP3.&nbsp; Everything had been working fine for a long time, then one morning when I fired up my PC and tried to start Outlook, I get the error message: "Task
 'Microsoft Exchange Server' reported error (0x8004011D): 'The server is not available.'"&nbsp; I am able to successfully get to my email if I login using someone else's machine, and other people who can bring up Outlook from their machine cannot do so from my machine,
 so it seems to be something local to my machine but not to my specific login profile.&nbsp; As I mentioned, others can successfully connect to the same Exchange server, so it doesn't seem to be a problem with the server.&nbsp; I can successfully access my account via
 Internet, and I can successfully ping the Exchange server.&nbsp; The only thing that I can see that happened between the last time I could connect to the server and now is that the fix for KB2598361 was applied
 to my machine, but that may just be a coincidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen lots of people report this error, but I haven't found anything that applies or resolves the problem.&nbsp; It seems very odd that a machine that was working perfectly for a long time suddenly has this error, and that it is local to
 just this machine, but maybe that can help narrow down where the problem lies?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Hi Rabia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You'll receive the error code <strong>30016-4</strong> if the installation file of Office got corrupted or there are still Office components saved on the computer even after uninstalling it. That being said, a series of troubleshooting steps will be done
 to determine what's causing the issue. However, before we proceed, we would like to know more about this concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Based on your description, what do you mean by <strong>uni login</strong>?</li><li>How did you uninstall Office?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error code that you are getting? <span style="font-weight: bold">
Note:</span> Please do not include any personal information.</li></ul>
<p>

<p>The address book is just a view of your Contacts' electronic addresses, so you won't need to "move" anything. You just need to configure the address book view:</p>

    <title>Active tasks filter changed from WM 2003SE to WM6.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benoitvm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Active tasks filter changed from WM 2003SE to WM6.1</h2>
                    With my previous device running WM 2003 SE (HTC/QTEK S100), the "active tasks" filter for tasks would only display tasks "not completed" AND "start date" =&lt; today.<br />
With my new device (HTC Touch 3G running WM 6.1) activating the "active tasks" filter shows all tasks that are "not completed", including tasks whose start date is in the future...<br />
This makes the list of displayed tasks unnecessarily cluttered (with tasks I should not be working on right now).<br />
I've browsed through the help file and manual, but that didn't help.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to have the same behavior as with WM2003 SE ?

    <title>Footnote disappears when I change its number in the text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mfelicitascurti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Footnote disappears when I change its number in the text</h2>
                    <p>I have revised &nbsp;my book manuscript and need to correct most of the footnote &nbsp;numbers. I can change the number in the footnote itself; but when I try to correct the number in the body text, the entire footnote disappears. I can insert the new, correct number,
 but can't delete the old, wrong number without deleting the footnote itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have this problem? I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions.</p>

            <p>To expand on what John has explained, if you overtype a footnote number at the bottom of the page, you break the footnotes. You end up with a like-formatted number that is not a footnote number and that will not change as you add or delete footnote references.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did that, replace it by a number copied from another footnote. It should auto-renumber (else, close and reopen the document).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To tell footnote references and numbers from similarly-formatted numbers, enable
</p>
<p><em>View &gt; All </em>in the "Nonprinting characters" section of Word's Preferences. Those that are footnote-related will show with a dotted frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below, the red superscript was obtained by overtyping the third footnote's number. Note the absence of a dotted frame.</p>

<h2>            2G and 3G cell monitoring software for Nokia N95</h2>
                    As far as I understand, Net Monitor application can be download in Nokia mobile phone for monitoring 2G cell parameters.<br />
<br />
Is there any sofware that can be installed and activated Nokia N95 phone to monitor 2G and 3G cell parameters in air interface?

            Hi ;-)<br />
Try this application:<br />
<br />
CellTrack91 - Version for S60 Symbian 3rd Generation<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.afischer-online.de/sos/celltrack/#newos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.afischer-online.de/sos/celltrack/#newos</a><br />
<br />
The main screen shows the GSM information.<br />
<br />
* Cellid<br />
the id from the actual cell<br />
<br />
* LAC<br />
the Location Area Code from your cell<br />
* Net<br />
the net you are moving in - e.g. 262 for Germany and 02 for Vodafone. If a W-CDMA/UMTS cell is present is shown here. The number has still 4 digits.<br />
* Name<br />
the name of the cell. This is shown by an algorithm when you select 'Cell Name from Id' in the settings. Or from the cell broadcast when you have turned 'Cell Name from CBS' on and have defined a service number. Otherwise one a '-' is shown. If both is turn
 on the CBS overwrites the generated name.<br />
* Signal<br />
shows the quality of the receive signal. The percentage value is taken from the Nokia phone API. The dBm values is covered with an at command (CellTrack62) or the newer API (CellTrack70).<br />
* Battery<br />
should show the capacity of your battery<br />
* Description<br />
shows the information from the database.<br />
* Diagram<br />
shows the dBm values as green and the percentage as black line. The red lines a cell changes<br />
<br />
I use on 6120c, works acceptible :)

            there is netmonitor software that can be run using python on the N95. You can also log calls with the GPS and if you work for a network operator you can load cell information onto the phone. the installation process is a bit complicated and involves downloading
 and signing 6 SIS files. But it all works. Screenshots and the program can be found at

<br />
click on the "Download PyNetMony 0.8.2" link to download the zip file. read the readme.txt file for instructions<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!<br />

</p><p>but when working on <strong>Outlook - mail, it will freeze up after about 5 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>sometimes it just "times out" even though the pause has been under one minute.</p>
<p>then it will either re-load very slowly, or stall out and never reload.&nbsp; continual "spin" cycle.</p>
<p>How can I keep it open and functional?</p>

<h2>            Command Button Increase Value by 1</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thanks for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a form where I enter records. &nbsp;Each row has 8 fields. &nbsp;1 of the fields is time (ObsTime) and one of the fields is a photo name (ImageName) &nbsp;that includes letters and an increasing numeric field (IMAG0001, IMAG0002, IMAG0003, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to create a command button that copies the last row entered, increases the value of the ObsTime by 1 minute (13:15 becomes 13:16) and increases the image name by 1 (i.e., IMAG0001 becomes IMAG0002). and then paste the updated record as a new record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, pretty new to access.</p>
<p>

            <p>While this can be done, I would change your structure. Since the image name is always prefixed by IMAG, why store it? Make your image number a Long Integer datatype. Then it will be easy to increment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>strSQL = "INSERT INTO tablename (ObsTime, ImageNumber, field3, etc.) " &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"VALUES(#" &amp; DateAdd("n",1,Me.ObsTime) &amp; "#, " &amp; Me.ImageNumber+1 &amp; ", " &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Me.control3, etc. &amp; ");"</p>
<p>CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above code will add a new record with an incremented ObsTime and ImageNumber. The rest of the fields will be copied from the current controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To display the number with the prefixe use the expression:</p>

            It's not clear whether your ObsTime values include a date, and are formatted as hh:nn, or whether they are the 'time value' only.&nbsp; If the former I'd suggest the following amendment to Scott's code:<br />
<br />
strSQL = "INSERT INTO tablename (ObsTime, ImageNumber, field3, etc.) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "VALUES(#" &amp; Format(DateAdd("n",1,Me.ObsTime),"yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn") &amp;_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "#, " &amp; Me.ImageNumber+1 &amp; ", " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.control3, etc. &amp; ");"<br />
<br />
As written the code would fail in the UK and elsewhere not using the US short date format.&nbsp; Formatting the value to the
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ISO standard for date/time notation</a> internationalizes the code.<br />
<br />
If the latter, then you should understand that there is in reality no such thing in Access as a 'time value' only a date/time value; it is really the time on 30 December 1899, which is 'day zero' in Access's implementation of the date/time data type.&nbsp; So the
 code would then be:<br />
<br />
strSQL = "INSERT INTO tablename (ObsTime, ImageNumber, field3, etc.) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "VALUES(#" &amp; Format(DateAdd("n",1,Me.ObsTime),"hh:nn") &amp;_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "#, " &amp; Me.ImageNumber+1 &amp; ", " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.control3, etc. &amp; ");"<br />
<br />
I have one question, however.&nbsp; What happens when the time reaches 23:59?&nbsp; In scenario 1 above, where the values include a date, then the value would increment to midnight, 00:00, at the start of the following day; in scenario 2, where the values are 'time values'
 they would revert to 00:00 at the start of 1899-12-30.<br />

<h2>            N97 Memory Reorganiser issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am really stumped. Everything I seem to do with this phone requires hours of trawling through forums. Am feeling like going with the flow and getting an iphone ASAP as my Nokia always seems to be such an effort... lock button now snapped off too...ahhh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been trying to follow previous posts on how to manage my memory and have no "<strong>Memory reorganiser
</strong>application" ﻿installation app present. I cannot find one to download on the website either. ﻿Not sure whether I have somehow deleted the app by mistake but cannot locate it anywhere that previous posts have suggested it is located.﻿</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have latest update V 22.0.110</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file manager says the following:</p>
<p>C: Phone Memory&nbsp; (free&nbsp; 11.8MB)</p>
<p>E: Mass Memory (free 29.5GB)</p>
<p>F: Memory Card 2GB&nbsp; MicroSD (1.7GB)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, have cleared cache as suggested in a previous post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically I want to be able to use the 29.5GB mass memory and not have to keep faffing with the minute amount available on the phone memory otherwise what is the point of having so much space.... it feels like I have bought a mansion and am living in a cardboard
 box at present!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help as I cannot update my Ovi Maps as there is not apparently not enough memory on my phone.﻿</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help and sorry about the long post/rant!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hiya,</p>
<p>(all of this can be found if you trawl thru old threads looking for n97 memory issues).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N97 is still a very capable phone IF you're willing to nursemaid it a little. I'm on my 3rd year with this phone and still getting lots of use and all the functionality I want from it.&nbsp; You're totallly right in that this was (arguably, still is) a brilliant
 phone wrecked by a stupidly small amount of RAM on the C Drive. Not helped by the way that everything Nokia (and QuickOffice) insists on being installed on that tiny C Drive. If you want it to work well you'll have to be prepared to put in some time in setting
 it up and a little occasional maintenance to keep it that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory Reorganiser removes itself after 1 use.</p>
<p>If you've made a lot of changes/moved things around/installed a few new apps it might be worth rerunning to regain 1or 2 extra mb on the C drive.</p>
<p>If you haven't run it before, try 'Software Update' (in applications menu) it should show up as an option to download.</p>
<p>If you have run it before, try 'Settings&gt;Application Mgr&gt;Installed apps'&nbsp; and from the list shown hightlight 'Reorganiser Uninstaller' and uninstall that (that's the thing that uninstalls the memory reorganiser and lets software update know it's been run).&nbsp;
 Memory reorganiser will now be offered as an option the next time you run software update.&nbsp; This process can be repeated as many times as you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIRST though I be inclined to sort out any other problem areas and use memory reorganiser as final 'polish'.</p>
<p>I'd be aiming for around 25 to 30 mb free on C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Ideally you'd start from a reset,</p>
<p>2. Check your firmware is the best you can get (software update),</p>
<p>3. Set messages to use 'E:Mass memory' NOT C</p>
<p>4. Delete all the applications that you know you will never want (if you use application manager to&nbsp; do this it's easier to spot which ones are saved on the C Drive). Top Gear, Tetris, Guitar Hero should be the first to go.</p>
<p>5. DO NOT OPEN BOINGO! Create a sub-folder called trash&nbsp;and then move Boingo to it so that you never open it by accident!</p>
<p>6. Don't install QT!&nbsp; It takes up 13mb on the C Drive.&nbsp; When you're downloading Apps from OVI Store they may have a message/prompt saying 'this will involve a download of 13mb'&nbsp; that means it uses QT and is going to download it to your C Drive. This will
 condemn your n97 to the slow lane. It's a shame 'cos some of the QT stuff is very cool (especially the talking hamster!).</p>
<p>7. Remove OVI Maps. Then use software update to reinstall the latest version (it's getting better and better).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More detail on how to do any of the above can be found in the pool of knowledge on this forum:</p>
<p>/t5/Pool-of-Knowledge/bd-p/topfaq</p>
<p>(don't want to get told off for spamming because I'm repeating too much of what's already out there!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for on-going maintenance, just remember to turn it off once a week!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that will take time, from memory it was about an hour and a half last time I did it.&nbsp; But the end result will be a phone that _can_ do more than the Iphone4.&nbsp; The N97 doesn't like live updates on the homescreen - things like facebook/Accuweather will
 either be unreliable or will cause the phone to stall.&nbsp; The interface can be confusing for the simple minded. And the phone will pause for thought every once in a while. Oh, and the Iphone is generally considered to be prettier.</p>
<p>In 'my phone is better than yours' conversations the list of things that the N97 can do will easily beat the Iphone tho.&nbsp; If I feel that the Iphone owner might be thinking they're winning I just flip it open and shut a couple of times and then start typing
 on the excellent keyboard.</p>

<h2>            I am getting a lot of pictures being X&#39;ed out instead of loading in IE and also some other special synmbols. Any ideas&#63;</h2>
                    Very recently when I bring up IE I see on a lot of pages that I am getting a red X where I should see pictures. And also I amnot seeing some arros/carets like are used ofr dropdowns --ie on facebook, where you bring up the dropdown to "log out" there is
 nothing but I can click where it should be and I get the dropdwon. This is a relatively new problem...maybe within the last couple of weeks.
