<h2>            why cant i make a video call on my phone</h2>
                    i went to make a video call on a nokia 6500, but it was greyed out and when i clicked on it to do so it came up saying "no UTMS network coverage" what does this mean ? im guessing it has something to do with my phone company provider?

            yes, it's the network provider. video calls is an avilable option only if your network provider supports it and you're in an area covered by proper UTMS (3G) signal.<br />
some service providers have differential coverage, where 3G coverage is limited to certain areas only. if you are sure your provider supports video calls then check for an area with 3G coverage, you can see that when your phone shows 3G under the signal strength
 indicator in standby mode instead of the usual "tower icon"

            it doesnt have no 3G anywhere near those bars. Is that because my sim card is not a 3G sim card?

            i just went thru my phone and it had 3 settings "UTMS,GSM, and DUAL MODE" i usually have my phone on GSM, because if i have it on DUAL MODE i get no reception. So what exactly does this UTMS stand for then ? ive never seen it before. Oh yeah, BUt now ive
 selected UTMS i am now able to make video calls i think.

            the phone has to be on DUAL mode, UTMS is a form og "3rd generation GSM networks , aka 3G" that supports video calls and high speed mobile internet connections.<br />
<br />
another point. in order to make a successful video call, please make sure that the other end is also covered by a 3G network and his handset supports video calls.

            yep Asem305 is correct here, although you can use UMTS solely on its own, its more advisable to use Dual mode, that way the phone will connect to a 3G signal when available and drop down to GSM when there is none available, instead of 3G mode solely in
 which case when there is no signal it will drop to no reception at all.

<h2>            Warning signs i 2007 macros</h2>
                    
<p>When I use a 2003-database in Access 2007 I will have some yellow warning signs on some of the commands in my macros. What¬¥s the meaning of these warning signs ?? For example I will have a sign for my command "SetWarnings" in a macro. I have also seen that
 this command doesn¬¥t exist in Access 2007. I need to have this command in an "Autoexec"-macro. How can I get the function "SetWarnings" in a 2007-macro ??</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for an answer</p>

<p>SetWarnings does exist in Excel 2007 but you have to click "Show All Actions" in the Show/Hide group of the Design tab of the ribbon to see it in the dropdown list of actions.</p>
<p>The yellow triangle means that the action will only work if the database is stored in a trusted location. Macro actions without the yellow triangle will work even if the database is not stored in a trusted location.</p>

            <p>Nope, that's not it, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mail is not coming from the Inbox. It's archived mail without an Inbox label.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until today, it was random emails going back several weeks in a single pst. This morning, I woke up to 543 unread emails in a different PST that had not been previously affected by this glitch--two of each that were previously downloaded in the last month
 or so. This did not happen to *me* in Outlook 2003, 2007, 2010 or 2013. It's new in 2016, although a web search shows me others who are having the problem in different versions.&nbsp;ScanPST seems not to solve the issue. I would not be inclined to blame Outlook,
 except it seems Gmail users aren't the only victims, so it looks as if I must.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of us who use Gmail plus Outlook keep our mail on the server as a backup (or in Outlook as a backup to the server, depending on how you look at it). I have Gmail going back to 2005 in one account, but none of it is in my Inbox. (After I read your message,
 my plan was to move all the Inbox mail to a separate label, but none of the mail Outlook has downloaded is labeled "Inbox." I checked this with a search for "in:inbox is:read" and while there were a couple of emails I'd failed to archive at some time in the
 past, they were not included in the newly re-downloaded emails.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might understand if these were old PST files that I'd moved from my old computer, but in fact, they are brand new for this computer and this year. If any of the emails were duplicates of deleted mail, even that might make sense, but I don't delete mail;
 I just mark it read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a total loss. If there were some consistent factor, it could be fixed, but it's just a random, intermittent occurrence.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Edited to add: Not so intermittent at this point. I have nearly 10,000 repeats since yesterday when I told Google to download mail "from now on," instead of from the date I'd last set the preference. Outlook heeds it not, although I'm only receiving mail
 from 2016 at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to get on this. It's a mess.</p>
<p>

<p>It gets worse, Fiona.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the day I posted, I've accumulated about 50,000 duplicates in two different accounts. I spend a great deal of time cleaning up my mail now, and I'm starting to become annoyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others have reported the same and similar problems with Outlook going back several versions and many years. Even when one ignores those cases in which an existing PST is moved to a new computer, there are far too many instances for comfort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have complained in three different threads, as well as posting feedback to Microsoft from within Windows 10. So far, it's all crickets. I suppose that if I weren't so lazy, I'd open a support ticket, but the frustration of dealing with first-line support
 deters me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next support engineer who tells me to use a restore point (or makes some other nonsensical suggestion) is going to feel extreme wrath.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you luck, but I fear that unless the software fixes itself, we're all out of luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Okay - What I did was went went into Outlook</p>
<p>Clicked on <strong>Account Settings</strong></p>
<p>Clicked on my <strong>default account</strong> which took me to my POP and IMPAP Account SEttings</p>
<p>Clicked on<strong> More Settings</strong> down the bottom of the screen</p>
<p>Then clicked on <strong>Advanced </strong>Tag</p>
<p>And then removed the tick from the Leave a copy of messages on the server</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this stopped downloading all duplicate messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely hope this works for you Rhonda - it was driving me insane as I got to the stage where I was continulously cancelling my receive emails and just trying to receive my most recent emails.</p>

<p>Hi Fiona,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I considered doing that, Fiona, but I rejected the idea, because:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have email on the server that goes back to when the account with Gmail was opened--2005. I don't want to remove those messages from the server. In theory, at least, Gmail controls this, so I believe that Outlook can't actually remove those emails, but
 I'm not quite ready to take that chance. Moreover,</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I use "recents" because I get my mail in more than one client, and Gmail's instructions for using recents includes a direction to leave the box ticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, it has not been an issue. It is only since February that I've had the problem. This tells me that Microsoft has done something screwy. It seems to be the same screwy thing it is has done a time or two in the past as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting, though, because it may well help another user.</p>

<p>I have several accounts connected to Outlook, and the three I have a problem with are Yahoo (1) and Gmail (2). The other accounts are not pulling down additional mail.</p>

            <p>Hi Fiona,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an experiment with an account that receives very few emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setup you suggested did not remove any of the old emails from the server, but it did remove all the current ones. This would mean that going forward, the only client to hold these emails would be Outlook, and that's not acceptable to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find professionals who can fix it, please let me know, but I think Microsoft needs to fix its code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rhonda</p>

<p>hi yusefmaarouf,<br />
<br />
i‚Äôd like to explain that the folder you marked is a shortcut pointing to the sync folder of a sharepoint library. it is created by the onedrive for business sync client.<br />
<br />
so, to delete the shortcut, please follow the steps below:<br />
1. stop syncing the sharepoint library. right click the onedrive for business icon in the notification area, then click
<strong>stop syncing a folder</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4190f66a-4be2-4949-b1cd-27b3d003f3af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4190f66a-4be2-4949-b1cd-27b3d003f3af" /></a><br />
2. select the sharepoint library, then click <strong>stop syncing</strong>. when prompted, click
<strong>yes</strong>. <br />
if you are currently syncing several libraries, you need to stop each of them. after that, the shortcut should be deleted from left of the
<strong>file explorer.</strong><br />
3. if you want to delete the sync folder, go to the path c:\users\username, then delete the sharepoint folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>note</strong>: after deleting the sharepoint folder, you will need to re-sync all documents.</p>
<p>please share any update after you tried the above steps.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
jiaxing bian<br />
<br />

<h2>            Downloading applications</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently bought a Samsung GT-i8000 (Omnia 2) with Windows Mobile 6.5 installed. I have not subscribed to mobile Internet service with my provider because I use it only as a cell phone and small portable extension to my PC.</p>
<p>There are some apps available which I would like to download and install. Is there a way of doing this by downloading the apps to my PC and then synchronising it with the Omnia to install these apps on it?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>There's no way to download applications from the Marketplace to a computer.&nbsp; The only way to install applications from the Marketplace is by downloading them directly to the phone.&nbsp; You can use a wifi connection instead of a data connection to do this -
 even the WMDC passthrough internet connection should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you purchase and download applications from other places on the web (instead of the Marketplace), you will still be able to install the applications in the old, conventional way - by downloading the installation files to your computer and then installing
 the application to your phone via a WMDC connection.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP IE Application Compatibility VHD is about to expire - what to do&#63;</h2>
                    The latest Windows XP IE Application Compatibility VHD released by Microsoft, expires on 13th November 2012. That is now 5 days away and my company is using this VHD as part of a testing phase. When will the next release of this VHD be out? And who can
 I contact at Microsoft about this? The relevant URL is: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11575<br />
<br />
PS: I selected "Internet Explorer 8" as the IE version because it doesn't let me submit the form otherwise, but really this is applicable to any IE version runnable on Windows XP.<br />

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recorded a video yesterday on my Lumia 920 (OS 8.0.10328.78). I recorded the video as you would, holding it sideways (rotate anticlockways 90 degrees), with right index finger on the shooting button.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The video is fine, sideways on the phone, and on my computer on VLC, and on my computer on windows media player.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I uploaded it to youtube, and it's rotated sideways:</div>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. If you only have Office 365 ProPlus subscription, you can‚Äôt <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deploy-Office-365-ProPlus-by-using-Remote-Desktop-Services-af9d7621-8c2c-4181-84b4-27778b1e7920?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
deploy Office 365 Proplus by using Remote Desktop Services</a>. Office 365 ProPlus subscription is not an Office 365 plan.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you can use the Office 365 ProPlus subscription to manually download Office 365 applications and configure Office 365 accounts with Exchange Online Plan licenses to use mail service. In this workaround, you will not be able to use Remote Desktop
 and you will need to install the applications on the computers one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to Active SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure in O365</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying for days and searching like crazy for a solution. What I am really trying to do is enable Managed Metadata Navigation on a site. But without the Publishing Infrastructure, it's not working.</p>
<p>I get the following error when I attempt to activate it:</p>
<div>
<div>Sorry, something went wrong</div>
<div>Provisioning did not succeed. Details: Failed to create the '_catalogs/masterpage' library. OriginalException: Specified argument was out of the range of valid values.
<br />
Parameter name: value</div>

</div>
</div>
<p>I have tried deleting the contents of the masterpage folder and making it exactly like another SPO site that I have access to where publishing has not been enabled. Without success.</p>
<p>Once I try to activate this feature, it does create a bunch of folders and files in the masterpage folder, so something does seem to work.</p>
<p>I cannot look at the correlation, because it is O365, so I don't know where else to turn now.</p>

<h2>            Nothing happens when I try to open Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    I have a brand new computer with Windows 7 on it. My last computer had no problems with MSE. Now, when I try to open it, nothing happens. I tried to re-install the program but it says it's already on my computer. No error messages. Just nothing happens.

            No, the computer is brand new and came with Norton, which I uninstalled the first day I started up the computer. Every computer I've ever owned has had that. The only thing I added is spybot, which I've used successfully with all my prior computers as
 well. I need spyware protection as well as antivirus.<br />

<p><strong><span>What about Windows Defender?</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Windows Defender provided spyware protection only.<span>&nbsp;
</span>MSE provides protection against spyware, viruses, Trojans, worms, root kits, and malicious scripts.<span>&nbsp;</span>So, there is no need for Defender.<span>&nbsp;</span>On XP, MSE should uninstall Defender.<span>&nbsp;</span>If not, you can uninstall it.<span>&nbsp;</span>On
 Vista and Windows 7, MSE should disable Defender. If not, you should disable it.</span></p>
<p><span>Did you contact MSE Support as was recommended above?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Spybot S &amp; D has been known to sometimes conflict with MSE and other AV&nbsp;programs especially if the "Tea-Timer" function is enabled.</span></p>
<p><span>You might uninstall Spybot and then uninstall/reinstall MSE and see if MSE works properly.&nbsp; Or if you wish to use Spybot (which I quit using several years ago) and you cannot get MSE&nbsp;to work with Spybot installed, suggest you uninstall MSE and try
 another AV program.&nbsp;</span></p>

            No, I decided to answer your questions first before proceeding with all the plans of action. Often, the things suggested to fix problems like this are "catch-all" and can take half a day or more to complete, when a more specific fix would have worked.
 I wish I had all the time in the world to deal with this, but sadly I do not. I've had MSE and Spybot working successfully together on all other previous computers I've owned. So, maybe it's a problem when Windows 7 is involved?<br />
<br />
I'm happy to remove spybot as long as MSE provides all the same protections. I did not get the impression this was the case, but perhaps I'm wrong. MSE never finds anything when I scan, then when I run spybot, it finds all sorts of things to remove.<br />
<br />
I did contact MSE support. They have revcently provided me with a catch-all set of instructions, which include uninstalling, reinstalling, running a different spyware program, etc. I've been in process of trying this and it's so far taken me 3 hours. I figure
 there are about 2 hours left of things to do. They just got back to me early this morning, after I'd submitted this help thread.<br />
<br />
If their suggestions don't work I'll let you know. I will also consider removing spybot. The problem is that many of us, including myself, never considered spyware removal programs the same as antivirus. They used to always be considered separate items. So
 I don't know if "malware" includes spyware. I'm assuming after reading your&nbsp; post that it does.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<p><b><span>Step 1: Please perform the online virus scan in safe mode with networking.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>We are going to perform the online scans to rule out any possible conflicts of virus infection in your computer. Sometimes, when you have a severe virus already installed in the computer it won‚Äôt allow to install
 any antivirus program and may create stability issues. So let‚Äôs go ahead and perform the online scans.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform the online scans with safe mode with networking. Scanning with safe mode with networking helps to remove tough viruses. To log in Safe
 mode with networking check step A below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: In case your computer is currently not on a wired connection, we would not be able to perform online scan because wireless connection doesn‚Äôt work in safe mode with
 networking. In that case you need to try the below scanners using the Normal log in mode.</span></p>
<p><b><span>A)</span></b><span>&nbsp; A fast way to check for viruses is to use an online scanner, such as the

<p><strong><span>Note: You may not be able to delete all the files so delete as much files as you can.</span></strong></p>
<p><u><span>&nbsp;</span></u></p>
<p><b><span>Now, let‚Äôs go ahead and
</span></b><b><span>reinstall Microsoft Security Essentials by following the steps mentioned below.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step3: Uninstall from MSE from programs List.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click <b>Start</b>, click

<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the list of installed programs, uninstall MSE security program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, let‚Äôs go ahead&nbsp;and remove traces of previous version of Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE). We are performing this step to remove remnants of any incomplete installation of MSE that is
 offered through subsequent releases of Windows update to install it.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this run the FixIt tool from the following links:</span></p>
<p><span>MSE (Version 1):
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2435760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/</span></a></span></p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>David, I would suggest you to uninstall both the version as it will completely clean traces of previous version of MSE from the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before moving ahead I would like to inform you that
</span><span>Microsoft recommends that you run only one antivirus or antispyware product. Running two or more security products that are not designed to work together on a single computer can severely slow down the performance
 and create stability issues. &nbsp;We suggest that you uninstall any non-Microsoft security product from your computer.
</span><span>I would like to inform you that
</span><span>running only Microsoft Security Essentials provides the best protection.
</span><span>Microsoft Security Essentials is an
</span><span>antivirus program from Microsoft that is for free and for lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span>I am sending few links of antivirus removal tool which will help us to completely remove the remnants from the registry keys. So, let‚Äôs go ahead and perform the step below
 to rule out possible conflict of any Non Microsoft antivirus program installed fully or partially on your computer while installing MSE.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:

To dj928-
<div>I use MSE on both my win7 and my winXP (SP3) laptops. &nbsp;In both cases I also run Spywareblaster and Spybot with no issues. &nbsp;(I

            <p>I agree that the solution provided by MSE Support is extensive and detailed. And most of it is probably not important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The single most important thing to do is to use the Norton Removal Tool.</p>
<p>The second most important thing is to make sure that Tea-Timer is not installed and running as part of Spybot's setup.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the spyware found by Spybot, most of what you will see reported by Spybot will be tracking cookies, although it can certainly also indentify other items -- many of which MSE will ignore as they are not malicious (generally speaking as I will also
 state that no security, MSE included, is 100% effective at detecting and removing everything). Tracking cookies can be managed in your browser privacy setings. I personally see no need for another program besides MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that said, once you've run the Norton tool, if MSE still doesn't start, use the links for removing MSE and then reinstall it.</p>

<p>I am trying to access my skype account. I get a message saying I am a child and I cannot access my account without parents permission. Whatever I try, I get asked either a credit card number or a proof of age with an ID. I do not want to provide this data.
 What can I do to get access to my skype?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the easiest way to resolve the issue on parental consent of your account. Microsoft takes steps to verify that an adult is giving a child permission to use a Microsoft account. One of the commonly used methods, which is approved under regulation,
 is to charge a small nonrefundable fee to a credit or debit card. </p>
<p><br />
Provide a valid credit or debit card number. We can use a valid credit or debit card number to verify your age as long as the card also has a CVV number.</p>

<h2>            iu encountered an invalid argument</h2>
                    I have an HP g7 desktop running Windows 10 and upon wake up this morning I had two error message boxes one behind the other that both said the same thing "iu encountered an invalid argument". I searched the entire support site and community and no one
 has ever posted this that I could find. Can anyone help me figure out what this means? Aside from my fan being a little noisy on and off, there is nothing wrong with the operation of the laptop. Thanks!

            <p>Error message was there in the morning; when I woke computer from sleep mode. The&nbsp;exact error message was exactly what I wrote before: "iu encountered an invalid argument" The only update I know of is one from QuickBooks that was done last week. Since it
 is an HP G7 Laptop with Intel core i3 running Windows 10 and using IE11; most necessary updates are installed automatically that are related to HP or Microsoft since I am on automatic updates from Microsoft. That exact message was there twice with one error
 box right behind the other.</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and I hope you can help me figure out if this is something I need to be concerned with.</p>

            Hello AngieGilliland
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft community.
<br />
<br />My name is Soraya F. and I am an independent consultant to help you!
<br />
<br />Sorry to have that problem.
<br />
<br />Please follow the procedures below that may help you:
<br />
<br />Clean boot.
<br />
<br />Clean boot is used to determine if a background program is interfering with the system.
<br />
<br />1. Press the Windows + R keys, type MSconfig, click Ok;
<br />
<br />2. In the System Configuration window, click the Services tab;
<br />
<br />3. At the bottom of the screen check the box Hide all services Microsoft click Disable all;
<br />
<br />4. Now click on the Program Initialization tab and click on Open Task Manager;
<br />
<br />5. In the task manager window on the boot tab, disable all non-Microsoft programs, close the task manager, and then click OK in the system setup and restart the computer if prompted.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;NOTE: This disables all third-party services and programs. You can later, if the problem is solved in this way, enable the programs and services that will be initialized with Windows, selectively, instead of keeping them all disabled. If the problem comes back after enabling the initialization of a specific service or program, the problem is exactly at startup of this software and it is recommended to remove it.
<br />
<br />
<br />If the behavior continues, perform the next procedure.
<br />
<br />Uninstall antivirus.
<br />
<br />The antivirus may in some cases bar the updates by not recognizing the update as a trusted program, so the need to remove it.
<br />
<br />1. Press the Windows + R keys, type appwiz.cple click OK;
<br />
<br />2. Find in the list the antivirus that you are using;
<br />
<br />3. Right-click on the program and the Uninstall option;
<br />
<br />4. Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Note: Many antiviruses have their own removal tool. Go to the Installed Software website for more information. Your system will not be unprotected because Windows has its own security system that automatically enables you to restart your computer.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Test and see if the behavior repeats itself
<br />
<br />As a last resort, follow these instructions:
<br />
<br />1. Press the Windows + Q keys, type in the troubleshooting bar;
<br />
<br />2. Click the icon and under System, click Fix Problems with Windows Update;
<br />
<br />3. Click Next and then troubleshoot as administrator;
<br />
<br />4. Now click close troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope I have been useful!
<br />
<br />It would be very important for our community to know if the answer was helpful to solve your problem!
<br />
<br />Soraya F.

<h3> slowconnector  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clutter - Why can&#39;t I manage the settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Clutter is currently diverting important business messages from my inbox in a folder called "Clutter".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to stop this from happening, but am having a problem with trying to turn off the "Clutter" function in Microsoft Outlook 365 operated by my employer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The guidance such as "Use Clutter to sort low-priority messages in Outlook" suggest that you go to the following section in your Outlook account:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Settings</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f4b83e9cb-c7e4-46c8-b3d1-cfee017123ae.png" /><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Options</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Mail</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Automatic
 processing</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Clutter</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>However, this section does not appear under my account, and there does not appear to be any way I can turn Clutter off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this because the Clutter settings are managed centrally by my employer's network administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if the Clutter settings is outside of my user access, should there not be way to show that they exist and can be changed by the administrator?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi SlowConnector,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two methods to turn off Clutter in Outlook, please refer to the detailed steps in the article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-off-Clutter-in-Outlook-a9c72a77-1bc4-40e6-ba6d-103c1d1aba4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-off-Clutter-in-Outlook-a9c72a77-1bc4-40e6-ba6d-103c1d1aba4c</strong></a></p>
<p>The email server keeps track of the email you read and the ones you don't. Once you
 turn it on, Clutter is automatic. As new email comes in, it takes messages you're most likely to ignore and puts them into the "Clutter" folder. It's not managed by network admin. You can turn it by yourself manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, you system admin may be controlling those Clutter settings so you should ask them to turn it off for you.</p>
<p>Also, Clutter, as a feature, is on the way out and will be replaced by Focused Inbox.</p>
<p>Microsoft tends to do these kinds of changes piecemeal so that's why the option to turn it off went away first before the option is removed completely.</p>

    <title>Help with configuring email accounts and views in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dogberry99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with configuring email accounts and views in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have spent a while going round in circles on the web and reading books but haven't found the answer to these questions. The idea is that when I install Outlook I can just have these things set up quickly by importing .reg files or xml or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1, Enter the settings for email accounts without having to do them individually using several sweeps through the wizard. Surely this information is held somewhere and can be entered directly using a script, macro, .reg file or something.</p>
<p>2, Configure a set of default views without going through the view settings rigmarole within Outlook. I don't want messages grouped and I want the reading pane off by default but available (hence the /nopreview shortcut is not an option). I used the apply
 settings feature in Outlook but it's application seemed hit and miss and when I created a new account in the same profile or opened a .pst file then I still got grouping and reading pane. I want to rewrite the settings so they can't change or go wandering
 off.</p>
<p>Hope you can help, thanks for your time.</p>

<p>1) The registry key holding the account information is a complex key with references and dependencies to locations of files on your disk.&nbsp;Therefor you cannot directly enter the information in the registry.&nbsp;You can use the manual option to add an account
 though and disable the option to do an account test to save some time adding an account if you already have all the details.</p>
<p>2) You can change the default Messages view and apply&nbsp;this view to already exisitng folders at once. See;<br />

<p>Thanks Robert. Is it possible to export the keys from the registry so that I can at least import them instead of setting them up again in the future?</p>

                    Just update the "Download" in your 5800 and then look in the Applications folder and you will see Adobe pdf Reader, download it and install...<br />
<br />
Cheers!

            friedbrains - this is the QuickOffice PDF reader, correct?&nbsp; I installed it a week or two ago, but it's a 14-day trial and mine is about to expire.&nbsp; A visit to Adobe.com takes me to the QuickOffice site for the acrobat reader so I don't think there's any
 other choice at the moment, is there?
