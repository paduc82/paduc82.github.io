<h2>            wireless mobile mouse 1850 failed to be recognised by Mouse and Keyboard center</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased two&nbsp; - wireless mobile mouse 1850.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plugged one into my windows 10 computer I expected to be able to set the buttons to my preferences.</p>
<p>When I plug it into the usb It is not recognised by the Mouse and Keyboard centre so I am stuck with a dumb basic mouse with only one button working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a software fix or do I have to return the mice for a different model?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes will be saved on the location where you are editing the document. If the document is edited on the machine locally, then you need to save the changes locally and then upload it to SkyDrive.
 If the changes are made on the SkyDrive then you may download it and save it locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            When I face this issue, I sometimes use the web interface to Skydrive to check the online version of the file. This way I can be sure about the contents of the server version before I keep or reject it.

            <p>I have to scrutinize OneDrive this way, which is obtuse, confusing, and ridiculous. I actually opened the file on OneDrive and the file locally. They were significantly different and the file sizes were different. My collaborator's name was on the OneDrive
 version in Details View to the right of the Date Modified, so that was a clue as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole point of OneDrive is to keep things in sync. I'm terrified if I click keep my version, it discards changes on the server file. Does anyone know if that is indeed what happens? Or does OneDrive eventually merge the changes if you say Keep My Version
 or does it discard all changes made by a collaborator. In this case, it would have been disastrous to Keep My Version if it overwrites changes made by someone else I'm collaborating with. This is a serious question that needs to be addressed my Microsoft.
 At the very least,, explain with screen tips the ramifications of each choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right-click the file in OneDrive,, you can see a version history with helpful details--I blocked out the collaborator's name for privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4451154c-b975-4514-ba97-cca122469410" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, when I went back to OneDrive.live.com, the file sizes don't match. When I check the box next to file in question, click the Details pane to open it, the files size in the Details pane showed 994 KB, the size in the horizontal listing
 itself in Details View (I use Details View and Details Pane always in these situations) showed 739 KB, and in Windows Explore on my local OneDrive folder, it showed 65 and then changed to 739 KB when I chose to keep server version--talk about confusing and
 distressing. I'm assuming if I did make changes to my local file, they're lost. I haven't worked on the file in a long time, so have forgotten if I had done anything to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally something else I was unaware of until I seriously experimented with this today, when you open the file by clicking Keep Server Version, the collaborator's name disappears from the Details View--it shows up to the right of the date modified. If you
 right-click the file, Version History, my name is now at the top of the list rather than the collaborator's.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f41aeeb-f5fb-409b-9c78-8cec0a9b2917" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click Keep Server Version:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e488b082-dc33-439c-af21-1ddae83d8309" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line for me is this--are my assumptions correct? And if so, this process completely defeats the point of OneDrive, which is to sync files, not discard and overwrite changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Keep My Version</strong>--keeps my version and discards any version on server with changes made by a collaborator by overwriting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Keep Server Version</strong>--keeps the version of the collaborator and discards any changes I made by overwriting my file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the root of the problem comes down to sync issues with OneDrive. Yesterday, I opened the SkyDrive app (and why is it still named SkyDrive,not OneDrive) in Windows 8.1, clicked the link All files are up to date, and saw this file in question listed
 as Problem downloading. If OneDrive is syncing as it should, those prompts will never appear.</p>

            Well I just clicked "Keep my version" because I COULDN'T PREVIEW WHICH DOCUMENT WAS WHICH, so I figured the latest file was the one locally saved (as well as the "are you sure you want to discard all your changes that have not been uploaded to the server" message making me uncomfortable, and lucky me I lost a whole day's worth of editing on a lab report. Seriously Microsoft, I love OneDrive but **** like this is unacceptable. I am irate right now and can hardly focus on REWRITING MY PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED WORK. Get this worked out because it is a local versus server conflict that is very incorrectly handled.  



Two suggestions: 


1) fix the bug that results in the conflict 


2) if there is ever a conflict ALLOW THE USER TO PREVIEW EACH VERSION so they know whether or not they are trashing hours of work. 



Pretty simple, really. Hope somebody from the OneDrive/Office department sees this thread.

<h2>            Using, creating and saving templates in Outlook 2016 Preview for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am testing Office 2016 Preview and can't find a way to open Outlook templates (.oft). When I try it opens an new email with the template attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also do not see a way to create a new Outlook template because Save as... is grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To the best of my knowledge, Outlook does not support Outlook templates on the Mac. You might consider sending a feature request to Microsoft asking for support for Outlook templates. To send feature requests to Microsoft, click the Smile button found in
 the upper right corner of most Outlook windows.</p>

<h2>            OneNote sometimes hangs when pasting &#40;CMD&#43;V&#41; on Mac.</h2>
                    <p>Using the latest onenote (no updates pending), and pasting text, sometimes crashes onenote.&nbsp; Symptoms are, first pasting gets very slow (several seconds), then the next time just hangs for ever with the spinning wheel of death:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3706d7d0-454f-47be-a77b-b19433c8d70e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3706d7d0-454f-47be-a77b-b19433c8d70e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Only solution is to force quit onenote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When onenote restarts, I can paste again (with both right click pates and CMD-V)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont use onenote much, but this is the second time it has happened.<br />
</p>
<p>Note, I have plenty of SSD free, 16GB ram, few other apps open etc.&nbsp; OSX 1.13.1<br />

            Before I give troubleshooting steps, I would request you to provide following information -
<br />
<br />1. What is your Mac OS version? 10.13.4, 10.13.3....(Could you confirm that it is OSX 1.13.1)
<br />
<br />2. What is your Onenote version? 16.12, 16.11, 15.41....
<br />
<br />3. Has the problem started recently particularly after an update or was it always there?

<p>It says 1.13.1 in the "about this mac". There is a pending macOS update with non related fixes such as external GPU which I have not allowed yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About oneNote shows 16.12 (180410).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only switched from PC to mac (don't ask) a month ago, and the issue has happened twice.&nbsp; I could just wait till it happens again.</p>

            An option is roll back to previous stable version which you had preferably 15.41. Once version 16.13 is released, roll up to 16.13. To rollback -
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall the latest version of Onenote - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install the previous stable version of Onenote - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>

            Your behind on your update to the system and Might be a reason for OneNote acting like it is. Update to 10.13.4 and install the recent security update. Then try.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIIW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have XL2016 but my personal add-in (XL2013) started at once also giving the "out of memory" message. Other symptoms were that the code remains displayed although the workbook was closed. Added code was not saved except if I used thisworkbook.save
 in the immediate pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was thinking about a corrupted file but rebuilding it did not solve the issue. Someone recommended to disable all other add-ins, which I did without success ... because I was so sure about one add-in ... but finally, it was that add-in that caused the problem.
 The author corrected his add-in and since then no problems anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of articles saying that there are too much global variables, bad memory management, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the reason why I was so sure about that add-in was that I had in use for years and nothing has been changed the last years. Till I realized that the add-in was updated and installed from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>

    <title>Microsoft Lumia 950 Dual Sim Phone Book Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivan sharkov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Lumia 950 Dual Sim Phone Book Issue</h2>
                    <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have quite an odd problem with my Lumia 950. Sometimes (quite offen, as a matter of fact) the telephone does not recognize the incoming number as an existing contact in my phone book, and the telephone shows me the mobile number on the screen, instead
 of the name (and the picture) of the calling person. When I do restart my device, in the call history I can see the right thing - the name of the person who called me. But only after restart. It is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The telephone is set to "collect" information only from my Gmail account. No Skype, no Hotmail accounts. I tripple checked it!!! I have gone even further - I have deleted all my contacts in my Hotmail account, in order to avoid doubling contacts in two or
 more accounts. But the problem still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help me solve that anoying issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Ivan Sharkov</p>

<h2>            Update Records with Multiple Criteria Per Record</h2>
                    
<div>Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
I'm new to the forums and this will be my first post. I have some knowledge<br />
of Ms access and a little in coding with VB, but what I am trying to do is<br />
above my knowledge, and I'm going crazy trying to get anything to work:<br />
<br />
Background: <br />
I have 2 tables.<br />
<br />
First Table contains temporary raw data so lets call it: tbl_temp<br />
Fields that are important in this table are called:<br />
barcode (text field, as some barcodes contain text)<br />
dept (number field)<br />
<br />
Second Table is called - tbl_scan_rules<br />
Fields that are important in this table are called:<br />
dept (number field)<br />
trim_start (number field)<br />
trim_keep (number field)<br />
trim_if (text field)<br />
<br />
Here is what I'm after. I have a barcode scanner that stores raw data. I<br />
import this data into my MsAcess database into tbl_temp.<br />
<br />
Example of Raw data: &nbsp;<br />
--------------------Barcode----------------Dept------------<br />
Record 1---------AB123456789WW-------999------------<br />
Record 2---------1100987654321---------999------------<br />
Record 3---------AB123456789--------------111------------<br />
<br />
Now, I only want 123456789 to appear and 987654321 for those first 2 scans in<br />
dept 999.<br />
<br />
In dept 111 I would like it to leave the data untouched.<br />
<br />
There are plenty more rules I wish to apply, but I would like to apply those<br />
rules per department.<br />
<br />
I would like to use the tbl_scan_rules data as the "Criteria" for each<br />
department. Each dept can have multiple criteria depending on the "trim_if"<br />
field.<br />
<br />
Examples of Data (or my criteria) held in tbl_scan_rules:<br />
<br />
Record 1<br />
Dept 999 <br />
trim_start = 2 (i.e trim first 2 characters)<br />
trim_if = AnyLetterAnyLetter (like inputmask "??") or (AA, AB, GE, GF.... etc<br />
etc)<br />
trim_keep = 9 (i.e after trimming first 2 characters keep the following 9<br />
characters)<br />
<br />
Record 2<br />
Dept 999<br />
trim_start = 4 (i.e trim first 4 characters) <br />
trim_if = 1100<br />
trim_keep = 9 (i.e after trimming first 4 characters keep the following 9<br />
characters).<br />
<br />
Record 3<br />
Dept 111 - trim_start = Null<br />
trim_keep = 13 Characters<br />
trim_if = Null (i.e trim no characters and keep 13 characters)<br />
<br />
and so on and so on....As you can see the tbl_scan_rules table data can be<br />
customized by the user for whatever rules they wish to create.<br />
<br />
What is needed:<br />
<br />
I'm trying to replace, trim or update (i'm really not sure what will work<br />
best) my raw data before I append it to my main table. I want it to loop<br />
through all my records of raw data in tbl_temp and trim the barcode against<br />
the scan rules. Any help and advice on how to code this in a query or VBA<br />
code would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Adam</div>

<p>Based&nbsp;on your examples, it can be done in a query.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you should cange the scan rules table to make it more consistent:</p>
<p>dept (number field)<br />
keep_start (number field)<br />
keep_len (number field)<br />
trim_if (text field)<br />
<br />
And all fields must be filled in.&nbsp; Your example scan rules records would then look like:</p>
<p>Record 1<br />
Dept 999 <br />
keep_start&nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(i.e&nbsp;keep starting with third&nbsp;character)<br />
keep_len&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e&nbsp;keep 9 characters)<br />
trim_if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [a-z][a-z]*&nbsp;(Records that start with 2 letters)<br />
<br />
Record 2<br />
Dept 999<br />
keep_start&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e keep starting woth&nbsp;fifth&nbsp;character)<br />
keep_len&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e leep 9 characters)<br />
trim_if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1100*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i.e. records that start with 1100)<br />
<br />
Record 3<br />
Dept 111 <br />
keep_start&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Keep all characters)<br />
keep_len&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99<br />
trim_if&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i.e all records)</p>
<p>Then,&nbsp;I think&nbsp;the query might be something like:</p>
<p>SELECT DISTINCT&nbsp;Dept, IIf(trim_if Is Null, barcode, Mid(barcode, keep_start, keep_len)) As trimmed_barcode<br />
FROM tbl_temp LEFT JOIN tbl_scan_rules<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ON tbl_temp.dept =&nbsp;tbl_scan_rules.dept<br />
WHERE barcode LIKE trim_if</p>

<p>That worked great. Here is my code: I want to change it to an update query and am having troubles getting trimmed_hawb(which is a fieldname in my temp_import_data table) to equal the returned values in trm_hawb from the select query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT DISTINCT tbl_scan_rules.depot_id, IIf(trim_if Is Null, HAWB, Mid(HAWB, trim_start,trim_keep)) AS trm_HAWB</p>
<p>FROM tbl_temp_import_data LEFT JOIN tbl_scan rules ON tbl_temp_import_data.Depot_ID_number = tbl_scan_rules.Depot_id</p>
<p>WHERE (((tbl_temp_import_data.HAWB) like trim_if));</p>

<p>What is trimmed_hawb?</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to do with an UPDATE query.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can use:</p>
<p>UPDATE tbl_temp_import_data INNER JOIN tbl_scan_rules<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ON tbl_temp_import_data.Depot_ID_number = tbl_scan_rules.Depot_id<br />
SET HAWB = Mid(HAWB, trim_start,trim_keep)<br />
WHERE&nbsp;HAWB Like tbl_scan_rules.trim_if</p>
<p>When you add entries to the rules table, make sure that&nbsp;it is impossible for a&nbsp;data record to be matched by the trim_if in two different rules.</p>
<p>If we can't get that to work, then use the SELECT query that did work as the base for an Append or Make Table query.</p>
<p>Side note:&nbsp; Please use Copy/Paste when posting code, SQL, exoressions, etc. so we don't get sidetracked over typos.</p>

            Sorry about not cutting and pasting. Im writing this from my mobile device. your answer worked. Thank you very much for your reply and assistance. now i just need to work out how to stop users from over lappining the rules<br />

<p>I forgot to mention it&nbsp;before.&nbsp; If the Update query does the job and if you have a dept that does not need to trim anything, you do not need a rule for that dept.&nbsp; That means you do not need rule3 in the example rules.&nbsp; Actually, it may be significantly
 slower to update records just to update to an unchanged value.</p>
<p>If you use an Appemd or Make Table query, then you do need a rule so every record is copied.</p>
<p>The following idea only applies to the Update query scenario.</p>
<p>Assuming you will not have too many rules for any one dept,&nbsp;you could create a test procedure to run a query that checks all the rules for a dept whenever a trim_if is changed/added.&nbsp; Here's a shot at some air code for the trim_if text box's AfterUpdate
 eventthat might get you started:</p>
<p>Dim db As Datebase<br />
Dim rs As DAO.Recordset<br />
Dim strSQL As String<br />
Dim strOverlaps As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set db = CurrentDb()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "SELECT trim_if, Count(*) As overlap " _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; "FROM tbl_temp_import_data As D&nbsp;INNER JOIN tbl_scan_rules As R" _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;"ON D.Depot_ID_number = R.Depot_id " _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; "WHERE D.Depot_id = " &amp; Me.Depot_id<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; " And HAWB Like R.trim_if And HAWB Like&nbsp;'" &amp; Me.trim_if &amp; "' "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' check if changing an existing rule or adding new rule<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.trim_if.OldValue) _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then&nbsp;strSQL =&nbsp;strSQL&nbsp;_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; " And R.trim_if &lt;&gt; '" &amp; Me.trim_if.OldValue&nbsp;&amp; "' "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL =&nbsp;strSQL&nbsp;_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; "GROUP BY R.trim_if "&nbsp;_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; "HAVING Count(*) &gt; 0"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(strSQL, dbOpenSnapshot)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If rs.RecordCount = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Me.trim_if &amp; " has no overlaps"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Until rs.EOF<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strOverlaps = strOverlaps&nbsp; &amp; ", " &amp; rs!trim_if<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Me.trim_if &amp; " overlaps " &amp; Mid(strOverlaps, 3)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>I think something like that is necessary to make sure the new trim_if is ok, but you may also want to provide another form/subform that just displays a depot's resulting HAWBs for a trial trim_if before it's even entered in the rules table.</p>
<p>I hope you understand that this kind of thing is a pretty advanced thing to be doing and the users wil need some assistance before they will be able to get a grip on what can be done an how to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would probably be a good idea to provide your users
 with a short class on how to use wildcards for tricky trim_if situations and to hand out a cheat sheet on wildcards even if it's just a copy of the Help topic.</p>

<p>Marshall, your a ledgend. Thank you very much for your help and assistance. The update query worked like a charm, and as the data being imported gets trimmed in a&nbsp;small temp table,&nbsp;the query shouldn't&nbsp;take too long. I've set code to delete records from the
 temp table once they're about a&nbsp;week old. I wouldn't imagine there being anymore than about 200-300&nbsp;records in a week, and there is about 400 depot records all up.</p>
<p>Thanks for the additional code. I'll give it a test tomorrow and let you know how it goes.</p>

            I have tried your code and you had missed a _ in one line which i fixed. i cant paste the code in here to show you but i am getting an error 3131. Syntax error in FROM clause when i try and run this procedure on the lostfocus event on my form. it then
 highlights the line set rs = db.OpenRecordset(strSQL, dbOpenSnapshot) I'm not sure what is wrong. i also tried closing brackets around the tbl_temp_import_data As D and tbl_scan_rules As R I received another error 3061 too few parameters. Expected 1 again
 it highlights the set rs = ............. any ideas?

<p>Apparently I got the name of something wrong.&nbsp; I tried to Copy/Paste the field and table names, but ...</p>
<p>It would help to find the bad name if you added Debug.Print strSQL just before the OpenRecordset line.&nbsp; Then, when it stops with the error, hit the End button in the error box.&nbsp; Open the Immediate window using Ctrl+G and Copy/Past the SQL statement into
 a new blank query's SQL view and try to run it.&nbsp; You should then get a parameter prompt for whatever name is wrong.</p>

                    <p>I'm slow ring and I've rolled back to 17025, after a few days of 17074 and receiving a BAD POOL HEADER green screen about once a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I liked about 17074 was that my Kinect showed up in the Camera app; under 17025 it doesn't. But, I was not able to determine any particular behavior of mine that led to the green screens.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>In my follwing formula , How I can change number format data into string . Some of the data in pricelist.xls]item1!B:B will be number and some numeric. So I need to change all data into text format within in this formula. Please help</p>
<p>ActiveCell.Formula = "=IF(COUNTIF([pricelist.xls]item1!B:B,""*"" &amp;H7&amp;""*""),VLOOKUP(""*"" &amp;H7&amp;""*"",[pricelist.xls]item1:L,11,0),IF(COUNTIF([pricelist.xls]item2!B:B,""*"" &amp;H7&amp;""*""),VLOOKUP(""*"" &amp;H7&amp;""*"",[pricelist.xls]item2!B:L,11,0),0))"</p>

<p>Hello, Pol</p>
<p>I am not sure if I understand your question completely but it is possible to surround a VLOOKUP with the TEXT function.&nbsp; the VLOOKUP becomes the text and then you can follow it with some formatting.&nbsp; For example supposing the following VLOOKUP produced the
 answer 3.0 - VLOOKUP(A1,'Sheet1'!B2:D40,3,FALSE) - and you wanted it to read as £3.00.&nbsp; You could do the following - TEXT(VLOOKUP(A1,'Sheet1'!B2:D40,3,FALSE), "£0.00").</p>
<p>You can of course apply this technique to any relevant part of the formula</p>
<p>If this helps, please hit the button!</p>

<p>I have made no changes to my account. The only thing I have done differently between the time that I was last able to use the service and this notice appearing&nbsp; is that I started using an android phone (I have been using Windows phone for some years before)
 and logging into onedrive and office online using that.</p>

<p>I can login to outlook.com. The error occurs when I try to log into OneNote online via my Windows and Linux desktops using a variety of browsers including Edge, Opera, and Firefox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my original post I have also tried contacting Microsoft Support via my Office 365 Home subscription support. When I tried to contact a support agent via the chat box provided it returned the same message that I get when trying to log into OneNote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Then I enter my password and press next.</p>

            Hi, I'm Roberta, a Microsoft Advisor and I'm here to help and assist you!
<br />
<br />Your Skype chats are stored in the cloud for a period of 2 years. You can also try to export your old chats in new Skype.&nbsp;
<br />Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; Messaging &gt; Export chat history from Skype 7.x&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />
<br />Thank you

<p>Hi&nbsp;amnsalova,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still using the same device from 2012? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, you can do the steps provided by Roberta A. As it will create an HTML file where your old messages can be viewed. Just to inform you, Skype version 7x created a log file where your old messages is being saved and it is called "main.db". It is located
 inside your Skype name folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you no longer have access to your old device, then, I would suggest to contact our chat support team for your request to be process. You may follow the steps in contacting our chat team on this link:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?tm=1555696329995</p>

<h2>            Video won&#39;t play on PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to the 2016 Microsoft Office from 2013.</p>
<p>I make 1 presentation a year and always add videos into them with no problem.</p>
<p>This year, when I preview my slideshow, it will not play any video in any format that I try. wmv, avi, mp4, etc....</p>
<p>Again, when I had the 2013 version I was able to add and play video with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the answers/problems I see so far talk about using the right format and embedded links and the such.</p>
<p>None fix my issue. &nbsp;WHY is this an issue now in the 2016 version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<p>Well, I updated all my drivers, and unchecked the one add in, unable to remove as it needed "Administrator" authority. ( I am the administrator. ???)</p>
<p>These did not fix the issue, however, I tried again in safe mode and there was a "click for more info" link in the graphics configuration error box.</p>
<p>It didn't have the correct info but led me to what was causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check the boxes to Disable hardware graphics acceleration and slide show hardware graphics acceleration.</p>

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 Update 1 to Windows 10 Technical Preview and I've always used picture password because it's very efficient. The one I used to have works well but when I decided to create a new one, it says "congratulations" but it doesn't make
 it ! Now I don't have any picture pasword !</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence we can conclude that the issue with the picture password was caused due to user profile corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, I suggest you to try the following steps to copy the files from the corrupted user account to the new user account. Once after copying the files, you may delete the corrupted user account.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to copy the files from the corrupted user account to the new user account:
<br />
</span>a) Press/tap <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows </span></strong>and
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">x</span></strong> together and select <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Explorer</span></strong>.<br />
b) Click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View </span></strong>tab and click/tap on
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Options</span></strong> at the top right corner.<br />
c) Click/tap the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View</span></strong> tab, and then click/tap
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Show hidden files</span></strong>, folders, and drives.<br />
d) Uncheck the box which states <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hide protected operating system files</span></strong>.<br />
e) Click <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes </span></strong>to confirm, and then click<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OK</span></strong>.
<br />
f) Locate the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Users\Old_Username folder</span></strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile you want to copy files from.<br />
g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:<br />
•<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ntuser.dat</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.dat.log</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.ini</span></strong></p>
<p>h) Right click/tap and Select <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy</span></strong>.</p>
<p><span>I)Locate the </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Users\New_Username folder</span></strong><span>,<br />
where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and New Username is the name<br />
of the new user profile you created.<br />
j) Right click/double tap&nbsp;inside the folder and select</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Paste.<br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">k) Restart your PC and check if you are able to log in to the computer using the new account with all the files of the old account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to delete the corrupted user account profile:<br />
</span><span>a) Login to your new User Profile.<br />

<h2>            Multiple Selection from A Drop Down menu in MS Word</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a simple request.</div>
<div>I want a drop down box that contains 20 items.</div>
<div>I want to be able to pick any number of these instead of the usual only one item.</div>
<div>I want the selection results to be be displayed in the Word document one above the other.</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>David</div>
                </div>

            None of the dropdowns available to be inserted directly within a document (the legacy dropdown form field, the ActiveX combo box, and the content control dropdown list box) support multiple selection.<br />
<br />
To get that functionality, you must create a <a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/create_employ_userform.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
userform</a> on which you insert a list box control, and set that control's MultiSelect property to the value
<b>fmMultiSelectMulti </b>("Pressing the SPACEBAR or clicking selects or deselects an item in the list") or
<b>fmMultiSelectExtended</b> ("Pressing SHIFT and clicking the mouse, or pressing SHIFT and one of the arrow keys, extends the selection from the previously selected item to the current item. Pressing CTRL and clicking the mouse selects or deselects an item").
 Then insert a MacroButton field in the document to run a macro that displays the userform and places the results in the correct place in the document.<br />

<br />Ensure that any compromises or open relays have been resolved, and then contact support through your regular channel.

<h2>            trouble syncing music from PC to windows phone</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying in vain to sync music from my Windows 7 PC to my Windows 8 Nokia Lumia 625 using Windows Phone App. It will sync some songs, but gives a list of songs that it can't due to "unknown" reason. Error codes are 8300006 and 80004005 on the Windows
 Phone App.</p>
<p>When I try to play some of the songs on my phone that did sync, my phone lists error code 80070003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to sync&nbsp;from both iTunes and Windows Libraries - both presented the same problem (the songs are NOT protected - this isn't the issue).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did manage to succesfully&nbsp;transfer songs using Windows Media Player and copying and pasting to the micro SD card that I put directly into the PC. However, this still gave the error code 80070003 on my phone when trying to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried two different micro SD cards (one 8GB and one 32GB), and have tried formatting these on PC and phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done a full reboot of my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still no joy. Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>

            I am having the same problem with a different error code, and also something about .wma to the phone. The error code for me is 83000009 with Lumia 1320 phone, hope someone comes up with a solution, this does not make sense at all, have written on twitter
 to see if I get some help from Nokia as EE have no idea, they have not been trained for this and could not put me through to Nokia as they seem to do everything on line now, I love this phone apart from the fact that I cannot move my music.

<h2>            MIssing Junk Folder in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I just noticed that I do not have a Junk folder in the app though I can see a junk folder in the web access version.&nbsp; That folder contains several emails that I presumed had not been sent to me but were indeed.&nbsp; How do I add a junk folder to the Outlook
 app on my laptop?&nbsp; Using Windows 10 on a Lenovo laptop.&nbsp; Thanks.

    <title>Booklet Printing &#40;word 2010&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Booklet Printing &#40;word 2010&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to print a booklet in word 2010 and have inserted a border. I am trying to print it so that the book is "portrait" on a "landscape" paper (so the book looks like an actual book). I have tried printing my document several times and the results
 have either been </p>
<p>1. the book prints in landscape format (so flips up and down) </p>
<p>2. the book prints in portrait format, as does the content (therefore, 1/4 of the book is cut off).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions? I have played around with margin and gutters izes and no results.</p>

            <p>Nm, figure it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went out of booklet printing mode and then back into it and that solved it.</p>
