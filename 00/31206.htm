<h2>            Insyde Airplane Mode HID Mini-Driver problem on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above mentioned driver has a bug that doesn't work with the latest version of Windows 10. The driver is from the Microsoft HCL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have done a new Windows 10 Home 64 bit install on a Kogan laptop (W54_W94_W955TU,-T,-C). Version of Windows is Windows 10 Home v1803 (OS build 17134.112).<br />
<br />
Once the laptop performed a Windows update to the version mentioned above, flight mode would toggle on and off every second immediately after booting the system.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling the following driver in Device Manager temporarily fixed the issue : Insyde Airplane Mode HID Mini-Driver (hardware id = ACPI\VEN_PNP&amp;DEV_C000), version 1.4.0.8, AirplaneModeHid.sys.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Problem is even when I uninstall the driver and the driver package, Windows reinstalls it again after every reboot and the issue comes back again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've Googled the issue and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.edugeek.net/forums/windows-10/187573-airplane-mode-off-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.edugeek.net/forums/windows-10/187573-airplane-mode-off-off.html</a> (check soln by dhicks).<br />
<br />
I'm out of ideas how to fix this. Here's the things I have tried:<br />
<br />
- uninstalled in device manager, removing the driver package as well such that device becomes "unknown device". After reboot, it just re-installs.<br />
<br />
- went into device installation settings and set Windows to never check/install driver software from Windows Update.<br />
<br />
- Ran cmd prompt in recovery console and performed the "dism /image:&lt;imagemountdir&gt; /remove-driver /driver:&lt;publishedname&gt;" command.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- Ran the pnputil -d command. Driver removes ok but comes back after reboot.<br />
<br />
- Tried disabling the driver in device manager but it's listed under Human Interface Devices and there is no disable option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- Tried older driver versions (some from :&nbsp; <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Insyde+Airplane+Mode+HID+Mini-Driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Insyde+Airplane+Mode+HID+Mini-Driver</a><br />
<br />
- Contacted Insyde and they told me they only write BIOS code, even though I have sent them screenshots of their own driver.<br />
<br />
- Tried disabling the driver from loading by using device installation restrictions (<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/263851/how-to-prevent-windows-from-automatically-updating-specific-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/263851/how-to-prevent-windows-from-automatically-updating-specific-drivers/</a>)
 . Because this is Windows 10 home, I tried to do this via the registry but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Short of upgrading to Windows 10 pro so I can use Group Policy to disable this one driver or rolling back the big Windows 10 update, i'm out of ideas.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi AITS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you have performed several troubleshooting steps, what we can do next is to download the device driver from the manufacturer's website and install the drivers to a new user profile. To create a new user profile, you can check the steps on this

<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result so we can further assist you.</p>

<p>I had a client with this exact same problem. The only thing that prevented that worthless Insyde Airplane driver from constantly reinstalling itself was to disable the Windows Update service. That registry hack shown at howtogeek sure looked promising, and
 maybe it used to work, but it certainly isn't working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be a better way to deal with this, disabling Windows Update is obviously not a long term solution.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that editing the Group Policy on a Windows 10 Pro System works, so perhaps it's worth an upgrade. It's possible to get Pro Licence keys for &lt;£20, so it may be worth that amount to also benefit from some other Pro features.<br />

<p>Sam3001,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Pro and and the same issue with Insyde Airplane Mode (IAM) keeps reinstalling. I would also like to prevent Windows Updates using Group Policy. What particular settings in GP would I use to prevent a program like IAM and Windows updates from installing
 on my Win 10 Pro System.? Thank for the help. I am not an IT person nor delve into this sort of thing often.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>N851TB,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The link in the original post is a more in depth walkthrough than I could ever provide (I have also put the relevant link below), the only difference here is that when you open "Device Manager" you will need to look in the "Human Interface Devices" to find
 the&nbsp;</span>Insyde Airplane Mode HID Mini-Driver. Let me know if you need anything else.<br />

            Playing CDs or movies is apparently too challenging for Microsoft. I have to try to rip music CDs on a Vista machine because 7 will almost never read the disc, thinks blank discs are full and full discs are blank Vista usually works, but God knows what
 10 is like. Every version of the operating system Microsoft has managed to make playing, burning or ripping even more unlikely. We probably have to buy others software since they are apparently unable to figure out how to do anything but play MP3s already
 on your computer. Anything else is just too challenging for Microsoft. Playing CDs, DVDs, burning or ripping. Their operating systems just don't work with media or CD DVD players anyone installs. My theory is in an effort to increase interest in programming,
 they let inner city 4th graders write all their software for Media player and other disc reading systems.

 He also gave you a link of steps to complete to make sure you are fully Updated from Store.&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you get from there to DVD Manager which has since blocked VLC?&nbsp; Uninstall DVD Manager now.</p>

 choose Control Panel&gt;Icon View&gt;Default Programs.&nbsp; Set Windows Media Player as your Default claiming all of its defaults.&nbsp; Then VLC should hold the remaining defaults.&nbsp; Report back on these settings.&nbsp;

<h2>            Problem with USB Headset Microphone on Win7 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, my USB headset (plantronics DSP500) microphone stopped working. I did not make any hardware/software changes. It was as simple as hopping into a ventrilo channel and going, oh look, my mic isn't working-- that's odd.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Basics:&nbsp;<br />
- OS is windows 7 64-bit<br />
- Headset sound works fine, microphone does not.&nbsp;<br />
- No manufacturer drivers are made. It is plug-n-play (uses default windows drivers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>- MOBO is ASUS Sabertooth X79<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting thus far:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>No, it's not muted on the headset wire, or in ventrilo.&nbsp;</li><li>Plugged the headset in to a different computer running windows 7, recognized and worked without issue. On this separate computer, I am able to record a sound file using windows sound recorder (start --&gt; all programs --&gt; accessories --&gt; Sound Recorder).
 To me,<b> this verifies it is not a hardware issue with the headset.&nbsp;</b></li><li>Tried different USB ports, both front and back of computer.&nbsp;</li><li>System restore to a restore point back in january, no luck.&nbsp;</li><li>Basic driver troubleshooting done:&nbsp;</li></ul>
* attempting to update drivers for the headset through device manager and audio recording tab. Windows tells me the driver is up to date. (Recall there is no manufacturer driver for this headset, it is designed to work with windows/mobo default drivers).&nbsp;<br />
* Uninstall drivers for the headset, unplug headset, restart computer, re plug in headset, allow windows to reinstall default drivers, still doesn't work (sound OK, mic still broke)&nbsp;<br />
* I've gone as far as reinstalling all the MOBO drivers (ASUS Sabretooth X79)... Tried both latest mobo drivers as well as older versions.<br />
<ul>
<li>Done a ton of fiddling with playback / recording devices to try to trick it into working, including disabling everything but the headset, playing with options in the headset properties (exclusive vs. not, default device, default communications device, etc.).&nbsp;</li><li>Unplugged headset, ensured that default speakers "levels" tab in playback didn't have microphone muted (it did, but fixing this to not muted didn't fix the issue).&nbsp;</li></ul>
<br />
I'm out of basic stuff to try. &nbsp;I would order a new headset, but after confirming this is not a hardware issue it 1) seems silly to replace my theoretically usable headset and 2) a new headset still may not even work anyway.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Am I forgetting anything obvious here? I'm not worried about Ventrilo settings issues, I can fix those once the microphone is working with windows. &nbsp;At this point, windows is not receiving input from the microphone in even the basic Sound Recorder windows program.
 &nbsp;Talk about frustration.

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 (i7 CPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD with BitLocker) recently updated to Windows 10 Anniversary Update (built 14393.693). I also have installed Office 2016 with Outlook and Publisher, Visual Studio 2010 and 2015, Expression Ultimate, Adobe
 Reader, Skype and a couple of other tools from Microsoft. Also a Surface Dock, a permanent micro SD card with BitLocker (64GB then 128GB). All Windows and drivers are up to date, and no issues reported in Driver Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From time to time I noticed some software does not respond anymore (e.g.: File Explorer, Internet Explorer), but I'm able to switch to other programs such as Office, Visual Studio, etc. And I also noticed that something that helped to make it respond again
 is disconnecting or reconnecting a USB device, even the Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many things, even uninstalling software, reinstalling drivers and much more.
<strong>But it seems that what actually makes the device and Windows respond normally is when I remove the micro SD card.&nbsp;If I insert the&nbsp;card again, the problems start again. If I remove the card again, everything goes back to normal.</strong> I repeated this
 several times and since many days I don't experience issues anymore because the micro SD card is not inserted anymore. I only use it when I really need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was actually interesting to have the card permanently inserted because I was using it to store some files that don't fit on the SSD, or even to have some backups of files, just in case. It is not&nbsp;critical so I can live without it, but it was nice to have
 it inserted instead of going to different places with the card in my pocket every time, which sometimes I could forget to take it with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if anyone experienced the same issue and if found a fix for it, if any available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Oliver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue happened also with the previous version of Windows 10 (1511), and if I am not mistaken even with Windows 8.1 (but I did not pay much attention then so I cannot confirm).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I was having issues when trying to update to Windows Anniversary (1607, build 14393.693) I was forced to reset the Surface and then reinstalled everything again. So yes, I did reset it and this issue still happens from time to time when the micro SD
 is inserted. It has been a month that I don't have the card inserted and so far everything is running very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Credit Card declined</h2>
                    <p>My credit card that I used to subscribe to xbox live with has suddenly been cancelled without my permission, now I cant play online and I have to pay $20 to get back online? Why is that? I also cant use any other method of purchasing a new membership without
 using the card, so Im basically being scammed. My membership is over and even though I bought an xbox live code, it isnt letting me activate without me having to pay an additional $20 to "reactivate" my membership. To sum up, my credit card info stopped working
 for one day, then it tells me in order to get my membership back I "have" to cough up $20, why this much all of a sudden? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Hey MK260,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! It could be your account is now past due. When a payment is missed, the Gold subscription will continue to work for a period of time, but the account will still be responsible for said payment. We do have a

<h2>            Gamer-Tag Corrupt Only On One Game&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My brother and I play games together, recently we decided to play gears of war 2
<b>again</b>.<br />
<br />
My brother logs into the game and everything is fine.<br />
<br />
I log in on my gamer tag and I get hit by a lot of achievements and a "Network updating" cog and the console crashes, all
<b>simultaneously</b>.<br />
<br />
I delete my saved game data and tried again and I still get achievements, network updating and console crashing.<br />
<br />
I tried deleting my gears of war 1 saved game data since my brother thought the achievements were from that game... Somehow? Still.. My problem persists.<br />
<br />
Is there a way I can delete all history of the game from my gamer tag? All the achievements also? I think it might solve my problem.<br />
<br />
<b>No other games have this problem... Just my gamer tag on this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
specific</span> game.</b></p>

<p>It did not work. I kept searching for a solution and found that the "SIERRA WIRELESS DRIVER" was causing the problem. After two months and $100 dollars of "fix everything" software that don't work, in 5 minutes I fixed the problem for free.</p>

    <title>Default Program does NOT select&#47;set Application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sewhelpme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Program does NOT select&#47;set Application</h2>
                    <p>I have read all the current posts on this subject, but none of them are quite the problem I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hardware is an ASUS Transformer T100TAM. It came with Win 10, but husband installed our registered Win7 in order to get he free Win10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Settings-&gt;Set Default Programs I have found 2 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) an application I have installed (EditPad by JGSoft) is not available to be selected as a default application instead of OneNote or NotePad;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>(2) when the application I want is available from the list and I select it, nothing happens. For example, under select default browser, FireFox, MS Edge and MS IE display. No&nbsp; matter which one I select, it returns to the "choose a default" as if I never
 selected anything. (What I want is FireFox). I have tried setting using by file type (extensions) and protocols. Same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some articles I read suggested the problem is somehow related to the manner in which the OS was upgraded but I found no solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to have my preferred text editor and browser as the defaults and not be constantly asked to set them in settings where I can not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any assistance you are able to provide.</p>

            <p>For #1, necessary registry entries have to be added in order for the program to be listed in Default Apps. Regardless, you can right-click a file type that you want to associate with "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">EditPad", click
 Open with... select EditPad from the list and enable the "Always use..." checkbox and click OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For #2, As a workaround, click Set defaults by app in the Default Apps window. this option launches the Classic Dfeault Programs UI.</span></p>

            <p>1) registry entries were already present. However, I seemed to have fixed the problem and am uncertain what worked.</p>

            As I mentioned, I select Firefox ... and when I do something which should go directly to FireFox it goes instead to MS Edge. When I return to this screen, it looks exactly as you saw it here -- as if I never made a selection.

<p>
</p><p>Control Panel<br />
(select View by [Small|Large] Icons<br />
select Default Programs<br />
select Set Your Default Programs<br />
scroll down to the program to be fixed<br />
click on blue text (2nd to the bottom right hand side):<br />
SET THIS PROGRAM AS DEFAULT<br />
-- this will enable ALL relevant defaults set to that program<br />

Didn't find my editor listed but fixed browser (FireFox) and email client (Becky!)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you are seeing the error: "There is a problem with the server's security certificate. The security certificate is not from a trusted certifying authority.", it often happens when you don't use SSL to secure your email account. To fix this error,
 use the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Manage Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Choose the account that's out-of-date to display the account settings dialog.</li><li>Choose <strong>Change mailbox sync settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced mailbox settings</strong>. You may have to scroll down in the dialog to see Advanced mailbox settings.</li><li>Check the boxes for <strong>Require SSL for incoming email</strong> and <strong>
Require SSL for outgoing email</strong> and then choose <strong>Done </strong>&gt; <strong>
Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Kinect always-on question.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tiziii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect always-on question..</h2>
                    
<p>Since this is the official XBox Forum I hope an official Microsoft person sees this and could answer..</p>

<p>So I heard that for the new XBox one Kinect has to be alwasys on and connected in order for the XBox to work.</p>
<p>So.. My Question to you, dear Microsoft, is:</p>
<p>Are you really expecting me to have a camera in my room that films everything I do?<br />
Do you expect &nbsp;me to have myself filmed or listened to while&nbsp;having Sex?</p>
<p>Do you really expect me to be filmed sleeping, eating, hanging out with my friends and everything else I do?</p>

<p>Ya know, Microsoft, I'm really really trying to like the new XBox, but you're making it awfully tough on me...</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Assuming had an XB-1, &nbsp; I wonder what would happen if you put a towel over the Kinect? &nbsp;Elect Tape over Camera Recticle &amp; Mic maybe? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If i got one, thats what i'd do, as i have no plans to play to use it and dont want to even wonder if it's watching
 me or not... &nbsp; &nbsp; FYI, them saying it doesnt watch does not make me feel assured of anything....</p>

<p>@Hellfire: I think it's good that the media makes such a big buzz around it, cause otherwise Microsoft wouldn't change it..</p>
<p>I mean just look ath the always-on internet thing. I bet ya everything I have Microsoft was planning on doing it, Media made a huge buzz, we users complained, and MS gave in.
</p>
<p>Let's just hope MS does the same with Kinect.. So keep it going, Media :)</p>

<p>I can handle every other rumor going around.. the used game fees, the online check, everything else... but Kinect mandatory is what got me to just say no. Paranoid or not. I can turn it completely off, then why bother making it mandatory in the first place?
 I should have the option to keep it wrapped up in the box if I want since I'd never use it for anything and never plan to.</p>

            <p>The solution is to download the Windows 10 ISO on a working computer, then use Rufus to create a bootable copy.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Create a bootable copy using Rufus:</p>
 during setup. The thumbdrive needs to be formatted as FAT32 and use the GPT partitioning scheme. To do this, you need to use

</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">After you have installed Rufus:</p>

            sorry but this does not work. &nbsp;I have a Dell inspiron with a 32gb eMMC and ive tried everything. &nbsp;if you completely delete all partitions on the HDD your pretty much lost. &nbsp;Nothing works. &nbsp;I've tried all formats in Rufus and ive tried disk-part with several
 different configurations and nothing works. &nbsp;when you partition the thumb-drive for GPT it doesnt boot into it. &nbsp;

<p>You have to check if your computer is UEFI based. The best way to find out is checking on the front page of BIOS screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use that information to format your thumb drive.</p>

<p>i have the same issue with the xbox live, disconnects every 10-20 mins, connects fine again, only to do it again 10-20 mins later. playing single player games atm, but if i was online this would be a big problem getting booted out randomly all the time.
 and same with the site, seems to be running really slow but other websites are fine.</p>

<h2>            Perhaps the wrong forum but how is Morrowind on 360&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As opposed to original XBox?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm excited about Skyrim and I've just now gotten into Oblivion.&nbsp; Its a great game and it makes me wish that I had experienced Morrowind.&nbsp; I've been looking at options to purchase M'wind and I was pleased to discover it on the list of games supported for
 backwards compat on 360.&nbsp; I haven't really had good experiences with games on that list however, so I thought I ask on this forum and find out if anyone has played Morrowind on 360 and if it was stable etc.&nbsp; I'd also like to know if the GOTY Morrwind pack
 is fully supported on 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I COULD just play Morrowind on the PC, but I've seen on other forums where it doesn't play nice with Win7 and I'm not really interested in learning any tricks to make it work.</p>

<p>You should invest the time to get Morrowind working on PC. There's a nice new high resolution texture pack on the way soon which makes it look amazing!</p>

<p>Gamestop stopped carrying orig Xbox stuff. &nbsp;Half.com and the Amazon marketplace are a great place for finding nice copies of orig Xbox stuff. &nbsp;I got a copy of Deus Ex Invisible war in "Very Good" condition for less than $8 on Amazon mkpl. &nbsp;In my opinion
 the condition was better than advertised.</p>

<p>When my cousin let me borrow it for the 360. The frame rate would drop to at least 15fps at night time. I would recommend buying it for the P.C. Its an old game so as long as you have a modern p.c you should be able to run it well.</p>

<h3> jamespedersen  say:</h3>
<h2>            UDP Port 137 Outbound Traffic</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; I have an issue with only one computer on a LAN of about 30 computers.&nbsp; It has outgoing traffic to external i.p addresses via udp port 137.
</p>
<p>Its driving me batting as I have formatted the machine 4 times using trinity rescue, change i.p addresses and computer names and still the traffic continues.&nbsp; For now I have&nbsp;blocked all UDP 137 traffic trying to leave the LAN.&nbsp; I've had a support case with
 Symantec for last few weeks and they can't work it out as all scans show up nothing. I've also used several&nbsp;other virus scanners.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only clue I have&nbsp;is an application called TCPview claims the data&nbsp;comes from the System&nbsp;process within windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Also
 affects Windows 7 Pro. Malwarebytes picks up the activity and blocks the transfer some of the time. Please help&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the computer connected to a domain network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may use firewall to block the&nbsp;UDP 137 ports and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Windows firewall software, you can allow or disallow applications by name or by a specific port number. Blocking a port through the Windows firewall will block network communication to any application that tries to bind to it. You can block specific
 ports through the advanced settings of the Windows firewall. <br />
<br />

            <p>Thanks Anannya. I have been reluctant to block the port on the pc knowing that this port can be used for printing and other functions on the LAN.&nbsp; I've been able to determine its coming from a windows process called System (4) .&nbsp; Doesn't matter if machine
 is connected to Domain or not. same issue. Computer is currently connected to the domain. So seems to act as legitimate information but still concerns me.&nbsp; I'd love to stop it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Sidebar v&#39;s Desktop Gadgets, Security Risk&#63;</h2>
                    When I searched for Windows Sidebar the other day, the Microsoft site warned that Sidebar has been officially discontinued due to potentially serious security risks. What I was looking for is actually on my W7 Ultimate OS under Programs and is Windows
 Desktop Gadgets. Can I assume that this new version of supplying Gadgets is now fully secure?&nbsp;

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now

<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

    <title>Windows 10 1803 Scrolling Down Problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 1803 Scrolling Down Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Dell 7567, Windows 10 Home. After new update pages in settings (I guess mostly in new tabs in privacy)&nbsp; can't scroll down.&nbsp; The cursor on the right gets down but page&nbsp;can't move. After randomly clicking the mouse, pages move. I guess it's a bug in
 the new version. I hope you can fix it. Also when I try to open settings it's a little bit laggy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p><span>I've only got one solid friend who I play with regularly and it's getting pretty lonely having to play alone 99% of the time. I've tried the forums once before and it didn't really work out but I thought I'd give it another
 shot.&nbsp;<span>I'm a bit of a dork but if that doesn't bother you than feel free to add me.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Looking for guys/girls and anyone inbetween who don't take things too seriously and just looking to mess around. Before I ramble on aanymore, I'll list a few details.</span></p>
<p><span>I've got Halo 3/Reach/4, GTA V, Deadrising 2, Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds, MW3, and I've been messing around in Warface. Even if you're just looking for someone to talk to while you mindlessly grind in your favorite RPG,
 that cool too.</span></p>
<p><span>I don't have many multiplayer games but Im looking to pick up a few more. Anyways, sorry for the long post and don't be afraid to add me.</span></p>

    <title>Bad_Pool_Header BSOD blocking attempts to run diagnostic tests - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joanxe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad_Pool_Header BSOD blocking attempts to run diagnostic tests</h2>
                    <p>I have been constantly receiving BSOD messages about a bad pool header and I cannot boot Windows 7 normally. I have to use Safe Mode with Networking to try search for solutions. When my computer tries to use start up repair, it always fails because the start
 up repair is offline. I have posted the problem signatures below this paragraph. I tried running chkdsk and memtest86 but I always end up getting the BSOD before any test is performed. In fact, with any diagnostic testing that require rebooting, I always end
 up getting the BSOD. How can I start the process to fixing the corrupt pool header if the BSOD is preventing me from running the tests? I have not made changes to the computer before I received BSOD; I did not have an external device or updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem Signatures:</strong></p>
<p>Problem Event Name: StartupRepairOffline</p>
<p>Problem Signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Problem Signature 02: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Problem Signature 03: unknown</p>
<p>Problem Signature 04: 399</p>
<p>Problem Signature 05: AutoFailover</p>
<p>Problem Signature 06: 1</p>
<p>Problem Signature 07: BadDisk</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed WhoCrashed program to help decipher the dump files. According to the analysis from WhoCrashed, there are two things causing the pool header to be corrupt: AVG and ntoskernl.exe.<span>&nbsp;The results of the analysis are posted
 below this paragraph. The frustrating thing is, I tried to start with uninstalling AVG and all of its components. I even installed YourUninstaller program to make sure everything connected to AVG was removed. This still did not work, you can see by the second
 analysis that AVG is still in my computer. Yes I have tried CCleaner and I would not be surprised my registry is becoming damaged from the frequent registry cleaning for AVG. When I noticed it was not helping I uninstalled CCleaner. As for the Windows kernel,
 I decided not to do anything about it until I completely remove AVG.</span></p>

The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.

<br />
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: avgldx64.sys (AVG AVI Loader Driver, AVG Technologies CZ, s.r.o.).

<p>Please help me figure out a way to fix both of the issues while taking in the fact that I am unable to run tests that require rebooting. If you need any more information, please inform me. I would greatly appreciate your help!</p>
