<h2>            Windows 10 Phone &#40;Lumia 950&#41; will not readily charge in dock</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 950 that does not charge readily when connected to an HP Elite X3 dock.&nbsp; There is no problem at all in charging when simply connected to a power source.&nbsp; However, when connected to the dock, which also serves, when connected to a monitor,
 as a USB connection, the phone sometimes charges, but often times does not charge.&nbsp; I have found that the solution is to shutdown the phone and restart it.&nbsp; Then, it will charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is cause of this problem and is there a way to fix it, short of having to restart the phone each time?</p>

    <title>Nokia 6630 Supported ringtones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stelmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6630 Supported ringtones</h2>
                    Just a quick question.<br />
<br />
I have found that when I try to select a mp3 track for a ringtone I get a message saying that the format is not supported.<br />
<br />
My phone previously let me select them for ringtones but now won't.<br />
<br />
Any information will be appreciated.

            Some operator's (I know of, e.g., Vodafone did it) have prevented the use of MP3s as ringtones on the 6630.
<br />
<br />
The error message you're shown seems to indicate that would be the case.<br />
<br />
If not, put the MP3s in "\Nokia\Sounds\Digital" in phone memory (C-drive) or "\Sounds\Digital" on the memory card (E-drive), and at least then you should be able to use them as ringtones.<br />
<br />
Othewise, it could be an MP3 file that's not really an MP3 file, or one formatted/generated in a way that's somehow not compatible. (Hard to say without access to the file itself.)

            Thanks for your replies. It is Vodafone which have blocked the use of mp3 files as ringtones unless downloaded from their wap site.<br />
<br />
I have a new problem regarding a message ''unable to complete installation, security error'' when installing new themes. I suspect this is the same vodafone thing. My old 7610 just warned me about no certificate present.

That maybe just a settings issue? The N70 has the following option sometimes set by default.<br />
<br />
Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Manager &gt; Options &gt; Settings &gt; Software Installation (and Online certif. check)<br />
<br />
Software Installation needs to be on whilst Online certif. check needs to be off.<br />
<br />
Is the 6630 similar? If not then as you say, it could be a network restriction issue.<br />

<h2>            sorting data on master sheet and all other sheets sort to with corasponding data follows</h2>
                    I am working on a attendance worksheet the 1st sheet is the master sheet. On this sheet I want the names in alphabetical order. I know how to sort the names where the other data on the sheet moves with the names but the problem is that the other sheets
 that the names are links with using the formula (=a2) the other data that goes with the names on the other sheets don't move with the names. Is their anyway to sort the names on the master list and all the data that goes with the names moves with it on all
 the other sheets.

            <p>The real answer is - don't use more than one sheet. If you have a master sheet with all your data, apply data filters on your data set to allow sub-sets of the data to be shown as desired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF you must have other sheets, first break the links to the names by copying and pasting values, and convert the other columns to VLOOKUP formulas to extract data from your master sheet. Then you can sort your sheets any way you want and the values will
 move with the values in column A.</p>

<h3> mr. m. j.  say:</h3>
<h2>            A bug in IE11&#8217;s handling of multiple monitors&#8217; scaling</h2>
                    <p>My primary display is set to 150% scaling. My secondary display is (apparently) set to 125% scaling.<br />
I‚Äôm using Windows 8.1. I let it scale display content for different displays, as introduced in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I am using a stop larger sizing than the (miniscule) default one.</p>
<p>IE11 is one of few programs officially adjusting to per-display scaling.</p>
<p>But it does it wrong.</p>
<p>Its default zoom is 150% on my primary display, that is alright. (Or maybe I&nbsp;set it so, I don‚Äôt remember this for sure, but I believe that‚Äôs how IE adjusted itself to my scaling settings.)</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;when I&nbsp;drag IE‚Äôs window onto the other screen, it does not change its zoom to 125%‚Äîas it should‚Äîit does so to 120%, resulting in the text being a tad too small, and more difficult to read. If I manually change it to 125%, and then drag the window
 back, it changes zoom to 156%. See what‚Äôs happening?</p>
<p>I consider this an obvious bug, contradicting how IE should heed per-display scaling as implemented in Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>Awhile back someone on this forum managed to solve this problem.&nbsp; I wish I could find the post for you but, unfortunately, I can't.&nbsp; As I recall, what he did was to go into the second monitor and reconfigure its software to a higher dpi scaling, which tricked
 Windows into believing it was something that it was not.&nbsp; The result was not optimal (believe he settled for 125% on both monitors), but it seemed a good workaround to this obvious design flaw.&nbsp; There may be others on the forum that can recall this post.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Meanwhile, you might want to have a look at these scaling tweaks..........</p>

    <title>How do I get back to Outlook desktop version on my Samsung Galaxy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get back to Outlook desktop version on my Samsung Galaxy tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since outlook upgraded its look a few weeks ago, my tablet will only show it in the tablet mode, which is useless to me because it has almost no options, it has no formatting at all for messages, and doesn't even show me all of my email. I need formatting
 and the other desktop version features because I do newsletter-type emails to groups every week, and they are really tedious to create without any formatting and they look terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have an Internet-enabled computer, and now I have to go use a public computer at the library to do the very thing I bought a tablet for. I even downloaded an Outlook app, and that has the same problem, no option to switch to desktop mode. &nbsp;I'm also
 really technologically old-fashioned, so that doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link I use to log in is&nbsp;https://outlook.live.com/owa/. I tried to get it to show just&nbsp;https://outlook.com, but it always puts on the "owa", and I don't even know what that means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply -- I always use a browser, though, and it doesn't take me to the desktop version like it used to. I only tried the Outlook app once to see if it was better than what I was seeing on my browser, and it was even worse, so I uninstalled
 it immediately after and went back to using the browser. I use the default Google Chrome that came with the tablet, and even tried the non-brand browser on it which is only titled "Internet", and that gave me an even less user-friendly version of Outlook.
 I even installed another version of Chrome, and had no better luck, so I uninstalled that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if Microsoft Outlook now has some setting that differentiates between a tablet and a computer, and treats a tablet like a smartphone without even allowing the option of desktop version anymore? I couldn't find anything in my tablet settings
 that shows the option of defaulting websites to desktop view, but then again I'm new to using a tablet and don't really know how to look up those kinds of settings on it anyway.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950&#47;XL slow wake up &#38; brightness problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,<br />
</p>
<p>I have been using a 950 for the past 3 months and have thoroughly enjoyed it. The camera is awesome and the screen is gorgeous.<br />
For the past couple of weeks, i have been having a couple strange issues with it, after an Anniversary update.<br />
<br />
1. Sometimes the brightness just gets stuck at low and i cannot even manually change the brightness from the settings. the one thing that works is a restart. This fixes it every time and after the restart the auto brightness works like a charm.<br />
<br />
2. The phone becomes slow to wake up after pressing the power button, once i press the power button the glance screen shows up and then nothing happens for the next 3 to 5 seconds and then the screen turns on.<br />
</p>
<p><span><span>Both</span><span> problems</span><span> occur
</span><span>simultaneously. </span></span>With version 10586 of Windows 10 mobile it is all worked without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now begun to restart the phone every couple of days, and, before this i had not needed to restart the phone ever since i got it unless an update required it to be restarted.</p>

            <p>Just turned off my auto brightness adjustment, seems to have resolved the wakeup issue for now. my guess, something to do with the light sensor setting to keep it from waking up in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>definitely annoying on an otherwise great device, hoping to test the HPx3 soon though.</p>

            I was about to throw my Lumia&nbsp;950 to the curve for the same problem. I turned off "Glance Screen" and "Change brightness automatically". I haven't had any issues for the past week.

            I'm having the same issues on the 950 XL, slow wake up and screen dimming. I have also tried&nbsp;turning off the auto brightness and glance feature, but it still happens. It happens after long calls. If my phone rings I can't even answer it because of how
 long the phone takes to wake up, I always have to power on off the phone. MS needs to do something about this ASAP. I'm ready to give up on Windows phones. &nbsp;

            <p>Got my first Windows phone eight weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All good for the first week &nbsp;then had the same issue raise its head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got the phone replaced, seven days later same thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soft reset fixed the problem, but it came back with a vengence two days later. Then it got even worse i.e. only lasting 1-2 hours. Got sick of resetting so i performed a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fixed the problem for, you guessed it, one week!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go that phone replaced hoping that three times a charm! One week later........ Yep same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time i used the recovery tool.. Good again for a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rang support, was told to do a hard reset using the power button+ vol up etc etc method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked, got to seven days and all was well!!! &nbsp;On the ninth day dam! It was back. Rang support and quoted the job number. The bright spark offered no help and told me to pack it up and send it to a repair centre??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless I'm the most unlucky guy on the face of the planet getting three faulty handsets in a row, it's got to be a firmware/software issue. He wouldn't have it!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought it might have something to do with the action center alerts as it had occurred after hitting "clear" a couple of times but after reading this your correct in that it seems to be coinciding with long calls????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to turn off the auto brightness and hope this does something...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug need to be fixed as a matter of priority as it's a deal breaker for me..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such a shame as i love the windows UI and the 950 is an awesome phone..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft! </p>
<p>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Hopefully this is an easy question,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking for move to O365 and want to take advantage of One Drive. Are there any options around not only having the files stored on the cloud but also a copy on premise as well so that if we lost internet connectivity users would still be able to access
 their documents?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can set up OneDrive for Business in on-premises environment, using the sync client to sync cloud files to the server. After the sync&nbsp;completes,&nbsp;then we can access these documents without internet connection.</p>

<h2>            Edge reloads pages repeatedly</h2>
                    <p>As Edge open a PDF file on my windows phone it immediately reloads a page twice and then reports about some problems.</p>
<p>This is the last example link&nbsp;http://www.fiba.basketball/OBR2017/Final.pdf</p>
&nbsp;It's really annoying since there is no alternative browser on Windows Phone platform.

    <title>Read Receipts From Only Select Recipients &#38; Read Receipt Log - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smullaney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Read Receipts From Only Select Recipients &#38; Read Receipt Log</h2>
                    <p>After some searching around, I have come up short on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are needing to issue read receipts for correspondence sent to our clients, but when the correspondence goes out it is sent to and/or CC'd to about 40-50 people (some on our team, some on the clients team). I would like to isolate the delivery and read
 confirmation receipts to only be received for certain recipients IE if the client's system takes delivery of the email, we get a receipt and if the clients Project Manager opens the email, we get a receipt - but not for anyone else. We send out 10-50 items
 of correspondence per week so getting all those read and delivery receipt emails would be a disaster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2 would be a log of receipts and what is outstanding - log all the receipts for delivery and read to a spreadsheet or database so that we can quickly look and see, for example, 20 items sent, only 17 read. This will allow us to quickly determine what
 the client has received, but not opened and acted on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping these are all baked in somewhere. I figured out the rules to automatically apply the read receipt for any message I send, but not to isolate it to a select group of people out of all the people that will be on the "To:" or "CC:" or "BCC:" lines. Then
 I haven't gotten anywhere with the log, though I feel like this should totally be built into outlook and I just haven't found it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or a finger in the right direction would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello SMullaney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting here. According to my test, if I sent an email that request read receipts from recipients, I would receive read receipts from all recipients if they approval to send read receipt or their clients are support to send. From my understanding,
 you want to get receipts only from selected recipients. If so, as far as I know, it is not feasible. As per read receipt logs, there‚Äôs no similar logs in Outlook. &nbsp;I totally understand the inconvenient it caused, you are recommended to share your suggestions

<p>By default, the startup folder is C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART, where &lt;username&gt; is your Windows login name. You must show hidden files and folders to see this folder.</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just bought Windows 8 and Office 2010 - but Word, Excel, Outlook etc all open on the old desktop OS&nbsp;version, rather than in Windows 8 (though they appear as tiles pre-programme launch)&nbsp;as a touch-screen application / programme. How do I have the Office
 (Home &amp; Business) 2010 suite be fully Windows 8 integrated, so a) there is no switching between OS and b) the suite&nbsp;is touch-screen enabled?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Office 2010 predates Windows 8 and is still a desktop suite.&nbsp; Office 2010 applications are not built to run as a Win 8 apps and do not have the new Win8 functionality.</p>
<p>As you have just purchased Office 2010 you will probably be entitled to the free upgrade to Office 2013 which MS recently announced.&nbsp; Office 2013 is due next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that "Word, Excel, Outlook etc all open on the old desktop OS&nbsp;version" is a misinterpretation.&nbsp; Win 8 has two operating modes, the tiled UI which allows launch of desktop applications plus the running of the new UI apps, plus the traditional
 desktop mode for running traditional applications such as Office.&nbsp; Both modes are Win 8.</p>

                    I have downloaded a docx file from my professor but when I try to open the file an error message pops up and says "word experienced a error trying to open the file." It suggests check file permission (which is not the problem), make sure there is sufficient
 memory which I'm not totally sure how to check but I can't imagine that being the problem either. Is there something I can do to fix this? Thanks!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Brenna,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you on this.</span></p>
<p><span>Can you try the following steps to check if you can open the file?</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right click the file.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click Unblock.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</span></p>
<p><span>1. The Office version. (Open Word&gt;select File&gt;click Account)</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if all files meet the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Check if other people can open the file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Qing</span></p>

<h2>            Rules &#38; Categories</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; Seeing if anyone can figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we have a Shared mailbox that has 3 people connected to it.&nbsp; I want to create a Rule in Outlook that Marks an original email I reply too with the Blue Category,&nbsp; Red when one of the other users send a reply and Green with the other.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I setup a rule
 to do this it only marks the message I sent in the Sent folder.&nbsp; I want to mark the Message itself after I reply.&nbsp; Does anyone have an Idea?&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a Transportation company.&nbsp; So we want to mark messages with a color based on who replies so we know it's
 being taken care of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi, I have the same problem with the same timeframes and on the same phone. Something has either changed in the app and/or the Office 365 for Business server environment. My personal MS email and Gmail accounts all sync fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have to restart the phone which causes syncing for my O365 account to restart, but then it stops after a while (usually within an hour or two). This also stops Calendar and Contacts from syncing, which, with my O365 email, is pretty much all I use
 my phone for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an in-app Support chat going on for the problem, but it is going nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts please on what the problem is and how to fix it.</p>

<p>Hi, a senior in-app support tech was able to help me with my problem, and it may also help others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He initially asked if I had the MS Authenticator or Intune Company Portal app installed. I had Authenticator installed (not Intune), not because I use two-factor, but because one day I thought I might.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This prompted me to have a look at it, and I discovered that it had entries for both my O365 and personal MS accounts. I went to settings (available from the three dots in the top right) and for "Work or school accounts" found my phone was not a registered
 device. So I did that, and then also enabled browser access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing these things fixed it for me.</p>

<h3> hotdog mcgee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word 2013 display deteriorates in Print Layout view on a Windows 8.1 notebook</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded Office 2010 to Office 2013 on my Windows 8.1 notebook, and Word 2013 is doing something I've never seen before.&nbsp; I prefer to work in Print Layout view.&nbsp; After I've been working with a document for awhile, or more readily if I open multiple
 .docx files, the entire Word window starts to get glitchy.&nbsp; Random lines and characters appear in the document area, as if the document has been corrupted (it hasn't).&nbsp; Some lines of text in&nbsp;the document go missing, or else are duplicated.&nbsp; Word tables are
 totally scrambled.&nbsp; Then parts of the Word window outside of the document area begin to randomly deteriorate.&nbsp; Icons on the Quick Access Toolbar disappear or become corrupted in appearance.&nbsp; Areas on the Ribbon do the same thing.&nbsp; The commands on the action
 bar disappear.&nbsp; If I mouse over any of these decrepit areas, they are restored, except for the document area, which just gets worse and worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching to Read Mode view or Draft view immediately clears up the entire&nbsp;Word&nbsp;window, after which I can switch back to the Print Layout view and everything will be OK for at least a little while.&nbsp; Then the problems start up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this behavior has not occurred with Excel 2013 or Powerpoint 2013 or Outlook 2013, only Word 2013, and only on my Windows 8.1 notebook.&nbsp; Word 2013 is operating normally on my Windows 7 desktop system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that when this happens, all other programs running on my Windows 8.1 notebook are unaffected.&nbsp; The issue is specific to Word 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is up to date, with no pending updates available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us start Word in application safe and then open the files by going to File and Open and check how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that, press the ‚ÄòWindows + R‚Äô key on the keyboard. </p>
<p>In the Run open box type in ‚ÄòWinword /safe‚Äô and hit ok. </p>
<p>Note: There is a space between Winword and /.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If application safe works, try the steps in the following article.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try disabling hardware acceleration in Word and verify the results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>File</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Under Display, select the <strong>Disable hardware graphics acceleration </strong>
check box.</li><li>Click Ok.</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Follow the steps and let us know if that helps. If the issue persists, reply and we will be happy to help you.

            <p>I initially thought that this add-in was the culprit:</p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Name</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>
</p><p>However, a little&nbsp;while after disabling it, the problem recurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to reproduce the problem in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally discovered that selecting the <strong>Disable hardware graphics acceleration
</strong>check box under Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display eliminated the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit&nbsp;disappointing since this problem occurred on a&nbsp;very high-end notebook pc&nbsp;that is only 18 months old, and the issue never occurred over an 18-month&nbsp;period of heavy use of Office 2010 programs including Word (i.e., prior to the Office 2013 upgrade
 that I installed just a few days ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            ActiveSync 4.2 &#38; Wireless Internet</h2>
                    
<p>I have an&nbsp;iPAQ running WM 5.0 that syncs fine with my XP computer. I use WiFi to get my computer on the net. That works fine until I plug my iPAQ into the USB cable. Doing this shuts down my WiFi connection. I have
 to restart my computer with the iPAQ disconnected to get the WiFi connection going again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have the iPAQ connected via USB first, my computer will not establish the WiFi connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an older PPC running WM 4.2 that doesn't have any of these problems when sync'd to the same computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have ActiveSync 4.2 on my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have this problem until the lamest level 2 support person in the world removed my internet security software &amp; installed the 2008 version. We uninstalled that and did a system restore to put the old security software back on. But the
 problem didn't go away. I have since uninstalled the old security software as well. Still have the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking for suggestions on what to do to make things work like they used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andy</p>

            Ibve done this before. I suggest you upgrde to Activesync 4.5. During installation it's going to ask you whether you want to keep wireless connection on when plugged in via USB. You might want to give that a shot.

            It is an issue with ActiveSycn 4.2.&nbsp; The WIFI connection wis disabled whenever a pocket pc connected via ActiveSync.&nbsp; This capability was restored with ActiveSync 4.5.&nbsp; So moving from AS 4.2 to AS 4.5 should resolve this issue for you.<br />

Looking very much forward to answer/fix, as I have exactly same problem with similar software.<br />

I've been told to change encryption from WPA to WEP, but I don't find it desireable to lower the security level.<br />

            Do you guys have the Advanced Network Functionality checked in AS? You might try toggling on/of. It may affect your ability to sync USB, though.

<p><span><span>Try repeating the last steps, but test Internet Explorer before the restart. If this works correctly then it could be a startup program that is altering the default
 settings. If that doesn‚Äôt work then it would still be a good idea to test the startup programs to make sure they aren‚Äôt causing a conflict with Internet Explorer that causes the links to work incorrectly.</span></span></p>

 forum which discussed the same problem as mine and that site suggested to download ADW Cleaner. I was finally convinced ntil I read the comments below that after running ADW cleaner there PC starts to run slow. I tried searching reviews about this software
 but then most of the comments were not satisfied with it. My only probem is how can I get rid of this ads but it seems like there's o slution at all. Can somebody suggest what can I do or what is best software for this? or recommend some sites? Should I donload
 ADW cleaner? Thanks!
