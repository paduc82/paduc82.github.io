<h2>            Monthly earned Microsoft Reward points</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one know where we can see the total Microsoft Reward points earned in a month? I know if i click on the medallion icon, it shows the daily points earned. But is there a place to see the points earned in a month or any given month?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Trying to install 2nd copy of  Office 365 Home</h2>
                    <p>My desktop and laptop are both my own so I do not have a different log in account issue. I pay monthly for the Office 365 Home version on the desktop and it has worked fine for over a year. The package comes with 5 copies and only one is in use. Trying to
 load copy 2 on my laptop that has Windows 8.1. I go to myaccount and it lists both computers as existing but only has a GREEN INSTALL button and an Uninstall button for each system. When I click on the INSTALL button it just tells me it can't do anything because
 something else is installing. I have never seen the "Install Office" button.</p>

<h2>            why can&#39;t I join Homegroup in windows 10 Preview&#63;</h2>
                    I have the windows 10 Preview on my PC and I cannot join the HomeGroup! The first thing&nbsp; checked is to see if p2p.svc, PNRP. and Peer Networking Grouping service is off! to enable these services it is said to delete the idstore.sst file in C:\Windows\Service
 Profiles\Local Service\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking, but there is no idstore.sst file there! Please what do I do now to join or fix the HomeGroup features????

            So it seems that you only read the title and answered from that!! I know where the setting and the HomeGroup is! Now can you tell me why I can't join now,when I was connected before the last two updates to the Preview?? And why there is no idstore.sst
 in it's proper file location? That i need to delete to create a new one which will reset the HomeGroup features: p2p.svc, PNRP.svc and the PeerNetworking Grouping??? Before I installed 10162, I had 10130 and I was able to connect to the HomeGroup of my other
 three computers-2 running Win. 8.1Pro and 1 running Win. 7 Pro Then Iinstalled Preview 10162 and the homegroup stopped working because the right files (idstore.sst) were not there (C:\windows\serviceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking) to
 correct the restarting of p2p.svc, PNRP.svc and the PeerNetworking Grouping! Which is dependant of each other to start! That is where the idstore.sst comes in, by deleting it will reset those services to enable and allow the Homegroup to work as it should!!!!!!!<br />
The same as evaluation copy 10166 it didn't have those services running either and HomeGroup doesn't work with that one. Thank You for responding! But your response is no where near what I'm looking for as an answer or solution. If you look at this link: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/windows-p2p-svcpnrp-svcand-peer-netwoking-grouping/fb980fed-359d-444f-a836-9af0b113d32f,
 and read all of the postings there you will understand what I'm talking about and why I don't have proper HomeGroup connectivity.

            <p>What OS are you running??&nbsp; Open : Show hidden files and Go to: C:\Windows\ServiceProfile\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetwoking\idstore.sst . Now if you are having problems with joining HomeGroup and the p2psvc,PRNPsvc,and the PeerNetworking Grouping
 svc are not on, then you would delete the idstore.sst file, restart your system it will create a new file and then you will be able to enable those services(svc) in the system services folder under Administration in the Control Panel and your HomeGroup will
 function again. Also make sure that the HomeGroup Listener,and the HomeGroup provider services are enabled!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: The idstore.sst file&nbsp;is the (Microsoft Serialized Certificate Store)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you filed this issue using the Windows Feedback app?&nbsp; If not, please do</p>
<p>What hard specs is your device?&nbsp; Make, model, LAN/WAN, driver?</p>
<p>Can you confirm the build you're using currently?..i.e. 10240?</p>
<p>

            <p>For your first question: yes! I have posted in WFA and Win. Preview forum and a few other tech sites.</p>
<p>System:</p>
<p>Mobo: Asus F1A75-V Pro, Cpu: Amd A8-3870K APU, OS: Windows Preview Win. 10.0 10240 build 10240, ram:
16GB@1600Mhz Corsair Vengence, Gpu: ATi Radeon HD6770, SSD: OCZ Vertez 3 120GB,WD-500GB HD,Seagate-1TB HD, LightOn: DVD Multi-Burner, Corsair CX600 600w Psu. Lan: Realtex Pci GBE Family Controller
 Driver v7.90.826.2014, using a NetgearA6200 router. Network is fine I have 3 other computers connected to it, this system was on the homegroup until build 10130 and that's when HomeGroup disconnected and I've been reporting it since, but hoping it will get
 fix with each new build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes the build that I am currently running is Windows 10.0 10240build 10240. and there won't be anymore builds but updates from Windows Updates from this point on. So maybe in the long run I'll get another update that will correct it or when the final
 complete OS comes down that problem will be fixed, but I'd like to know how now in case it isn't. Now I know that Win. 7 and 8.1 has the idstore.sst file but my Win. 10 doesn't!!!</p>

            <p>I resolved this issue to perfection today.&nbsp; Here is what I realized:&nbsp; The initial setup of my Home Group on the host PC&nbsp;did not require the MS Windows login password.&nbsp; Some of the subsequent PCs I added started using the Windows account password and NOT
 the Home Group password initially created on the host PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Left the Home Group on all PCs.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Rebooted the PCs to clear the cache of the existence of a Home Group.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Created the new Home Group on the host PC.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Rebooted the host.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Joined each of the other PCs to this new Home Group.&nbsp; These PCs are all logged in to the Windows account, so you will not be asked to enter the password of the Home Group.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I then opted to reboot each of the PCs, just to be certain of success.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Done Deal!!!</p>

            <p>I am on Win 10 10240. But the problem was also there on 10162. It was not there on 10130. I then , since 1013 would not upgrade to the next version, updated via an iso ( from microsoft) I lost some things after that because I changed from a french version
 (unintentionally bought when updating from 7 to 8) to an english version (at last...) , and apart from this annoying problem, everything is working fine. The other PC on the same network is a portable, also on 10240 and has no problems at all, I created the
 homegroup on there. PCs can see each other on the network and the desktop is asked to join the network, but cannot. Two of the 3 peer to peer services cannot be started on the desktop, so this looks normal to me. But i cannot figure out how to fix this. The
 idstore thing obviously does not work for win10. Is there no alternative?</p>
<p>i even tried creating an empty file with notepad on the location it should be in win8, but this is removed when restarting or trying to join a home network...</p>

            Do you need to remove every continuous section break from a document or a particular continuous section break?
<div><br />
<div>A search and replace is one easy way to remove section breaks. You could iterate through those to identify the ones you want to remove.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note that deleting section breaks puts the section pagesetup back into the previous section so it is very important to work out exactly what you are trying to achieve before a coded solution can be proposed.</div>

<h2>            Sharepoint Designer&#58; Cannot change the filters after closing and opening designer</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone, I am using SharePoint Designer to make a web-part page and I have added my list in it using the data view. After I set all my filters and sorting, everything works fine, but as soon as I close designer and open it
 again, all the editing capabilities (Filters, Columns etc) is no longer available in designer. The page works fine within SharePoint online but if in the future I want to add more filters within designer, I will not be able to do that.</p>
<p>I am in the middle of something urgent so a quick response would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best</p>

<p>Hi TechnicalSupport5,</p>
<p>Do you mean the buttons that on the ribbon are greyed out? If so, could you capture a screenshot for me<b>[</b>click<b> Use rich formatting-&gt;Insert image</b> to upload pictures]?</p>
<p>And how about creating a new page then try to edit it using SharePoint Designer to check the outcome?</p>
<p>If the issue is related to customization/codes, I’d suggest you post in our <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointcustomizationprevious%2Csharepointcustomization&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>There are many issues with SPD due to its flawed design but it looks like you're placing the dvwp outside a web part zone? It should be on line 36. When you click anywhere in the dvwp code, the tools should open up.</p>

<p>I have tried that actually, the problem with putting it on line 36 is that some of the capabilities of editing it from within browser is lot, like adding filters and so on. By putting it inside &lt;zone template&gt; I retain all the editing capabilities in broswer,
 but as soon as I close designer and open it again, design options are gone.</p>

<p>The sequence has to be:</p>

<p>Looking at your 3rd image - I can't see the code at the end of the lines but a wp MUST be within the above tags to work. When I do it that way, I can close SPD and reopen the page with full access to the dvwp filters and so on.</p>

<p>In the third image I have entered the code in the 44th line which is exactly where you have mentioned. I would like to add that I have access to the filters and other setting through browser, but I cannot do the same in the designer after closing and opening.</p>

<p>It is working for me but I have come across issues with the list view tools not showing in SPD frequently before. SPD is a very badly made product and Msft is unresponsive about the issue but there's a trick included in this article (look for the paragraph
 headed "Add the field to the list's views"):</p>

<p>You cannot uninstall WD from W7 since it is part of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install MSE it should disable WD on W7 (WD on W7 is an antispyware program&nbsp;<strong>only</strong>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To ensure there are no software conflicts I've never run WD concurrently with another AV program on XP, Vista or W7.</p>
<p>

<h2>            document-specific settings don&#39;t &#34;stick&#34;</h2>
                    <p>The project I am working on requires the team members to leave track changes on.&nbsp; I have determined how to turn off the warning message (you are about to save a document with track changes on).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Word Options</p>
<p>Trust Center</p>
<p>Trust Center Settings</p>
<p>Privacy Options</p>
<p>Document-Specific Settings</p>
<p>Warn before ......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There appears to be a bug in Word 2007.&nbsp; The "document-specific settings" do not remain in force when I leave the document and come back to it.&nbsp; I am having to continually re-set the "document-specific settings" to get rid of the Save warning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for looking into this.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>How do I obtain the product key to a product I bought online and copy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gecko79  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I obtain the product key to a product I bought online and copy of which I received in the mail &#40;without the product key&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased online and downloaded an upgrade from Office 2007 to Office 2010. The PC on which I installed the upgrade crashed last week and I was forced to reformat the hard drive, losing all installed software in the process. I am now re-installing software.
 After I purchased the upgrade to Office 2010 online, I received a backup disk in the mail. I have not been able to re-install it because I have looked everywhere (inbox, spam folder, etc.) in my Gmail account, which is the one I use. The package indicates
 that the backup disk was sent by Arvato Digital Services. I visited their page hoping to be able to retrieve the product key, unsuccessfully. I don't know how else to obtain the product key and would be grateful for assistance with this issue.

<p><br />
The product you bought is not an upgrade. It is a brand new freestanding 2010 version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have the confirmation email with the product key, call the company you bought it from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup disks do not have product keys and are used in conjunction with the product key you purchased.

&nbsp;Did you ever get the answer to this?&nbsp; This is how I fixed that problem, from my own thread about this;<br />
<br />
I solved this one myself--or rather, with the free program from a list of programs someone posted in another forum.&nbsp; It found my product key via the registry in seconds.&nbsp; It's called "<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nirsoft
 ProduKey</a>," and can be found and dowloaded here:&nbsp; http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html<br />
<br />
There's another one called Jelly Bean which I didn't use, but the Geek Squad guys mentioned it, so that's another alternative.<br />

<p>Hi AzDusty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For display unread emails in Outlook for Mac, the easiest way is to filter emails by Unread (<strong>Home</strong> &gt;
<strong>Filter</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For keeping the groups collapsed every time open Outlook or switch from folder to folder, it's not feasible to achieve it at present. And regarding this feature. there are some users who have same concern as you, you are recommended to vote via

<h2>            French Voice</h2>
                    <p>I would like a French voice when accessing my learning tool in OneNote. You should be able to click on a link as per this article : https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Learning-Tools-for-OneNote-Getting-Started-and-Frequently-Asked-Questions-f304e897-4985-43b6-b6cd-8f64bb11df90
 . &nbsp;Unfortunately, the link is not active. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing my language settings to both France and Canadian French but this does not help, as I am only able to access English US speech. &nbsp;Neither Mark nor Zira read French very well. &nbsp;How can I download French voices to use this program in my

            <p>I have tried &nbsp;following these instructions, but I am not given an option to select a language voice. &nbsp;I have dowloaded the eSpeak French voice but it sounds very computerize and not nearly as good as the French voice I had on my tablet when running Windows
 8.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Office cannot verify the licence for this product. You should repair the Office program using Control Panel.&#34;</h2>
                    <p><span>I need help to fix a problem with the installation of Microsoft Office 365 2013 Education Version that my college provided through their website. I've installed and activated it but I get the following pop-up message every time that I try to run it....
<strong>Microsoft office cannot verify license for this product. You should repair the Office Program by using Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've seen numerous references online to this possibly being related to a "compatibility mode" issue but I've been unable to fix it using your "fix it" tool or by reinstalling the product, or trying to repair it through Control Panel. Also, when I go
 to the Microsoft Office portal for the college it clearly shows it as being activated. I'm using Windows 10 on a desktop PC. All of the Office programs appear to function however, the pop-up message still appears every time each program is opened.</span></p>
<p><span>None of the current online suggestions through this forum have worked for me so far so any additional suggestions as to how this can be fixed would be appreciated!</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!<br />
Rick</span></p>

</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion. I certainly appreciate your help and I'll go through the process to see if it resolves the issue. Please note that I also have an older version of Microsoft Office 2007 installed on my system. Do I need to uninstall it before
 installing Office 365 or can they they both coexist?</p>

<p>You would not guess i am an Insider and the last to know about these links</p>
<p>My upgrade started then failed.&nbsp; No or very little response from Network</p>
<p>Not surprised about that either.</p>
<p>Downloading the tools from MS was a great 46kbps. Could have written it faster</p>
<p>Just have to wait until states goes to sleep before i try download / upgrade again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Said it before.&nbsp; Nice if MS updated the Insider Hub information for once</p>
<p>

<h3> liat gluska  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Preview will not connect to the internet on both x86 and x64 flavors.  PLEASE Help.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had (and still have virtual-box). &nbsp;I have installed yesterday the VMware workstation (which&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;is not compatible with Hyper-V (but still installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed both Windows10 Preview flavors <strong>under HYPER-V</strong>. &nbsp;On either one, I cannot connect to the internet. &nbsp;The x64bit says it's missing files needed (I've
</p>
<p>checked detailed view, it points to "missing windows sockets registry&nbsp;entries" and has 2 "?" marks under Device manager (one of which is the acpi) - Even after
</p>
<p>a SECOND install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The x86 flavor, says i do not have valid ip. &nbsp;(I had to make local user account because of the no internet access). &nbsp;I went through the defaults while installing
</p>
<p>(no motherboards drivers have been asked to be installed). &nbsp;This is a Desktop computer with wired high-band routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a solution for the connection? &nbsp;(I now obviously also have the external switch and is is connected and i can surf on the primary Win8.1 OS).</p>
<p>Do I really need BOTH VMware and Hyper-V installed / Which one is better for this specific problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ANY</strong> help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Utmost Respect,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>Completely</strong> removed the Hyper-V platform from Windows Featured.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then rebooted.</p>
<p>(Vmware services are still running but with no usage for now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opted in the Enable PAE/NX under system/Processor tab in VirtualBox.</p>
<p>Opted in the Enable VT-x/AMD-V &amp; Nested Paging under system/Acceleration tab in VirtualBox.</p>
<p>Created the Virtual PC&nbsp; <strong>as VHD</strong>!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of the above -- are grayed out when the Hyper-V platform is installed and therefor will NOT allow Windows 10 Preview to either install well or connect and activate - until the Hyper-V is removed.</p>
<p>Seems that taking OFF the native, built in Hyper-V Virtualization Platform altogether - Solved the issue.</p>
<p>Just shows that&nbsp; the respectable VirtualBox (v.4.3.12), Works like a charm where the other two platforms, Did not.&nbsp; (Kindly note that the Hyper-V Switch, was installed with no evadent issues, it did show traffice -
</p>
<p>for a few seconds, then remained enabled BUT both IPv4 &amp; IPv6 went to no connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows managed to successfully Connect and auto activate -- on both x86 &amp; x64 flavors.

 else works. It worked for me.

<h2>            How can I shop from outside the USA&#63;</h2>
                    When I sign in and want to shop - only the free applications are available. When I want to buy a full version - I can't do it! I tried to add a credit card, but I can't submit an address from outside the USA. It is not possible to change the country.

<p>I assume you <a href="http://www.mobilityminded.com/6615/windows-marketplace-for-mobile-gets-storage-card-support-and-world-view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
changed the world view settings in Windows Marketplace for Mobile</a> to the appropriate catalog of your country? I added the creditcard information via the browser of my laptop, however it is also possible from your Windows Phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem might be caused by the country registration of your Windows Live ID, which doesn't match with the creditcard information ??</p>

    <title>all downloaded emails go to junk folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ks9642  say:</h3>
<h2>            all downloaded emails go to junk folder</h2>
                    <p>I recently repurchased and installed outlook 2013. I donwload emails from hotmail.com and gmail, and ALL of them go into the junk folder, even though I have my junk mail setting on the lowest setting (no junk mail separation). I can't just simply move them
 either but have to mark them as read first to be able to move them to the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really shouldn't have to set each email to 'not junk' to get them to go to the inbox directly, still leaving non-repeat senders to end up on the junk folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions?</p>

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is happening based on the filter settings. Can you go to rules in Office 2013 and check to ensure the emails are not set to automatically go into Junk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I should have clarified: there are no rules set in Outlook 2013. You wrote "Office 2013". Is there another place to set rules?

</p><p>Sorry, that was my mistake. I meant Office 2013. However, your rules can be carried over from your Microsoft account rules at&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com</a> when you navigate to settings, Manage rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, let's start over. These are normal emails that I have received for months or years from friends, business contacts, and others. Gmail forwards to my hotmail account online, and that all gets downloaded to Outlook desktop. This all worked just fine
 for many years, and now with the installation of Office 2013, everything goes into the junk folder. As I mentioned, I would have to click on EACH email and make it not junk for it to go to the inbox. This is not a viable option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You write "all downloaded emails go to junk folder". Have you made sure that before the "download" they are
<strong>not</strong> in the Junk folder on the server? </p>
<p>Is "all" really true or is it "almost all"?</p>

<p>If the Outlook.com account is configured in Outlook 2013, first check the junk email settings. Junk Email options is on the Home ribbon. Is uit set higher than No filtering or Low filtering?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also - if outlook desktop is moving them, the banner on the message in the junk folder will say Outlook did it. If it says something else did it (it wont say what though) it was either moved by the server or a 3rd party antispam utility. (Likely if you don't
 use Defender Antivirus as most 2rd party virus scanners also install spam filters in outlook.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its not an addin or junk mail settings: Close Outlook. Right-click on the Start button and choose Run or press Windows key + R&nbsp; to open the Run command. Type or paste the following into the Open field and press Enter or click OK to restart Outlook. (There
 is a space before /.)<br />
<br />
outlook.exe /cleanserverrules</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will clear any rules on the server - I've seen a few cases where the person did not knowingly set a rule and it wasn't showing in Outlook desktop but had messages going into RSS or the mailbox root folder.</p>

            External designs of a specific device never change as they are registered ones. Internal design or specifications may change with change in service provider, chances of this also are very less... So about your display concern, then no need to worry, the
 display will remain the same for all Lumia 635 irrespective from where you have bought.<br />

<h2>            Task manager soccer game after boot</h2>
                    <p>I'll never understand the need for overbearing system maint/boot when entering the desktop after bootup. It's bugged me for years with Microsoft's OS's.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6fa2663-0b34-4a33-a5f2-808f7b401ed3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This goes on for the 1st 16 minutes after every hard boot. Most of the hits are due to maintenance and service host proccesses. CPU averages 3% to 31% and Memory about the same during this activity. Some can be interupted but will retart if you pause which
 is most likely the cause of many erroneous app crashes that are reported. In comparison and not to cause argument, Linux does all this before reaching the desktop in minimal time with only freedesktop-org left for desktop settings. I really don't see the need
 for so much activity before one can actually have a smooth running system?? And it is, Win 10 B-10162 is looking good and does flow well during use, I've even adopted Edge for full time use. Anyways, this occurs 9/10 times after a hard boot. Why?</p>
