<h2>            OneNote - Screen Clipping Problem</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to perform screen clipping, my whole monitor turns white. If I reboot the machine, it works for a while. I have 3g of memory so it must be something else. The OneNote service is active and visible from the system tray. OneNoteM.exe process&nbsp;is
 running as well (viewed from taskManager) . All ideas are welcome to help solve this problem. Other than this glitch,&nbsp;OneNote is awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            You might check to see if your video drivers need updating. I have seen outdated drivers cause this, especially on Win XP.

<p>Kathy,</p>
<p>I rebuilt my system about two weeks ago. Still, I notice there is an update from NVIDIA last friday for my FX 3500 video card. I will download, install, reboot and get back to you. Sometimes the problem takes a while to re occurr after a reboot so it may
 be later today until I know. But I really beleive it's something else, just don't know though. I really appreciate your input.</p>
<p>Thanks Again</p>

<p>Just thought I would follow up in case anybody ever experiences the same problem. I still don't have a fix for it, other than rebooting the machine. You would think that it would be a memory problem but, it can happen when memory resources are low and work
 when many applications are running. As of now, it works for a while. Too bad, I really liked the feature.</p>

<p>Ruchi,</p>
<p>I appreciate your response but your suggestion did not work.</p>
<p>Yesterday after rebooting my machine, I had no problem with screen clipping. This morning I tried it the first thing and it does not work. When I hit (Windows key + S) instead of a 40% or 50% white screen I get 100% white screen. If I try to capture anything
 I get a black window inserted into OneNote.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I did not log out over night.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I have a dual monitor.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>I've had some problems like that, also. What worked for me was to go into OneNote's options and deselect the option to place the icon in the Notification area of the taskbar. Exit OneNote, restart it, then re-enable the option.</p>
<p>You might also want to try clearing temp files, also. Close all programs, then click<strong>Start button/Run</strong> (or press
<strong>Windows key + R</strong> ), type<strong>%temp%</strong> then press Enter. If there's a lot of stuff in there, select it all and delete.</p>

<p>I have been having this same exact problem for years!&nbsp; ON2003, ON2007... and now with ON2010!!&nbsp; Under Windows 2000 and Windows XP... and with three completely different PCs, single monitor&nbsp;and/or dual monitor setups...&nbsp;There seems to be some kind of conflict
 with&nbsp;some applications or their components.&nbsp; Somtimes its internet explorer, sometimes its firefox, etc... very intermittent, very hard to reproduce and hence very hard to pin-down the root cause.</p>
<p>I have seen multiple threads popup here and there on various forums concerning this issue; no&nbsp;solution and&nbsp;no&nbsp;reliable work-around (aside from closing applications or rebooting PC).&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange one I came accross consisted in launching Internet Explorer simultaneously
 while initiating a screen clipping?!&nbsp; It worked a few times when I tried it, but not consistently.</p>
<p>Here are a few other threads&nbsp;on this annoyance:</p>

<p>Rainald:&nbsp;&nbsp; I leave my machine on standby.( Basically I just leave.) I've had this problem happen a few minutes after a reboot. One time it was right after a reboot. I successfully clipped an image and on the second try,....the white out... I running XP professional
 - dual monitor</p>
<p>Bob:&nbsp; Clearing the temp files did not help but thanks for the suggestion. A good idea to try.&nbsp; Also when I tried changing the options settings per your suggestion it worked but only one time. Since then it has not. But it worked once.</p>
<p>Alainr : thaks for the links. Please keep me posted here if you find a solution.</p>
<p>Can anybody recommend another screen clipping program that works with one note.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I have a solution to this problem. Perhaps this information will help you if you experience the same problem. I contacted John Guin (from the link from AlainR above). John works with the OneNote team at Microsoft.</p>
<p>John requested that I send him the output from the msinfo32.exe file.</p>
<p>In this file he noticed that logmein was driving my video driver. (Under Components - Display)</p>
<p>I called up logmein and they had a separate install that does not install the mirror driver for the video card.</p>
<p>I installed it and my problem has cleared up.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you who suggested something. I appreciate it.</p>

            The form must contain elements that the Object Depencies tool cannot handle - probably its Record Source. See

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>However, you can always record a Macro and save it as a shortcut which will allow to change back the font color to black from any font color, and will provide you the same functionality.

<p>Sometimes when entering a numeric code in some app or settings, the enter key is not there. Hit the back button and there should be a continue' option at the bottom of the screen. If not, just wait as the code is sometimes verified automatically without

    <title>Office 365 SMTP settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark josephgalay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 SMTP settings</h2>
                    
<p>Good day!</p>
<p>We recently moved to Office 365 from &nbsp;Exchange on premise.</p>
<p>We have custom .Net applications used within the organization. We need to configure those applications to use Office 365 SMTP server settings for automated email. Fortunately we are able to do this by using smtp.office365.com, port 587, and global admin
 credentials.</p>
<p>Is there a way, we can use normal user accounts for the login credentials instead of global admin? We tried but unauthorized error.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>If you have configured SMTP client submission on your application, you can use a licensed Office 365 mailbox to send emails no matter whether the mailbox account is an admin or an end user. So I’d like to confirm some information below to troubleshoot the
 issue:</p>
<p>1. Do you use SMTP client submission described in the following article on your application?</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554323(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554323(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>2. Can all end users in your organization not send emails using SMTP client submission?</p>
<p>3. The entire error message.</p>
<p>Besides that, I suggest you check if the end users have been assigned the Exchange Online license. To check it:</p>
<p>1. Login to your Office 365 admin center.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to USERS-&gt;Active Users.</p>
<p>3. Select the end user account, then click EDIT in the right panel.</p>
<p>4. Click Licenses, then click the drop-down icon after your Office 365 plan name.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<h2>            Bing Search - Hong Kong - English</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a user of Windows 8 on my notebook. I am living in Hong Kong and I don't know Chinese / Cantonese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to notice that all the apps in Windows 8 including Bing search website has Region set to "Hong Kong - Chinese" but there is no English version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many foreigners and expatriates living in Hong Kong who knows English and does not know Cantonese / Chinese and it makes it difficult to know the regional updates like news, finance as all the apps in Windows supports only
<strong>Hong Kong - Chinese</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like the App team including Bing Search team to update the preferences to set the region as
<strong>"Hong Kong - English"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the input.&nbsp; It is with only one website so far.&nbsp; It happens when the website processes payment through a third party which is either Visa, MasterCard or NYCE network depending on the card used.</p>
<p>If I go to Internet Options, click on the Security tab, then uncheck "Enable Protected Mode" I can then process a payment.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm trying to find what to change in the Custom Level settings so I don't have to keep Protected Mode unchecked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Chrome browser causes same error.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got voipcheap working on my N8 at the weekend using these settings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nokiausers.net/forum/general-95/4058-nokia-n95-tips.html#post32964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokiausers.net/forum/general-95/4058-nokia-n95-tips.html#post32964</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The settings can be found in Settings -&gt; Connectivity -&gt; Admin. Settings -&gt; Net Settings -&gt; Advanced VOIP settings. You first define the SIP settings, then define a service using those settings. Not totally intuitive but it does work in the end! Call quality
 was very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS I agree - the N8 is a great device! :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>To follow up on my previous post - I've found those settings for the native VoIP client in the N8 to be unreliable. Sometimes the call will work, sometimes (more often than not) it won't. I'm wondering if being behind a router with NAT is causing the problem
 as the voip service is registered but it seems to be establishing the calls that's the problem. :smileysad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround I decided to try the software supplied by voipcheap:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.voipcheap.com/en/mobilevoip.php?phonetype=symbian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.voipcheap.com/en/mobilevoip.php?phonetype=symbian</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be lightweight and all calls worked 100%. Call quality was ok too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two main issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i) while it is running (and after exiting) my phone's contact list is completely empty!? Quite a shock the first time I saw that! However, if you go into the call log it seems to make the contact list work again. Phew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ii) I think it assumes the phone has call/end buttons as on the N8 the only way I can find to hang up a call is to exit the program :smileysad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has native settings for voipcheap/buster etc. that work 100% behind a router/NAT then please post... :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>excellent topic! Unfortunately, there is more problems than answers...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my problem:</p>
<p>I am using a N8 and my voip provider is voipbuster.</p>
<p>I have put the sip settings. To avoid any problem, I have even turned&nbsp;to "always active" (just for testeing for the moment).&nbsp;So, I am connected.</p>
<p>BUT, when I go to the call options, no "voip call" option appears. I have voice or video call and this is all. Is there another setting that I missed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other side, using fring all works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for your help!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. Are you using 3G or WIFI ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using 3G you have to change more settings.. here are the instructions:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even then it won't work for me.. it works once or twice and then when I make a call it goes to the call screen and it doesn't complete the call.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just made a voip call over 3G and it worked well. The problem is that it works one time out of 15 tries.. Nokia better fix this, it is really frustrating. I know I have the right settings in there because it works every once in a while, it I didn't have
 the right settings it won't work at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sip/voip on the Nokia N8 is very unstable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is the exact problem i have with sipgate. never had a problem with my n95 and my d-link dir655 router but trying to get the n8 to work is driving me nuts!</p>

<p>I must admit that it is getting up my nose.&nbsp; Especially due to the fact that it has worked really well with my N80, N95, and N97.&nbsp; I know where the problem is.&nbsp; I Just don't know how to fix it.&nbsp; The problem has got to be in the Advanced Voip Settings application
 that Nokia has suppied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the drawing board.&nbsp; It's not the actual phone.&nbsp; Therefore I have to do some more home work. May be together we can all work it out!</p>

<p>After a lot of searching and 3 late nights.&nbsp; This is what i've found out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connected to my bebox thompson router</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use Fring I can make incoming and out going calls no problem connected to my router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use the native voip settings I can't hear audio on incoming calls</p>
<p>If I use the native voip settings I can make out going calls without any problems and hear audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I switch to 3g or GPRS I can make outgoing and incoming calls with no problems. Just make sure that you have changed the setting in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced voip settings &gt; Voip Services &gt;( select Service) Profile settings&gt;&nbsp; Change AWCDMA to on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then back all the way out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will allow you to make calls over th 3g /gprs network</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are in the europe i'd suggest you select codecs in this order</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) PCMA</p>
<p>2) G729</p>
<p>3) PCMU</p>
<p>4) AMR</p>
<p>5)AMR-WB</p>
<p>6)iLBC</p>
<p>7)CN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for me Nokia N8 voip over 3g/gprs is sorted</p>
<p>I just need to find out what setting I need to change for my router work with native voip now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works using fring so it's got to be a setting that I need to change in the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS I stil love this phone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Recently I did something inadvertently and not knowing what I did, i cant un-do it.</p>
<p>I was receiving&nbsp;spam from one of my own email address so I blocked sender. I thought.</p>
<p>Now, Im&nbsp;not receiving to my working&nbsp;email address any emails from the blocked @motorcycleinnovation.com" address but ALSO nothing from other emails within the company with same&nbsp;"@motorcycleinnovation.com" address.</p>
<p>I can receive "@motorcycleinnovation.com" to other receiving addresses in my outlook, but not to my principal working email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I reverse what I did and hopefully open up access to "@motorcycleinnovation.com" emails and I'll deal with the spam a different away?</p>

<p>I'm sorry to see that my suggestion didn't help. Are you using a Microsoft account (@Hotmail, @Outlook, @Live, @MSN)? If yes, does the issue occur if emails from the domain&nbsp;<span>"@motorcycleinnovation.com" are sent to a different Microsoft account
 domain?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If email from any&nbsp;</span><span>@motorcycleinnovation.com accounts are not received on any Microsoft account domains, there is a possibility that the sender domain is blacklisted. In such cases, the domain administrator of&nbsp;</span><span>@motorcycleinnovation.com

<h2>            outlook.com people reset</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the aim of better syncronising contacts (+500 entries) with Windows 8.1 laptop (people app). I have deleted all my contact at outlook.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then imported csv file succesfully. When I check contacts online, I see under "links" older references to the same contact. This is very strange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore when I check people app on Windows 8.1, some contacts seem to be missing, some double.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done already?</p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall people/mail/calendar app on Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Unliked and relinked my outlook.com/hotmal.com account on Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way for Microsoft to clean up my outlook.com contacs so that I can start again?</p>
<p>

            MSE <i><b>is</b></i> an anti-malware (AV+AS) program for your XP system. <br />
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is not meant to be a replacement for any antivirus software... although it 'acts' like the best.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I tried malwarebytes <u>for a trial period</u> ... Its less than a <i>
[anti]</i>virus program... </blockquote>
To complement MSE's real-time protection and featured on-demand and scheduled scans, please note that it's
<i>only</i> the 'free-edition' (not the trial to be upgraded to the Pro version) of Malwarebytes that is recommended at this Community. It's because of its lack of the 'RTP' feature (only available with the Pro version) that it won't conflict with MSE's normal
 operation. You may use it as an on-demand scanner - maybe once weekly.<br />
<br />
Please note, however, that Malwarebytes Support claims that their program ..."should run alongside antivirus software without conflicts"...
<i>[Note the keyword here is 'should']</i>.<br />
In any case, exclusions may need to be set for MSE (and vice-versa) to achieve the best possible system performance, though (I think) this won't be enough unless you're using an OS other than XP :-(.<br />
See related info from Malwarebytes Support &gt;<br />
- <a href="http://helpdesk.malwarebytes.org/entries/20818081-does-malwarebytes-anti-malware-replace-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Does Malwarebytes Anti-Malware replace antivirus software?</a><br />
- <a href="http://helpdesk.malwarebytes.org/entries/20818081-does-malwarebytes-anti-malware-replace-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What's the difference between the Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Free and Pro versions?</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>... I had malware and Microsoft Sec Ess would not remove it. Every time I removed it, I would then get a message that the threat was still there and to remove it. I supposedly remove it&nbsp; 4 times and still was there...</blockquote>
What was MSE's detection (and Malwarebytes' removal) for that? Was it a Java Exploit for any chance?<br />
It might be the case that it was not a real infection but leftovers of an attempted (and failed) attack.<br />
<br />
Besides Le Boule's recommendations above to help MSE protect your system, would suggest you
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/plugin_cache.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear the Java cache</a> AND
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/uninstall.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove ALL VERSIONS of the Java Plugin</a> now (and DO NOT reinstall it back!).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps - Please confirm by return.<br />

<h2>            OneNote 2016 Search Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to search for keywords or phrases in my OneNote 2016 Notebook, it won't return any results. If I happen to have the page open where the phrase is, it will highlight it in yellow, but it will say "no results found" in the search bar. Some of my
 notebook pages are receptive to the search function. It's only the notebook pages I've added in the last month that are giving me trouble. I've had this issue before, and it's extremely frustrating since this is the primary reason I use OneNote. I made sure
 all my Microsoft software is up-to-date, so that is not the issue. Please help!</p>

            <p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds like OneNote 2016 Search feature isn't properly working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask some questions to know the best possible resolution to offer.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes on the settings of your PC before the issue started?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done on your end?</li><li>Have you tried running the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Is it Synching? Or any errors upon sync?</p>
<p>Is the text you're searching for truly "text" or is the text you're searching for contained within a PDF or pic? That might not behave search-wise like true text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, in Windows OneNote 2016, when you type in the search box, there it shows you where it is searching. Click on whatever it says and expand to the largest scope to search. e.g. All Notebooks if not already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>1) No. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;It wasn't working, so I decided to update the Microsoft Office 2016 software. It still didn't work after that.</p>
<p>3) No, I did not run troubleshooter, since this seems like a glitch with the software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, It is syncing. Yes, it is truly text. I copied and pasted the words in as "text" using the key command Alt H V T. Like I said, if I was on the page and searched for a phrase on that page, it would highlight it, but it would say "no results found" in
 the search bar. Yes, I selected search through ALL notebooks.</p>

            <p>It sounds like the cause of this issue is related to some updates or programs installed on your PC. We recommend that you perform a clean boot to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts
 that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10. Kindly check this

                    When I log into my outlook (which I've had for years since it was hotmail, they say they need to confirm &nbsp;that I can receive a security code by phone to verify my account. My home # is listed so I clicked SEND but never got the code, Tried again - &nbsp;same
 result. Can you only get the code via text to a cell phone? I don't have a cell phone. &nbsp; I can still access my outlook account by ckicking "SKIP", but it appears my acct. will be locked in three days - UGH.

            <p>There is not even a good manual way to do it. In cases where it is necessary to replicate handwritten or typed material using ditto marks, the best you can do is insert tab stops at the requisite locations in each line and put the ditto marks (straight quotes)
 there. When I faced such a situation, I ended up with this:</p>

<p>In outlook, we have the option to manually choose an email address to send from. Is it possible to let outlook automatically choose an e-mail address?<br />
For example: I have my own e-mail address and a shared email address. When I am working in my shared email address and click on New Email, Outlook use by default my own email address as the sender. Is it possible to let outlook automatically choose the mailbox,

<p>Hi Sarie,</p>
<p>No, it’s not feasible to achieve that in Outlook 2013. When you’re using an account and click to compose a new email, the
<b>From</b> address is the account address. A little more efforts may be required to manually change the
<b>From</b> address.</p>
<p>We appreciate it a good idea with Outlook 2013. The best way to influence our product it to submit feedback to our relevant team:

            Hi Mahdi
<br />
<br />The keyboard language has nothing to do with this setting, it is the region setting that is causing this change
<br />
<br />Are you manually changing the region when this change takes place?
<br />
<br />If you want to permanently set the 'dot' and 'comma' for a region
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />If necessary, at the top right of Control Panel, set View to icons
<br />
<br />Click Region, then on the resulting dialog, click 'Additional Settings'
<br />
<br />The 3 settings to look at are on the Numbers Tab of the next dialog, they are, Decimal Symbol, Digital Grouping Symbol and List Separator . . .
<br />

<p>Dear DaveM121</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Think it has something to do with windows 10 may update</p>
<p>Because I did not have this problem in previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see </p>
<p>I set Regional Formating to Persian</p>
<p>Then I set all symbols to dot.</p>
<p>Then Opened one note and typed 192.168.1.1 with Persian Keyboard</p>
<p>and there is comma again!</p>
<p>
