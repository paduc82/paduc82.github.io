                    I try to run any program/.exe file extension through my command prompt and it simply won't let me.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For every command I type in; either "ipconfig/all", "ipconfig", "java.exe", "java", "javac.exe"... It doesn't matter which command I type in. None of them work!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The error I get says, "(program i'm trying to run) is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file."</div>
<div>Someone please help!</div>

<h2>            Scam - Press Windows key and &#34;R&#34; key</h2>
                    I received a scam call last night (11/10/17) at 7:39 PM (EST) from 1-800-787-8566. It was a guy with an Indian accent from "Windows" in what sounded like a huge, noisy call center.&nbsp; I messed with this guy's mind for about 5 minutes and then finally hung
 up on him. An obvious scam, no doubt.

<br />
Close Outlook.<br />
Do Control Panel-Mail-Email Accounts and remove it there.

<h2>            Skype for Business to Teams chat</h2>
                    I'm having an issue messaging some Teams users from Skype for Business. This user shows as offline, however I can see him online when I am in Teams. I verified that his Teams app is set to accept messages from Skype for Business and this feature works
 throughout my organization. We did do a pilot test group where users were on both Skype and Teams for a period of time, however other users from the pilot group are not experiencing this issue. Any help would be great.

<p>Hi James Bradford (jbradford),</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you post. About chatting from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams, this feature is&nbsp;workable. And when you send a message from Skype for Businee to a user logn in Teams, this user will receive the message from Teams, and if this user logn in
 with Skype for Business, he also will receive this message from Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, about the user show offline from Skype for business, but show online when this user in Teams. The presence between from Skype for Business is&nbsp;separate. The presence from Skype for Business has nothing to do with the presence from Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>
        </p>

            That's the problem though Richard. It isn't working. I have no issue with 99% of the user base. I'm unable to message this one user who is on Teams from Skype for Business. He was using Skype for Business at one point, so I disabled his license in O365
 for troubleshooting purposes. I'm not specifically looking for the presence information, but it should tell me he's online at least, like it does with the rest of my users.

<p>Hi James Bradford,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask if your Skype for Business is deployed on hybrid or on premise environment? 1:1 chat with Skype for Business on premise users is not support in Microsoft Teams. You may send your domain to me in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
PM (Private Message)</a> and I will further check it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if this is not the scenario, I need gather more information to narrow down the possible cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Please make sure the user only sign in to Teams when you IM it and please double check if the user get the IM notification at the bottom right in Teams.</span></li><li><span>To scope where the issue based on, please check whether others in your organization also have the same issue with this specific user.
</span></li><li><span>Please check if the user can receive your IM in other places such as Skype for Business's integration in OWA (Outlook on the web) and Skype for Business.</span></li><li><span>Since the IM notification prompts as a dialog in Teams, you may let the user download Teams app or change a browser to check whether it's a browser issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>Hi James Bradford,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to clarify, you are encountering following issue between Teams and Skype for Business communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot view the online/offline status of all Teams users in Skype for Business and the users cannot receive your IM but the sender receives an notification email indicates the user is offline who
 is actually online. And you made sure the users in Teams didn't log in Skype for Business at the point to prevent conflict. Right now you have two users in your tenant have this issue. Is that correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> deres72  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I turn off the passcode requirement to login windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm sick of entering a pin code everytime I turn on my pc, on win 7 I never had to do that but when I upgraded to 10 it forced me to use my microsoft account (which i don't use for anything since I haven't had my xbox sub in a year).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to go straight to my desktop without entering a pin or password, everything I've found on google says to use the netplwiz but it doesn't work, it still forces me to enter my pin :(</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query at Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to inform you that having a password to login is a security feature. It makes Windows more secure. If you want to login directly:<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
</span></span>First step is to open <strong>Run</strong> command box by simultaneously pressing Windows logo and R keys (Windows+R). In the Run dialog box, type
<strong>Netplwiz</strong> and then press Enter key.<br />
In the resulting <strong>User Accounts</strong> dialog, select your user account first and then uncheck the option labelled
<strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer</strong>. Click
<strong>Apply</strong> button to see <strong>Automatically sign in</strong> box.<br />
In the Automatically sign in dialog, type your password and then re-enter the password to confirm the same.<br />
Finally, click <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p />

            Same problem. I am completely disabled (except for limited use of my right hand). When a caregiver (typing this message) is not here I am unable to get onto my computer. It seems there should be a simple work-around for this, especially since your "chat"
 acts like the login requirement can be turned off. Please resolve this; I certainly cannot be the only person with disabilities who has this problem.&nbsp;

<p>when you get to the screen that asks for a username and password of the default user, you need to enter the full email address associated with your Microsoft account and the password (twice) not the pin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to try again, tick the box 'users must enter a password..." click apply, then untick the box and click apply again.</p>

<p>As you want to connect the desktop computer to a wireless router. The computer should have the wireless capability. For this you may have to buy a wireless network adapter to be able to connect to a wireless router.</p>

<h2>            Program Already running</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to install a better version of a software ('AnyTrans') I already have but when i run the installer, rather than overwriting/replacing the existing files it displays the message .....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Setup has Detected that the AnyTrans is running. You must close it and then click"Yes" to continue, or press "No" to exit."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled the program by using Revo uninstaller. (which removes even the most hidden files and directories of an application )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to run the application after restarting my computer, but still no progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the task manager for any processes relating the application.(But there is nothing besides the setup file of the application!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system ----- Windows 8.1 (x64)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<h2>            Windows&#47;start button doesn&#39;t open, but does light up grey, also sound is softer than it should be</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So today i wanted to press the windows button as a normal person does and it didn't work.</p>
<p>it only lights up grey instead of being black.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried about everything with the powershell stuff and all that.</p>
<p>I did make a new account on my laptop and it worked fine on there but i don't have all my files on that new account which is annoying.</p>
<p>it won't let me copy all the files from 1 account to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing i noticed was when i listen to music on itunes or watch videos on youtube i have to turn the volume up alot in order for it to be the sound i usually listen to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me! it would be very much appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Font size on the Forum</h2>
                    I find it difficult to read the small type used in the posts.&nbsp; Zooming the whole windows is the only way that I see to make the messages larger.&nbsp; Could you add an option that only increases the font size.<br />

<p><span>Hello Mecalith,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is an option in Internet Explorer to do just what you asked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’ve include the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can make webpages easier to read by changing the text size. If you change the text size, graphics and controls will
 remain in their original size but the text size will change.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To change webpage text size</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Click
 to open Internet Explorer.</span></span> </li><li><span>Click the Page button, click Text Size, and then click the size you want.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Notes</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This will change the size of text displayed in webpages, unless the text size was explicitly set by the person who created
 the page. To learn how to override text settings set by the person who created the webpage and use the fonts you pick instead, see
Change the colors and fonts used for webpages.</span> </li></ul>
<span>&nbsp;To override website font and color settings</span>
<p><span><span>If you want to have the fonts and colors you specify in Internet Explorer to be used for all websites, regardless of the fonts that
 have been set by the website designer, follow these steps:</span></span> </p>
<p><span>Please let me know if this helps you</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Zack</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click to open Internet Explorer.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click the <span>Tools</span> button, and then click
<span>Internet Options</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click the <span>General</span> tab, and then click
<span>Accessibility</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Select the <span>Ignore colors specified on webpages</span>,
<span>Ignore font styles specified on webpages</span>, and <span>
Ignore font sizes specified on webpages</span> check boxes, and then click <span>
OK</span> twice.</span></span></p>

            Hello Zack<br />
<br />
I only have the problem on this forum.&nbsp; The default font looks like a Verdana 8.&nbsp; I would like to bump this up to a 12 and only on this forum.<br />
<br />
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span><span><span>
<p><span>Verdana 8</span></p>
<p><span>Verdana 9</span></p>
<p><span>Verdana10</span></p>
<p><span>Verdana11</span></p>
<p><span><span>Verdana12</span></span></p>
<p><span>Verdana13</span></p>
<p><span>Verdana14</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
&nbsp;I cut this from Word 2007.&nbsp; Note the Verdana 12 is not the right size.&nbsp; There is something odd about how this forum displays the text.&nbsp; (This was written in Times New Roman 12)</span></span></p>

            <p>I am surprised that on September 14 2015 a Microsoft Support Engineer is not aware that Facebook has deliberately broken the API that enables linking Facebook &amp; Microsoft products. This is well documented by Microsoft and others all over the internet.
</p>
<p>It just reinforces my opinion that the big American IT companies (Facebook, Apple, Microsoft &amp; Google) are most interested in firewalling their users at the expense of their users.</p>
<p>I am very impressed with Windows 10 and was really looking forward to finally being able to dump the multiple programs &amp; apps in favour of a single synced system.&nbsp; (Mail works perfectly but People &amp; Calender don't seem to sync with anything.</p>
<p>Now it seems that this is just a pipe dream as it seems that Microsoft has no plans to fix this problem. In fairness it does seem that this time it is not Microsoft's fault, but an attempt by facebook to force users to use their poor website and app.</p>

<p>I had the same concern. I use Office 365 Personal which uses Outlook 2016. One day the Facebook Contacts folder just appeared out of nowhere. I tried adding the contacts with no luck at all. Put a post on the Microsoft forum and was told it only works with
 Office 365 Business. Then why the heck put it on my Outlook if it's useless? I delete it but when I close and reopen Outlook it's back. Junk!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>What program are you using to video conference with? Are you getting any errors? Have you tried enabling your camera through your program setup?
 Have you tried uninstalling your Cam along with your drivers, then reinstalling them again?
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Give that a try first (Uninstall and reinstall your drivers), please post back and let us know what program you’re using for video conferencing

<p><span>Hello DavidMarvic,<br />
<br />
Some features (video call) may not be available in other versions of Messenger.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Check with your partners/friends, what version are they running. I would suggest that you all upgrade to the latest version of Messenger. Here is the link</span></p>

    <title>Surface pro 3&#58; wifi cannot connect to 3-COM router using secure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherif elmetainy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro 3&#58; wifi cannot connect to 3-COM router using secure connection</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - I purchased a Surface Pro 3 (i5, 8GB Ram, 256 GB) from amazon and I received it today. I tried to connect to my home network WiFi and I get a message saying cannot connect to this network. The router is working fine, I have 2 Windows 8.1 desktop PCs,
 2 Windows 8.1 laptops, 1 Windows Phone 8.1, 3 Android phones, 1 PS3 and 1 iPad all connecting to the same router without a problem. I made sure the passphrase is correct of course. The Windows computers were working before on the same router with Windows 8,
 Windows 7 and Windows vista. So I am pretty sure the router is fine, and that it's Windows compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the trouble shooting steps I made:</p>
<p>1- The router is:&nbsp;OfficeConnect ADSL Wireless 11g Firewall Router&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to be 100% sure, I checked it on Microsoft compatibility site and it's listed on the site as compatible:&nbsp;http://bit.ly/1lAJgO3</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- I ran the network troubleshooting wizard in Windows 8.1 and it couldn't find or solve the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- My router supports 802.11b and 802.11g radio types. I ran: "netsh wlan show all" and it shows that the surface hardware support several radio types those supported by my router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - When I try enabling connection sharing on my Windows Phone 8.1 (Lumia 920) and connecting through my phone instead it works fine. But this is not a viable option, as this connection is metered and costs me money to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5- When I tried disabling security in my router (making the connection open for everyone without a password), the surface can connect without a problem. However, this is not a viable option, since I don't want strangers near my house into my network (I am
 using that option now to be able to download updates and apps, but obviously I have to turn security back on again soon).</p>
<p>
</p><p>6- I read in another thread people recommending updating wifi driver from Microsoft, so I downloaded it from this link:&nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=38826</p>
<p>It didn't help</p>
<p>
</p><p>7- I installed all available updates on Windows update. Also didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8- I read in another thread someone saying I should go to the wifi adapter power management properties, and disable powering off device to save energy. It didn't help, and the surface crashed with a BSOD saying:&nbsp;<br />
SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (wificlass.sys)</p>
<p>I googled this error, and a use was saying that he got this error when he disabled that option as I did, and it didn't crash when option is enabled. So I enabled the option back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9- I checked windows event log, and I didn't get any helpful info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 - I tried changing router setting to all other options, WEP 64-bit, WEP 128-bit, WPA, WPA2, and they all resulted&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>11- Every attempt I made I was turning surface WiFi off and on again And flight mode on and off again. It didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12- I ran netsh wlan delete profile MY_HOME_CONNECTION_NAME, and setup wireless connection manually from network and sharing center, and it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would appreciate any help, and I am sorry if the solution is obvious. I did a lot of searching and troubleshooting before posting this question. Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<div>&gt;&gt;Hello and thanks a lot for your reply. I just looked at my router configuration, and it was already in "11g only mode". I tried "11b Only mode", and "both 11b and 11g mode". None of these options seem to help. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;I tried another thing which is setting up a hosted network on a desktop windows 8.1 PC I have that's connected and sharing that PC's internet connection. The surface can connect to my desktop PC hosted network using a password. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;As a temporary workaround, this is better than making my router having no password. However, it has a drawback that the desktop PC must be turned on for the surface to have internet access. </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You MIGHT consider replacing your router. Your Surface Pro 3 can reach speeds</div>
<div>much greater than the old b/g standard. If this router was supplied by your ISP,</div>
<div>maybe they would upgrade it. In any case, it's 9 years old, don't know if newer</div>
<div>firmware is available, and I don't know when or even if MS will do anything to</div>
<div>fix the compatibility issue. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;I also have another problem which is that wireless connection doesn't work when the surface wakes up after a hibernate (I get "limited" under the connection). When I turn off wifi and turn it back on it works. I wonder if there is a solution for this problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;are you actually hibernating or are you coming out of sleep/connected standby?</div>
<div>do you have hyper-v installed? either way, there are several threads with users</div>
<div>afflicted by this. No word on when or if MS will fix. </div>

<h2>            Error code 0x8007064 Cannot install MSE or Silverlight</h2>
                    <p>I've gone through everything I can find to fix this issue. It started with the problem that I could not update Microsoft Security Essentials or Silverlight. It would not let me uninstall them either. I've also read that it's a .Net issue, but I don't even
 have .net on my pc. Or at least, I can't find it there. One of the problems I'm seeing, is that it will not recognize mp_ambits.msi or msse.msi</p>
<p>I have managed to completely remove both program from my computer, by way of deleting files and registry entries. Now I still can't install either, and my pc is not protected!</p>

            <p>Hi Joni,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try rebooting to see if that resolves the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If not, go to
</span><span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/reset-and-fix-broken-windows-vista-file-ext-and-type-associations-include-exe-com-sys-zip-lnk-folder-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/reset-and-fix-broken-windows-vista-file-ext-and-type-associations-include-exe-com-sys-zip-lnk-folder-drive/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 scroll to EXE and click or double-click on it to run the program to restore EXE file associations.&nbsp; Once done, do the same thing for the LNK entry.&nbsp; That should restore your programs and your get your icons functioning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, do a System Restore to just before the problem started.&nbsp;
<span>Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed and uninstall any software you removed between now
 and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<h3> sengmand  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Windows LifeCam HD-3000</h2>
                    <p>I've specifically bought two of the Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 for my Microsoft Windows 10 PCs because on the Microsoft website it states Specifications - System Requirements&nbsp; - Computer;"Requires a PC that meets the requirements for and has installed one
 of these operating systems: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Microsoft Windows 10</strong></span>, Windows® 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7; VGA video calling: Intel Dual-Core 1.6 GHz or higher, 1 GB of RAM; 720p HD recording: Intel Dual-Core 3.0
 GHz or higher, 2 GB of RAM".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is still for sale as of 01/26/2018 on the Microsoft website https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/products/webcams/lifecam-hd-3000/t3h-00012 for £29.99.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On trying to install it it would not work. After hours of failed attempts and fruitless searches for a solution it appears that it is not in fact compatible for Windows 10 and no drivers are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a solution?</p>
<p>

            Option 1 - Download Win 7 Driver and install in compatibility mode 
<br />
<br />Step 1: Download and install the latest drivers in compatibility mode from below link.
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/d/lifecam-hd-3000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/d/life...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: Try to install the driver in compatibility mod and check if it helps.
<br />1. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘Properties'
<br />2. Click on the ‘Compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.
<br />
<br />Option 2 - Uninstall USB Root Hub
<br />
<br />I suggest that you try to uninstall USB Root Hub in the Device Manager. Kindly unplug first the LifeCam before performing the steps provided below:
<br />Press Windows key + R  and then type devmgmt.msc.
<br />Click OK.
<br />Select Universal Serial bus controllers in Device Manager.
<br />Right-click USB Root Hub and select Uninstall.
<br />Restart your computer and it will automatically install back the driver again.

<h2>            2018-03 Updates Failed &#40;31st March 2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, recently I updated Windows 7 x64 Pro on my desktop, and two of the several updates failed. I have tried a few attempts at fixing this issue myself, such as returning to a previous restore point and restarting the updates, running the 'sfc /SCANNOW'
 command to search for integrity violations and a disk check just to be sure. The specific update details are listed below. I also feel as if these updates are broken as I've never had this issue with previous updates and these updates may need a re-release

Well regarding the points stated above, there's no way I can resolve it after the several methods I've tried. It's got nothing to do with my PC, but rather the coding produced within the update assembly itself. Maybe you guys should review these specific updates
 and get them patched as other people are having the same problem. I've never had issues installing Windows updates up until now and it's only those two specific updates mentioned that will not install.&nbsp;

Well after attempting a repair on the Windows Update service and trying to manually install the KB4088875 update, a message box pops up saying "The update is not applicable to your computer". Clearly this is Windows telling me that it is not compatible for
 whatever reason and that the update is obviously broken in a way it's coded incorrectly. I'm not surprised why people are having problems installing this update primarily on Windows 7 based systems. If you want it to work, please review this particular update,
 including the KB4091290 update and re-release them. There's clearly a fault somewhere in the update.

            As mentioned above, the pop-up message I received after installing the stand-alone update via that link said "<span>The update is not applicable to your computer", which means it's incompatible. I really and highly doubt
 it is my anti-malware engine preventing the update from installing, otherwise it would have done this to the other 3 previous updates that came with the ones that are not working; including many other updates I've installed previously. I don't think an anti-malware
 software would stop security updates, or any other update for that matter from the Windows Update service from installing onto the host system. There are plenty of people complaining about this update and the&nbsp;</span><span>KB4091290
 update not working. Please stop accusing my computer of being the root cause after multiple methods of attempts in fixing the problem and get your team to review this issue to check for a bug or other underlying cause. There is obviously something wrong.</span>

<p>killing stunned enemies from flash bangs and concussion grenades are easy. But getting the kills from Nova gas are proving to be ver difficult!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice please????</p>

<p>You dont have to kill them with the gas itself, &nbsp;you can shoot them while they are effected by it.</p>
<p>Its fairly easy in objective modes, just throw the gas at the objective, then start shooting.</p>
<p>Its also nice using hardened .... throw the gas in a room and shoot through the walls.</p>
<p>***************</p>
<p>Actually, what I hated was the flash kills, It would be very decieving. I'd flash the enemy and think I didnt have to react as quickly because the enemy has his weapon pointed at the ground and his arm over his face, but then bullets come flying out of his
 belly and kill me.</p>

<p>Equip Warloard pro so you'll get 2 nova grenades. &nbsp;Try to use them inside where you know people hang out. Like the upper level of "Summit". It is a pain but you'll eventually get it. then you get those great hit markers!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you dont get the kill, you get a lot of xp from assists when your teammate kills them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had some fairly poor matches where I've still gotten plenty of xp by getting 15-20 assists because of nova gas..</p>

<p>Well, this isn't going to rack up kills, but Nova Gas is extremely effective in CTF.</p>
<p>If you see an enemy run for the flag or is about to cap your flag, throw the Nova Gas in the appropriate spot to effectively stop them.</p>

<p>Everything the other posters have said is what I would do. If I could add anything it's be prepared at all times becuz if they are also using Tac Mask you'll find out real quick that they can see you through that gas and can shoot back rather easily.</p>

<h2>            Windows10 wont boot, wont repair. CMD environment shows default C&#58; drive has been changed to X&#58;</h2>
                    <p>The computer will not boot, nor repair. I was getting UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME error on startup. I tried resetting the registry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices" \DosDevices\X: to \DosDevices\C:. I have access to CMD, and I was hoping someone had
 a solution. Perhaps resetting this parameter was not correct. All the files are stored under X: rather than C:, and CMD cannot find the C: when I do a "DIR C:". Thanks,</p>

            <p>When you access the system partition from the recovery environment or setup media's cmd prompt then it's natural to have a different drive letter assigned. That is not the cause of your inability to boot the system, and modifying the registry to point to
 X: instead of C: will only make things worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Confirm with <em>dir</em> that X: is actually your normal C:, then run <em>chkdsk /r x:</em> to check the partition for errors.</p>

<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a><br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting -

http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>The <em><strong>only</strong></em> software conflict that can usually cause *124 bugchecks are OS to BIOS utilities from manufacturer's like Asus' AI Suite. If you have something like this software-wise, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. </strong>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />
