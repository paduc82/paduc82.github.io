                    <p>When I open up any of my office programmes the ribbon at the top of the page and down the side in Outlook has overnight got bigger (zoomed about 300%) and I can't change it back to normal size - does anyone know why this has happened.&nbsp; I just tried to do
 a screen shot of it and when you paste the picture into Paint the Ribbon looks normal size !!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks but I've tried most of what the link suggested and it doesn't seem to work.&nbsp; The main body of my emails / excel / word are all normal size it's just the commands / toolbars which are massive for some reason.&nbsp; It's as if the page has been zoomed about
 500%, apart from the section where I type which is normal size ???</p>

            That's very strange... I don't have any ideas on changing the size but what I would do is repairing office 365 to try and reset the settings to default. Save any work and follow the steps: <br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features <br />Select 365/Office in the list of installed apps <br />At the top click 'Change' <br />Choose Online Repair<br />Hopefully this helps :)

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Pageybee</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are glad to help you on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, the issue happens to the ribbon and toolbar in Outlook, Excel and Word.</p>
<p><span>As you mentioned "</span><span>I just tried to do a screen shot of it and when you paste the picture into Paint the Ribbon looks normal size</span><span>",
 may I know if you have tried restarting your computer and see if there is any changes?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may check the suggestions in these similar threads:</p>

<p>If the issue doesn't happen in safe mode, then it should be caused by Office add-ins. (open the application normally, File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins&gt;Manage COM add-in, uncheck an add-in, reopen the app, see
 if the issue will disappear.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we'd like to confirm the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.In Word(or other Office apps), go to File&gt;Account, then capture a full screenshot of
(note to mask your email address)</span></p>
<p>2.Which device are you using? Desktop computer or tablet?</p>

 me away from doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having one Sign In was supposed to be easy but it isn't.&nbsp; I would like to sign into a page where I can access all others from there like most web sites.&nbsp; My Account, My OneDrive, MS Answers Community, TechNet Community, Mail, Contacts, Bing, Insider, etc.&nbsp;
 - all the places I have logins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now it logs onto my Account but I can't go to say OneDrive from there.&nbsp; I have a separate login to get to OneDrive.&nbsp; Extremely clunky.</p>

<h3> sharkbyte1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change a subform&#39;s SourceObject&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am looking to dynamically change the SourceObject of a subform.&nbsp; The changes are based on whether or not there are selections on 8 combo boxes, resulting in 20 potential variations on criteria.</p>
<p>I have seen reference to using the OpenReport command and passing the criteria as parameters.&nbsp; Is this the only way to do this? (If so could you post some sample code with say 3 parameters, for reference?)</p>
<p>It would almost seem as easy to create 20 subforms and simply make the correct one visible, as I need it.</p>
<p>Thanks, in advance.</p>

<p>If it is easier and quicker for you, you can go ahead and create 20 subforms, and call the correct one according to the user's filtering of the combos.</p>
<p>To use a different subform:<br />
Me.SubformControlName.SourceObjcet = "NameOfSubform"</p>
<p>Note: replace NameOfSubform with the name of one of your 20 subforms.<br />
That one line will put the requested subform inside the subform control on the main form.</p>
<p>The other alternative is to change the recordsource of the subform inside the subform control.<br />
If you want a fairly easy to way to&nbsp;change the query for the subform from the 8 combos, have a look at this search form sample,&nbsp;which has easy to follow code to get the parameters.</p>

    <title>SharePoint Team Site - files automatically being sent to the recycle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harzicn  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Team Site - files automatically being sent to the recycle bin</h2>
                    <p>We have migrated a large number of files to SharePoint Team sites. Users are reporting that the files are mysteriously disappearing. Upon inspection, the files are found to be in the recycle bin and it shows that I deleted them. Can anyone explain what is
 happening here? I did not delete the files and no retention policy has been set up on the site.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;synced the document library in question&nbsp;on three different PCs. I have suggested that other users do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a similar post here <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_manage/onedrive-for-business-folders-and-files-randomly/0a7c4d38-590c-40ca-a7bd-2947d589c71c">
Onedrive for business folders and files randomly "deleted"</a> and I wonder if this is being caused by the syncing process causing the files to be deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is rather worrying because it is taking a long time to restore all of the files each time they are moved to the recycle bin and users risk losing shared documents if this is allowed to happen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the syncing process is causing files to be automatically deleted, are there steps I can take to make sure this does not happen in the future. Has anyone got any insight into what is happening here?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Natalie,<br />
<br />
If we shared some files with other users in SharePoint Team Sites and they sync these files to their local folder, with Edit permission at the library level, they can delete the files from local folders and the browser. Therefore, if they delete files on his
 computer after syncing the library, the files will be removed to the recycle bin in SharePoint Online.
<br />
<br />
To make sure this doesn’t happen in the future, we can remove the <strong>Delete Items</strong> permission at the library level for users. Then, they can only edit the files, but can’t delete them. Please follow the steps below to create a
<strong>Edit without Delete</strong> permission level and then assign it to the users:
<br />
<br />
1. Go to the team site where we would like to share files with other users. <br />
2. Click the Settings icon like a gear &gt; Site settings &gt; Users and Permissions &gt; PERMISSIONS &gt; Permission Levels &gt; Edit.<br />
3. Scroll to the bottom and click Copy Permission Level. <br />
4. Create a name ”Edit without Delete” and un-tick Delete items in the permissions list &gt; Create.
<br />

5. Go to the library where the users would like to sync. <br />
6. Click LIBRARY &gt; Library Settings &gt; Permissions and Management &gt; Permissions for this library &gt; Select the users who have Edit permission &gt; Edit User permissions &gt; Select Edit without Delete permission level created newly and remove Edit permission used before
 &gt; OK. <br />
7. When the users access the files, there is no Delete option as below. When they try to delete files in synced folder on the computer, they will receive an error saying no permissions and can’t delete.

    <title>Are multiple workouts stored without sync&#39;ing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Are multiple workouts stored without sync&#39;ing</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to find out how workouts are stored on my band. I could just try this but thought I'd ask the question first!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go for 3 runs without sync'ing my band to my phone, are all 3 runs kept on the band and uploaded next time I sync or is only the most recent run kept on the band overwriting the previous 2. Since the band has limited storage I guess something must happen
 when all 64MB are exhausted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

    <title>m4a files stutter on N73 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> choke---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            m4a files stutter on N73</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I have a N73 phone, RM-133, recently upgraded to firmware 4.0726.2.0.1. A while ago I decided to convert my music files to M4A (higher quality 64kbps) when transferring them to my phone's memory card.<br />
<br />
Now I have encountered a very annoying problem: whenever I play my music files while using other applications (such as internet browser), the sound stutters and sometimes it even stops playing. I never had this problem when my music files were in MP3 format.<br />
<br />
Has anyone here encountered this problem?<br />
Do you know what I should do to fiz this?<br />
Should I try and convert my music files to AAC or simply leave them as MP3?<br />
<br />
The main reason why I decided to use M4A format was to save space in my memory card, but that is pointless if I cannot use the music player along with another application.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!
                </div>

            depends how many programs are open, plus m4a take up more effort to run due to quality so it could be that or it could be the internet page ur viewing. use mp3, much better + easier

</p><p>Is there a way to color code only those cells in a particular worksheet that are linked from other sheets in that same Excel file?&nbsp; For example looking at a worksheet,&nbsp; cells are shaded with a grey background to indicate they are linked to another sheet.&nbsp;
 if they are not linked to another sheet, then they are not shaded grey.</p>

<p>I don't have Excel 2016, but it has the FORMULATEXT function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a conditional format, using the IFERROR, FIND and FORMULATEXT functions together as the rule. Like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFERROR(FIND("!",FORMULATEXT(A1))&gt;0,FALSE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then set the color you want.</p>
<p>

<p>Jason is on the right track but for my conditional formatting formula I used</p>
<p>=ISNUMBER(FIND("!",FORMULATEXT(A1)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the screenshot two cells (C1 and C3)&nbsp;reference another sheet;</p>
<p>I selected all the cells and used the formula above (note it refers to A1 since this was the first cell in my selection</p>

<h2>            Recover Deleted Items not working</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Outlook Mail for a Hotmail account online, and the Recover Deleted Items feature stopped working about a month ago. The link to Recover Deleted Items&nbsp;is still there, and a pop up window comes up (with the Outlook logo) but then the window is just
 blank. Is this a setting that could be easily changed? I'm using mainly IE, but this also happens on Firefox.</p>

<p>Hi Dee,<br />
<br />
Recover Deleted Items folder allows to recover emails that have been deleted if they are not showing up in Deleted folder. This feature also available on Outlook.com and should be working on your account. For us to isolate the issue and identify what's causing
 the problem, kindly provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to check if this happens with other Outlook account?</li><li>Have you tried checking it using another web browser?</li><li>Can you provide us a screenshot when you click or open the Recover Deleted Items folder?</li></ul>

            Hi Mia,<br />
<br />
Based on my understanding, App passwords will not be blocked. If users cannot sign in with their app passwords, the admin can follow the steps below to let users reset app passwords.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Go to Office 365 portal&gt; Set up multi-factor authentication.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Select the user and click Manage user settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Check Restore Multi-Factor Authentication on all suspended devices and Save.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Let the user sign in and reset their app passwords.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

<h2>            Switching from Gmail to outlook.com - importing Gmail messages</h2>
                    <p>After many years, Google has finally chased me away from Gmail, and I have set up an outlook.com account. I want to import all my Gmail emails, folders and all, into my outlook.com account, and then retire my Gmail account and delete its emails. I cannot
 find a way to do it. I have seen the instructions for connecting my Gmail account to outlook.com, but I don't want to "connect" them; I want to shift the emails over to the outlook account and be done with Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up an IMAP account on my laptop in Outlook 2013 I imported my Gmails into a .pst file that is almost 2 Gb in size, in the belief that Outlook 2013 would share with outlook.com, but Outlook 2013 would only import the inbox folder, and none of the rest.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can export my Gmail folders to .mbox files, but cannot find any way to upload those into outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>I assume that the suggestion in the other one was to do a more comprehensive repair of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)<br />

<p>I did the quick repair and then the online repair. <span>T<span>he online repair stopped before it finished with error code 30015-11(3221356598). There were some instructions for continuing but I was not able to make any progress with that.
 I uninstalled Office and did the&nbsp;<span>online repair again and this time it ran successfully. One thing I didn't understand was that Office 2016 and Office 365 were in the list of programs. Possibly the&nbsp;<span>Office 365 was on there as a
 trial when the computer was purchased but I never used it. This may have caused a problem when trying to do&nbsp;<span>the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">online repair. I&nbsp;<span>uninstalled
 both before running&nbsp;<span>the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">online repair again.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>The problem occurred again this morning.<span> It<span> seems to occur when trying to save a Word document.
</span><span>The first message is Word not responding, </span></span>followed by
We're sorry, but Word has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Word will need to be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?
</span>The option to repair was chosen and the hourglass was displayed for quite a while. Eventually, when Word is opened, the problem document is listed as a recoverable file. The document can be recovered but the most recent changes or additions may not be
 included.</p>

<p>It is always a good idea to get rid of old trial versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, in this case something else is going on, since the problem hasn't been fixed permanently. See if you can avoid the crashing by starting Word in Safe mode (only as part of troubleshooting). See
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If Safe mode works around the issue, continue troubleshooting the Normal template (rename it) as well as COM and Startup add-ins; for more on this, see

            <p>You can use the DISPLAYBARCODE field, which is new in Word 2013, to generate any of 10 types of barcodes in a document. If you're making a mail merge, there's a similar MERGEBARCODE field. These fields are documented at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh745901(v=office.12).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh745901(v=office.12).aspx</a>&nbsp;and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh745903(v=office.12).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh745903(v=office.12).aspx</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, here's a field construction that creates a Code 39 barcode, and below it the barcode that results:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18ab71fa-1f03-43ae-8259-0ed16a81753c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't insert these fields from the Insert &gt; Quick Parts &gt; Field dialog or from the Merge Fields dropdown because they aren't listed. Instead, you must press Ctrl+F9 to insert a pair of empty field braces, and type the field code between them. The barcode
 will appear when you update the field.</p>

<h2>            Probability in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Help me please, there is any formula in excel to answer the probability question below ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A contractor company knows that the probability of rain in its area during certain days of August is 30 percent. He still has two working days and there is still a grace period of 4 days to complete the project the cost of late fines. If he can not work
 because of a rainy day, what is the probability that he will be fined? Assume rain on a particular day does not depend on the occurrence of rain on another day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rgds,</p>
<p>Yari</p>

<h2>            Office 365 University Subscription - change Microsadt account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an Office 365 University subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is linked to an old Microsoft account I have (and so my old hotmail address). How do update this to link it to my new Microsoft account (and so my new outlook email address)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.25pt"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>There seems to be no option to do this in the Office ‘My Account’ page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.25pt"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the Microsoft store page I can edit my email address but is says “This is only the address where your store correspondence will be sent. Changing this does not change your account login information”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t seem to find a way to contact Microsoft about this at all. Requested a call back on a support page and any number I tried didn’t apparently exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 3 years of my subscription left and would like to stop using my old account. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>My iPAQ 4150 used to connect to my Win XP SP2 Laptop just fine with ActiveSync, until it suddenly started connecting as guest and stopped synchronizing with my Outlook - for no apparent reason. I then upgraded ActiveSync
 to 4.5, setup a new connection, and again after disconnecting and reconnecting the device, connection went back to 'guest' only.</p>

<p>I would like you to check the following registry key on your device. If you do not have a registry editor, you'll find one
<a href="http://www.phm.lu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. In the Registry Editor go to Hkey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Activesync\Patners. you should find one or two subkeys that looks like this: {1EFE3FDE-HGFDD67h-h3h3-jghg7j}. If they are are there,
 delete them and soft reset your device and connect again. </p>
Be careful with the registry Editor as you might damage your Device if you don't know what you're doing.

<p>I have the same problem using a iPAQ 4700 running XP.&nbsp; After the update of a couple of weeks ago, I suddenly got a message that my hp usb activesync was not valid, and niether my iPAQ nor my HP camera would work.&nbsp;
 I used Ghost and restored to a previous point a week or so before that update, and it worked fine...twice.&nbsp; Now I always go on as a guest.&nbsp; I have done all you have requested in the previous posts of this forum, and would like to check the registry as you
 listed above except I can't access that site.&nbsp; I do use Registry Mechanic, and none of those keys&nbsp;were there.&nbsp; I do have the option of rebooting to a Ghost backup of 11/07 when all was working fine.&nbsp; Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I have
 tried it all.&nbsp; Thanks, Fredzky</p>

<br />
I had emailed both microsoft and hp tech support. whatever they asked me to try to delete or change on computer, my ipaq will only connect as guest until i actually restore my ipaq to earlier time, then everything works great now.<br />
i will suggest to restore your ipaq to earlier time or just restore to manufactory setting (clean reset).<br />
hope it will help you. it works for me.<br />

<h2>            Office 2007. Is my product key expired&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought a new netbook. I have microsoft office home and student 2007 with a product valid on three computers. Is this now expired now that Office 2010 has been released? The product key does not work for that and I can't find anywhere to download
 Office 2007.

            <p>If it is a retail license, it is perpetual.&nbsp; It does not expire.&nbsp; Certain license types do expire, but I don't think yours does, judging from what you've said.</p>
<p>Never rely on downloads existing forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;After you download an installaiton kit, burn it to a CD or DVD do you'll have it.&nbsp; I also put it on a USB flash drive and also put a copy on my SkyDrive space.</p>

            How can you tell if you've got a 'retail' license - last week, after loading another (non competing) software renewal, I could not open any of my MS files from Home and Student 2007 and had to download a trial copy of 2010. Frequent attempts to reload
 2007 have gone nowhere and I was under the impression that it was indeed perpetual software, since I bought it and the computer at a big box retailer (Staples) here in Canada.<br />

            The software was Quicken. Every time I download the MS S/O 2007&nbsp; software that I paid for, the software loads saying that I have a 'trial version' which I do not. This is the first issue that I've had with it since I installed it several years ago.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Online constantly freezes</h2>
                    <p>I use Microsoft Online daily to complete various research papers. And every single time I use it, it will freeze randomly while I'm typing in approximately five minute intervals. It takes around a minute to become responsive again. When it does this, all
 other pages on the browser (and the rest of the computer) work as normal. It is the worst on Word online. Is there any explanation for this? Does it happen to other people? Is there some kind of solution?</p>
<p>I have used Microsoft Online on all varieties of wifi and computer quality and it consistently does this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the freezing issue, it could be related to the browser. I would suggest you reset the browser settings and clear the browser cache to see the outcome. Also, you can try another browser
 to see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still exists, I’d like to confirm the following information for further investigation.</span></p>

<li><span>Which browser are you using?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue occur when you create new documents or edit the existing ones?</span></li></ol>

            I was having the same issue.&nbsp; I have a Sony Vaio, as I'm sure you do as well.&nbsp; The installation pop-up is Vaio Update trying to install its latest incarnation.&nbsp; Why it doesn't identify itself as such is beyond me.&nbsp; If go to your start menu and open Vaio
 Update, you will receive a message saying your current version is out of date and you must install the newest version.&nbsp; After you agree to install it, the same "Select Country" window appears. Click "Next" - it's all good.<br />

<p>Excellent. Not often having serviced Sony VAIOs I had no clue about that and I'm glad that worked out for you. Jeepers, you'd think they'd identify it better. It sure looked, sounded, and acted like malware to me. I'll have to remember that one.</p>

<p>As far as Malwarebytes, as long as you downloaded the free version I recommended it can remain on your system as a backup. While you probably are more of an average user than I am, I'll tell you how I protect my system. Now keep in mind that MSE (and Malwarebytes
 if you want) are perfectly adequate as long as you practice safe surfing and maintenance habits. I'll go over the programs I use and then tell you about the habits you need to learn until they become like instinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take more security precautions than most because helping people often means I need to test software before recommending it, go to questionable websites where people are having problems to see if I can determine the cause, need to download sometimes dubious
 software because someone has a question about it and I can't help unless I have it in front of me, and so forth. Because of this I take more precautions than the average user who doesn't do (or shouldn''t do) these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's what I do (and it isn't 100% but nothing is, and in some cases only catches things after they've already gotten into the system, but it's a good process while remaining reasonable and they can all work together - as proven by the fact that I
 use them):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use MSE for real-time protection and run 2-3 quick scans a week with a scheduled bi-weekly full scan. Our moderator runs a weekly quick scan and doesn't run full scans unless he suspects he might be infected or the quick scan picks up something and
 he wants to do a more thorough scan to be on the safe side - and that's all he does in terms of using programs for scanning. He has great faith in MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I update and periodically (every couple of weeks or so) run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>and SuperAntiSpyware:
</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and ESET online scanner:</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>
 Get only the free versions. Any that also have paid versions include features like real-time protection that cannot be used along with MSE anyway (in these cases), so there's no point in spending the money anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use Secunia PSI </span><a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/</span></a><span> to make sure all my programs are updated and current (since updates often
 plug security holes in the software and thus can be important as many people never check and/or update their software unless prompted - and this way I don't need to check everything since notifications and sometimes updates are automatic).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I always follow the following advice from Stephen Boots - MVP (and whether or not you add any of the above programs, the following applies to everybody and should be thought of as the "14 Commandments of keeping your computer secure"):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled. </span></strong><span>No other firewall truly offers better protection or is needed. This one is perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON and not running with elevated privileges.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-<u>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</u></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Practice safe web browsing.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I add a 15th. Do your normal work as a standard user. Use an administrator account only if you need to do something that requires those priviledges (since anyone who hacks into your system or malware that enters your system will have administrator
 access if you're logged in as an administrator and be able to get in deeper and do more harm than if you're a standard user). And have one or two backup Administrator accounts (all with good, strong passwords that you won't ever forget) in case problems happen
 with one of them because if it's the only one on the system and you can't use administrator rights with it or even access it for whatever reason (and it happens), then you're stuck with a restore to factory conditions as there's no other way to regain control
 of the computer. Always keep on UAC. Well, maybe that's more than one more, but that about covers it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
