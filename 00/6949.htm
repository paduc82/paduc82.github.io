    <title>Troubles with OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Troubles with OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>So i got my account suspended. It happened for the second time already and all I was doing just giving my family shared access to the albums! The message i'm receiving is as follows</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Your account is currently unavailable</p>
<div>
<div>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
Your OneDrive or Profile might be temporarily blocked because it has been experiencing an unusually large volume of traffic. In this case, the block will be removed after 24 hours.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">

 if&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=106278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">customer support</a>&nbsp;finds content which is in violation, then you'll need to remove all violating content within
 48 hours or your account will be shut down.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking the link to contact support takes me to the Report Abuse page, not actual contact support so I can't address my issue directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time it happened I contacted the support and they told me to reset my password - didn't help. I then asked for help once again - the support recommended me to contact OneDrive support team via pressing the question mark in my OneDrive page - but
 there is no direct "Contact support" button, only email the support team, but I still have no answer. The site also asked me to confirm it's me via phone message - i did it like five times and still, no effect. I then waited for 24 hours and, hooray, i can
 use my OneDrive again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my happiness didn't last long, as i got the same issue after sharing some more of my albums! and I guess i have to wait for another 24 hours! It's an outrage! Why can't I normally use my OneDrive? Why do you keep suspending me for "<span>unusually
 large volume of traffic" when I wasn't even uploading anything! I guess your autoblocking system is broken and needs some serious fixing, for your services are just impossible to use!</span></p>

            Hey there, valiksheva
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />When this happens, the best thing to do would be to contact OneDrive Support via the help icon or email them. I know this can be frustrating, however we can't look into your account as we are community members who volunteer our time and energy helping others. 
<br />
<br />I would strongly suggest posting at the UserVoice page here: <a href="https://onedrve.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrve.uservoice.com</a> as this is a place to make suggestions for OneDrive and OneDrive services. 
<br />
<br />How many views are you getting on your Albums?
<br />
<br />Regards,

<h2>            microsoft exchange tasks syncing with categories</h2>
                    I am working with a small business owner, he has the new nokia illumina 822. He is unable to properly sync his tasks with the handset. He has all of his tasks listed under categories, however the categories do not show up under "To-Do's" in the native
 calendar app the tasks just populate one after another in a list fashion. We have tried to sync his Exchange Server with third party apps but none of them will accept his Exchange Server information. What can we do to sync the categories with the tasks?

            Windows Phone does not include a category field, so there is no place for that data to sync to on the phone.&nbsp; There is nothing you can do to make categories be part of the native tasks of windows phone 8.<br />

<h2>            How to record a Skype call with audio and video&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is a lot of question on what to use to record skype meetings, but I have a specific situation here I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am going to have a type of online course using Skype as the main app to communicate with the other party. Basically we are going to be interacting with each other. I am guessing he would be watching my screen to give me instruction on what to do and perhaps
 i might see his screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which is the best app for Skype to record the session with quality video and audio ( so i can go back and look at it for reference )? Here I am asking for recording what we share with each other ( our desktop screen) and audio ( voice)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Most likely we will be using a microphone to talk to each other, but the course is about music, so we will be using a software to create it, how can i do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a) I will be listening what i create on my speakers obviously, i want him to listen to that audio not trough my microphone ( bad quality) rather listen as he was in my room</p>
<p>b) be able to record everything we might be talking ok do this and that ok here goes &nbsp;listen he lsitens to the good audio and he comments something while listening i want the recording to be as the live ( hopefully I explained myself)</p>
<p>c) basically here is the question &nbsp;HOW can I do that and is there and APP that can do that for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outcome should be after i finish the conference i should be able to go back to the recording and listen to everything we said, see everything we did regardless of my screen or his and the audio of the music being played should be good quality as oppose
 to our voices which come from a microphone ( which could be a bad one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p />

    <title>Callto&#58; Protocol not working in any way, shape or form with the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leo agafon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Callto&#58; Protocol not working in any way, shape or form with the newest Skype versions.</h2>
                    The title says it all.<br />
<br />
<strong>Problem:</strong><br />
<br />
I have to make several business calls with skype every day - and I simply can't manually copy-paste every damn number for every call that I have to make.<br />
<br />
It makes me waste so much time you can't even imagine, I swear that I will be switching to another program asap if this doesn't get fixed soon because I can't afford to waste so much time manually copy-pasting numbers before calling them.<br />
<br />
<strong>What I've been doing to fix the problem:</strong><br />
<br />
I've been using skype classic up until now but now for some weird reason the developers are forcefully pushing me to update to the newest version, wich simply doesn't support the Callto: protocol in windows.<br />
<br />
<strong>What I've tried now:</strong><br />
<br />
I've tried using the Windows Store version but of course not even that version supports it.<br />
<br />
Also tried using skype portable but that doesn't handle protocols.<br />
<br />
Also tried installing every possibile old version of skype but that does not work either because as soon as I log in into my account it forces me to either update to the latest version or quit the .exe<br />
<br />
Since I'm a paying customer and I pay to use this program every month I would expect someone to give a damn but apparently no, and it's also not just me. This and other forums are full of similar threads regarding the callto: protocol and still no response
 from the developers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusions:</strong><br />
<br />
So I need to ask, should I change to another software or is there an available&nbsp;fix for this?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />

<p><br />
If the former, can you tell us some more about the workbook concerned...?<br />
<br />
Does the same happen if you open the same workbook on a different computer?<br />
- What differences are there between the computer it fails on and ones it works on?<br />
<br />
Does the active sheet have a zoom factor (View &gt; 100%)?<br />
What does the worksheet contain that might be unusual?</p>

<p>Hi RuggeroSchleicher-Tappeser. Support for team site document libraries&nbsp;is listed on the Office 365 roadmap under the "in development" categoery:
<a href="http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/roadmap#I-42804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/roadmap#I-42804</a></p>
<p>With team site document library support one would assume that group support would come at the same or similar time as the underlying technology for group files and team site libraries is similar.</p>
<p>No timeframe is given on the roadmap.</p>
<p>The uservoice site also lists team site support is in progress: <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/suggestions/10026033-new-sync-client-must-support-team-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Please help me about .csv file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kivorkong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please help me about .csv file</h2>
                    Hello all the expert,<br />
<br />
I have a simple question, simple for you but it trouble me for whole day to get a solution. Let me explain this:<br />
<br />
I have a .csv file and I open it with Excel 2013. It looks something like this:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d23ec1a-cc09-4913-8fa6-7ddbbfe9d0cb" /><br />
<br />
I do not want to see the <strong>1.00002E+14</strong> or <strong>1.00001E+14</strong> as I know it is a number. What I did was I right click it at the column A and choose "Format Cells", under the "Numbers" tab I choose "Special". It then change everything
 to number. Example: <strong>1.00001E+14</strong> become <strong>100001957209850</strong><br />
<br />
After that I press CTRL+S to save it.<br />
<br />
I proceed to click the X button to close the Excel file and now it ask me a question "Want to save your changes to blablabla.csv?", I click "Yes".<br />
<br />
Now here is the problem:<br />
I reopen that file again and all the data become like this, thy are in a single row, without column:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e80438cf-6c8f-416a-938a-4f5fa952ba1f" /><br />
- My question is simple, how can I set the "Right Click&gt;Format Cells&gt;Numbers&gt;Specific" to default? So that whenever I got a new .csv file the number doesn't look like an alien, or
<strong>1.00002E+14</strong> and I do not have to manually change the Format Cells to "Specific".<br />
- If the first one cannot be done, then how can I save a .csv file? (after changing the format cell to "specific" and all the data remain at the same row same column?<br />
<br />
Please help and thanks in advance!!!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Kivor

<p>
</p><p>Excel interpret the values and gives it the best fitting format. It does not mean that the values in the cell have changed. Try it with changing the format to number, no decimals.</p>

<p>I also got that message after the last update, but only once. It disappeared after restarting the phone. This is just a bug, nobody is controlling your phone. You cannot install MSE Essentials or any other AVP on the phone anyway, and you don't need to.
 Just ignore it, if it's too annoying try a hard reset, it might rid of it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you insist on starting new threads each time you decide to ask something, instead of continuing in your original one, I no longer remember which handset you have. If it is supported for the creators update then wait for it and see if resolves the problem.</p>

    <title>Outlook default view of Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markifrank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook default view of Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I like to view Calendar in "Month" view, so can see several weeks at a time in traditional Sun to Sat across the top.&nbsp; It defaults to showing the first week of the current month at the top, so I must scroll down to make the current week the top row and the
 next few weeks visible.&nbsp; At this time of the month, if I don't do that, then I&nbsp;am looking at the past 4 weeks, when I care more about the next 4 weeks even though they are in June.&nbsp; So I can scroll down fine, but when I go to Mail or People, then return to
 Calendar - it reverts to default of first week of month along top again.&nbsp; Is there way to keep current week at the top?</p>

            No. The Calendar view has hardly changed since first being introduced many years ago. The reason is that because you can only show a few overlapping tasks, it has very limited use. So I'm afraid it is unlikely to change any time soon.

            I'm guessing your question is more about Outlook than Project? &nbsp;To the best of my knowledge, the month view in Outlook always shows from the beginning of the calendar month to the end and I don't believe you can change that option.

            <p>How about using VBA within Outlook?</p>
<p>I am familiar with VBA within Excel, which would use a command like "ActiveWindow.SmallScroll Down:=6"</p>
<p>I could then create a formula that figures how many scrolls to make based on weeks that have past in the current month and have it auto-run on choosing the Calendar tab of Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Cannot clear cookies from browser, internet options</h2>
                    <p>Hello, running xp pro, 32bit, ie8, svc pk 3.</p>
<p>I have deleted everything from browsing history, repeatedly. Then I take the following steps:</p>
<p>1. close exporer</p>
<p>2. open explorer</p>
<p>3. check int. options for settings under browsing</p>
<p>4. view files THE COOKIES ARE BACK!!!!</p>
<p>I have run fixit 50195 to reset internet settings, cleared all cookies from Doc and set/administrator/local setting/temp files, and lo and behold they are there again even though I deleted them repeatedly also!</p>
<p>I have run full scans with MSE and MAMB no infections, (I update daily and run quick scans daily, full scans every couple of days.)</p>
<p>I have read most questions that I was directed to before posting this query, but none of the fixes have worked or they do not pertain to my problems. The original issue was that yahoo was not remembering my password. Research said I had a corrupted cookie.
 Since that time, 3days, I have been trying to clear cookies. I have also run cccleaner, even after cleaning two cookies are still there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>I suggest you turn off AutoComplete completely, by following these steps:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In an Internet Explorer browser window, click on Tools<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click on Internet Options<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. On the Internet Options configuration console, click the Content tab.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. In the AutoComplete section, click on the Settings button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; e. You can select or de-select different types of information to store in AutoComplete:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Web addresses stores URL's that you type and automatically tries to complete them the next time so you don't have to type the whole thing each time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Forms stores data such as your address and phone number to try to help populate form fields so you don't have to re-type the same information every time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * User names and passwords on forms stores the usernames and passwords for sites you visit and automatically enters them when you visit the site again. There is a sub-option to check so that Internet Explorer will prompt you each time rather than
 automatically saving passwords. You can use this if you want to use the feature, but not save passwords for more sensitive sites such as your bank account.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; f. You can turn off AutoComplete entirely by de-selecting each box <br />
<br />
Note: Even if you turn off AutoComplete, or just the option to save user names and passwords in AutoComplete, the passwords that have already been stored will remain.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Go to the General tab and click the Delete button in the Browser History section to get rid of stored passwords.<br />
<br />

            yes, by default WM6 standard does not have a builtin Search tool. Fortunately, there ar third party applications. Total Commander is a good one and free. Download from http://www.ghisler.com/download.htm

<h2>            Infopath 2007 Keeping previous text fields after submitting data</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have which might be a silly question, but I just can't get it right. I created my infopath form that has been designed to fill questionaires, it has general details and specific details and works as expected. However, after submitting data into an MSAccess
 Database, I would like to keep some of the general fields of my form such as address, zip code (meaning, text and numbers) from the previous submit until I click on the new record to delete all info.</p>
<p>My question is how do I keep these previous general details after submitting all this data?</p>

<p>In the submit options dialog box, there is an advanced button; click it, and you will see a dropdown box with three different options for what happens after you submit the form.&nbsp; You can have it close the form, leave the form open (with all the fields still
 populated), or open a new form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if that will help you, or if you need something more specific?</p>

    <title>Phone locks after 5 mins of playing AVI videos, but not while playing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Phone locks after 5 mins of playing AVI videos, but not while playing WMV videos</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my WM6 smartphone set to lock itself after 5 mins. When I play a WMV file in Windows Media, I can watch the video forever and the phone won't lock itelf. But if I'm playing and AVI file, the phone does follow the 5 minute rule and interupts my video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way so that the phone won't lock while playing a non-WMV video without me having to manually change the device lock feature off?</p>

<h2>            Lost color coding on Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    <p>My color coding on my Outlook 2016 calendar disappeared today. &nbsp;The categories are still there but most of them are pink instead of various colors. &nbsp;I had to reenter the colors so I got them back but I'm also noticing other changes - font in Sticky Notes
 changed, etc. Have there been update changes that altered this?</p>
