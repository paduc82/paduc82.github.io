<h2>            How do i delete all my fonts and resotere it all to windows default&#63;</h2>
                    I can restore it using the backup but i can't do that cause it will effect the programs installed on my PC, I installed some kind of a foriegn fonts and it replaced with a system font and the system fonts isn't now available and it's causing some problems
 in writing in that language without that corrupted font, I can't even find it on the c:/windows/fonts area, and i don't know how to delete it, and it's now like a Trojan cause i can't even find it and replace it with the real one, here is what really happen&gt;
 (It's called (name: mvbolinew title: MV Boli&gt; fake font that replaced this font&gt; name: MV Boli title: MV Boli&gt;system default font) so is there a program or something that can only restore all my fonts.<br />
<br />
Now i got a better idea how about a font uninstaller that can find that hidden font and delete it even if it's a system font. Or is there any way that i could see that hidden font and delete it so i can install the windows default MV Boli font. q: can't you
 install MV Boli font and replace it with the mvbolinew title: MV Boli? a: I have done that but it doesn't work it's corrupted in someway and can't replace like that.<br />

<h2>            Xbox enforcement</h2>
                    Microsoft is one god awful company. They’re a hold your hand, baby proof the entire world company now. I was playing rainbow six siege and my teamate killed me on purpose. Then after they killed me in game he proceeded to harass me and send me hate mail.
 I did not even kill him back or message him first. He messaged me. I know for a FACT xbox would have done nothing to help if i reported him calling me trash. Its not good enough for them to make a ban off of that. Overall microsoft is teaching people to be
 the biggest wimpiest people ever. Teaching people to not stick up for themselves as if there will always be someone around to take care of everything for you. After sending a couple messages this player says ok whitey to me. I say okay darky back. This is
 why i am suspended?? Bc a player harrassed and bullied me over xbox and was also being racist. This person should be banned for good. This so called “enforcment team” of wimps without brains wouldnt Even consider my review when
                </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;BryanEd&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you can do is block and report. Let Xbox Enforcement handle it from there. The minute you message anything back you both can get a ban at that point. Also bans can happen weeks after the fact so this may be from something else entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can dispute the ban through the Enforcement site. Nothing can happen over the forums&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should have blocked the person sending those messages after you reported him (if you did, you should have).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Responding with things that break the code of conduct is not wise and is most likely the reason you got suspended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person who said those things to you will get suspended if enforcement sees the report and sees if he broke the code of conduct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to contact anyone that can alter suspensions (or to appeal it or ask about it) is to contact enforcement through a case review:
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6</a> Xbox support and phone support can not alter suspensions. Only enforcement can - and ONLY through a case review. To do a case review your suspension must be active, have been applied within the last year
 and be longer than 24 hours. You may have to do a quiz on the code of conduct before you can do a case review, and if you fail you will have to wait 24 hours to try again.</p>

<p>Since you were being harassed, your report would be reviewed and the user would be dealt with appropriately. After you report them, as choppyseize said, you would block and ignore them. If you decide to "stick up for yourself", keep in mind that whatever
 you do is held to the same standard (the Xbox Live Code of Conduct) as that which was being sent to you. This is why the best Internet advice is the simplest - don't feed the trolls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're free to review the suspension at <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the Enforcement site</a> and, if you're eligible to do so, file a case review.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 1)">An
 important thing to remember is that Xbox Live players are really the police, while the moderators and enforcement team are the judge, jury, and executioners. Other people read your profile, play games with you, etc. and when you do bad things they will report
 you. So if you don't do bad things, you won't ever get in trouble.</span></p>

            Its just aggravating that this player did all this. I know im a bit too heated over this it really isnt that big of a deal. Just stinks especially because the semester just ended. I know for a fact it was this player i dont do bad things unless they are
 deemed worthy. Yet again though all of you are telling me to do exactly what I am complaining about 😂😂. Sit there and do nothing lol. Next time ill just kill the whole team and leave the game. That cant get me banned might ruin the rep a bit but its worth
 it instead of being suspended from communications. They reviewed my case and did nothing about it. Thats why I’m here to complain. Lol sorry people. They wouldnt even shorten it from a week after explaining circumstances. Xbox players arent the police. Theyre
 the criminals. I dont think theres a decent gaming community left anywhere

            If you report the offending player, you're not "doing nothing". You're reporting bad behavior, which will be reviewed against the Xbox Live Code of Conduct, just as your conduct was. Again, if you respond to the troll, you're giving them EXACTLY what they
 want. Don't feed the trolls.

            Sorry that you had a poor experience like this. Hope your faith in the gaming community is restored when your enforcement action is lifted. I’ve made so many great friends in the Xbox community, though it does depends on the game (some are breeding grounds
 for toxic behavior).

<h2>            Dell Inspiron Laptop touchscreen issues</h2>
                    Okay, so I have a Dell Inspiron p25t laptop, running windows 10 64 bit. Usually, my laptop's touchcreen works, but randomly, the touchscreen will stop functioning without notice. The only way i can tell this without using the touchscreen is by the fact
 that my taskbar icons move closer together. In Device Manager, the HID touchscreen device is hidden, and has a Code 45. What confuses me the most is that whenever i restart my laptop, the touchscreen works fine. What should I do?

            Did you run Windows Update then check for the latest updates?
<br />
<br />You can also right click the hidden HID touchscreen device in Device manager
<br />Click uninstall
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart then let Windows 10 redetect it
<br />
<br />You can also click scan for hardware changes in Device Manager, right click the HID touchscreen device then click Update driver.
<br />

<p>i assume that your gold has already ran out? </p>
<p>
</p><p>you can go to your subscriptions page on the Xbox website and turn of reoccurring subscription. it will not charge you again and when your gold runs out if it hasn't already you wont get billed but wont have gold you then can go and pay it monthly instead
 if you would prefer.</p>

<p>The thing is when your account is suspended for payment option you are already in 21days past due</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also should be noted that you do grt three warnings before the suspension is issued via your email</p>
<p>If you dont use a valid contact email you should really update it</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are within thr 30 day period for 3monrhs however you should keep it at 3months or upgradr to a year</p>
<p>One yearly and 3month subscriptions are cheaprr then month to month</p>
<p>Yearly works out to 5bucks a month but 3month is 25.99 depending on whrre you are vs 9.99 or highrr for month to month</p>
<p>I personally buy prepaid codes upto 3 years and stack my.membrrship</p>
<p>It should be notrd that sometimrs when you add a year you actually get a bonus month I got 2 extra months for adding 2 years to my subzcriptions</p>
<p>This doesnt go all the time being ut it should be looked at by you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not sure if the promotion is still going on but 5bucks a month one time payment at max 59.99 or whereever you are you can often find or get dashboard deals or prepaid codes for lesz&nbsp;</p>

            Normally outstanding balances must always be paid before anything regarding the billing account or subscription can be done. If you go and call/find a link to the customer support for billing and stuff you may be able to find some a work-around. However,
 you'd probably have to pay what you owe first if I am interpreting this right.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to screen capture or record a video&#47;desktop on Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, this is really a complex question, yes it is. There is a program or an application(with an extension .exe) which is password protected and when I enter the password , it gets redirected to a media player where it plays a video closing all the other
 open applications(even if the window is closed and they are open in right corner of task bar) like Google Chrome, Screen Recorders,Windows Explorer etc . I've tried a lot of applications like ZD Screen Recorder, Camtasia , Camstudio, Bandicam etc. to record
 the videos/capture the screen. But however, the program or application(I am here referring to the application/program which redirects to the video/plays a media file after entering a password) when started closes all the background applications except applications
 like <strong>Bit-torrent</strong>,<strong>utorrent</strong> and <strong>Skype</strong>. I've tried looking for solutions on several video sharing sites and none of them worked. I don't want that software/application to close the other applications after running.
 I don't know the way it got permissions for all that. I need some software which will record the screen in background. I am in the process of making a tutorial and the video in that application/program file is an important part of it.</p>
<p>I am running a Windows 8 PC(X64) with Dual Core- 2GB RAM and 500 GB HDD</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, you would like to have the details of the screen recorder applications that can be used in Windows 8 to record&nbsp;videos of the activities performed on the computer for teaching purpose. I can definitely help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8, we have an inbuilt application named as “Steps Recorder” which can automatically capture the steps you take on the computer. It also creates a text description of where you clicked and the screen shot during each click. This application was
 also available in the Windows 7. You can have more information from this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/How-do-I-use-Problem-Steps-Recorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/How-do-I-use-Problem-Steps-Recorder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: This is also applicable to Windows 8</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8, to launch this application, you just need to type “Step” from the Start Screen and you will be able to find the “Steps Recorder” on the left pane of the window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: You will not be able to create short videos of the screen recording using this application.<span>&nbsp;
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are looking for an application which can record the screen activity on the computer and create short videos, then you can search for such an app in the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to search for an app from the Windows Store, follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open the “Store” app from the Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “C” keys on the keyboard to show the charms bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “Search” from the charms bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “Screen recorder” in the search bar and search for a suitable app.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>You will be able to find the search result on the right pane of the window and you can select a suitable app as according to your needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.&nbsp;Please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>
<p>Isha Soni</p>

It would be cool if you could mention what recording software&nbsp;have you tried. I use
<a href="http://mirillis.com/screen-recorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mirillis Action screen recorder</a> - maybe it will work for you?<br />
Have you tried to&nbsp;reinstall the software that causes closing other applications?&nbsp;<br />

            Fred,<br />
<br />
I think you are panicking unnecessarily.&nbsp; Let me explain how WU works under Win10.&nbsp; Basically, they are done for you automatically.&nbsp; And any that, actually, require a Restart, that will, also, be done for you by the OS @ a time that it thinks there is little
 activity.&nbsp; <strong>You can change that such that it notifies you when a Restart is needed &amp; you do when you want or choose.*</strong><br />
<br />
Also, to know or see what Updates have gone in one can look @ Update History.<br />
<br />
Now here are some helpful instructions for you:<br />
<br />
&gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security<br />
<br />
1. You will see it says, "Available Updates will be download &amp; installed automatically"<br />
2. Under that asks if you would like more info about the latest updates.&nbsp; Click under that on
<strong>Learn More. </strong>That will give&nbsp;a full breakdown of all updates you have received.<br />
3. Next, under #2 is Advanced options.&nbsp; Hit that &amp; you will see the choice Auto or Notify

<br />
Now, if you, still, do indeed have a problem w/ WU, it is a free call to Microsoft.&nbsp; Help Desk will address WU problems &amp; assist for free as it is considered a security risk issue if they are not behaving properly. The # is 1-866-425-8809<br />
<br />
NB: BTW, if one hits the Check for updates button &amp; it produces nothing (don't panic) means there really are none available
<em>at that moment &amp; </em>as I said, when there are, the OS will do them.<br />
<br />
I trust this will help you (relax)&nbsp;&amp; not have you considering going backwards to 8.1.&nbsp; One is far better off w/ 10 than 8.1.&nbsp; Point is with Win10 you don't have to be worrying over updates.&nbsp; Win10 takes the onus off your shoulders. (smile)<br />

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />When you use BitLocker it encrypts the whichever drive you choose. The drive cannot be unencrypted unless the correct key is provided. If someone were to liveboot from linux the windows drive would be unreadable by the linux system.  This means the liinux system could not make any changes or even view what is on the system. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

    <title>My game score has disappeared. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> requestedmite8  say:</h3>
<h2>            My game score has disappeared.</h2>
                    
<p>Since my new computer has daily challengers on it my score on Mahjong was two thirds of the way towards a gold medal. There was almost 6000 coins in the kitty and now they have just gone. This has taken away my enthusiasm for trying again. Can someone tell
 me what happened and why? Is it possible to get the score back? Thought it was a great innovation but now my disappointment has taken that thought away. It took me hours to accumulate this total.</p>
<p>Does it happen often to others? Can the problem be fixed?</p>

Thank you for this info. I did the scan as you suggested but Windows did not find any integrity violations. Therefore, I still have duplicate games in my start menu. Any other suggestions?

            <p>I am having the same problem with duplicate entries in my games folder. There is no option to just delete one of the icons when right-clicking. If you right click over one of the icons it gives you the option to uninstall, but I do not want to uninstall
 the game - I just want to get rid of the duplicate icons. Also, when you open the games folder, there is only one instance of each game listed in that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance with this would be appreciated.</p>

Yeah, exactly. That's how it is for me too. It's just showing up in the Start UI. Kinda frustrating that there is duplicates, but in the games folder &amp; control panel, it's only installed once. Any idea of a fix?

            <p>I've seen this problem and know exactly why it happens.&nbsp; I performed a clean reinstall of Windows 7... then set it up and did the upgrade to Windows 10 and noticed the duplicated entries for games I had just installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason it does that is... there is a BUG in Windows 10 that causes duplicate entries... First, it will create a games entry for the installed game.&nbsp; Then NEXT, it will create entries for anything that it finds inside the Games Explorer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for example, if you installed 10 games and then dragged the shortcuts for FIVE of those games into Games Explorer&nbsp; (when you were still running Windows 7)...&nbsp; then after the upgrade to Windows 10...&nbsp; those FIVE GAMES will have the duplicate entries.&nbsp;
 I have all of my games showing in Windows 7 Games Explorer ... on my main computer...&nbsp; and I have NOT done the upgrade to Windows 10 yet.&nbsp; I think before I do, I will delete (or rather remove) all the game shortcuts inside Games Explorer so I don't have the

<p>To fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move the shortcut from the C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\&lt;application&gt; folder to the desktop, causing one of the icons to disappear from the All Apps menu.

<h2>            How to move the box to the right when I do right click</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
After a few window update installations, now when I right click my mouse at my window 7 home premium desktop, the box appears to the left of the mouse arrow. Before it always appears to the right. I uninstalled all the earlier installations but it didn't solve
 this problem.<br />
I found it very uncomfortable since I'm not used to it.<br />
<br />
How can I move the box to the right when I right click my mouse on my desktop again?<br />
Many thanks.<br />
<br />
p.s: the box what I mean is the box which contains: View, Sort by, Refresh,...<br />

            Its called the right click contextual menu :)<br />
<br />
Have you checked to make sure your desktop resolution has changed? Its possible that if the screen is smaller in size, it instruct the menu to appear to the left. The question, I would like to ask, in what way is it obstructing you from accomplishing the tasks?
 Is it going off screen? <br />
<br />
Try adjusting the screen resolution to see if it makes any difference:<br />

<h2>            Printer keeps printing 2 pages to a page</h2>
                    <p>My printer (an HP LaserJet 1020) has suddenly started printing all pages as 2 pages to a page.&nbsp; I have checked the settings on the indivdiudal document and in the printer settings, and they clearly state 1 page per page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I do a print preview, it all looks as it should (i.e. one page to a page), but then it prints out differently - 2 pages on a page.&nbsp; I haven't changed anything, although I did allow some recent Windows updates.&nbsp; The printer test page comes out ok.&nbsp; Anyone
 with thoughts on what's going on, could you please let me know as it's driving me nuts?</p>

            <p>Hi Raaghu.m89,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question. I understand that you are unable to play NFS Most Wanted 1.3 and receiving error message “speed.exe has stopped working”. In
 order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How did you install Need For Speed Most Wanted on the computer?
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you download and install it from Internet or you installed it using the game CD/DVD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if you are able to play the game. You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a
 minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p><b>(Step 1: Perform a clean boot)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    Hello, I have a weird issue with google chrome and It's over a year now with no solve.<br />
my google chrome browser keeps freezing after a short time opening. maybe from one to three minutes and It freezes (Not responding), the weird thing I have noticed that, this happens only when Wi-Fi is on! means, when I activate flight mode and open chrome
 it acts well with no issues, if connected to internet via Wi-Fi it lasts a couple minutes before freezing. the second weird thing, this happens with chrome ONLY, Firefox is well, Edge is well. it's over a year now and I tried all expected solution, Reinstall,
 Update, Clear.. ETC. and still not solved. so I hope to find a solution.

<p>Thank you for uploading CBS log together with other diagnostic data. It has proven to be quite helpful.</p>
<p>Let us keep SFC aside for now and fix the BSOD first.</p>
<p>Dump 1 blames a Kaspersky component related to Network.</p>
<p>Dump 2 blames Networx software for the crash.</p>
<p>If Networx is somewhat related to Internet/Network, I would first uninstall Networx and subsequently Kaspersky too and observe.</p>

<p>2nd Thing-Never use 2(3? including Defender) at a time. This is a common cause of BSODs.</p>

<h2>            USB Wireless Mouse Scroll Jumping</h2>
                    Recently, on Windows 10, when attempting to scroll the page will sometimes jump up, then down when I am scrolling. I am using a new Gear Head Wireless USB mouse, which in the past as worked perfectly well. I have tried solutions previously listed on the
 web (cleaning the sensor, turning down the amount of lines that will be scrolled), and so far, nothing has worked. Any advice?

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Does the issue occur in a particular application?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
What is the exact model of the mouse?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:
<strong>Hardware and device troubleshooter</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press
<strong><span>Windows key + C</span></strong> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Type
<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong> and click
<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong> under
<strong><span>Settings</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Now type
<strong><span>Hardware Troubleshooter</span></strong> in the
<strong><span>search</span></strong> option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d) Click on
<strong><span>Hardware troubleshooter</span></strong> to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>:
<strong>Uninstall and Reinstall</strong> the mouse driver</span></span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Uninstall and reinstall the&nbsp;mouse drivers from the manufacture's website and check, if it works.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Refer to the following steps to uninstall the mouse drivers from the Device Manager.<br />
&nbsp;a. Click on <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and then, select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.
<br />
b. Locate and expand <strong>“Mice and other pointing devices”</strong> in the <strong>
Device Manager Window</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
c. <strong>Right-click on the mouse drivers</strong> and click on <strong>“uninstall”</strong> the mouse driver.<br />
d. <strong>Restart</strong> the computer and check, if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>clean boot</strong> and check. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Warning:
</span></strong><span>After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to
 Normal startup mode. </span></span></p>

            <p>Option 1: Troubleshooting found an unknown device with no driver.</p>
<p>Option 2: Followed the instructions, and it did not succeed in fixing the issue. Gearhead does not have a driver download, the mouse is supposed to be "plug a play," and has worked for over a month prior to this.</p>
<p>Option 3: The error still persisted even in clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue occurs in every program that has a need for scrolling that I have tried. The mouse is an Optical 2.4GHz Wireless Mouse Model Number: OM4750W, OM6750W</p>

    <title>Quick access - Explorer jump list - Pinned User Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micha&#235;l van kerckhoven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quick access - Explorer jump list - Pinned User Folder</h2>
                    <p>Windows does not support moving C:\Users folder to another location (read drive). So after my new clean install of Fall Creators Update, I chose to use the standard way. The official way to move my user files away from my c:\ (SSD drive) is to move all the
 folders from C:\Users\Michael to whatever path I want using right-click &gt; Location tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, I want to add my User Folder to the Quick access (easy task) and this automatically adds it to the Explorer Jump List. Fine, this is what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem (should I say BUG) :</p>
<p>When I click on "Michael" in Quick Access, everything is OK and I go to the "virtual" &gt; Michael folder (= User Folder) that shows all files and folders in C:\Users\Michael PLUS all the folders that I just moved like explained earlier :</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b4c4524-7b4c-4d33-b4d3-0a7b31c65ffc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b4c4524-7b4c-4d33-b4d3-0a7b31c65ffc" /></a></p>
<p>But If I use the link that is pinned onto Explorer's JumpList, I'm redirected to the "physical" &gt; C:\Users\Michael ! And of course, it's pretty much empty (except some hidden files/folders like AppData)...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0b110d1-a2ed-4968-93dd-0d5fb32e6508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0b110d1-a2ed-4968-93dd-0d5fb32e6508" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I customized the start menu to show my user folder, and if I click this one, I go to C:\Users\Michael, too.</p>
<p>I don't think this was the case in the previous version of Windows 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can we report bugs to the windows team ?</p>

            There are plenty of applications out there to hide the shortcut arrow. But if you want a nice simple way I've uploaded a Blank.ico, a .reg file and instructions to
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?vcr5vdohr3frr93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MediaFire</a>.<br />
<br />
Guaranteed not to, at a later date, turn into a black square where the arrow should be.<br />
Basically, just drop the Blank.ico in your C:\Windows folder and run/merge the .reg file.<br />
<br />
For your info the .reg file reads:-<br />

</p><p>I cannot add my outlook account to my settings. I keep getting error code 0x80070525??(says something went wrong) My husband has added me as a family member and I have my own Microsoft account and G mail account. In the settings menu on windows 10 when I
 go to add an account it says "something went wrong we can't do that" and it shows the error code I mentioned.</p>
<p>Also, my power icon is missing from my home screen. I have connect, ease of access and that's all. I used to have a power icon that allowed me to click and either sleep, shutdown, or restart. PLEASE find a fix for both</p>

            If Windows can't detect a printer that you want to use, follow these steps to find and add the printer manually:<br />
<br />
1. Open Devices and Printers by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , and then, on the Start menu, clicking Devices and Printers.<br />
2. Click Add a printer.<br />
3. In the Add Printer wizard, select Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer.<br />
4. On the Searching for available printers page, click The printer that I want isn't listed.<br />
5. On the Find a printer by name or TCP/IP address page, choose how to find the printer that you want to use, based on the type or location of the printer, and then click Next.<br />
6. Complete the additional steps in the wizard, and then click Finish.<br />
<br />
To make sure that printers on the network are being displayed, check to see if the network is working correctly. For more information, see View the status of your network.<br />
<br />
I’d also suggest you to refer the link below and follow the steps mentioned in the article to troubleshoot network printer problems:<br />

            AFAIK, there is no such thing as DoD "certified" disk wiping software.&nbsp; Currently, the only means of sanitizing magnetic media acceptable to the DoD is degaussing --&gt;

I believe that some of the more paranoid 3-letter agencies require physical destruction of magnetic media (e.g., melting in a furnace).<br />

<h2>            Incorrectly Charged for cancelled order</h2>
                    
<p>Hey</p>
<p>I received this email on 8/26 which is identical to an email I received on 3/24/2016 from a Kyle Johnson about an order I placed in November or December of 2015.</p>
<p>Both times I received the email I replied to cancel the order.</p>
<p>Today I got charged, on an account that I only put money in for online orders when I need to BTW, $19.99 from you and $35 from my bank for the overdraft on this account due to your company&nbsp;not checking your email.
</p>
<p>I called the number on the email and they told me that the email comes from an automated server and is not monitored and they cannot refund me my money. From the email below, there is no mention that I should call or contact&nbsp;you any other way.</p>
<p>I've been an XBOX Live member since 2002&nbsp;(2004&nbsp;or 2005 with my current ID)&nbsp;but I don't understand how this happened. A $19.99 game has now cost me $54.99 because&nbsp;of a non marked automated email server.</p>
<p>I need this recredited to my account </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Skype loses connection to my webcam frequently, and camera lag on my side only.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Logitech C930e that I use for Skype calls. Through the course of a normal day, the camera's video will stop working, and i'll get the the following message on Skype: "We could not connect to your selected camera. Please select a different camera
 or try restarting Skype. The small image you get of what the other person sees on their end shows that my webcam is frozen.<br />
<br />
Restarting Skype does not work. Unplugging and reconnecting my webcam does restore video functionality, if only until the issue occurs again.</p>
<p><br />
The other issue I have is that when the video IS working, in the small image of what the other person sees on their, it appears as though my video is lagging. However, I asked the people I'm calling if my video is lagging and they say that it is not. So this
 apparent lag is on my end only.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the two issues are connected, but I would appreciate any assistance in fixing them both.<br />
<br />
I'm using Skype version 8.44.0.40 on&nbsp;Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Jimmy.<br />

            Hi JimmyOrevich 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe

            According to Avast, this option is off by default and is only available on the paid version. I have the free version, and I'm not even able to access those settings.

<p>Bonjour, voila j'ai un problème, hier je jouais sur le nouveau Call of, tout marchait parfaitement bien, ce matin j'ai lancé le jeu, fait une partie en multi, à la fin de la partie, la partie suivante se lance et là plus de son, j'ai enlever le CD, nettoyé,
 remis dans la One mais rien n'a faire, plus de son, j'ai testé le mode campagne, aucun son non plus à part pour les cinématiques... quelqu'un a une réponse à ça ?</p>
