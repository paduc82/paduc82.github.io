            PhilipRadler has provided the answer. It's just unfortunate that there's no way to get these statistics except by running the grammar checker first. I suppose Word needs to do that in order to take stock of the document, but I can't imagine how painful
 that would be in a long document, clicking <strong>Ignore</strong> repeatedly just to get to the end.

    <title>Calendar item off by one hour after daylight saving time changed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calendar item off by one hour after daylight saving time changed</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I accept an outlook meeting invitation from my phone (Lumia 520) it gets into the phone´s calendar one hour earlier than sceduled in the invitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked settings, the outlook invite as well as my phone has the same timezone settings (western europe), though phone settings is "Auto".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like phone does not handle calendar invite items correctly after the switchover to standard(winter) time. For information; when the Outlook meeting item is sent to other calendar systems (e.g. other outlook server or google calendar) the meeting
 is registerred correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any clue how to solve this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>//Christian</p>

<p>Hi ceggertsen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using your Microsoft account? How often do you experience this? Can you try to create a test invitation using another exchange account and then see if it's the same? Also, try to set your manually set your time, date, and time zone and see if it
 will make any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>Lumia 920 GDR3 location Belgium Brussels : I have been roaming the internet extensively and it seems to be a sync problem between the caldav protocols of Google and Microsoft when DST was introduced per 30/10/2013. EAS did not have this problem but support
 for it was stopped by Google as per 31/12/2013. Therefore I had to switch to Caldav and Cardav syncing for my Google Mail, Calendar and Contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;only &nbsp;solution that really worked for me &nbsp;until de MS boys fix the bug is the following: .Go to settings :&nbsp;&nbsp;date + time: uncheck automatic : checkout time zone UTC+01:00 West Central Africa. This is the only time zone +1 that does not use the daylight
 saving time. DST and thus it doesn't provoke this error. I guess people in other time zones ought to look for similar time zones which do not use DST.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> michaelmalloy- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mobile Excel Web Access Feature - Causing problems when creating a sub site using a custom template</h2>
                    <p>On July 20, 2016 several of us on this forum inquired about an issue which is preventing us from using custom templates to create new sub sites. My understanding from everything I've read from Microsoft is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This is the result of a deprecated feature</p>
<p>2. MS is concerned that doing something about this on the back end will have a damaging effect for a majority of tenants who are NOT experiencing this problem</p>
<p>3. We should contact SP Online support to get this handled on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>4. MS locked the other discussion on this topic which was started on July 20 when we started receiving the errors</p>
<p>5. I was in touch with an engineer and forwarded her the .wsp file that was throwing the error. I am still waiting to hear back.</p>
<p>6. I suspected my legacy BPOS site collection (which has been upgraded to the modern SP 2013 URL) was the issue</p>
<p>7. I ran a test and created some new site collections - saved a site as a template - and created new sites based off the custom templates....everything worked fine. I suspect the issue lies within the .wsp file somewhere</p>
<p>8. I am hoping to keep this thread alive so that we can continue to share experiences with how this thing turns out in the end.</p>
<p>9. I did see some mentions of using Powershell to solve this; however, I would prefer that the solution come directly from MS engineers as it relates to this current issue.</p>
<p>10. Please reply to this is any of you have actually received a viable solution from MS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck everyone!</p>

            Hi Brandon,
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />* I move the email on my Surface. It moves it out of the inbox (according to Windows Mail) and into the destination folder. This also reflects in Outlook on my phone. However, if I log into Gmail (web), it is still sitting in my inbox.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Is the account set up as imap or using the new "Microsoft cloud" sync?  The Mail client and Outlook app both support adding gmail using the cloud sync feature so calendar &amp; contacts are included. Changes made in the apps don't sync back to the server immediately 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />* I move the email in Windows Mail on my surface from my inbox to the destination folder. It reflects on Gmail (web) but when I open Outlook on my phone, it is still sitting in my inbox.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />If you pull down to refresh, does it disappear? I've noticed the outlook app can be really slow to update. 
<br />
<br />More information on the cloud sync feature, see 
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sync-your-Google-account-to-the-Microsoft-Cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sync-y...</a>

            Thank you for your response, Diane. The account is actually set up using the Microsoft Cloud Sync. Pulling down to refresh Outlook on my phone does not correct the issues with certain emails still being displayed in the Inbox. It's been weeks and they're
 still there.

            Do you have the latest app updates installed on your phone? I know there are sync issues if you don't update and it doesn't force you to (most of the time it forces you to update the app - but once or twice it didn't).

<h2>            Store Beta still not working outside US in build 10041</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to install apps like Word from the beta store without any luck. I have to change my "location" to US and also change my Regional Format settings to US to make the store work at all. I was hoping this got fixed in latest build. Is there
 any other workaround except changing language formats and location? </p>

    <title>WM6.1 Password Protection &#40;Simple 4 digit&#41; or Alternative App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdpo  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM6.1 Password Protection &#40;Simple 4 digit&#41; or Alternative App</h2>
                    Dear all,<br />
<br />
I have recently upgraded my handset which now has WM6.1 installed. My old WM5 handset had a 'Simple 4 digit PIN' password option, which when locked only required you to tap the 4 digits (no need to press 'unlock'). Now in WM6.1 they have replaced it with a
 'PIN' option of arbitary length (which is unneccessary as there was always an alphanumeric option which sufficed). This means now I have to type my 4 digit PIN as before, but now I have to tap the tiny 'Unlock' button just above my left soft-key as well.<br />
<br />
This is a royal pain in the ____ if I'm in the car.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get it back to the "4 digit PIN" behaviour as in WM5... OR (even better) does anyone know any alternative applications that will password protect my phone after x number of minutes, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.omegaone.com/pass/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.omegaone.com/pass/default.htm</a>&nbsp;(however
 this does not support WM5/6)?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance

<p>&nbsp;Yes you are absolutly right. There is the extra unlock button you have to tab.</p>
<p>If you are looking just for the lock with no pin (No security) I can recommend S2U2&nbsp;on
<a href="http://www.ac-s2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ac-s2.com/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give you on a touch screen the slider option to unlock your screen</p>

    <title>N86 GPS does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bicyclez  say:</h3>
<h2>            N86 GPS does not work</h2>
                    
<p>I use N86 "Integrated GPS" as the only positioning method.</p>
<p>N86 takes at least 2 min to locate satellite signals.&nbsp; In contrast, my Garmin GPS takes about 40 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the car, the N86 GPS does not appear very good because the connection with the satellite constantly drops.&nbsp; I suspect that the GPS receiver is weak.&nbsp; My Garmin is superior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N86 GPS was tolerable until I upgraded my software version to 20.115.&nbsp; NOW, I GET NO CONNECTION AT ALL, even under clear open sky.&nbsp; The warning message "GPS works poorly indoors and in enclosed area" just exacerbates my frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the GPS receiver can completely drain a fully charged battery in about one hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution to my NO CONNECTION problem?</p>

<p>It is advisable to do a soft/hard reset of phones after every update. I recommend you do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, ANY phone will be outperformed by a dedicated GPS receiver if A-GPS is disabled. please consider that not only does the phone have a GPS antenna less than half the one installed on an actual GPS receiver, it only has a battery with a 3.7 volt
 output, and this power would have to be divided to at least 2 antennae (GSM and GPS) during navigation, not to mention other phone features.</p>

<p>There is an app called Location in your phone. I have forgotten exactly where this is placed, but I think it should be in the Tools folder. Open it and select GPS data&gt;Position&gt;Options&gt;Satellite Status. This should show you if you are receiving any signals
 from satellites. If everything is low or there are no signals, please go to a Nokia Care Center, as the GPS chip itself would be having trouble if such is the case.</p>

<h2>            Malware&#47;Virus has disabled Windows Defender and can&#39;t turn it back on</h2>
                    <p>I installed something stupidly.</p>
<p>I ran scans with Malwarebytes and it removed 250 threats, did the restart and then Malwarebytes wouldn't run anymore, I uninstalled it and reinstalled and rescanned and it removed 5 more threats, did another scan and it hasn't found anymore threats but whenever
 I restart my PC it gets disabled again. I also scanned with Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit and CCleaner.&nbsp; Windows Defender won't turn on at all and Windows Defender Offline tells me it's unable to detect a Windows system drive. System restore also doesn't work.
 Please help</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. Would not even keep office 365 in my cart for my personal login. Tried to buy a business subscription with my business login. Can not actually buy it. The 'Place Order' button is greyed out although all information is correct.
 (Also the cc number line is faulty and the cursor skips back to the beginning at the second to the last number while typing causing it to become the first number)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using explorer, buying from the MS store. Not in a personal browsing session. Temp files?? no idea.

<p>Hi Oldhasbeen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test and personal search, there is no setting in Steps Recorder or Word for changing the image size when opening the recorded mht file. We may need to manually adjust the image size in Word 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could follow up this thread to see if our members have some good suggestions for this scenario. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@other community members, you are welcome to share your experience about the best practice for opening a recorded mht file with Word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h2>            requery from a pop up form</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have a pop up form which appends records to my database, but it I want it to requery the main form to show the records that have just been added without closing the pop up form, as I still want to append new records using the same&nbsp; pop up form.&nbsp; Is this
 possible as I am currently not having any luck.<br />
<br />
I have tried the following in VBA<br />
<br />
DoCmd.OpenQuery "qryFindNextDocNumber_And_Append_2 digits", acDatasheet, acEdit<br />
DoCmd.OpenForm "frmCritFindNextNumber", , , , acFormEdit<br />
<br />
Forms!frmCritFindNextNumber.Form.docDocNo.Requery<br />
<br />
and I've tried a few other varies code but still to no avail.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me to get this right.<br />
<br />
the main form name is; frmCritFindNexNumber - the underlying query is "qryFindNextDocNumber"<br />
the pop up form is; frmFindNextNumber_Preview<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            If you don't activate eventually Office will switch to "limited function mode", read only, no edit no printing.<br />
<br />
How soon varies with the source of the installation file. It may be after you start the Office App 25 or 30 times, it may be 30 days, or 60 days.<br />

<h2>            How to use the OLE DB Provider for Microsoft Directory Services in Excel&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,I'm looking to use the "Get External Data" function in Excel 2007 to pull a list of names, phone #'s etc from our Active Directory DB. &nbsp;The steps I follow are:
<p>Select "<strong>From other sources</strong>" on the "<strong>Get External Data</strong>" section on the "<strong>Data</strong>" tab Select "<strong>From Data Connection Wizard</strong>" Select "<strong>Other/Advanced</strong>" On the Provider tab select
 "<strong>OLE DB Provider for Microsoft Active Directory Service</strong>" Select Next</p>
This is where my problem starts... &nbsp;I haven't been able to determine what I need to enter in the "<strong>Data Source</strong>" and "<strong>Location</strong>". &nbsp;Regardless of what I enter, I can select the "<strong>Test Connection</strong>" button and it tells
 me "<strong>Test connection succeeded</strong>". &nbsp;However, when I hit ok after that, I get "<strong>Unable to connect to data source...</strong>"
<div><br />
</div>
What information should I be entering to make use of this function? &nbsp;
<div><br />

    <title>Graphs show zero values when formulas entered in cells have not yet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Graphs show zero values when formulas entered in cells have not yet been given values to calculate</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>When I use formulas in cells to calculate numbers and then try to graph them, a line graph will show a zero instead of a blank if the numbers for the calculation have not been entered yet. I have adding an "if" statements to make the value for the formula
 to be blank if there are no numbers entered for the formula yet - and this still does not remove the zeros. Is there any way I can leave the formulas in this situation and somehow make Excel see the cell as being empty when the values for the formula have
 not been entered?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Make the formula return NA() instead of blank and it won't be plotted, instead the graph will interpolate between non zero (na()) values</p>

    <title>How to Create an Append Query to Import Excel fields into Mutliple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> debraann  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Create an Append Query to Import Excel fields into Mutliple Tables</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel file that contains 36 columns of information.&nbsp; Most of the information is repeated so they asked me to create a database to avoid repeating all the information on each row.&nbsp; I now have these main tables along with&nbsp;seven other tables each
 containing the unique&nbsp;list&nbsp;for a field in one of the main tables .&nbsp;I'm hoping I did the breakout and relationships correctly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Parent Component</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Subcomponents</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part Info</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacturer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relationships</p>
<p>- Parent Component is linked to Subcomponents</p>
<p>- Both Parent Component and Subcomponents are linked to Part Info</p>
<p>- Part Info is linked to both Manufacturer and Status tables</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that there is no circular relationship issue because the Parent is linked to the Subcomponent but both the Parent and the Subcomponent will contain its own line item in the Part Info table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, now for moving all the data from Excel to the multiple Access tables.&nbsp; I have linked the Excel file into the database and I want to append all the fields in the Excel into the multiple tables while ensuring the relationship is kept in tack between the
 tables.&nbsp; I have no idea how to appendix into multiple tables, it only asks you to identify the one table you are appending into.&nbsp; I see that I cannot create a query of the 36 fields and then Append to a query as it does not allow that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how would I do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, in advance, for your assistance.</p>
<p>

            Take a look at DecomposerDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file imports data from Excel into a single 'holding' table, and then decomposes it into a set of correctly normalized predefined operational tables.&nbsp; This is done by a series of 'append' queries.&nbsp; The demo takes you through these step by step,
 with a brief explanation of each.&nbsp; The order of execution of the queries is crucial.&nbsp; In essence, data must first be inserted into the referenced tables before inserting rows into the referencing tables.<br />
<br />
While my demo uses quite a simple model, the same principles apply to more complex models.&nbsp; It is of course very important that the target tables are each fully normalized and that their keys are correctly defined.&nbsp; It is also important that all relationships
 are enforced.<br />
<br />
With any append operation like this the consistency of the imported data is important.&nbsp; I once found myself recorded in one old 'flat-file' database as author of technical articles in my own field of work in three separate ways, K Sheridan, K W Sheridan and
 K V Sheridan (the last an error).&nbsp; When the data was imported into a relational database I was represented as three separate people until the Authors table and its referencing table were manually corrected (the latter first of course). &nbsp;<br />

<p>you should check your device manufacturer or Mobile operator website for upgrades. I went to check HP's website and did not find one for your device. You will need to have Windows Mobile 5 and above to install the

<h2>            Feature request&#58; image cropping in OneNote</h2>
                    <div>OneNote is one of the only Office products that cannot crop images inside the app. Considering that images/graphics are quite common in note-taking, this feature would be extremely convenient.&nbsp;There are many ways to&nbsp;insert images, such as via the clipboard,
 screen clippings, or even the webcam, yet there's no way to crop them once inserted. Can we expect this feature in the near future?</div>

            That's strange, because I am using OneNote 2013 on Windows 8.1 and I do not see that option. However, I installed an add-in called Onetastic (http://omeratay.com/onetastic/) which has a crop feature. This solves my problem for now but I still think it
 should be natively supported in OneNote.

</p><p>Today, I just try to enter the Product Key again, and it passed without any error message. BUT, I don't understand why the new expiry is just
<strong>Feb 07 2019</strong>, it must be <strong>Nov 11, 2019</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the support from Microsoft team! I quote the reason here for who get in the same situation</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot actually renew Office 365 if you purchased it though Microsoft using keys from outside retailer. In other side, if you have purchased Office 365 from a retailer, you cannot renew it using the Office purchased directly from Microsoft. You can use
 the key one the expiration date reaches"</p>
