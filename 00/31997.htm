    <title>App Store not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            App Store not working</h2>
                    I recently updated to Windows 10 on my Toshiba laptop from Windows 8, and now whenever I try to download an app from the Windows App Store, it automatically closes out of the window when I click the "free" button. It also closes out whenever I go to click
 the sign in button (within the store's window). I have tried downloading multiple apps, so I know that it is not that particular app itself. Why is this happening/how can I fix this problem?

<p>i cant find any concrete information on the xbox one check in policy. My question is lets say i go camping or on vacation and im not home for a few days to check in, and because im camping or on vacation i have zero internet access, (because you dont need
 a smart phone while camping), what happens?can i set the xbox to check in for me if im not home?</p>

<p>That's right, 500 dollar brick. I don't mind the 24 hour check in, but I should be able to play my physical game discs if I'm not online. If they reconsidered this one policy, I would feel much better about the XBOX ONE. But right now, I'm less than excited.</p>

<p>I really see no reason they could not just authenticate the license with the Box that the disc is installed in and make it playable on just that Box. Seems easy enough.

<p>[/quote]I can't recall a time Xbox Live has been down entirely for more than a few hours across the entire service. They're bumping it from 15,000 to 300,000 servers so the probability of "what if the servers go down" is a moot point.<br />
<br />
If your area is out of internet for whatever reason, you can very briefly tether your phone's internet connection and connect to Xbox Live, sparing a few kilobytes from your mobile data, and you're good to go for 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's a way for every body whining about this to quit posting every 5 five seconds. &nbsp;Can all y'all keep it to once every 24 hrs or is that too much to ask? &nbsp;I this is like the only topic on the forums.</p>

<p>Seriously your all talking about camping in a remote location and not using your internet. &nbsp;Try some other tech, like a camera, scuba gear, or maybe a typewriter. &nbsp;Take a vacation people quit worrying bout playing lego batman while your getting in touch
 with nature. &nbsp;Learn to swim, hike, climb, &nbsp;or god forbid socialize.</p>

<h3> uchewosu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Event Properties - Even 41, Kernel-Power &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My computer keeps crashing with a blue screen of death, and this particular blue screen of death is currently the only one plaguing my computer, but it's consistent. Every time my computer crashes, I'm never able to read what's on screen because all the
 letters and numbers look torn up like a graphical&nbsp; or memory error. However, I looked on the windows event log to see exactly what the error is, and all these crashes belong to the error: Event 41, Kernel-Power. This error only seems to occur whenever I'm
 playing a game, and it's happened at least three times. I've looked up other fixes on Microsoft, but none of them seem to apply to me. I'm pretty sure my power supply isn't failing, i turn my computer off using only the shutdown button in windows, and there
 are no abrupt cuts with energy in my house.&nbsp; All these seem to be a contributing factor to this error, based on others who have had this problem. The error occurs during or right before some sort of game, and then crashes my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system information is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Intel Pentium G4400 @ 3.3Ghz</p>
<p>RAM: 4Gb</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 64-bit</p>
<p>Power Supply EVGA: 430W</p>
<p>Motherboard: MSI B250M Pro-VD</p>
<p>HDD: WDC WD3200AAJS-61B4a0 (165/297Gb)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This crashes doesn't happen very often, but it's bound to happen in the future, because it always comes back. I'd really appreciate a response, and hopefully a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hello Uche,<br />
<br />
An event 41 is used to report that something unexpected happened that prevented Windows from shutting down correctly. There may be insufficient information to explicitly define what happened.
<br />
<br />
Your system will perform a check to determine whether the computer was shut down cleanly, if it finds that it didn't, system would then generate the&nbsp; event 41; which is the Even 41 Kernel-Power error you're getting now.
<br />
Although a common misconception of the error being the cause, it actually is a symptom.<br />
<br />
Random restarts or shutdowns with no Windows errors isn't pointing at the operating system, it's more of a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
If event 41 is logged because power to the computer was interrupted, consider obtaining an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) such as a battery backup power supply. An underpowered or failing power supply may cause this behavior. For example, if you added RAM
 or additional devices or hard disks when this problem began, the power supply may cause the problem.<br />
<br />
Moreover, noting that you do shut down your computer through the Shutdown button on your Power options located in your Start menu, we'd still need to isolate and determine if this is indeed due to a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
To check whether this scenario is occurring, press the CAPS LOCK key on the keyboard. When you do this, if the CAPS LOCK light on the keyboard does not change when you press the CAPS LOCK key, the computer may be completely unresponsive (hard hang).<br />
<br />
Update us on the outcome, so we could further advise.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            recent office update cause graphic artifacts in outlook and powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>After the latest round of updates I have noticed that on occasion artifacts are starting to appear in the ribbon in outlook the artifacts are other sections of the open window overlaid on top of others.&nbsp; This makes the icons hard or impossible to make out.&nbsp;
 Closing and reopening the app seems to fix it.&nbsp; minimizing the window does not.&nbsp; Clicking on where I think a particular icon is sometimes helps but not always.&nbsp; I have no similar issue in any other applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In powerpoint the slides on the side window are different from the ones in the window.&nbsp; By that I mean if I select a slide in the main window the one highlighted in the side window is a different slide then the one selected&nbsp;in appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp; So as I click
 on different slides that so not look like the one I want in the preview or side window the one that shows up in the main window is the one I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suspect the video driver except no other app is having a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The applications do not crash.</p>

 document, it will print pages 3, 2 1, then&nbsp; 3, 2, 1 in that order or else it will print pages 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1. To better understand click on the "Collate" checkbox and see the changes on the figure on it's left

<h2>            Denied refund</h2>
                    I recently was denied a refund for unauthorized charges on my credit card to the amount of $3400.00. Charges were made by a mentally challenged minor.&nbsp; Unsure how this happened since I had account password protected. This has left me in a hardship that
 will result in repossesion of my vehicle possibly. I feel that this is highly unacceptable,&nbsp; especially&nbsp; due to the amount.&nbsp; 33 charges of $110 back to back.&nbsp; I would think this would be clearly eligible for a refund.&nbsp; I am begging someone to please help me
 resolve this.&nbsp;

<h2>            Peculiar problem with windows 10 v. 1709 &#40;and also v. 1803&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"><span>Good evening,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I‚Äôm Marco, an Italian IT worker. I don‚Äôt know how to escalate this problem in the right hands, so I write here.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Main Problem </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Health problem with windows 10 v. 1709 (and also with v. 1803, the version I‚Äôm using for now, but I have saved an image backup of version 1703 and I will return there soon).
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Secondary problem </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Microsoft forced me to pass to windows 10 v. 1709 (from v. 1703), even if I had hidden this update with Microsoft ‚Äúwushowhide‚Äù tool. This tool has been bypassed, probably thanks to another update.
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Description of the main problem </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I‚Äòm a person very sensible to eye strain: high screen luminosity, some kind of backlight LED, hdmi, antialiasing and all its derivated forms (so all the classic videogame graphic filters), some kind of fonts
 (but it‚Äôs very rare), forms of flickering that human eye can‚Äôt see and I suspect also some kind of rendering and pixel shading can cause me aggressive forms of eye strain: not only red/tired eyes, but also headaches and light forms of articular pain and/or
 dizziness. Some of the things I have reported are videogames related, but some others not. Using windows 10 v. 1709, I have a very light form of dizziness that becomes a big headache in half hour. Moreover, my eyes feel immediately tired.
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>My graphic card settings and my desktop monitor settings, from version 1703 to 1709 (and now to 1803), are still the same. And I‚Äôm aware of the fact that with this kind of updates (these deep updates that change
 an OS version), it can happen that some of the graphic settings reset to default: I have already checked this parameters and I have restored the few options that have been reset to default. Speaking in general about desktop monitors, usually I use a very low
 (even 0) luminosity and low contrast; usually I also use a low gamma (0.60 or 0.70). About text size scaling, in 1920x1200 resolution I use 140% (and a lesser percentage, always over 100%, in other resolutions).
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>More info</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>- All previous windows versions have been always safe for me (all windows XP versions, all windows 7 versions, both windows 8.0 and 8.1 versions). About windows 10, I can speak only about version 1703 and the
 version immediately earlier (I don‚Äôt remember the version number) : both these windows 10 versions were safe for me. With version 1709 it has begun the problem, and it‚Äôs present also in version 1803. For sure, graphically speaking, your graphic coders have
 changed something between v. 1703 and v.1709 (I have already described what can cause me problems).
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>- I‚Äôm over 30 and I have used hundreds if not thousands of PC programs: in 18 years, I have had a similar problem with no more than 4-5 programs.
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>- Internet sites: in the past two years (before never), I have had a similar problem with 2 sites. One of them was an Italian journalistic site quite famous: in less than three months it has returned to be safe
 for me (I don‚Äôt have report nothing to them). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>As you can see, it‚Äôs always a graphic-related problem: with windows 10 v. 1709 (and also v. 1803) one of my fears has become true: the occurrence of this problematic in an operative system (and considering I
 use windows in 75% of my informatics activities, it‚Äôs a real big problem). With the aggravating that Microsoft has forced me to pass to v. 1709. Anyway, I hope in a solution for the future (I hope that someone here knows how to report my problem to Microsoft
 in the right way and/or it reports it for me); meanwhile, I think to return to version 1703 (I have an image backup of January 2018), hiding/blocking every windows update (of course not a good choice about security, but I don‚Äôt know what to do).
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Thanks for the attention. </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Marco</span></p>

<h2>            HP Envy Dv7-7223cl Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit&#58; USB 3.0 Ports wont work.</h2>
                    When I plug in my mouse into any of the USB 3.0 ports, Windows doesn't make the sound indicated that it is plugged in. I did a clean reinstall two days ago and installed most of my drivers, but they don't work. A local PC shop deleted Windows 8 and installed
 Windows 7 a few weeks ago and the USB 3.0 ports worked that time, so the drivers exist. After having some issues,&nbsp;I decided to do a clean reinstall of Windows 7, which deleted all of my drivers and I was able&nbsp;to reinstall most of them, but the USB 3.0 ports
 didn't work since and still don't work. I've looked through the internet, but I couldn't find the right one. I've looked in device manage and found that two devices: PCI Device and SM Bus Controller are indicated with a yellow sign. After looking under properties,
 I found that both do not have their drivers installed (Code 28). Does anyone know where to find the drivers to fix this issue?

 method used by Customer Support Services is to rename the folder. Verify that no problems exist after a restart and then delete the folder.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a KB which in trying to fix another problem uses the process of renaming the folder:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949386</a></span></p>
<p><span>Before your rename the folder you must stop the service. Here is how:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start&gt;Run </span></li><li><span>type <em><strong>cmd</strong></em></span> and press enter </li><li><span>type <strong><em>net stop wuauserv</em></strong></span> and press enter</li><li><span>type&nbsp;<strong><em>rename c:\windows\SoftwareDistribution softwaredistribution.old</em></strong>and press enter</span></li><li><span><span>type <strong><em>net start wuauserv</em></strong></span></span> and press enter</li><li>type <strong><em>exit </em></strong>and press enter </li></ul>
<p>Verify that the new software distribution folder created when you restart the update service is approxiamtely 1.5 MB in size (standard files). Restart the computer and del the folder if you have no issues.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'SoftwareDistribution' folder is where automatic updates are stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are mixed views across the board about deleting this folder, but my view is that if you stop automatic updates, delete the folder then restart automatic updates that works and has worked many time before for me.</p>

<h3> richardwaltonta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bios Password</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have an Hp ProDesk 400 G3 SFF. I got a message that I needed a bios update. Your probably thinking I should be on the Hp site but this has to do with the bios on the operating system. When I tried to update the bios it wanted the bios password. I bought
 this computer brand new, custom built, I turned it on and followed the Microsoft prompts, entered my Microsoft account info, created a password for logging onto the computer but NEVER created or was asked to create a bios password. Does anyone know anything
 about this issue with the operating system?

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the BIOS password, this will vary depending on the make or model, you should be able to do it by resetting the BIOS battery on the motherboard.
<br />
<br />See steps how to do it:
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

            Hi Richard.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is no OS BIOS, it belongs to the motherboard of the hardware which in this case is HP.  If someone set a BIOS password - usually businesses do this to protect company secrets if laptop is stolen - then there is no way to reset it on an HP without having HP Support verify ownership and do this for you - the password chip isn't even the same as the BIOS chip so resetting doesnt' work.  Again these are anti-theft measures usually only put in place at the BIOS level by companies protecting their property.  
<br />
<br />I would contact HP support to establish ownership so they will reset the BIOS password for you.  I know of no other way and I've handled thousands of these cases in forums for years.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If all else fails, you may need to Remove the Cmos Battery on the mother board for a short time to clear the information in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Go to the Manufacture web site for information on How to accomplish this on your particular System. There may also be a jumper that you will need to pull and then replace to clear the Bios.</p>
<p>

            This model all you have to do is remove the jumper power on shutdown reinstall the jumper and reboot and the password will be gone, see my other posting for the link to the manual.

<h2>            HandyShare 4.0.0.2 software with Windows 8.1 Malfunction&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Once installed, HandyShare 4.0.0.2; the program's properties indicate the software is compatible with Windows 8.1, which I was forced into after after 12 years with a great computer built for me, running Windows XP.&nbsp; The requirement of installing the compatible
 version of QuickTime has been fulfilled.&nbsp; The device I am attempting to use with the HandyShare program is a Zoom Q2 HD audio/video recorder.&nbsp; The HandyShare program opens well enough and the click options are working.&nbsp; Here's the bear:&nbsp; the HandyShare program
 will not recognize the recorder.&nbsp; I have used every USB port on my just-out-the-box hp cpu,.&nbsp; Uninstalled, rebooted and reinstalled&nbsp; QuickTime and HandyShare.&nbsp; Same bear.&nbsp; I have run every compatibility checker I can find and everything is all good.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp;
 I have changed all appropriate settings on both programs to no avail.&nbsp; If there is a Merlin out there tuned in and, perhaps, reading this (What are the odds, I wonder?) who has an answer for this techno-challenged fossil, I would be extremely grateful if he,
 or she, would do the unimaginably remotely possible kindness of educating me as to the error of my ways.&nbsp; Thank you very much for any effort you may undertake to assist.</p>

            A batch would be our best bet. But Docufreeze and Foldermill both haven't been what we need. Docufreez worked perfect aside from it not converting ledger files (just text). If it would have worked, that would be our go to. The ledger will open fine in
 acrobat or adobe but when using docufreeze it doesn't work .We also used 2pdf and it was dumping everything into one folder, not into the original folder. We have went through almost all trials and freeware but not will do what we need it to do , which is&nbsp;<span>source
 directory and it convert all XPS files under this source directory</span>

<p>Yes, I do, but the command would only work if the converter has a command line option (which you just said that it hasn't). A Google search like this one might help:</p>

    <title>Windows will not shut down &#43; explorer crashing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> felduir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows will not shut down &#43; explorer crashing.</h2>
                    Hey, so when I try to shut down my computer it just gets stuck on the shutting down screen and I have to switch it off by holding down the power button. I'm fairly sure this is because the system cannot end certain processes but I don't know which ones.
<br />
At first I thought it was iTunes because it wouldn't open but would start a process that wouldn't shut down. Then I got it uninstalled and it hasn't helped.
<br />
Now the other problem, maybe related? When I right click on the desktop explorer crashes (not IE). It doesn't just shut off but stops responding. For some reason i can still use the taskbar and start menu (I thought that was part of explorer).
<br />
And my computer is constantly running at 100% CPU usage. Its an HP laptop running Windows 7 and has had Windows on it for at least a couple months running fine.

            The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
General shutdown troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
<span>Shutdown issues are generally caused by a program and/or process that is refusing to exit gracefully. The program and/or process can be from malware or can be legitimate (such as an invasive antivirus like Norton or McAfee). If you
 are using a Norton or McAfee product,&nbsp; uninstall it and replace with a better program such as NOD32, Kasperksy, or Avast (free). The Windows Firewall is adequate for most people. Shutdown issues can also be caused by old/poorly written drivers so make sure
 all drivers are updated, particularly on Windows Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
A.The first step is always to make sure your computer is virus/malware free.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
B. If the computer is virus/malware-free, drivers are current, and no Norton or McAfee programs are installed, then do clean-boot troubleshooting to see which program/process is the culprit:<br />

http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/shtdwnxp.htm</a> <br />
<br />
Standard caveat: If troubleshooting the issue is too difficult - and there is absolutely no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a computer repair shop. This will not be your local BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. Get
 recommendations from family, friends, colleagues.</span>

                    System repair only brings up a black screen with just the mouse cursor, and safe mode does the same thing. Windows 7 won't start at all and launch repair does nothing. It is Asus Eee netbook. Unmountable boot volume error.&nbsp;

Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7</a><br />
<br />
The main method to fix is to boot with a Windows 7 disk and use the Command Prompt to run :<br />
<br />
Chkdsk C: /f /r<br />
<br />
(spaces after k , C: , and /f&nbsp;&nbsp; such as Chkdsk&nbsp;&nbsp; C:&nbsp;&nbsp; /f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /r&nbsp; using just one space each time)<br />
<br />
If you need a Windows 7 Repair Disk the method to make one is below. (Of course you can use<br />
a Windows 7 Installation Disk as well.)<br />

<strong>Bug Check 0xED: UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME bug check has a value of 0x000000ED. This indicates that the I/O subsystem attempted to mount the boot volume and it failed.
</p>
Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

=============================================================</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot (if you can as you can).</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>
