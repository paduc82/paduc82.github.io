            <p>Hi grahamSmithKB,</p>
<p>Thanks for the post. You have installed a registry booster application, uniblue. You now wish to uninstall it. It would help to understand the
 issue better if you could let us know if you encountered any error code or message when you tried to uninstall it. Also, please let us know which version of Windows is installed on the computer.</p>
<p>Installed programs are listed in Programs and Features in Windows Vista and Windows 7 and you can find them under the add/remove programs in
 Windows XP. If the computer is Windows 7 or Vista then I would suggest that you refer the link and follow the steps provided in the article.</p>

<h2>            ERROR_INSTALL_FAILURE&#40;0x80070643&#41; after logging in</h2>
                    Original title:Windows Freezing After a Few Minutes with Windows 7 - 32 bit and SP1 not configuring
<br />
<br />
First off here's my computer info:<br />
Dell Inspiron 531 w/ BIOS 1.0.3<br />
AMD Athlon 64 x2 Dual Core Processor 3800+ 2.00GHz<br />
3.00 GB Ram - DDR2<br />
Windows 7 Professional 32-bit<br />
NVIDIA GeForce 6150SEnForce430<br />
<br />
I'm a student in college. Took my computer home over summer break and did not have connected to the internet. Moved back to college and plugged it in. Had to download K-States antivirus software (OfficeScan) in order to get onto the network. Then I had a bunch
 of updates that automatically downloaded and needed installed since I wasn't connected over the summer. Some installed ok, but SP1 would not configure. It would stop halfway through and just sit there...even overnight. I did a hard reset a few times when it
 got stuck, then it reverted changes. After a long time and a few hard resets, it finally got me to my login screen. It showed error code: ERROR_INSTALL_FAILURE(0x80070643) after logging in.<br />
<br />
I was originally running only two 512kb sticks of RAM (bad decision, i know). So i ordered two 1MB sticks and installed them. I thought that had fixed it cuz my computer started running a bit faster.<br />
<br />
Then last weekend, I shut it off to go home for the weekend. When I got back, I turned my computer back on and everything worked fine...for about 5 minutes. Then windows explorer would freeze and the cursor would just be the blue "thinking" cursor when it hovered
 over the taskbar. After shutting down and restarting a bunch of times, it finally started working....but only for a bit.<br />
<br />
After browsing many different forums, I tried to:<br />
1)&nbsp; Remove and shuffle my RAM sticks around. (Also tried to clean out some of the dust in my tower).&nbsp; (Didn't help)<br />
2) Disable sound card. (Didn't help)<br />
3) Update my NVIDIA driver (already had newest update)<br />
4) Install SP1 again (still would not configure and had to revert back)<br />
<br />
Basically I don't have any idea what to do next. I read about updating the BIOS, but I'm not sure if that will help. I didn't have any problems last year when it was connected to the internet or over summer break when it wasn't connected. It all started happening
 when I got back and plugged it into the internet. Any help would be very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<h2>            Something is terribly wrong.</h2>
                    Okay...for some reason, my computer's being difficult.&nbsp; I recently updated my security settings and it recommended I download a virus protection device.&nbsp; After doing so, I noticed that my memory from my HD had dropped dramatically.&nbsp; I had about 46.5 GB
 left of memory, but this morning I noticed it was running slow and checked and it said I had only 4 GB left.<br />
<br />
So I installed McAfee and started doing&nbsp;a scan.&nbsp; This scan found 1 item so far but I can't explain the lost memory.&nbsp; On top of all that, I can't open tabs.&nbsp; A pop up shows up&nbsp;that says&nbsp;C:PROGRA~2/Java/jre6/bin/ssvagent.exe.<br />
<br />
Then it reads in the center:&nbsp; Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.<br />
<br />
My name is the only account and is the admin account.<br />
<br />
Then I can't save pictures now.&nbsp; When I try to save it, it doesn't save.&nbsp; Then a pop up shows up later saying "Access is Denied."<br />
<br />
AND McAffee toolbar keeps opening whenever I log on or open a new tab.&nbsp; (I can still open them, but that message keeps showing up.)<br />
<br />
Also, my computer (The&nbsp;very same laptop)&nbsp;has been shutting down on it's own lately for no reason at all.&nbsp; If I close the lid, it stays on for awhile, then when I open it, it shuts down on me.&nbsp; Even when I'm in the middle of something, it shuts down for no reason
 at all.&nbsp; I'm getting very frustrated with this and I'm close to wiping the thing and just restarting.

            If you uninstalled McAfee did you use their Removal Tool? If not run it.<br />
<br />
----&gt; Also what others do you have or have you ever had on machine? This is important! &lt;----<br />
<br />
Also you need an antivirus on the computer,,,,, check AVAST - HOME - FREE (click the blue<br />

    <title>How do I unistall&#47;reinstall directx on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mccarthymr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unistall&#47;reinstall directx on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Linx tablet running Win10.&nbsp; it was upgraded from Win8 the day Win10 was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 8, I had a number of older games I played without issue.&nbsp; however, after upgrading to Win10. These stopped working.&nbsp; the error that pops up every time is unable to initialise Direct3D.&nbsp; A reboot usually fixes the issue but, if you continue to
 get the error, you will need to re-install Directx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have obviously rebooted hundreds of times without success.&nbsp; I have also tried troubleshooting and searching for how're-install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is the only advice regards Win10 is that Directx will simply update as part of each standard windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm stuck.&nbsp; I clearly need to uninstall directx in order I get a clean install but&nbsp;it is not an app and not a program I can uninstall in the control panel.&nbsp; I am unable to find an uninstall tool and windows update will only assist if I can get it uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this dilemma is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>You can't uninstall DirectX (effectivly). </p>
<p>But it can be repaired by using the DirectX Redist (June 2010) installer package if there are corrupt files.</p>
<p>This will overwrite all DX files (except DX12).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have not run the DirectX Web Installer updating tool try that first -</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- The following is a list of the Direct X .dll's you will have when the files are up to date.<br />
Go to the Windows / System 32 folder, (and SysWOW64 if you have 64bit). &nbsp;<br />
They are in alphabetical order and will start with d3dx9 - 24 &gt; 43 . Then d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43 &amp; finally d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.<br />
There should also be - d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11 (among others). </p>
<p>These come before the D3Dcompilers - 33&gt;47.<br />
- Win10 currently has only two d3d 12 files. One in System 32,and SysWOW64 .<br />
- There are more DX files, but these are most of the graphics related Direct X&nbsp; .dll's<br />
<br />
<br />
Note - The installer download unpacks files to a location of your choice. You then open the folder
</p>
<p>and find the DXSETP.exe&nbsp; and run that to reinstall DirectX.<br />
Once the reinstall is complete you can delete the folder the files were unpacked to.<br />

            <p>Hi Omar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community, I understand your concern and we will try our best to help you resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Are you able to rotate the desktop screen, but unable to&nbsp;change the desired rotation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per your query, I&nbsp;am led to believe that you are unable&nbsp;to rotate your screen. I would suggest that you try the workaround mentioned below so that we can check if you are able to rotate as desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Press<strong> Ctrl+Alt+the arrow keys</strong> to rotate your display as desired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Start Menu &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</strong>. Click the box <strong>
under Orientation&nbsp;&gt; make a selection</strong>.</p>
<p>This third method may prove most useful without a keyboard while multi-tasking. The&nbsp;window with the display&nbsp;settings can be kept open or minimized, and you can always bring it back up to quickly change the orientation at will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi and thanks for the quick reply, no this does not happen to all games. It seems to be random. I went to Device Manager and I do not have the listing Display driver, but I do have Display Adapters which i am updating as i write this. Is this the same
 thing as Display Driver ?. It says this is Intel {R} HD Graphics. The research i have done on the internet I have found a lot of people with there windows 10 freezing up so i know it is not just me having a problem. I will keep you posted on here if i continue
 to have problems. Thanks

            <p>Hello Wiz-21,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to control panel and click on the System icon. You can see which version you have on the General Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running a 32 bit system you will see something like this: Windows XP Professional version 2002 Service Pack 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running the 64 bit then you will see something like this: Windows XP Professional x64 version 2002 Service Pack 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version dates may vary on your machine, but you get the general idea.</p>

    <title>No HDMI Sound after upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuartfraser  say:</h3>
<h2>            No HDMI Sound after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just upgraded my Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10 and am now getting no audio on HDMI out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a genuine MS HDMI adapter for my SP3 and was using it to stream to my TV only an hour before the upgrade.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do get video but no sound.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>TV is a Sony Bravia.&nbsp; Don't know a lot about it other than that.&nbsp; It came with the apartment I am renting right now but as I said, it was working just fine an hour before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stu</p>

            <p>Yes here are the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Connect your Surface to the TV and turn everything on</li><li>Right click on the speaker icon, on the task bar.&nbsp; </li><li>Choose Playback Devices.&nbsp; (You will need to be connected to your TV first to see it listed here).</li><li>Click the Properties Button with the TV highlighted in the list</li><li>Click the "Advanced" tab</li><li>Here you can set the default format for audio playback.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>By default this will be set to the highest quality which I believe the Sony TV's can't handle.&nbsp; I had to set mine to the lowest quality to get sound to work with the TV.&nbsp; You can try each level and use the "Test" button to see if it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get the sound working, save that setting and you are in business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps</p>

            <p>Problem solved.&nbsp; I had to lower the audio quality for the output to the TV and it works fine now.&nbsp; I have sound.&nbsp; Ok kind of crappy sound but there is sound.&nbsp; I'm guessing maybe the drivers got a little more diverse with Win 10?&nbsp; i.e. more options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, it is now working.</p>

<p>Hi Larrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest sign into Skype for business for Windows and check if you can sign into successfully, in the meantime, you can try to
connect&nbsp;</span>to Polycom VVX-401 Skype for Business Phone with another account to see how it goes. By doing so, we can clarify if the issue is related to your Polycom VVX-401 Skype for Business Phone or your specific account. If it is related to your account,
 I suggest reset the password of your account and try again. If it is related Polycom VVX-401 Skype for Business Phone. Please try to clean the credential of your account l in your device first and ask the support for Polycom VVX-401 Skype for Business Phone
 for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

            Hi Socca.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What backup are you using exactly?  File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version. I suggest the safest and most reliable method which is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag them to external or another hard drive,  then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.
<br />
<br />Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Tech Support disabled display adapter now on black screen</h2>
                    <p>I was having issues with upgrading to Windows 10 yesterday, so I contacted customer support via the chat option at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>They asked for my name and phone number, then said they could help. They then had me agree to</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/eahelp</p>
<p>
</p><p>and run LogMeIn. They closed the Windows 10 upgrader, then started cleanmgr.exe, and started to delete things, then msconfig to turn off non-Microsoft services. I can see those as legitimate troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the tech opened up devmgmt.msc, the device manager, then the display devices, and before I could terminate LogMeIn, the tech disabled it, the screen went black. I pulled the plug at that point, because if the tech was legitimate, I can't think of a
 single reason why the display would need to be disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this a scam? Why would a Microsoft tech need to disable my display? Needless to say I don't think this computer will end up with Windows 10 now that the upgrade period is over.

            <p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will try to provide the assistance required to help resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused for the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that at times during installation, if the support team find that there is a driver issue that might have caused the installation to fail. They would&nbsp;disable it and try proceeding with the installation process, this is
 generally coined as "Hardware Clean Boot". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Having stated so, I suggest that you&nbsp;perform Power Drain and check if you are able to boot to the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unplug the charger and remove the battery of your laptop, if using a desktop remove the power cord.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold the Power button for 30sec
</span></li><li><span>Plug the charger/power cord and restart system.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above failed, I suggest that you try to reboot the computer and press F8 until you see a screen which has "Safe Mode with Networking" as an option. Select the same and check if you are
 able to enter the above mode. If so, navigate to<strong> Control Panel &gt; Device Manager &gt; Display Adapter</strong>.&nbsp;Double click to expand the same, right click on the driver and select&nbsp;<strong>Enable.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:
</strong>The above will require you to be logged in from an admin account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps</span></p>
<p><span>Regards&nbsp;</span></p>

            You can execute following to gain space on your computer
<br />
<br />1. Use Storage Sense to delete unnecessary files
<br />Type Storage in Cortana Search Box &gt; Click Storage &gt; Click Change how we free up space &gt; Down below there is button Clean now under Free up space now which you should press
<br />
<br />2. Use Disk Cleanup
<br />Type Disk Cleanup in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Disk Cleanup &gt; Check relevant options (you can also clean system files)
<br />
<br />3. Analyze disk space
<br />You should analyze your existing space with help of third party softwares and remove un-necessary files. TreeSize is most popular one and is a Microsoft Store app.

<br />
<br />4. Check for log files in CBS directory
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Check the size of CBS.Log and if size is huge &gt; 
<br />Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Delete all of the files in the CBS folder (or rename and move to a backup drive) &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update. 
<br />
<br />5. Microsoft has also some suggestions to improve disk space.

            Hi CA, this may be the result of a known bug in Windows 10, it may not . . .
<br />
<br /> Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove, or indeed what the issue may be. . .

<br />Open Disk Management (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)

            Hi CA
<br />
<br />There is definitely an error somewhere, that is in total contradiction to the report provided by TreeSize . .. 
<br />
<br />I know there is a bug in Explorer.exe that means it cannot correctly read file metadata, but not by that much . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Right click that drive and choose Properties
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, choose the Tools Tab and click Check
<br />
<br />Windows will refuse to check that disk while it is running and ask you if you want to schedule a check on restart, choose Yes and restart your PC
<br />
<br />Let that disk checking complete and when Windows restarts, check the free space on that drive in File Explorer and in TreeSize

            <p>i think that setting the safe mode switch in msconfig was a good choice and it shouldnt of crashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what might be a possibility, though this is only a guess is that either windows file system is corrupted and the boot files and registry are unstable "or" the graphics driver is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the reason i asked if you had a cd is to see if we could try a couple of things towards tuning up the file system, like initiating the recovery console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with any bootable xp cd, the recovery console can be launched and it will by pass windows and take you to the disk prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then at the disk prompt, i was going to ask you to run a check disk then a fixboot, for starters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if the two commands still didn't work, then the next step we could try is a repair installation.&nbsp;&nbsp; but the repair installation is version specific.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>unlike the recovery console that can run from any xp cd on any xp version on the computer,&nbsp; the repair install can only work if the xp cd version is the same xp version on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in any case, does the back of your computer have two vga ports for the monitor?&nbsp; i am simply wondering if your computer might have a video card / graphics board installed.&nbsp; if so, then the monitor would be plugged into the computer in a location away from
 the group of connectors / jacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also what model dell do you have?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the information. It was helpful. The registry keys were already set as you described. I changed the setting from RAID to AHCI and let the computer boot. Windows would not boot up because of a disk error. I let it do the automatic shut down
 and let it restart for the second time as you mentioned in 19 and the same error resulted. I changed back to RAID and Windows loaded. Samsung Magician gave me an error notification that some of the features wouldn't work because AHCI was not enabled. But at
 least I was able to get Windows to load. For the most part everything works. It would be nice to be able to use all the features and benefits of the SSD.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
<p>David.</p>

            I attempted this today, unsuccesfully I'm afraid. I have a Samsung 850EVO SSD.<br />
As I went through the registry changes I found that at step5 value was 0, at step 7/8-
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStorAV, </strong>there was no option for
<strong>StartOverride</strong>. I went back to <strong>iaStorV </strong>and found the
<strong>StartOverride </strong>option there which I changed fro 3 to 0. at step 11 value was 0, step 15 value was 0.<br />
I then closed regedit and booted to BIOS, changed to AHCI, saved &amp; exited to restart.<br />
Instead of restarting, I got this error message "<em>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE"<br />
</em>I went back to BIOS changed back to IDE, same message.<br />
Finally after a few restart attempts Windows "repaired the problem" and the computer restarted normally.<br />
I went back to regedit and found the <strong>iaStorV\startoverride</strong> was changed back to 3.<br />
Any idea what went wrong and how I can make the change?

            <p>I followed your instructions to the letter, but unfortunately I could never get Win 10 to boot in AHCI mode.&nbsp; I found all the locations mentioned in steps 3, 6, 9, and 12.&nbsp; Does Win 10 use the Msahci service?&nbsp; I could not find it in my registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only registry settings that were not already set to 0 were the <strong>StartOverride

<p>One additional item&nbsp;was overlooked.&nbsp; I had to boot the PC into windows safe mode after making&nbsp;changes to&nbsp;the registry.&nbsp; Then after, reboot the PC, go into the PC BIOS before it boots into windows, change&nbsp;the BIOS&nbsp;to ACHI mode, then reboot normally.&nbsp; Only
 then would wondows load the correct drivers.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you set up the computer to use your Microsoft Login.&nbsp; Which is the same as your Hotmail.com login ?&nbsp; Correct ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if above is True... &nbsp;if you change your Hotmail login&nbsp;password, which is your Microsoft Login &nbsp;..&nbsp;the computer login automatically&nbsp;changes too ,,,,&nbsp; and&nbsp;matches it&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest before you change any passwords, you go to your Control Panel / Users .. and make the emergency password reset disc or usb stick.</p>

            I have one password for the lock screen and one for Hotmail, when I try&nbsp; "users change password" it goes to a change password strip through the middle of the screen but when I enter old password it tells me that it is not correct. I will try the emergency
 reset.

    <title>How do I make Windows 7 Administrator account only visible in Safe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quantummechanik  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make Windows 7 Administrator account only visible in Safe mode&#63;</h2>
                    net user administrator /active:yes or no&nbsp;&nbsp; DOES NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I'M ASKING...<br />
<br />
I'm trying to make it so that if the computer starts up normally then the normal Account for the computer shows up and only that one, BUT if the computer starts up in safe mode then the Administrator account will then be visible as well&nbsp;to log into next to
 the normal account like in Windows XP. Is this possible?...&nbsp;&nbsp; More details...<br />
<br />
I've already enabled it by opening the cmd command prompt by right clicking it, and "Run as administrator" then putting in...
<p><br />
net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes the Administrator account visible on normal start up, I don't want it to be visible unless the computer starts in safe mode.&nbsp;Any way to accomplish this? Normally it isn't visible wether I start up in safe mode or not. It was visible in safe mode
 by default in Windows XP and I want it to be the same now. This is for important reasons but it's not important to get into that here.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, however...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I stated in my&nbsp;initial post, I've already tried without administrator being active and of course Windows 7 (x86) Home Premium doesn't show the Administrator account by default in safe mode like XP use to. So just turning off the Administrator account
 using the cmd will not work, as I stated in my post that is the first thing I tried. Thanks for the response. So does&nbsp;anyone know a way to accomplish the task at hand?...<br />
<br />
Its funny how large companies get things right in the beggining then end up changing things that don't need changing and leaving things the same that should be changed. Remember, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."&nbsp; and "The more things change, the more they
 stay the same." Anyone figures this one out, your help is much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Realtek Network Controller Not found. If deep sleep mode please plug the cable</h2>
                    I've had this error before. I understand that its the controller not waking up after computer sleeps. Back when it happened the first time (many months ago) I accepted it as the controller being dead. 3 days ago I decided to update my drivers including
 the network driver and like magic, my internet worked again. I went to bed last night, (Cant remember if I tried to shut down my computer) and came in this morning to the screen stuck on the screensaver. After a hard reset, Im back in the same boat. This error
 pops up when I try to repair/reinstall the Realtek Ethernet Controller driver. The windows repair thing when I click currently connected to comes up with unable to locate network card or something similar.

</p><p>It is not our "modus operandi" to manually fix this sort of thing. I paid for win 7 so, very humbly, I expect this and similar problems originated by folks at Micrsoft to be solved by yourselves, not by my hand.</p>

            <p>Thank you (it's the same from Content Class problem, yes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Time Warner, no Norton, no Macafee, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple machine fully formatted more than once by several methods (including Shift+f10 at install screen, as instructed by seven forums), 2nd reinstalation of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After the 2nd install I noticed a very suspicious behaviour the first time I connected to the web: even with definitions of Updater to ask me first before downloading and installing updates, Microsoft managed to punch my PC with 2 updates right under my
 nose, without any notice or permission request. They downloaded and installed automatically (it was 2 of these: KB958488, KB2534111, KB976902).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing this is part of your methods to evaluate if our copy of windows is genuine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, after that (and I noticed one of these updates concernes the Update Agent), the Windows Updater could not work anymore. EVEN after unistalling the 2 most recent updates, it never worked again!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now what really bugs me is this: after the first installation I did (previous to the 26 of August, waay previous) I had no problem with updates, I managed to download and install all updates, the computer was up and running for a least 15 days (except no
 web connection via IE11, because of the CC problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Something happened at the 26/27 of August 2014 with Microsoft Update all over the world and Microsoft is not telling us what</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious is they were hacked and WU was corrupted, now all our machines are compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What say you?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for trying my friend, but I'm not going to do that since on my machine it has nothing to do with those updates.</p>

</p><p>Many are saying it works.</p>

            <p>I must be precisely that, to be going about windows still, with so many seamless alternatives these days. Not my choice though, I'm simply the only one who can look after some people over here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WU problem seems to be no more. I tried updating again this morning and this time it ran. Maybe you friends already fixed that IP/DNS confusion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's like my old man said, when nobody can help you, the simple passage of time itself will bring all the solutions to your problems. That is so very true with microsoft products.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: there is no <strong>downgrade</strong> involved. If you follow these steps, after doing that thing about UEFI changing to legacy BIOS, it's a clean install of Win7:&nbsp;</p>

 were the results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have an older version of Illustrator installed on my home PC, will I be able to transfer that same software over to the Pro?</p>

<p>Do a clean install of Windows. Registry cleaners are snake oil and the one you used probably finished the job on an already-damaged Windows. If you need to retrieve data which didn't make it into your regular backups, pull the hard drive and connect it to
 a working computer with a USB drive adapter.</p>

<p>If your computer was taken down by the McAfee false positive (see link), fixing it requires you to either be able to get into Safe Mode or boot from an XP installation CD to the Recovery Console.</p>

<p>From what you have written, you're not going to be able to do either of these things. You will need to either get an XP CD (borrow or buy) or take the computer to a reputable local professional. Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.</p>
<p>If your original XP CD was a *retail* copy, you can contact Microsoft to get a replacement. If your original XP came preinstalled on your branded OEM computer (Dell, HP, Sony, etc.), contact the OEM to purchase recovery media. Support for OEM installs comes
 from the OEM and not Microsoft.</p>
<p>To request replacement hardware or software, contact the Microsoft Supplemental Parts team. You must be in possession of the product (if it is damaged or defective) and be able to provide proof of purchase. The customer service representative will advise
 you of any replacement costs or shipping and handling fees that may be charged. If a product is no longer under warranty, the replacement item may no longer be available.<br />
