<h2>            JUNE 2015 -- Windows 8.1 Keeps minimizing apps after previous update. Will not allow new update to install.</h2>
                    I know this has been asked before, but nothing has been recent. It has all been from earlier in the year and last year.<br />
I tried some of the suggestions made in these posts, such as creating anew user, uninstalling updates, and also trying to switch to the app using task manager, but have had no success.<br />
<br />
After my windows 8.1 pc updated earlier this month, it started minimizing my netflix app. At first, I thought it was the netflix app, so I uninstalled, and then reinstalled it. But it didn't fix it.<br />
<br />
I then had opened my mail app, some time later, and had the same problem.<br />
<br />
I then opened other apps, and seen that they were all launching and minimizing...<br />
<br />
When I try to click on them on the desktop taskbar, they will maximize for a brief moment, and then minimize.<br />
<br />
If I try to swipe from the left, to switch to them. Windows tells me it has no apps to switch to.<br />
<br />
This is only happening on the apps. Any application that I run from desktop is working just fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
My pc has since been trying to update to another released update, but it keeps failing. It says that it can not complete the update.<br />
<br />
I am almost certain this problem occured with the previous windows update as I have not installed anything else on my computer around the time the problems started.

<p>&nbsp;Microsoft launcher is worse than &nbsp;a f'n virus. &nbsp;seems Microsoft knows all about installing it but when users want to uninstall it "they don't know nothing about birthing no uninstall babies".</p>

            Hi Yesenia, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend repairing the Photos app, which usually resolves issues like this. Here are the steps you can follow:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "apps &amp; features".
<br />- Select Apps &amp; Features.
<br />- Find the Photos app in the list and select it.
<br />- Click Advanced Options
<br />- Click Repair.
<br />
<br />This should fix the issue. If it doesn't, you could try resetting the Photos app, which will completely revert it back to it's original, unused state. Make sure you've backed up anything you need from the Photos app before resetting it.
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "apps &amp; features".
<br />- Select Apps &amp; Features.
<br />- Find the app in the list and select it.
<br />- Click Advanced Options
<br />- Click Reset.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hello Yesenia_766,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Photos app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi Yesenia.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try to Reset and Repair Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try reinstalling the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
<br />Please do not mark "No" to the popup asking if this post helped you, as it will remove my ability to help you further.  Just ignore it until problem is solved.

    <title>Surface Keyboard and touchpad are not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuckvan de vlasakker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Keyboard and touchpad are not working</h2>
                    <p>Dear all. the strangest thing happened to me yesterday. The Surface Keyboard and touchpad suddenly stopped working (also Bluetooth connected mice). I already established it is not hardware related. We have two Surface Books here and the Surface Base functions
 with other Surface Books and not a single Surface Book Base function with the aforementioned Surface Book. The Strangest thing is that the Keyboard light are working properly (I cannot dim them), they turn on when I hit the touchpad or a key. The Detach Button
 is also working properly, the Surface is charging and NVIDIA GPU is also working properly. The USB ports of the Base are also NOT functioning. So, the problem must be firmware/software related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager (touch is still working) I can see a little yellow triangle. Besides that, the keyboard is now listed under 'Other Devices' with a bunch of 'HID-Compliant' hardware and 'Unknown Devices'</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Cleaning the connectors (the problem is NOT hardware related)</p>
<p>- Running the Surface Diagnostics Tool (found noting)</p>
<p>- Checking the Windows Update (I'm on the latest version)</p>
<p>- Entering the BIOS and exiting again as suggested in other topics (no luck)</p>
<p>- Disable and enable the Surface Base in the BIOS and rebooting (no luck)</p>
<p>- Removing the Keyboard in Device manager and adding in various ways such as rebooting, adding the drivers manually or with the Surface Firmware pack (no luck)</p>
<p>- Detaching and attaching the keyboard (no luck)</p>
<p>- Rebooting with base/without base (no luck)</p>
<p>- Reinstall Windows (without keeping files, with the integrated Windows function as the USB ports are not working)</p>
<p>- Waiting and do nothing (of course, no luck)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at the end of my wits here. I have the i7, 16gb, with the discrete NVIDIA GPU. This is the only Computer I own (the other one is my sons) and now it is a really power, but quite useless tablet.</p>

<p>Today I called with Microsoft Netherlands and they provided a fix for me that worked. I don't know exactly why it worked but it does. The only thing is that you loose you programs, my data remained intact, so don't need to worry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the fix (it can take around 30 minutes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Windows Defender Security Centre -&gt; Device Performance &amp; Health</p>
<p>
</p><p>There you see "Fresh Start", click on additional info and use the "Fresh Start" and use this option.</p>
<p>Don't ask me why this option works and reinstalling Windows doesn't, but it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if it worked for you.</p>

            Hi UnlikelyMoniker 
<br />
<br />Are you signed up to the Windows 10 Insider Program, because 1903 has not been released to the general public yet, it is due for release in a couple of weeks . . .
<br />
<br />The Insider preview of version 1903, is compatible with some PC's while other architectures have been blocked by Microsoft until some bugs are resolved in that update, however the error you are seeing is not typical in this situation . . .
<br />
<br />With these insider builds, waiting seems to be the only way, that is the nature of being a Windows beta tester, the next build Microsoft release may install without issue on your PC . . .

            Currently 1903 is still on the Insider program &amp; hasn‚Äôt been released to the public.
<br />However this release has a new feature where it will fail to install if the user has any USB devices connected to the PC like external hard drives, if you have any of these connected then please disconnect them &amp; try again.

            The feature update that was released on June 11, 2019, fails on the second reboot. I can't find it in the Windows Update Catalog. In-place upgrade also fails.

            I agree with the June Post.&nbsp; The Windows 10 released 1903 I attempted to install on 7/13/2019 on an HP Envy desktop with an I7 and 16gb of RAM crashes on the reboot and is forced to remove the installed features and reset Windows to its previous state.&nbsp;
 I tried disconnecting external USB devices (except the mouse and keyboard, of course) as suggested in other posts and it makes no difference.&nbsp; I then also tried downloading the ISO version of this update and the exact same thing happened.&nbsp; Version 1903 has
 installed on several other machines in my house, including an HP laptop similarly configured.&nbsp; It also installed on two of the three machines I use at work, but failed on a 32" HP all-in-one desktop model.&nbsp; I don't know what models others are using who have
 reported this, but in my case, it appears related to at least some versions of the BIOS on HP systems.&nbsp; It would be nice if Microsoft would own this and give an ETA on a rebuild that works or test more tho

<p>I found the only thing that worked was to perform an In-Place upgrade. This procedure upgrades Windows without removing your files and programs. Instructions are here:&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing issues while removing the device from your Microsoft account as it keeps popping back after
 removing. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">t could be possible that the device was using OneDrive with the same Microsoft account and that might
 be the reason you are able to see the device listed under your profile. I would suggest you to remove the device from OneDrive and see if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can follow the steps to remove the device from OneDrive.</span></p>

<h3> ocman76  say:</h3>
<h2>            Age of Empires 3 Registry Question</h2>
                    I recently had to do a system recovery, which uninstalled Age Of Empires 3, which I had recently installed.&nbsp; I have lost my Product key (dumb right) so I can't reinstall, but I have heard that I would still be able to find my product key in my Registry.&nbsp;
 However, I don't know anything about Binary or Hexidecimal ot anything like that, and the registry doesn't seem to simply list the product key in an entry, it seems to have translated it to something else.&nbsp; Could someone specify the exact registry entry that
 the product key is and explain how I can translate it?

<p>The system<strong> recovery</strong> i did cannot be undone I just found out, so I can't go back to when the game was installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation folder is completely gone.</p>

<p><span>In Remote Assistance, What is the time until expiration for an invitation when using Windows Vista? When using Windows XP?</span></p>

<p><br />
According to this FAQ&nbsp;the&nbsp;default for Vista is six hours.</p>

<p>For some reason I keep thinking the default for XP was 30 days but I could be wrong about that. Its been a long time since I used Remote Assistance with either&nbsp;XP or Vista...</p>

<p>I belive the only way to do that with Windows 7 is to either let the invitation expire (ie. the default is six hours)&nbsp;or to close the active Windows Remote Assistance window on the Novice computer (ie. the computer needing help) that is opened when you either
 create an invitation file or try to use Easy Connect.</p>

<p>Remember the Novice must agree to allowing the Expert to connect in the first place so you can always simply ignore any connection requests.</p>

    <title>Controller right stick turns to the right slowly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Controller right stick turns to the right slowly</h2>
                    
<p>Just what the title says. The right stick on my controller moves to the right slower for some reason. Do you guys have any possible solutions or similar issues on either stick? I started noticing it when I played Sunset. Titanfall not as much, but it's very
 obvious during Sunset. Can I still save this controller or is it doomed to suffer the slow turn stick of death?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give it a good cleaning. I am forbidden to tell you how, but you may find some useful info elsewhere online.
</p>
<p>What causes these issues is (food particles, oil from your hands etc) gets inside the shell and lodged under and around the 3d annolge assemblies. (thumbsticks) A good cleaning *could possibly solve your problem.
</p>
<p>I have had my 360 controller for over 5 years, and I clean it once a month and am surprized with what can find its way onto a controllers boards.</p>

<p>Nothing will fix it, its due to lack of quality put into controllers. Last gen I went through 4 , 4!!! controllers and I take care of my stuff to the letter. Nothing and I repeat nothing will fix it, the springs they use are utter garbage. Dont bother with
 Youtube tutorials, its a waste of time, trust me you have to buy a new one. This kind of thing really aggravates me and I see this gen will be no different.</p>

<p>Moi je cherche toujours des r√©ponses sur divers forums.Mes 2 manettes original de 360 son en parfait √©tat (5 ans d'usure).Pour les manettes de la One ou on nous dit qu'ils ont une dur√© de vie de 8 ans et bien j'ai des doutes.Moi et 2 copains avons le stick
 gauche qui est bousill√© en 1 ans,a intervalle de 2 et 3 semaine.Pour ma part 400hrs de jeu,hier un autre copain ma pret√© une de ses manettes pour d√©panner et le meme stick quand on tourne plusieurs cercle complet ressent un craquement a chaque passage a 4h...Je
 me pose de s√©rieuse question sur la durabillit√© des sticks de la manette One...Si vous avez des experiences avec les nouvelles manettes et leurs durabillit√© merci de partager.</p>

<p>I'm sorry Defy Lightning I should have been more specific,I bought a new 360 E last year and went through two controllers,previously I had never gone through a 360 controller since the 360 came out so I don't know if it was the E controllers or just bad
 luck.My XB1 controller is working fine which came with the system</p>

<p>It's impossible to try to answer a question these days w/o being riddiculed or possibly even banned.
</p>
<p>Yes sir. You are correct about the spring being weak, however they don't break and so when you properly flush out the buildup UNDER/AROUND them, they will often work again.
</p>
<p>Think about it.. Everytime you click a thumbstick with buildup under/around it you are worping that spring.

            Hi Robert, 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />This would be the preferred option!
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi Robert.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 update catastrophic failure  - system files are missing</h2>
                    <p>I'm (actually was) running Windows 10 build 1703. Since beginning Windows 10 upgrade did not work on my machine, always failed during update to new version beginning with Windows 7 to 10 update. Everything was working fine after fresh install of given version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Windows always failed to update I choosed to defer functional updates for as long as possible which is 365 days. It was working perfectly until today when it decided to upgrade to 1709. I did not notiece that when restarting as I thought it's simple security
 update. As always it restarted, booted to update subsystem, then failed, went to restoring previous version but could not start system again. Common problem with missing winload.exe. It happened to me before, fixing BCD always helped so I tried it this time
 as well. The problem is that everything with BCD was fine and despite trying different thing I could not boot this system. Finally I checked if this file actually exists and it turns out it disappeared along with all system files from system32 as well as SysWOW64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First question is HOW IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE? I have 1433 files there and most of them look like drivers or other application libraries. Winload.exe is missing and it looks like much more is missing. File listing here:</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/t/s!AhqjjqCRmeVokvNR8OqS2Y6ASAdGGw</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is windows update log but I don't see any meaningful information there:</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhqjjqCRmeVokvNQ6zonbiaDb62ESw<br />
</p>
<p>I tried to run SFC but it does not recognize it as system and fails with "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service" message. No logs generated.</p>
<p>DISM on the other hand failed with:</p>
<p>Error: 50</p>
<p>DISM does not support servicing a Windows Vista RTM or earlier operating system.</p>
<p>If the operating system is supported check that SSShim.DLL is present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, SSShim.DLL is also missing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there any option to recover such system? Is there any backup made by windows update before replacing this files? I had backup drive which somehow failed and has completely broken filesystem, so I have no external backup right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed another copy of Windows on this machine but configuring it will take ages and I'd rather get back to my previous installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is desktop PC</p>
<p>Motherboard: ASUS P6T</p>
<p>CPU: Xeon X5670</p>
<p>It does not support UEFI. Previously I had system installed on MBR 120GB SSD, then I switched to GPT for system drive and bootloader is placed on different drive with MBR so it can start without using EFI. I know that small SSD on MBR and lack of EFI is
 most probably reason for failures before but I did not have such failure before.</p>

<p><span>Hi Maciej,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We see that the mother board which you are using is not compatible with Windows 10. However, you have performed force installation due to which
 some of features and driver software were not supported, which in turn caused the failure in update. Now as mentioned by you that you have installed Windows freshly, you will not be able to go back to previous installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I installed new Windows instance (version 1803) on different hard drive so I still have old one available. I have option to boot either of them but older one is corrupt and unable to properly boot because of missing files.</p>
<p>Anyways, I understand that hardware incompatibility can cause problems with updates but it should not cause such failure anyways. Most of the times if it wanted to update, then it failed and reverted to previous version without any problem (sometimes just
 corrupting BCD which was quick fix).</p>
<p>Also, is there any way of disabling functional updates completely? Regular updates (mostly security) are fine, I only have problems with updating to new Windows revision. I can only see option to disable it for one year but in this case 1703 was so old,
 it forced to update to 1709 anyways.</p>

            Hi , this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

Yes, you migrate to it for free as long as its the edition.

With the release of Windows 10 November Update (1511), and later versions such as the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (1607), you can switch directly to a 64 bit version of Windows 10 with or without a product key.

Switching to Windows 10 64 bit is free, you don't have to pay for it. As long as you have a qualifying Windows 7 or 8 or Windows 10 license, you are entitled to use it.
Switching requires that you perform a new installation, that means files, applications and settings will be deleted.
You will have to reinstall applications and native 64 bit drivers.
Backup before migrating: How to: Create a system image in Windows 10

Step 1: Download Windows 10 64 bit then create a bootable copy:

<h2>            Copy or Transfer Entire Surface Pro 3 to New Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know the best way to transfer EVERYTHING on my Surface Pro 3 to a new 2017 Surface Pro. I want to transfer all my files, photos, videos and programs for which I may or may not still have the activation key(s). Of course, they must be functional...
 I had heard about a way to connect 2 Surface tablets together with USB to USB cable but can't find that informaiton again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas??</p>
<p>
