<h2>            Bing Ads robbed me - &#36;500 spent in 3 days on a new imported unauthourised ad imported from Google hitting a 404 page&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I may be forced to close shop should I fail to get resolution on this issue caused by Bing!&nbsp; I decided to start 2019 using Bing Ads for AfricansAttire.com since we realised a huge potentia narket in Europe for our clothes and most users in Europe use Bong
 and Yahoo which are the same platform. I did not knowi was digging my own grave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I registered my account with all details including my banking details on 25 December 2018.</p>
<p>2. I then saw an option to import ads from my Googles ads and O got excited.</p>
<p>3. I clicked import ads from google a lengthy process that took a while and I totally forgot about it since i was confident no ad will run without my authourisation just like on the mighty Google</p>
<p>4. Nightmare comes 05 January 2019 my bank account is empty and am failing to fullfil my customers orders</p>
<p>5. Investigtion shows that Bing charged my account in excess of $200 a day since 26 December 2018</p>
<p>5. Now I am in Limbo because my annual marketing budget was swallowed without any returns. The imported ad needed tweeking and I was charged $500 for 3 days an anount less than my prevous year's marketinh budget on Google.</p>

<h2>            ALL files dissapared after uninstalling Lavasoft Adaware and Web Companion</h2>
                    <p>My laptop was very slow and I noticed that Lavasoft Web Companion was running in Task Manager (I always see that, but it never would shot down).&nbsp;<br />
So I uninstalled first Lavasoft Adaware Antivirus and then the Web Companion. Hoping that pc would run faster.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As I am opening Outlook to check mail - it could not find the .pst file. ???<br />
Tried to see how much disk was left and saw that it was all empty. (???) And I have 1TB and are always struggling with nearly full.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am not a pc guy but know for sure that I did not delete or format the disk.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And this just happened in few minutes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What to do?<br />
<br />
Br, Frode Goa<br />

<br />
I am using online purchased outlook 2016.&nbsp;<br />
I have tried restarting and reinstalling the two programs. No luck.&nbsp;<br />
I have been chatting with microsoft support for many hours - no luck.&nbsp;<br />

I can not believe that I am the only person who have this issue. That Lavasoft Web Companion was installed without my knowledge on my pc.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi there &amp; thank you for trying to help,
<div>First please excuse my lack of computer knowledge, every bit I do understand Is self taught.</div>
<div>The lock with a yellow triangle Is appearing In the search bar, not all the time, only on certain sites, It started on mail, then It appears, On sites that I have Accounts on, such as mail order, my facebook page Is the latest that was today, so Im not
 using It.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Im not able to open certain emails, such as Ebay or any that I hold accounts with, I had a look at the Norton security site, just to see If I could find anything about this sign &amp; the sign, appeared there,</div>
<div>when Iv clicked on the sign, It says something about the site can't be verified &amp; that It could be a made up page by a hacker to look like the real thing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Im not sure how to send you a picture, through my little knowledge &amp; would have to wait, till my</div>
<div>daughter, came In but hope you can sort of get the Idea.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanking you again :)<br />

            Sounds like this possibly might be last build 14383 before it goes gold. A couple of websites are reporting that build 14384 will be the anniversary build and will release to insiders end of next week unless unforeseen glitches occur. Build 14383 is being
 released before the weekend so Microsoft gets telemetry and feedback before they release final build.

<p>Dona had mentioned they were getting ready the last couple days, that's why we didn't get a new build till today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned on my old laptop when I started the install on my Insiders PC, it is almost ready to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been keeping track of install times for the last few builds, my PC usually is in the 18/19 min range. I no longer have to wait for Homegroup, it joins right away now.</p>

            <p>Well if you search your issues you would find this as one of the sites called wiki. &nbsp;here is part of it just so you would know it's not a virus/malware site</p>
<p>
"Meaning of "0x801901f4"
</p><p>
"0x801901f4" is the error name that contains the details of the error, including why it occurred, which system component or application malfunctioned to cause this error along with some other information. The numerical code in the error name contains data that
 can be deciphered by the manufacturer of the component or application that malfunctioned. The error using this code may occur in many different locations within the system, so even though it carries some details in its name, it is still difficult for a user
 to pinpoint and fix the error cause without specific technical knowledge or appropriate software.</p>
Causes of "0x801901f4"
<p>
If you have received this error on your PC, it means that there was a malfunction in your system operation. Common reasons include incorrect or failed installation or uninstallation of software that may have left invalid entries in your Windows registry, consequences
 of a virus or malware attack, improper system shutdown due to a power failure or another factor, someone with little technical knowledge accidentally deleting a necessary system file or registry entry, as well as a number of other causes. The immediate cause
 of the "0x801901f4" error is a failure to correctly run one of its normal operations by a system or application component.</p>
Ways to repair "0x801901f4"
<p>
With this error, like with most system or application errors, the user is usually given the option to send an error report to the software publisher, which is a good way to help the publisher eliminate such errors in future software versions. For a more immediate
 fix, advanced PC users may be able to repair the error by manually editing the registry, and others may want to hire a technician to do it for them. However, since any manipulations with the Windows registry always carry a risk of rendering the operating system
 unbootable, whenever a user is in any doubt of their technical skills or knowledge, they should only use special software that is meant to repair the Windows registry without requiring any special skills from the user.</p>

<p>The error was not caused due to registry error and the program installs a bunch of unwanted software on your computer. If you were to do a registry fix&nbsp;I'd use Microsoft Fix it instead of an unknown 3rd-party program</p>

            Why not enable the mouse option to hide the cursor when you're typing?&nbsp; Find it in Control Panel.

            The error you describe is a problem with your web browser, not with Outlook, and the error and the solution have been posted here many, many times.&nbsp; See if this helps you:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/problems/link_restrict.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"This operation has

<p>
</p><p>With IMAP account, you'll not be able to sync the calendar and contact information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must use Outlook.com or an Exchange account in Outlook to sync the calendar data.</p>

            Hi sw,
<br />Contact groups are mixed in with the contacts in Outlook desktop software - look for them in the contacts folder.  They will be bolded - if you use a list view (like phone list) you can sort by the icon field to sort lists together. 
<br />
<br />PS. If you receive an email with a phone # to call, don't call it. It's a spammer.       
        </p>

<p>Thanks, Diane. I have 8,000 contacts so it's a painful process. Also, it appears that I'm only seeing some of my contacts in the List view.</p>
<p>

            BTW, that link you found is for Office Groups, not Contacts Groups. 
<br />
<br />Sort by the icon and it should bring the groups to the top (or bottom). 
<br />
<br />Does the status bar say there are 8000 in the folder (its in the lower left corner of outlook.)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6368d4e-c968-4c03-979e-0091f6c932df?upload=true" />

 2007 version on Excel it doesn't give me the option to save all of the open documents, rather I have to save each one individually. Is there a way to save all of them at once when clicking the "X" instead of one by one?

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>The Save All is not available, via the user interface in 2007, it is also no longer available in 2003 (all patches installed).</p>
<p>However a rather dangerous altenative is to use Close All, and rely on Excel prompting you to save any unsaved work in the files as they close.&nbsp; Close all isn't normally available but you can add it to the Quick Access Toolbar, its listed under All Commands.&nbsp;
 See this link for details on cusomising the tool bar</p>

<h2>            Drive which contained my upgraded version of windows 10 tech preview crashed</h2>
                    <p>I tried everything I know to recover the drive, including resetting the windows install. No luck, so&nbsp;I downloaded the current version of windows and installed onto a new drive. Is there anyway to recover the product key that was used with this machine? Do
 I have to purchase a new version of windows? That would not be ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There used to be a number to call. Does Win 10 have customer service reps that can reissue a number?</p>

            <p>At the time of the W10 initial release it was possible to upgrade to the release version from within the insider program without having to use W7 or 8.1.&nbsp; To do this, you needed to have an activated version of 10240 and then use the Media Creation Tool on
 W10 itself to create the DVD or USB media and upgrade 10240 to the release version outside of the Insider program. After this, the DVD/USB media could be used for clean installs (I've done 2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem for a lot of people was obtaining the activated 10240 from the previous insider versions. In fact I needed to go back to an activated disc image of 10130 to achieve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Older insider versions have now expired and the only way of getting an activated release W10 is via W7/8.1. I have to say though that in the event of any failure, there is no substitute for disc image and data back ups.</p>

<p>Hi ArunKumarKak,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, we only see the Task Manager interface. May I know if the Outlook client and the Excel hang or crash?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check if the problem is related to the Office applications, please run&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool</a>&nbsp;to scan Outlook, Excel and use the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Quick

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please tell us the following information:</p>
<p>1. The detailed version of the Office client.</p>
<p>2. Do you see any error message when the Office clients hang?</p>
<p>3. Do any other users in your organization encounter the same problem?</p>

<p>Many thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, you are unable to use the top menu option in the Outlook client. Like the left part of the screenshot you shared.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please kindly try the steps I mentioned and let us know the updates when you have time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to open same file twice simultaneously in excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikunjgupta  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to open same file twice simultaneously in excel 2013</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I have a model that I need to run with multiple parameters. Hence I wanted to open two sessions of excel and run the model in them simultaneously.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Excel 2010 it was possible to open two seperate sessions of excel and have each session open the same file. When I try to do that in Excel 2013 it does not allow me but asks if I would like to reopen the file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can save the model as 2 seperate names but that does not work as if I run one version and then try to edit another excel file at the same time the VBA code gives me an error. Seems I need two unlinked sessions of Excel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would anyone know how to open two seperate sessions in Excel 2013 each with the same file open but behaving independent of each other.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards</div>
<div>Nick</div>
                </div>

            Hi - I tried this, but it did not work. And furthermore running macros startet to give "already open" errors.<br />
Howe er, there seems to be something wrong in the steps described: In step 8 we start to repeat the procedure just performed for Excel.Sheet.12 on Excel.Sheet.<u><b>8</b></u>.<br />
However, in step 9 and onwards, it is Excel.Sheets.12 that are mentioned again. However steps 9-13 was already done in steps 3-7.<br />
When I tried this, I used Excel.Sheet.<u><b>8</b></u> in steps 9-13 instead of Excel.Sheet<b>.</b>12.<br />
Can you try to fix the step descriptions?<br />
BTW, there is also a Excel.Sheet.5 folder and possibly more, don't remember). Should they also be modified?<br />
<br />

            Just found a completely different way, that requires no registry hacking.<br />
As noted in <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2013/02/07/open-multiple-excel-files-in-separate-windows-and-view-them-side-by-side.aspxhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2013/02/07/open-multiple-excel-files-in-separate-windows-and-view-them-side-by-side.aspx</a>&nbsp; you can get truly independent instances of Excel by
<b><u>holding down Alt-x while you open the second instance</u></b>. This second instance will be able to open an identically named file!<br />
Workd for me :-)<br />

            Thank you for the reply but it does not work. It opens the file while closing the one that is opened. I tried tracing the url link you posted but it must be missing something or its now down. If there is a step by step process that you followed, I'd appreciate
 lnowing it. But I had the file open, went to the folder where it is located, while holding ALT-x down, double clicked, then tried right clicking and selecting open and the same thing happened.

                    Windows 8.1
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think that I deleted all the program files for web cake, Babylon toolbars, vgrabber and similar ones. event those hidden in temporary folders.</div>
<div>several scaners (microsoft, panda, ccleaner, malwarebytes..) &nbsp;told me that the pc is clean</div>
<div>then I looked in regedit and saw several keys still refering to those programs and others like zoomit which I had uninstalled</div>
<div>&nbsp;then I ran Adwcleaner and found many keys refering to the unwanted programs, I just dared to delete a few ones.</div>
<div>then I had the upgrade from windows 8 to windows 8.1 (does this correct the registry?)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I try to run the brand new version of Adwcleaner (downloaded from&nbsp;<span>http://general-</span><span>changelog</span><span>-team.fr (not the mirror from CNET, as some users have doubts on&nbsp;</span><span>whether</span><span>&nbsp;they
 got&nbsp;</span><span>infected</span><span>&nbsp;there), but now I get so strong warnings from&nbsp;</span><span>WOT</span><span>&nbsp;about the website,&nbsp;</span><span>and</span><span>&nbsp;from&nbsp;</span><span>Microsoft against running the last version of Adwcleaner that I doubt.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>is http://general-</span><span>changelog</span><span>-team.fr more trustworthy than CNET?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Should I not run&nbsp;</span>Adwcleaner?</div>

<div>Another better way to clean the registry of the obvious references to wholly &nbsp;uninstalled (I believe) malware?</div>

<br />
Most of the well known specialized tools we use as malware fighters, including AdwClearner, are written by experts/Security Colleagues at various security forums like Bleeping Computer, TechSupport, GeeksToGo, SypwareInfo and other similar sites so they can
 be trusted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, many of these tools (or their embedded files) are repeatedly falsely detected by various anti-virus programs from time to time. This sometimes results in an inaccurate site rating/warning of potentially dangerous software when that is not
 the case.</p>

<h2>            Volume Sliders Missing Build 9926</h2>
                    Sound and everything works on my computer. I can even access sounds settings from the New Control Panel, but the volume slider does NOT appear in my system tray. I tried to see if it was turned on/off in the notification settings, but it's greyed out.&nbsp;
 Any ideas?<br />

                    Tethering not working on my phone if I put my sim card in my 521 tethering works but not in my 1320 is this a know bug? Is there a fix or do I have a bad sim or a broken phone?

<p>The SIM is unlocked, the 1320 is still the orginal carriers phone. It is expecting teathering settings from the original carrier, not T-Mobile.</p>

<p>No, it's a generic <strong>L</strong>a<strong>T</strong>in <strong>A</strong>merica version, so it is carrier unlocked out of the box.</p>

<p>I would guess that for some reason the phone is not picking up the settings automatically from the SIM.</p>

            While we are just guessing I believe it's a bug.<br />
t-mobile tech support has said I have a plan that supports tethering but the phone will not start internet sharing. Sending me to T-Mobile's website which has no option to up sell me hotspot tethering as I already have it. I suspect even a hotspot selling event
 may not fix the bug

    <title>Formula for greater than and less than time intervals - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Formula for greater than and less than time intervals</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need a formula to determine yes/no answers to greater than and less than time intervals.</p>
<p>Column I is formatted in Custom Time h:mm:ss. Most of the times in Column I will be in seconds; there may be some that are 1 minute or more.<br />
Using I2 as an example, I need&nbsp;the following&nbsp;formulas (I will the copy the formula for the remaining cells in column I):<br />
<br />
(1) if I2 &gt; than 2 seconds but &lt; 5 seconds, "yes", otherwise "no"<br />
(2) if I2 =&gt; 5 seconds but &lt; 10 seconds, "yes", otherwise "no"<br />
<br />
My&nbsp;=IF(AND( .... formula&nbsp;isn't working and I'm missing a piece that I can't seem to figure out.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Elsa<br />
&nbsp;</p>
