            Hi Diana
<br />
<br />Start your Device
<br />
<br />On the manufacturers logo screen you need to repeatedly press the appropriate key to access BIOS
<br />
<br />Typically that key is F2, though on HP systems that is F10 and on other systems, that may be the Del key
<br />
<br />On the Manufacturers screen, it should indicate the appropriate key to enter Setup . ..

    <title>Xbox One Elite controller is not worth the money and my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinw101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Elite controller is not worth the money and my issue&#38;&#35;39&#59;s with Microsoft&#38;&#35;39&#59;s policies regarding it.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Note: I am posting this because tech support has not helped me. I want answers about why both the quality and warranty are so utterly lacking on Microsoft's most expensive "Accessory" yet. Please put yourself in my shoes, and
 try to imagine the immense frustration and utter lack of assistance I am receiving.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>If you want to read my proposed solution, skip ahead to the last paragraph.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>So recently I purchased a brand new Elite controller from game stop for around $220, since the controller does not have a rechargeable battery for some unknown reason. I made this decision for three reasons. One: I was under
 the impression that I had a year long warranty on the device, which I learned alter was not the case, but more on that subject later. Two: The normal controller quality is utterly abysmal compared to what we've come to expect from the industry. Three: I am
 a competitive Halo player, and I need quality controllers that feature paddles. Normally I buy from third party developers like Scuff, but I figured "Eh, it's microsoft, they must offer the best quality.&nbsp;<strong>Especially when considering the price tag</strong>."
 So I bought the controller. Day one out of the box I was already disappointed to find out that I needed to fork over additional money for a battery pack, which I did, because "eh, it's Microsoft. This should be the last money I have to put into a controller
 for a long time."</span></p>
<p><span>My friends called me a moron for buying such an expensive controller. I told them I have been a long time customer and that Microsoft would never give a "screw you" to long time customers. I mean, after all, they were the ones
 who helped finance Halo 2, the game of my childhood.</span></p>
<p><span>Flash forward&nbsp;<strong>FIVE MONTHS</strong>. No, not one year, not a decade, only FIVE MONTHS LATER, and my controller busts. Now you're first thought is probably "be more careful bro, don't drop it," and normally I'd completely
 agree with you. I think the attitude of entitlement in America is completely disastrous, but I can confirm that I've not only never dropped this controller, but that I've never even touched the thing if I so much had a crumb upon my hand. I've given more care
 and attention to this controller than most people give to their controller for Pete's sake!</span></p>
<p><span>The actual issue was simply. I was off fighting Oryx in Destiny, and was planning on going for Onyx on Halo 5 slayer afterwards, when suddenly I heard a strange clicking noise in my controller. Curious, I examined it. The issue
 soon became apparent. The right bumper was loose, and I could tell&nbsp;<strong>something internal had broken</strong>. No biggie, I wasn't worried due to the fact that I just had to call Microsoft and grab a new controller. I didn't even leave my raid! A quick
 google search confirmed that I was not the only one with this problem, but that I was one of dozens!&nbsp;<strong>This was not a simple one and done error, but rather a malfunction deserving of a factory recall</strong>. I was significantly perturbed, and for good
 reason, but I still knew I had my warranty to fall back on, and those online said that the warranty covered the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the raid, which was incredibly annoying to run without my melee, I had to cancel my Halo game play due to the issue. Well that stinks for my teammates, but what can you do right? I started an online chat and was met by
 a nice lady who could barely type. I can officially say that this was the first time I had trouble understanding tech support over an online chat. Oh well. I quickly explained the situation, and waited about fifteen minutes. The lady responded with a quick
 apology,&nbsp;<strong>explaining that the warranty only covered controllers that come with the elite console,&nbsp;</strong>and that they could not except the controller back.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I silently screamed at them, but politely signed off, thanking them for the support before coming back onto the forums to write about my experiences. Not only did I learn that they offered a measly 3 month support plan, less
 than most next gen games bought through gamestop, but that the issue, which clearly was a manufacturing issue, was my problem, and that they wouldn't do anything about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Looks like my friends were right. Microsoft really did just screw me over.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>My solution:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>First off, we the community need a formal apology for this inexcusable abuse of trust. More practically though, we need year long warranties, and support for the issue of bumpers dislodging. This is not one or two people, this
 is a widespread problem, and must be officially addressed. I read a reddit post where the poster only received an official response after a bandwagon of people responded angry comments towards microsoft. Listen, I'm no genius, but if I talk to ten people who
 are even considering to buy the elite controller, and I tell them of my issues,&nbsp;<strong>that will cost Microsoft $1500 dollars.</strong>&nbsp;I'm no math genius, but I think it'd be cheaper just to give me a new controller.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><strong>How to make it right with me:&nbsp;</strong>As a consumer, I feel as though I have been abused. I want a new controller, and an apology not only for the pathetic support and warranty, but for the hours I have spent on tech
 support trying to resolve the issue. If Microsoft doesn't fix this situation in a way that satisfies me, as well as it's customers, I will have no choice but to leave. Me and several good friends have already discussed PC gaming, and now it seems that Microsoft
 has put the final nail into it's xbox shaped coffin.<strong>&nbsp;I am begging Microsoft to fix this situation, but I fear that they&nbsp;simply&nbsp;do not value their customers.</strong></span></p>

<p>Glad to see someone else feeling more than a little annoyed at the lack of support for a premium product.</p>
<p>I've been browsing the forums for the last couple weeks to see what other solution was being offered by Microsoft regarding an issue that way too many are having with the bumper buttons on the Elite, but every single response has been once it's past the
 90 days warranty the only solution is to spend another $150 to replace the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>defective</strong></span> controller.</p>
<p>Surely by now someone at Microsoft has been made aware of the number of people reporting the exact same issue over and over again in that the plastic tab holding the bumper button in place is breaking just under normal wear and tear.</p>
<p>Since apparently the only way I can get a replacement for my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>defective</strong></span> Elite is to spend the money to buy a new premium controller, but this is one consumer who won't be buying another&nbsp;Elite controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, Microsoft has lost a customer, while Scruf more than like will have gained one.</p>
<p>In addition, I plan on going back to my on-line review of the controller that I made not long after I purchased it and will be updating it to reflect the current situation that the bumper buttons have a good possibility of breaking, leaving the gamer out
 in the cold and the only solution offered by MS to resolve the issue is to buy a new Elite.</p>
<p>Will be interesting to see how people who buy the GoW 4 special edition of the Elite ($200) react when they too encounter the same issue as many have with the standard Elite..</p>

<h2>            wedge touch mouse intermittently stops working</h2>
                    <p>This is so frustrating and I see that I'm not the only one. I'm running Windows 8 (64-bit) on Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch. I installed the latest version of the Mouse and Keyboard Center (2.1.177) (even uninstalled and reinstalled).&nbsp; But occasionally,
 the mouse stops responding.&nbsp; Sometime it comes back to life but other times, it doesn't come back until I reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I've found. I haven't been able to recreate it every time but every time it dies, I'm doing the same thing, which happens to be: scrolling through a web page in Firefox (20.0.1) using the scroll bar and I have the mouse left clicked holding and
 moving the page down. Then the mouse stops responding and I'm stuck. But it does leave the page as if the left-button still pressed such that when I go and to use my TouchPad, the page moves up and down until I click on it to release the left click left by
 the now dead mouse.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the mouse sometimes comes back after a few minutes, other times, it's unusable until I reboot.</p>
<p><br />
Is this a hardware defect or a software driver problem?&nbsp; Can someone please provide some useful suggestions?&nbsp; Thank you in advance!</p>

Try using Sleep instead of Restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Less disruptive and you will still get drivers restarted.</p>

<p><br />
This ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch laptop&nbsp;is brand new and I just purchased the Wedge mouse. There are no other third party mouse software other than the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am finding unknown&nbsp;device with no driver when I run the hardware troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting intermittent disconnections in every app but reconnects right away (seems like something runs in the background that hold it up?).&nbsp; But for some strange reason when I use the scroll bar for extended time, it doesn't reconnect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think this is a defective mouse? Do you think the Bluetooth driver for the X1 Carbon is problematic?&nbsp; What else can I try?&nbsp; I suppose I can ditch the Wedge Mouse and get a different one.&nbsp; Any suggestions on an alternative?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Happened again just now. I was in Outlook scrolling through a list of emails (left button pressed down) and then a meeting reminder popped up (not sure if it was coincidence) and lost connection. When I moved the cursor using my TouchPad, it looks like
 the Windows still thinks the left button is pressed.&nbsp; I turned off the mouse this time and turn it back on and it connected. No need to reboot.

            My X1 Carbon does pretty much the same thing with the exception that the mouse always comes back after about ten seconds. It just stops. I use the touchpad on the notebook during those times, but it is quite annoying. Other than this, the Wedge Mouse is
 nice from a size perspective, although I'm still getting used to the scrolling.<br />
<br />
The X1 Carbon is running W7.<br />
<br />
1) Are Wedge Mice defective?<br />
2) Is it the Bluetooth connection, and if so on the X1 Carbon side or the Wedge Mouse side?<br />

            Same setup (X1 carbon touch &amp; Wedge mouse). Sometimes it helps to hit the Windows button twice (go to start screen and back). Other times i have to restart the machine. Could it be the lenovo touchpad/trackpoint drivers causing problems?

            <blockquote>Other times i have to restart the machine. </blockquote>
<p><br />
Instead of doing a full reboot try putting it to Sleep and waking it again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the same problem occasionally with my Touch screen and that procedure resets its driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Could it be the lenovo touchpad/trackpoint drivers causing problems?
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Yes.&nbsp; In fact, you might even get a clue about that in the Event log.&nbsp;&nbsp; There may even be some additional diagnostics in the driver (possibly only accessible via a reg hack) which could be turned on to supplement that information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW this reminds me that this is something that I always think about doing for my case with my Touch screen driver but still haven't done, so thanks for the nudge.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Good luck</p>

<h2>            &#60;Disk Read Error&#62; will not load. &#47; Windows 10 &#47; usb repair utility</h2>
                    <p>Without warning, (no crashes,freezes or weird noises from C Drive) &nbsp;Windows will not load. Error Message at bios:
<strong>VERIFYING DMI POOL DATA........ DISK READ ERROR...PRESS CTRL-ALT-DELETE TO CONTINUE</strong>. Drive is a little less than 3 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On first attempt after restart, I briefly saw a blue windows screen with a windows 10 font, something like ' there was a problem restarting your PC, sending error report.' I had turned away momentarily, machine triggered a restart before I could glean anything
 else from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time after that, no Windows. DISK READ ERROR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very limited budget and resources, and I am unsure if this is a Motherboard issue, a croaked C drive, or &nbsp;Windows problem. need a plan of attack to diagnose the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have avoided panicky stabs in the dark, as i did not want further complicate the issue. I contacted the mobo manufacturer, and there are no updates to the bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely locked out of my machine, so i will not be able to provide much in the way of specs</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Good News: I had windows backup dumping my critical files, system files and program files to an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 repair utility loaded unto a USB drive. &nbsp;I tried one of the troubleshoot options, but it did not help. I see that there is a command prompt available under advanced options on the repair utility, which may yield more sophisticated options.
 Will need step by step guidance with commands if thats where this is headed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the drive cannot be revived will need a solid B plan. This will probably mean a new drive and a fresh install of windows 10. I do not have a license key for win10, I upgraded from win8 as soon as win10 became available. (again, locked out, so i wont be
 able to access a license or serial)<br />

            <p>Thanks for following up. Best that we can suggest is to have your disk drive checked by your local OEM to diagnose it and see if it can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to worry about installing Windows 10, as long as you have your Windows 8 product key. Once your system reads your product key and have successfully installed Windows 8, you can immediately go to System Update to get Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has given my computer multiple personalities</h2>
                    <p>I was a happy windows 7 Professional user and I upgraded to Windows 10. I have had a number of problems that seem to indicate that my&nbsp;computer now has multiple personalities.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I use an Office365 account provided by my school. I used this account when upgrading my computer to Windows 10. Windows 10's mail client shows the email address but it shows it as a personal account. None of my email is received on the personal&nbsp;account
 but I can send. in order to view email I have received I have to open a browser and log into Office365.
</li><li>I also Microsoft Office on my computer which includes Microsoft outlook. After upgrading to Windows 10, opening Outlook in the standard way behaves as if I were opening it for the first time and wants me to setup an email account. I have&nbsp;seven email addresses
 that I use with&nbsp;Outlook for various purposes and organizations. NONE of my accounts appeared in Outlook after&nbsp;upgrading. However, If I open Outlook as an administrator, All my accounts are&nbsp;intact. Now if I want to open Outlook, I have to perform extra clicks
 so all of my email accounts will work. </li><li>Google Chrome will not&nbsp;open at all unless I open it as an administrator. I tried reinstalling this program and nothing changed. Again, all of my saved passwords,&nbsp;favorites and history are in tact only if I use it as an administrator.
</li><li>Programs such as StarCraft and Paint Shop Pro, an older art program which I still use frequently,&nbsp;&nbsp;also behaved as if&nbsp;they were never run on my computer&nbsp;after the upgrade. It asked for the original program&nbsp;CD (which had been updated several times).&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly,
 In the first few days I didn't have the CD&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Paint Shop&nbsp;worked after going through the failed reinstallation. I found the original cd and fixed that problem with a reinstall but why did Windows 10 force me to do that?
</li></ul>
<div>
<p>So now my computer has split personalities, the same Microsoft email address works differently in different locations, my old email seems to be tucked away under a separate administrator personality, and standard programs I have used frequently in the past
 behave as if they are not fully installed on my computer .... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to fix this without destroying the patient (format/reinstall of the O/S). any thoughts?</p>

    <title>Cannot RDP to specific host in specific subnet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b7_057  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot RDP to specific host in specific subnet</h2>
                    <p>This issue is ripping me a new one so I'd really appreciate any help...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Layout:<br />
<br />
desk and test are on subnet 1<br />
frank is on subnet 2<br />
vpn is on its own subnet but is passed subnet 1 in the vpn config (handled by router)</p>
<p>
</p><p>all are windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is full routing between subnets (pass all traffic)<br />
ping works to all hosts, telnet over 3389 works to all hosts, TightVNC works, just rdp is acting up<br />
window firewall is completely off on frank, desk, and test<br />
<br />
test is a completely fresh install of windows with all updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is no windows domain or anything and all computers are in "WORKGROUP"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>rdp testing table:<br />
<br />
_from_ -&gt; _to_ _result_<br />
desk -&gt; test<span> </span>yes<br />
desk -&gt; frank<span> </span>no "the logon attempt failed"<br />
<br />
frank -&gt; test<span> </span>yes<br />
frank -&gt; desk<span> </span>yes<br />
<br />
test -&gt; desk<span> </span>yes<br />
test -&gt; frank<span> </span>no "connects and show lockscreen but says 'username or passowrd is incorrect try again'"<br />
<br />
vpn -&gt; desk<span> </span>yes<br />
vpn -&gt; frank<span> </span>yes<br />
vpn -&gt; test<span> </span>yes<br />
<br />
keep in mind telnet 3389 works even when rdp doesn't<br />
<br />
for some reason frank is the only one that others cannot connect TO (it can connect to others) and for some reason vpn clients are able to connect to frank.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
On frank when I attempt to connect from desk/test I sometimes get the following error in frank's event log:<br />
<br />
A CredSSP authentication to TERMSRV/&lt;desk/test ip&gt; failed to negotiate a common protocol version.&nbsp; The remote host offered version 4 which is not permitted by Encryption Oracle Remediation.<br />
<br />
Microsoft recommends this page:<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4093492/credssp-updates-for-cve-2018-0886-march-13-2018<br />
<br />
Based on the above, tried setting to "vulnerable" or whatever, no good.<br />
<br />
So I update all windows machines to the latest build so now all rdp clients are version 10.0.17134 and it doesn't help at all except now when test fails to connect to frank it has the same message as desk, that is "the logon attempt failed" and no longers shows
 the logon screen as it did previously.<br />
<br />
I also tried creating a new account "test" on frank but that got the same error.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IF i connect frank to subnet 1 everything works fine so I think it is simply something to do with that host being on a differnet subnet. Is there anything I can set to allow rdp even though it is in another subnet. How can I rdp to frank and have it remain
 in subnet 2? please help!</p>

<h2>            Desktop Background Picture Position</h2>
                    Hi. I'm using windows 7 and I cannot understand this new theme functions. But that's okay. What irks me is if I try to change the picture position of any picture from Stretch to anything else (Fill, center, tile, etc). I click save changes at the desktop
 background page, but when you go back to the main personalization page (where they had the themes), its back to stretch format! Help. Its driving me nuts.<br />

            Probably you best interface for changing your 'shell' folders is the old 'TweakUI' from XP 'Power Toys'. You install it in Compatibility Mode' for XP, and rightclick the app for 'run as administrator'

<h2>            New to Skype for Business - have a few questions</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking to migrate my business away from using personal accounts and fractured protocols, so Skype for Business it is!</p>
<p>In my testing, though, I've come up with a couple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The free Outlook.com accounts have a Skype icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, and I've used this before for personal chats. This promotional material from Microsoft (<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/06/08/new-user-experiences-in-office-365-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/2015/06/08/new-user-experiences-in-office-365-on-the-web/</a>)&nbsp;gave
 me the impression Office 365 has that functionality as well, but I can't seem to get a Skype icon to appear up there. I can message my Skype for Business account from an external account, but a kind of sloppy popup appears in my Office 365 browser window,
 and if I click it, an entirely new barebones chat window is opened. This is not as elegant and integrated as the free Outlook.com version. What am I missing?
</li><li>I added my Skype for Business account contact to my personal Skype contacts list, but the profile picture I set up from within my organization (used PowerShell to push it to Office 365 and it appears everywhere else successfully) isn't showing up for that
 account contact on my personal contact list. Strangely, my personal account contact's profile picture shows up as expected in the Skype for Business Windows client... so that's half the battle, I guess. What am I missing?
</li></ol>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>hi noah--</p>
<p><span><strong>regarding my first question...</strong></span></p>
<p>here's what i see when i go to outlook.com, the free email offering from microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b67ed58f-65b0-496f-a70e-2a39a0126de3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db67ed58f-65b0-496f-a70e-2a39a0126de3" /></a></p>
<p>note the skype icon. again, this is a person account i use at outlook.com, not my business/enterprise account.</p>
<p>when i go to my office 365 outlook/mail portal for my business/enterprise account, i see this:</p>
<p>note the <em>lack</em> of a skype icon. shouldn't there be one there based on what we can see here?&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/06/08/new-user-experiences-in-office-365-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/2015/06/08/new-user-experiences-in-office-365-on-the-web/</a></p>
<p>specifically, this image:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7210f099-d17e-4553-b8e6-49f9c8809434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7210f099-d17e-4553-b8e6-49f9c8809434" /></a></p>
<p>in addition, when i get a message to my skype for business account, this is what happens in the office 365 ui:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5692f3f9-0fd1-430f-9de2-1d07b3732881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5692f3f9-0fd1-430f-9de2-1d07b3732881" /></a></p>
<p>i'm not going to post a screenshot of what happens when i answer that message, but basically, a new browser window is opened and i can chat through that. it's not a well-integrated, elegant solution like the free outlook.com offering, and i'm wondering why.
 this looks like an interim fix, not something microsoft should have published.</p>
<p><span><strong>regarding my second question...</strong></span></p>
<p>here's how i push user profile pictures to office 365:</p>
<ol>
<li>run windows powershell as administrator. </li><li><span>$credential = get-credential</span> (enter your office 365 login info)
</li><li><span>$exchangesession = new-pssession -configurationname microsoft.exchange -connectionuri "<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/?proxymethod=rps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.office365.com/.../</a> -credential
 $credential -authentication "basic" -allowredirection</span> </li><li><span>import-pssession $exchangesession -disablenamechecking</span>
</li><li><span>set-userphoto "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" -picturedata ([system.io.file]::readallbytes("c:\username.jpg"))</span>
</li><li><span>y</span> </li></ol>
<p>this works perfectly for everything we've needed so far (avatars in our directory, mail, etc).</p>
<p>unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be cutting it when it comes to external non-business skype users communicating with my skype for business account.</p>
<p>here's a screenshot from the basic/personal skype client. i am logged in with my personal account, displaying my skype for business account's contact at the bottom:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9400f344-a5f9-47a3-9b4d-63f8b42f2739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9400f344-a5f9-47a3-9b4d-63f8b42f2739" /></a></p>
<p>in addition to not displaying the avatar that works everywhere else in office 365 so far, the username is my business email address instead of my proper name. is this the expected behavior?</p>
<p>here's a screenshot from my skype for business client (still labeled lync on my machine for now):</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6ebd97dd-4c60-4193-8d0d-a6a010d4ada9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6ebd97dd-4c60-4193-8d0d-a6a010d4ada9" /></a></p>
<p>this is perhaps the only thing about all of this that works exactly as i would expect as a user. i allowed my organization to add external and non-skype for business contacts, and was therefore able to add my personal account as a contact. the avatar displays,
 the name is correct, and i am able to initiate a conversation.</p>
<p>avatars for other members of my organization work correctly within the skype for business client, too, as indicated by this search for a colleague's name:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fde723c5-abc8-47f7-b322-83823fcdce28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfde723c5-abc8-47f7-b322-83823fcdce28" /></a></p>
<p>to reiterate, my question about this is: what do i have to do to make it so that personal skype users will see my skype for business users' avatars and proper names on their contact lists? having that work would look much more professional.</p>

<p>Hi DJGrossman,</p>
<p>For the first question:</p>
<p>Based on our tests, we still can’t find the Skype for Business Online icon. What’s more, when someone sends an IM to me, a new chat browser window pops up. The result is the same as you described.</p>
<p>You may submit feedback about Skype for Business feature to our relevant team at http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273497-skype-for-business. Many features have been designed or upgraded based on our customers’ constructive comments.</p>
<p>For the second question:</p>
<p>It might be related to the conflicts between Skype for Business and other software or the personal Skype client. Could you please try to use a fresh installed computer for verification?</p>
<p>The email address shown in your Outlook.com is related to the Outlook.com setting, and our forum focuses on Office 365 online services.</p>
<p>To ensure you receive professional assistance, I recommend you post on Outlook.com Forum at: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum?tab=Threads&amp;auth=1</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Noah</p>

<p>OK, I'll take my first question over there.</p>
<p>My second question relates entirely to Office 365 and Skype for Business, and has no relation to Outlook.com or to email. I am trying to figure out why my Skype for Business account doesn't display properly in the personal Skype client (no avatar, no proper
 name). What do I need to do to ensure that the aforementioned Skype for Business profile details display properly in the personal Skype client? Is there some special permission somewhere I must configure in my Office 365 or Exchange settings?</p>

<p>Update for my second issue: in my personal Skype, I am now seeing the proper name of my Skype for Business account contact. That's what I was hoping for. However, I am not seeing the Skype for Business avatar in my personal Skype. What do I need to do to
 fix that?</p>

<p>Hi DJGrossman,</p>
<p>As your description about your username of Skype for Business showing as email address in the Skype of outlook.com, it is normal behavior. If using Skype client or Skype for IOS, it will show your username of Skype for business. Hence, as I told before,
 it is related to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>The username display appears to be working as desired, so that is no longer a concern. I'm not sure what changed, but it is fine now. What is not fine, however, is that my Skype for Business avatar does not display in the consumer Skype client (like in the
 image I posted earlier, <a href="https://community.office365.com/resized-image/__size/320x240/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/166/skypenoavatar.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Why is the Skype for Business avatar not showing up in the consumer version of Skype?</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 and corrupt Micro SD Card</h2>
                    <p>My second Kingston Micro SD card has now become corrupted. This was a replacement supplied by Kingston for the original, so it might just be that these cards are unreliable, but it does make me wonder if there is an issue with the Surface. I use Bitlocker
 to secure the card.</p>

<p>I agree with Le Boule. With all due respect, we have to be cautious about advice from Directly's 'independent advisors.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are seeing is a hijacked web page. It's not malware that has installed itself on your computer which is why scanning with antivirus software is not going to make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Web pages are commonly hijacked. There's nothing that your or I or Microsoft can do about it. The web page owner has to fix their web page, if it's still within their power to do so, and often it isn't. Other hijacked web pages are designed to trap innocent
 web surfers who misspell or otherwise get the name wrong when looking for a web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone is likely to come across a web page like that from time to time. When you do, here's what to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Ignore whatever the web page tells you.</p>
<p>2- Do not click <em>anywhere</em> on the web page. Don't even try to close it in the usual manner.</p>
<p>3- Open Task Manager and 'End task' on your web browser. You'll lose all open tabs, but that's better than being hacked.</p>
<p>4- Don't try to visit that web page again, at least not until the web page owner has fixed the page.</p>

<p>You would load drivers within the Windows XP virtual machine the same as you used to in Windows XP.&nbsp; Fire up the VM, then follow the manufacturer's instructions for loading the drivers.</p>
<p>Be advised that those drivers will work only from within the virtual machine, they will not make your device work in Windows Vista 64-bit.</p>

<h3> catherinekee  say:</h3>
<h2>            The zoom level is messed up</h2>
                    &nbsp;The zoom function is messed up on my computer. Every new page is zoomed to postage stamp size. How can I fix this? The zoom adjustment tab is not visible at the bottom like it usually is. I don't know where it went. Also, sometimes I am typing on my keyboard
 and the zoom level will just change on its' on accord. What is causing this?

            <p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Are all the device drivers and Windows updates are updated?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any significant changes prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>Is issue specific to web browser or with all application? If it is confined to web browser then have you check the issue in other browser, was the result same?</span></li></ol>
<p>As per the issue description the zoom level is messed up and not working the way it should be. The issue could be if display drivers get corrupted or need an update. It could also be if there is some third party conflict. I would suggest you to try the steps
 provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Step 1: </strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Boot the computer in safe mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persists, try to update the display drivers and see if it helps you to fix the issue and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A driver is software that allows your computer to communicate with hardware or devices. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes or updates made on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When exactly do you get the error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you facing issues with Internet connection?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not facing any&nbsp;internet connection&nbsp;issues, then you can ignore the error message.</span></p>
<span>
<div>On the other hand, if you are facing&nbsp;issues with the network connection, then&nbsp;you need to uninstall the adapter and restart the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Uninstall the Microsoft ISATAP adapter from device manager.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start; in the start search type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the Microsoft ISATAP adapter.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on it and choose uninstall.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Restart the computer once it is uninstalled</span>.<br />
<div><strong>Method 2</strong>:</div>
</span>
<p><b><span>Code 31:
</span></b><span>This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for
 the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the corrupted driver, if you have any previous installed adapter drivers and then install the drivers in Clean
 boot mode.</span></p>
