<h2>            Missing Diction &#38; Look-up</h2>
                    Is there a way to look up the definition of a word in Outlook 2016 similar to that of Outlook 2007 which was supported by Encarta Dictionary? It was useful when editing using the Thesaurus to make sure that the word being used as a substitute was better
 than the original.

            Not totally, but you can right click on the word or phrase and choose smart lookup - there should be two tabs in the results, one with web links and one for Define.  For this to work, you need to enable "intelligent services" in File, Options, General.

            Looking at the statement it appears that the feature is only associated with the Office 365 program, and not with Office 2016, am I understanding that correctly? If yes, that would mean paying both for Office 2016 and Office 365...seems a little much

            Sure sounds it... that's dumb. You shouldn't need a subscription for a definition only version of smart lookup. :( 
<br />
<br />I have a macro at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/developer/replicate-smart-lookup-macro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/developer/replicate-s...</a> that tries to replicate the feature using google - it would work for a dictionary service.

            Hi Brady,<br />
<br />
We have ways to prevent spam emails in Outlook. Most recommended ways to prevent spam emails is thru setting up a Junk email filter. Regarding your concern, it would be best to create rules in your Outlook app. With this, you will be able to manage incoming
 emails in your account like deleting incoming emails from a specific sender. You may refer to this

<p>Hi guys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hava a nokia e5 and sometimes I notice I paid for internet without knowing. I would like to know if I can shut down all possible internet communications for which I should pay. So I only want to use WLAN if necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What settings do I have to change that I am not connected without knowing? Can someone provide a list of these possible connections and how to deactivate them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>

<p>This does not disconnect net it will just temp suspend the connection till&nbsp;someone try to contact me through net (for e.g. by poking me on whatsapp). It would be nice if I can just by a click log off/on the internet - is that possible through upgrading/uploading

            You may consider getting a feature phone instead of a smartphone. On those phones is easier to disable features, on some are even not there.<br />
<br />
Does not make sense to have a smartphone where you want to disable the main connectivity automatic features.<br />
<br />
Just my poit of view...<br />

            menu &gt;control panel &gt;settings &gt; connection &gt; destination &gt;options &gt;default connection - set always ask. it will ask every time when the phone wants to connect to internet.<br />
<br />
some applications like whatsapp will connect to net automatically and if we exit the app also it uses net all the time.<br />
<br />
use netqin antivirus to terminate/stop the application process to exit the application manually, to disconnect from net.

<h2>            First impressions Win10</h2>
                    <p>Ok, yes, it's better than 8, but that really doesn't say all that much.</p>
<p>A so called "start menu". Do you really this that all your customers are idiots...?? Because that is the impression I get, that you guys think we're idiots. We are not. We rejected metro for a reason. We want nothing to do with anything 'metro', and that
 includes the 'store' and any other 'metro apps'.&nbsp; Your attempt to fool us with this current start menu has, sadly for you, failed miserably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as for those 2 new buttons on the taskbar, search and tasks view...again, what's wrong with you guys...??? Hard coding nonsense like that achieves one thing and one thing only: it annoys us.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have one more thing, at this early date. The feedback 'button'.</p>
<p>Well, it's not really a button, it's a metro app, which we reject. I get it though. Create the illusion that you're collecting feedback from the general public when in fact the only ones you are collecting info from are the fanboi's. But hey, didn't you
 guys listen to them almost exclusively in the run up to win8...??? Remind me again, how did that work out...???(and lets face it, the only ones who would ever agree to the insidious terms of the windows insider program would be your hard core fanbois, and
 certainly not the vast majorits who rejected 8, metro et al.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the bottom line. We are NOT fooled, we are NOT impressed.</p>

            <p>Well, for me you are just selfish. You are talking "WE". Who is "we"? Who gave you permissions to talk for "THEM"? If you think Microsoft should do everything YOU say then... I'm sorry, they won't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Windows 8(.1) from the beginning and I didn't like it at first - same as you. I kept mine Windows 7 installed for a reason and after checking new system I returned to 7. But then the update came and I started using it more often. At some
 point I decided, that I'm working much faster with Windows 8.1 and I left 7 behind. Even new menu start came very usefull at the end. It was like old, but much bigger and kept my desktop clean. I haven't been using Metro apps though, I just found it not usefull
 at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, 10 is a mix of 8.1 and 7 (kinda old menu start). If you don't like Metro and everything connected to it - don't use it. I can say even more, if you don't like windows 8 and 10 - don't use it. But let it stay for those who like it (I'm an example). For
 the new things - task view CAN be usefull, but I think I need more time, and search button is very usefull. It's very fast and finally it's in place, where we can have quick acess to it. And remember, there is a couple of months (I think??) to final release,
 so they can change a lot...</p>

<p>Which of course is why I have voiced my opinion. If all they hear is from the fanbois, then we are stuck with what they like....think 8 et al. Keep in mind that it was the massive groundswell of negative reaction to 8 &amp; metro etc that has caused the backtracking.
 If you say nothing, you get nothing, and that is what you deserve. A very large percentage of the user base has been doing battle against all things metro for over a couple years now, and we all want them to get this right so we can end the struggle. We do
 have other things to do with our lives yanno.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The metro apps are fine when they run in windows instead of full screen. I'm sure we'll see much more variety, and much better apps, now that they actually stand a chance of being run on the majority of Windows computers (which are laptops/desktops, not
 hybrids or tablets).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardcore "We" that you obviously represent does not represent the majority of Windows users. Removing Metro apps from the Start Menu is as simple as .. well - removing them.</p>

<p>Well, given the dismal showing of 8 &amp; 8.1, I'd submit that it does indeed represent a majority users, whether they are vocal or not.<br />
<br />
Also, it might be better to focus on the message, as opposed to my writing style. I'd say that this is too important to waste time getting hung up on semantics.<br />

<p>Couldn't agree more. I don't spend all day in the Start Menu. </p>
<p>I have a variety of applications and file windows open&nbsp;and work between them most of the day. Once I'm outside the Start Screen I'm business as normal, and like the new Explorer and tools in 8 much better than 7 any day. 10 for me doesn't seem to change
 that so much but give people on the Desktop more attention.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Man, have you ever thought about how metro apps are good? They allows you to run phone apps on computer! And now with WINDOWED MODE! You have no reason to say that it is bad~ And I love the current start menu. I'll never downgrade it to Windows 7 again,
 I'll just use Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp; For why it is named Windows 10, just think about how Apple named their phone iPhone 4. It was the 4th generation. So Win7 is the 7th gen, Win8 is 8th, Win8.1 is 9th, why they cant name their new system Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, some of you may think I hate Win7 very much? My computer is Mac Mini and don't have win10 support for Boot Camp yet. If I hate Win7, I could simply use my Mac OS X. I liked win7, and I think I will like Win10 better.</p>

            <p>Ya see, this is where the disconnect exists. Reading the comments on this page, one could easily come away with the impression that win8/metro was a raging success and ten merely builds upon it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except for one little teeny tiny factoid: The exact opposite is true. I get that there is a certain ilk who worship at the alter of microsoft, and believe that they can do no wrong. However, ms made the mistake of listening to them the last time, and released
 8 thinking that everybody would welcome it with open arms. One would hope that they have learned from their mistakes, and listen to dissenting opinions this time around. It just may save them from from two complete disasters in a row.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, you do have a point. I failed to properly articulate my point. I absolutely should have specified "the desktop". That is on me. In fact, as far as the whole metro ecosystem, I'm fine with it remaining on touch devices. My rantings are specific to the
 desktop, and only the desktop. <br />

            <p>I actually mean on non-touch systems. Its pretty much a given that the Modern UI or an evolution of it will be the default on tablets, but I want it to remain as an option on traditional form factor machines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like Modern on my tower and laptop computers, and have no wish to be limited to the desktop UI or forced to use an archaic Start Menu. I was in a struggle with the Menu for 17 years, and I never want to go back to that style of launcher. But I have no
 problem with the option being there for others to stick with what they prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Metro remaining on tablets isn't good enough - it needs to remain on "desktops" as well, with the option to turn it off for those who don't want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do people think when someone says they like Modern that must mean "just on tablets"? And those who like mouse and keyboard and full computers must always prefer the desktop UI?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The desktop" to me means the UI, not the system form factor. I haven't owned a system that would fit on desk since the 90s. And I don't agree that the desktop UI is the only "proper" way to work with a stationary computer.</p>

<h3> trevor j lawrence  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install Hyper-V VM in 9926.</h2>
                    <p>Has anybody had success or failure installing 9926 in a Hyper-V VM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running&nbsp; 9841, 9860 and 9879 perfectly happily in a Hyper-V VM but firstly failed to upgrade to 9926, then thinking I'd blow it all away, download the ISO and build a new VM, I have had singularly little success in doing this as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install process goes through the initial steps of copying files, initialising files, etc, then reboots twice quickly, displays "Getting Ready" briefly, switches to "Getting Devices Ready x%" which reaches 100% in about 3 secs, then switches back to "Getting
 Ready" at which point it hangs.&nbsp; The VM is using about 24% CPU all the time and absolutely nothing happens for a long time until I give up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The host machine is a Surface Pro 1.&nbsp; The VM has 2048MB RAM and a 33GB VHD (and of course a DVD mounting the install ISO).&nbsp; The SHA-1 hash of the downloaded ISO is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues?</p>

    <title>AcroPDF control on userform &#40;to view PDF&#41; causes ActiveX - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwhall  say:</h3>
<h2>            AcroPDF control on userform &#40;to view PDF&#41; causes ActiveX Warning</h2>
                    <p>I have developed a an userform that allows me to import and view PDFs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I store the file names in a worksheet and the pdf&nbsp;files themselves in a particular folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire userform works great, however the ActiveX warning appears: "This application is about to initialize an ActiveX Control that might be unsafe. If you trust the source of this file..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't mind the ActiveX warning, per se, and understand its importance. However, this has caused some problems with a few users:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Their security settings will not allow any UFI (Unsafe for Initialization) ActiveX controls to start - and it seems that the AcroPDF control used to view the PDFs in a userform are UFI (!?!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't consider any registry hacks - wouldn't recommend them if I could. So that has left me to try to figure out how to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make the AcroPDF a SFI (Safe for Initialization) ActiveX control, or</p>
<p>2. How to get the users Excel to recognize the location where the control is stored as a "Trusted Location"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In researching this, I have found out that only the developer can make the control SFI. Since I am the enduser, I cannot do this. So, option 1 is gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I searched my system for "AcroPDF*.*", I found one file - AcroPDF.dll in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Acrobat\ActiveX.&nbsp; Using the Trusted Locations addition method in the Trust Center, I added that location as a Trusted Location and tried to
 load the file again. Still the ActiveX warning. I even changed my ActiveX notification setting to "Enable all controls without restriction and without prompting" (something I wouldn't ask my users to do), and I still get the ActiveX notification.&nbsp; I copied
 the AcroPDF.dll to my application folder, made it a trusted location, and still the same warning appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, here is my need: How can I either -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Use the AcroPDF control as an accepted (SFI) control, or</p>
<p>2. Preview a PDF without using the control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>did you have any luck with this one? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have exactly the same issue but at a loss what to do. I did try the registry hack as well but it didn't seem to resolve the issue for all users. My other issue is that the warning stops the auto log in process after a server reboot, so I have to set an
 alarm for 3 am every Monday to log on and click OK! tried automating this click, even tried sendkeys (which I avoid like the plague usually) but had no joy whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a PDF viewing control that can be added to a userform in excel that is SFI?

<h2>            What is Error code&#58; 0xE000089E in Onenote and how to fix this error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I sync my OneNote installed in my PC, I encounter this pop-up error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Sync Errors (Last Sync at 1/01/1980)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">---------------------------------------</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Quick Notes</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(Error code: 0xE000089E)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>It has the options Sync Again&nbsp; or Cancel.&nbsp; I keep trying the Sync Again, and again it gives me the same error.&nbsp; So I select Cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I use my OneNote and Sync, it will always have this problem.&nbsp; So it means the window's statement "We'll try again later." do not work and no one is resolving this issue in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and i have the latest 2016 Windows on my PC.&nbsp; So please help me fix this issue?</p>
<p>

<p>After a successfull sync you may stop it in Start-Settings-System-Memory-Running Programs. It will load automatically again when you connect your device to your PC.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Menu and Titles Bar Have Disappeared</h2>
                    
<p>After performing a Repair install of Win XP following a damaging virus, Outlook 2007 no longer displays the menu bar and the standard and advanced Outlook tools bars. I have attempted to include a screenshot in the html code of this query. If it does not
 show up I can email it separately.</p>
<p>I have reset menus and toolbars, deleted outcmd.dat and tried removing add-in tools bars (which have now been added back in) without benefit. Ditto for repairing the Outlook installation. Those menu and toolbar items that have an alt or function key associated
 with them still work.</p>
<p>I need solutions to try to fix this problem. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            designing a splash screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone. I'm kinda new to Access so please bear with me.&nbsp; I'm fairly familiar with Excel, but not Access.&nbsp; I have tried to design a splash screen (Display Form).&nbsp; I've used some information from a book ("Access 2007 Bible")&nbsp; I've got the splash screen
 to come on when I open the Access data base, and it displays for about 5 seconds, but then it just closes, and I have a blank window.&nbsp; I need to know how to make it go to the switchboard when it runs out of time and closes.&nbsp; The code I'm using to make it work
 so far is as follows.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Option Compare Database&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Use database order for string comparisons<br />
Option Explicit<br />
Dim NumTime As Integer</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Load()<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub</p>
<p>Form_Load_Err:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Form_Load_Exit<br />

    <title>Internet Explorer spelling check no longer working in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tinus a2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer spelling check no longer working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have received some complaints that the spelling check for Windows 10 does not work within most webforms and/or internal websites. While I am typing this message I can see squigly lines for nearly each word since my native language is Dutch and this message
 is in English. This same effect does not work for all forms or fields. Sometimes it will give a squigly line but it won't offer any alternative options. It looks lik the type of field detemines if the spelling check works or not.
</p>
<p>In the past we had an add-in for Internet Explorer called Spelling Check which was a lot more reliable. Since it is no longer available we don't know how to offer the same functionality for all forms and websites.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is anything that can be done to improve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already checked a few of the online resources such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/wiki/ie11-iewindows_10/spelling-correction-and-checking-in-internet/a1321c59-3623-49a2-8fce-388ecc2cb057"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/wiki/ie11-iewindows_10/spelling-correction-and-checking-in-internet/a1321c59-3623-49a2-8fce-388ecc2cb057</span></a></p>
<p>The current spelling check built into Windows 10 itself only seems to check certain field types. For example the field I am typing in right now seems to be working just fine, highlighting
 errors and making suggestions. Other websites however this feature does not seem to work. It looks like there is a differentiation between field types.</p>
<p>Some of our web applications/sites no longer have a spelling check now which is a hassle for our users. Are there any known restrictions to the field types that are checked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also posted this question in the Windows 10 forum because I am unsure if this should be something posted there since the issue is with the new Windows 10 spelling check however it is related to this browser. I have this exact same issue with Edge
 however so I doubt it is specifically related to the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get the spelling check add-on for Windows 10 back?</p>

            <p>The spelling dictionaries for Internet Explorer 11 is only compatible with the Windows 7 operating. You can refer to this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for information about downloading this add on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Windows 10 built-in spell checker that can be enabled by going to <strong>
Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Typing </strong>does not work for you, we would suggest that you provide a feedback on this by typing<strong> Windows Feedback</strong> in
<strong>Cortana</strong>, the search box on the task bar. Log in using your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this was working before in Windows 10 and the issue only occurred recently, we'll need to know if there are changes on your computer settings that you've made recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            <span><span>If you can print some files in excel and if some cannot be printed it could be because of the file corruption. You can try copying the contents of the files (which are not printing)
 to a new workbook and try printing. If you are able to print without fail then you may have to recreate the corrupted files. But updating the printer driver is actually recommended for Windows 7.</span></span>

            The Excel Safe Mode, the problem occurs under the Excel Safe Mode as well. The 64-bit version of the Excel allows us to work with much larger data sets. Our large excel sheets exceeds the row, column or file size limits of 32 bit Excel. The 64-bit excel
 allows us a much higher memory capacity.&nbsp;

    <title>How to determine what tasks shifted when predecessor shifts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to determine what tasks shifted when predecessor shifts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up a Master Project with subprojects. &nbsp;Given the subprojects use some of the same resources, the files are not linked. &nbsp;I set the baseline.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue one: </strong>&nbsp;Given I have 2000 rows of a plan, I can't tell, if I change a date, what other tasks' dates are shifted. &nbsp;How can I easily find that out?</p>
<p><strong>Issue two:</strong> &nbsp;I tried "setting the baseline" and looking at the Gantt chart. &nbsp;However, it is not showing the bars for baseline and shifted timeline. &nbsp;Only one bar shows up. &nbsp;I looked at all the formatting options and cannot find a way to make
 it show the bar for baseline and the shifted timeline. &nbsp;I thought it was because the subprojects are not linked but this can't be the case because I have cross subproject tasks to show the appropriate relationships. &nbsp;How do I set it up where the Gantt shows
 multiple bars for a given task to show project shifts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>

<p>Comments from the gallery:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. As far as I can tell, setting the baseline for a linked master does not set baselines for the associated sub-projects.&nbsp; (You need to open those individually and set the baselines.)&nbsp; That's why you see "NA" in the subproject baseline fields.</p>
<p>2. Critical path and schedule variance / Earned Value analysis are not mutually exclusive.&nbsp; In general, both are necessary for adequate schedule visibility and control, though I would suggest the first is more important than the second for that purpose.</p>
<p>3. Although you can easily generate a filter of "Critical" tasks, Project has no output called "Critical Path."&nbsp; There is a not-so-subtle distinction between the two terms that is unfortunately overlooked by most users.</p>

<p>GKB,</p>
<p>Okay I see where you apparently saved a baseline 7/10/18 but if the Baseline fields still all show "NA", then it didn't "take". I'd go ahead and save a new baseline, although it won't be truly representative of your original plan if some progress has been
 recorded or dates have been manually changed from the original plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, critical path analysis is standard tool for analyzing schedules. But it all depends on what type of data you need/want for your project. Some users rely heavily on earned value which has several metrics for tracking a plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way are you in a Project Server environment or using Project Online?</p>

<p>Can't remember sequence that I carried out but on N8 running Belle there was no longer option for "no capture tone" in camera application but combination of turning "warning tones" = Off in profiles plus installation of mute camera.sis did stop camera sounds.</p>

<p>Well spotted as it can be easily overlooked that "<strong>Off</strong>" is just offscreen with Camera
<strong>1</strong> - <strong>4</strong> being visible by default.....should have gone to Specsavers!</p>
