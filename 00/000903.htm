<h2>            Saving as a Custom SmartArt</h2>
                    <p>I have created a really complex SmartArt timeline with different shapes and colour-ways. As it took ages to get right, I want to use it as a template for future diagrams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an option to save as a picture but I don't want this - and also I don't want to save the whole document as a template. Can you add a customised SmartArt to a gallery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p>Not natively no, if you have programming skills in XML this might be useful, not for the faint hearted though:</p>

                    <p>I bought&nbsp; Office 365 Personal in Office Store. I can't find the product key.&nbsp; I followed these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If you bought Office through the Microsoft Store, you can enter your product key there.</p>

<p>What do you refer to as hot/heating?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can't hold it hot, melting plastic hot, noticably warmer that the other parts of the phone hot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it get warmer and then stay there of does it get warmer as time goes by? (say 10-15 minutes later then the 5 minutes you mentioned)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts of the phone will get warmer as you use it, this is normal and since the housing is plastic it tends to not dissapate as much as it would with say an aluminium housing. Perfectly normal as computer electronics tends to generate heat when used.</p>

<p><br />
The same issue exists on the Nokia Lumia 920, theories mostly come down to the antennae so the best guess is that the phone has problems finding a signal thus stressing itself harder to find one resulting into a lot of heat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine is currently in repairs because the heating has me worried as well (tested it with extreme low settings but still connected to the net through wi-fi, warmed with internet explorer in less then 10 minutes) so I can't fully confirm the above theory is
 true.</p>

In no way has any low consuming app(internet browser) ever heated up a phone in less then one hour.<br />
I have already told you that I tested this with extreme low settings (you should even know these by now) and that my previous phone doesn't have this nor does my 1,5Ghz 2GB Note tablet (guess what no vents and a lot of stuff running in the background).

<p>The OP said his phone became hot and his written English appears good enough to distinguish between hot and warm. I suppose most users will not be worried by a warm phone but if the OP is worried enough to write in we can expect that he is experiencing something
 unusual. I have used many smartphones before and none of them have ever become hot enough to be concerned about even under intensive use so your theory of a heat generating computer with poor heat dissipation doesn't wash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously Paul, there is no need to defend Nokia to the extent of questioning users' langauge skills and rationalizing everything away. Some Lumias have problems, just accept that.</p>

<p>I have a Nokia N9 with the same polycarbonate material for its casing and it never heats up even if I multitask 5 or 6 apps. The hottest I can get it is to be pleasingly warm and that only when running GPS for extended period. The design of the casing has
 more to do with it than the material used. Another thing I noticed is that background apps in MeeGo like ebook reader, browser or music player do not use any CPU or battery power while open in the background if they are doing nothing. This isn't true for WP8.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not defending Nokia and not saying there are no issues. I am not the one who jumps on any post concerning a phone getting warm and assuming the issue is identical to any other. I am asking the OP questions to see if there is anything we might be able
 to advise or help him with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comments made towards Chrisvn and were general comments and not directly related to OP. Chrisvn seems to know me well enough to tell people to not listen to me, even though I am only asking some questions and making a general remark which does not dismiss
 the OP issue at all. It's a shame he managed again to make this thread about him and not the OP who must have fled the scene by now in agony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have on many occasions told him I fully agree with his claim he is not getting the support he should be getting and he should really contact Nokia&nbsp;directly to get this resolved. I am not saying OP has no issue or that there are no heating issues, just
 that they are not structural or 'genrally occuring'. In order to be able to provide a decent and sensible answer I asked the OP some questions to which we probably will never get an answer now and we're just left with another thread led by mr Chrisvn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An electrical component getting serious cooling in a server or computer environment can still easily run temperatures up to 35 degrees Celcius, a similar component without any active cooling in a phone will not run as hot, but can still develop enough heat
 to feel quite warm on the body of the phone. Also what may feel hot to one person would feel hand warm to another so there is also a personal opinion/perception in play here. The OP is _<em><strong>not</strong></em>_ saying the phone is getting hot, he is
 saying it is <strong><em>heating up</em></strong> which can be interpreted many ways which is why I am asking the questions I am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I should not need to defend myself here I am not the one hijacking every thread I can to press my personal issue over and over again. Chrisvn is assuming too much and has no idea where I am coming from in this or what I do or do not know.</p>

<p>I have also faced the same issue but not just under 5 minutes of usage, approximately after 20-30 minutes of usage it got hot under the camera ,ant the area over speaker. Camera does get hot even after 5 minutes of usage , i took it to nokia care and they
 said that it is normal and nothing to worry. i would say my device would heat upto some 40 degrees which the service centre guy said is ok , so if ur device is geting hotter than this u might want to get it checked and replaced.</p>

                    Mailmerge - &nbsp;in Word 16 when I use a Word database to link with a Word main letter document and save the document, when I reopen the main document I have to search for the database - as the link between the main document and the database hasn't saved.
 &nbsp;If I use an Excel database the link will save. &nbsp;Can anyone explain the reason for the link with the database in Word not saving?

            <p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mailmerge will work if I use an Excel database, which can be saved so that the next time I open the main document the database is still linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried following the Microsoft training on data sources that can be used for a mail merge, and that uses Access databases. &nbsp;That works as well, saving the database to the new document so that the next time I open the main document the database is still
 linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that although a Word database will link with a main document - usually a letter - the next time I open the main document I have to "reattach" the database. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message that appeared when I tried to open a mailmerge document this morning was:</p>
<p><em>2112C64A is a mail merge main document. &nbsp;Word cannot find its data sources, U:\...\Database of Nursery applicants......</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked on Find Data Source another message appeared:</p>
<p><em>We're sorry. &nbsp;We can't open Admissions forems letter to Nursery starters for Sept 2 016 1 because we found a problem with its contents.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In my mind logically the problem stems from when the whole computer system was upgraded to WIndows 2016 in September. &nbsp;Previous to that time I had no problems with the main document linking with the database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in a state primary school and the computer support company we employ have had no answers. They know a lot about the computer installation and keeping them running but not so much about using Office. &nbsp;The new company took over supporting the school
 computer system in September and they changed names of servers and main document folders. &nbsp;This week (the technician supporting us comes into school one day a week) the technician told me that Word 16 does not support mailmerge and that I'd need to go to an
 older version of Word to be able to use mailmerges!!! &nbsp;I don't have much confidence in his opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas you have I will try. &nbsp;I will probably have to go over to using Excel and Access as databases as it's a continuing frustration having to reattach the Word database each time I open a main document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>The technician does NOT know what he is talking about. &nbsp;Mail Merge works in all versions of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the data source is corrupt, or is not in the location that it was in when you last used the mail merge main document, it is understandable that when you open the mail merge main document, it will not be able to attach the data source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get the same issue with any other data source if the same thing happens (it becomes corrupt or is not in the expected location).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The U: drive is I assume a network drive and for some reason you may not be able to connect to it. &nbsp;It help however to set that drive (or the folder in it that you are using) as a Trusted Location under File&gt;Options&gt;Trust Center&gt;Trust Center Settings&gt;Trusted
 Locations and that will probably require that you check the box for "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended}".</p>

<h2>            Missing Tab Selector button and missing hanging indent marker</h2>
                    <p>For some reason in the last couple of days, the Tab Selector button and hanging indent marker display sporadically. If I close Word and start with a blank file, they are back. In particular, there is one document I'm working on in which this behavior happens
 sporadically. I have to make sure that document is closed, close all Word files, reopen, and then the markers are back. Any idea what might be causing this?</p>

            <p>There is an issue causing tab stops and indent indicators to disappear from the ruler in Word 2013. The problem is being investigated by the Office team, and a fix is expected. Meanwhile, the following are workarounds recommended by Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Word first, with a blank document, and then open the document you are going to read or edit.​</li><li>Avoid having a table as the first item in a document (at present it appears that this is the cause of the problem).</li></ul>
<p>While other procedures may clear the problem temporarily, none is a permanent fix, and they do not address the underlying problem issue.</p>

<h2>            Account hacked into repeatedly.</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
My laptop has been hacked and I believe that the hackers have my hotmail password. I need something to take to the police and want to know if it is possible for the guys at hotmail to tell me if my hotmail account has been accessed from multiple computers?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            &nbsp;If you wish to obtain IP login history, we can make that available, but for your security we cannot release that information to anybody that has not been validated as the account owner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;[PART 1]<br />
<br />
To start the request process, please visit http://account.live.com/password/reset<br />
<br />
Select I forgot my password from the first screen, and select "Reset Your Password"<br />
<br />
Enter the LiveID that you wish to obtain the login history for and solve the HIP check then click "next"<br />
<br />
From the next screen select "Customer Support" then click the "Customer Support Link"<br />
<br />
This will take you into the Automated Validation Process.<br />
<br />
Follow the prompts and fill out the information as fully as possible.<br />
<br />
Once you submit, you will either receive a response almost immediately if you auto-passed<br />
<br />
If not, you will receive an automated e-mail with an issue number, and within the next 24 hours you will receive either notification of a pass or a fail, again with the same issue number.<br />
<br />
(Important...in both passed scenarios, there will be a link.&nbsp; Do not click this link unless you actually want to change your password)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[PART 2]<br />
Once you have the pass message, go to the answers forum:<br />
<br />
Hotmail, Messenger &amp; SkyDrive&gt;Windows Live ID&gt;Security and Permissions<br />
<br />
In that forum post your question, I need to obtain IP log history<br />
<br />
In the body of your question, explain that you are concerned that your account has been compromised and you wish to obtain IP log history.&nbsp; Please do NOT post the message you obtained above.<br />
<br />
One of our moderators will respond to your post with a private message and ask you to provide either the e-mail if you auto-passed (make sure and include the headers so we have a date stamp), or the incident number provided in the other mails.<br />
<br />
Once the moderator has proof that you are the owner of the account, they will respond with the requested history.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that IP logs are the only information we have available.&nbsp; We cannot provide information if mails were read or any other activities that may have occurred.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please also note that the steps above is the only way that we can validate ownership, and without that validation we cannot release any information to anybody.&nbsp; This is for the protection of all our customers.<br />

The best thing to do is to change your password into a strong one. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. To change your password, sign in to https://account.live.com. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Select the Change option next to Password. Or if you want a direct link, you can go directly to the Change Password Page.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
It is important to ensure a strong password to prevent future risks to your account, and to change passwords at regular intervals. Please follow the guidelines detailed in this article: Creating a strong password for your e-mail account.

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
However, there will be instances when you won’t be allowed access to your account, preventing you from changing your password.
<br />
If this happens, we recommend that you reset your password. <br />

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Note that you will be asked information regarding your account to verify your identity.

<p>The advantages are that in each ring you get progressively early looks at new features from preview builds being the last to see them and fast ring being the earliest. Since this is an early look for MS to see if there are install or operational problems
 you may see strange and frustrating issues arise on occasion, with fast being the most likely. In my case, I have had 2 computers on the fast ring for nearly 2 years, and have had to do a clean install once on each machine for intractable issues. It is not
 recommended that you use your everyday machine for insider builds because there is a small but real chance you will lose everything on the disk and have to do a clean install from a USB stick. If you are not comfortable installing operating systems and troubleshooting
 issues, researching issues and solutions, using the command windows and so on, I would say you run a high risk of a very frustrating experience with insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not back up all user files frequently, stay away from insiders!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that, it is great being out on the cutting edge, and getting to experience those things you hear about but haven't made their way into the most current release to market.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Slow Ring</em> is good for checking the usability of new features over time.&nbsp; New builds are about once a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two branches of<em> Fast Ring.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Fast Ring, Active Development of Windows</em> is good if you like puzzles; i.e., finding and reporting bugs.&nbsp; Big bugs.&nbsp; Dangerous bugs.&nbsp; Crash-your-computer-and-blow-away-your-files bugs.&nbsp; New builds are about once a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Fast Ring, Skip Ahead</em> is not a choice right now.&nbsp; It is closed to new Insiders.&nbsp; It is the same as Fast Ring, Active Development of Windows but for the version of Windows to follow the current beta.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not use Insider builds of any ilk for daily computing or on an office or production machine.&nbsp; This is the mantra Microsoft and most veterans here repeat.&nbsp; Heed the caution.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not use an Insider build for any gaming beyond casual gaming.&nbsp; No competitive gaming. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always use a "secondary" device or virtual machines for testing Insider previews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not equipped for handling frequent crashes, lock-ups, trashed files, poor performance, settings glitches, etc., in an environment that does not risk valuable data then wait for the next version of Windows 10 to release to the public and adopt
 it then.</p>

            Skip Ahead has a very limited number of seats in order to keep most Insiders focused on completion of the current beta.&nbsp; It closes when all the seats are taken.&nbsp; It re-opens when the dev team decides it wants to fill some vacated seats.&nbsp; There is no scheduled
 "registration day."&nbsp; The team just announces that it is open for new Insiders and once no more seats are left it is closed again (no announcement).&nbsp; You just have get lucky and select it at the right time. &nbsp;

<p>Yep and all of the info posted by our fellow insiders could have been found simply by reading the forums, I don't understand as I'm in my 70's and I have always done research before asking, maybe its a new generation thing where people don't look for any
 answers but just post a question, ok now stepping down off my soapbox</p>

<p>You don't export. View the archived calendar as All Appointments (View-Current View-All Appointments), select them all and just drag them to your current calendar.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft AutoUpdate on Mac - Multiple Application Installs</h2>
                    <p>On my Mac, I have the Office Applications in a folder called "Microsoft Office" in the Applications folder. This is so I can pin the Microsoft Office folder to the Dock and have quick access to the Office applications without having to pin all the individual
 applications to the Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In recent updates (I am on Office Insider Fast) using Microsoft AutoUpdate, the office applications in the Microsoft Office folder get updated to the new release and then, for some reason, the same applications are also installed again in the Applications
 folder. Please fix this so that the applications are only installed once in the Microsoft Office folder and not in the main Applications folder. This used to work correctly in previous versions of AutoUpdate.</p>

<p>I did some more in-depth testing and found out that it worked OK in Safemode.</p>
<p>I disabled add-ins one by one, and discovered the built-in "Solver Add-in" from Microsoft was causing this issue.</p>
<p>Once I unchecked this add-in, the issue was resolved.</p>
<p>Since this is a microsoft add-in, does anyone know if there is an update available or any work-around for getting this to work properly?&nbsp; I don't think the employee who is experiencing this problems uses that function much, but it would be good to know in
 case anyone else runs into it.</p>
<p>Any info would be helpful.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            VISIO Template CF FLOWCHART AND Gantt Chart DO NOT ask for &#34;how many bands&#34; and &#34;how many tasks&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>In both VISIO 2003 and 2007 the application does not ask me anymore how many "bands" I want to use when creating a new cross functional flowchart.&nbsp; A similar problem occurs when using the Gantt chart template.&nbsp; VISIO "used" to ask how many tasks I wanted
 to include and it doesn't anymore.</p>
<p>What caused this and how can I fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Greyacourt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I apologize for the late response. We have done several tests on different versions and builds. We are sure AutoSave is available on the latest version of your channel,&nbsp; Version 1712 Build 8827.2148.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From our tests, when AutoSave is not available, we find that if we go to File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information, What's New button greys out.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efb1f96a-5f0e-4b6b-bda4-e54c34c9df39?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efb1f96a-5f0e-4b6b-bda4-e54c34c9df39?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Therefore, we would like to suggest completely uninstallation and reinstallation Office, and then check if there is any improvement. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. Follow the Option 2 in this article&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Uninstall Office from a PC to completely
 uninstall Office 2016</span></a>&nbsp;with the easy fix tool.</p>
<p>2. Restart your computer and check if Office 2016 is uninstalled successfully.</p>
<p>3. Reinstall Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h2>            Postmaster Delivery Failure</h2>
                    <pre>This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification.<br /> <br />Delivery to the following recipients failed.<br /> <br />       *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br /><br />I keep getting my emails returned with the above message.  I have spoken to the email provider and he says that <br /><br />The error that you receive comes from the Hotmail servers and therefore 
we need more information from them as to why this error is being 
generated. I can speak to my provider, but they are reporting no issues 
with the server and as the emails don't reach their system they don't 
even have any record of them. <br /><br />I have checked the email address and its definitely correct.  But it is only to email addresses for my businesses supplied by this provider which is<br />a real pain.<br /><br />I have had a look on the forum and there are a few other comments along these lines.  Hopefully someone from Microsoft may be able to assist<br />because my IT expert who is normally very good is coming up against a brick wall<br />Thanks<br />Simon<br /> </pre>

                    <p>What version of Office Open XML do the&nbsp;office web apps support, Is it possible to save a document in Strict OpenXML as per the ISO standard or do the apps use transitional OpenXML. Also if i choose to save documents in the OpenDocument format instead what
 is the version used 1.1, 1.2?. </p>

            <p>Hi GlenUK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are some very good questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Word Web App support both the transitional and strict ISO standards.</li><li>The Word Web App also supports editing ODT files, with some <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-sharepoint-online-small-business-help/differences-between-the-opendocument-text-odt-format-and-the-word-docx-format-used-by-word-web-app-HA102252963.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
documented limitations</a>.&nbsp; As is the case with DocX files, the content might not look exactly the same while editing it, but it should retain its fidelity once round-tripped back into the odt file.&nbsp; I believe we use version 1.2 of the OpenDocument format.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

            <p>Thanks Rob. Its good to know that the web app supports both but does it give you the option to save as either variant, i cant seem to find the option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One final question, do you know if there will be a patch/service pack&nbsp;to add (open/edit/save) functionality to office 2007 and 2010 for the Strict variant of OpenXML, I understand that only Office 2013 supports Strict OpenXML in full but not the older versions,
 if this is the case the two older office suites seem&nbsp;pretty much useless if you need to work to a defined standard for interoperability<font><font color="#000000"> pur</font></font>poses?. Any info you could share on this&nbsp;question
 would be welcome.</p>
