    <title>Windows won&#39;t log in to desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t log in to desktop</h2>
                    Last Wednesday, I was installing the windows updates as usual, was like 7 updates. It did the restart and was loading back in and was waiting for it to load to the user login screen and because I had to go, I stupidly turned the computer off thinking it
 had already finished the install, as it had already said it had 100% of the 3 stage update process. but when I got back latter that night it would not log in to desktop. It would get to the login screen as usual, but after logging in it would either get stuck
 on the "welcome loading screen or would load to a black screen with a cursor, no bars icons or anything would load.
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for some reason I had turned off System restore protection at the time, so I was unable to load a previous restore point. I went into safe mode, and tried, sfc /scannow (incase it did anything), uninstalled the updates I could, and used windows
 repair, nothing worked at first eventually I managed to get in. I then turned on system restore protection and reinstalled the updates and new ones. This time It wouldn't load to the login screen after update restart. so again had to turn the system off. And
 again after logging in, it would wither stay on the "Welcome" screen or load to a black screen with only a mouse cursor.
<br />
<br />
The last time I managed to get in was on Saturday which i got in using a combination of restore point (which I had turned on after the first problem), windows repair (which said there was no problems), sfc /scannow, even switching off and on the PSU power switch.
 - But i don't know specifically which one worked.<br />
Now I it only, after logging on, stays at "welcome" or loads to a black screen with a mouse cursor, even after trying all previously mentioned fixes.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to do a clean install, but will do that as a last option. Any one know a solution. any programs, able to identify errors stopping it from logging into desktop?<br />

            <p>Hi JimmyBrasco,</p>

<p>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please post your
 question in the TechNet Windows 7 Networking forum. </p>

                    <p>Spent an hour with Lenovo help desk and they said Windows 8 is not compatible with memory cards.&nbsp; This can't be correct.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to make Photo Importer display&nbsp;in English?&nbsp; Not using a cord or camera or anything.&nbsp; Plug the card directly into

            <p>Hello Sheila.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can understand your situation.&nbsp;Though there is no answer to the bug with the photo importer application in Lenovo systems, you may still try the following steps and check if they are helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the default by going through the Control Panel &gt; Hardware and sound &gt; Autoplay &gt; Change default settings for media &gt; Memory card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change it to import photos and videos (photos) and you will&nbsp;skip the foreign language although you could continue to guess your way through the photo importer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as suggested by Rizwan Pasha, you may also use the Photo Viewer application from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post back your results for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Removal of Bootup Message for jdy.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanlim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removal of Bootup Message for jdy.exe</h2>
                    Currently i have Avast Anti Virus installed in my computer, and it has found that jdy.exe is a malware and it has been moved to the Quarantine Chest.<br />
<br />
Further scans was made with Microsoft Malware Removal version 3.3 which is downloaded in the Microsoft Download Center, of which no more malware is found when a full scan is performed on the C drive.<br />
<br />
Whenever i reboot a popup message would appear in the screen with the following message:<br />
<br />
Windows cannot find "'C:\Documents and Settings\Ryan Lim Tian Loon\jdy.exe"'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the start button, and then click Search.<br />
<br />
Please advice, how do i remove this pop up message at the start of the boot up.

            The malware file is still set to run at Startup. I would do a bit more thorough malware removal work because the MSRT is very limited in its scope and Avast, while a good antivirus, isn't designed for non-viral malware. I would at least do the preparatory
 work and scan with Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware as described at this link:<br />

<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
Then, after you are sure the computer is clean, if you are still getting the message you can remove the Startup entry.<br />
<br />
<span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />

<p>Currently I have Vista Home Premium according to Upgrade Advisor my system will support Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. I do have a few questions on how and where to do this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is the product ID the same as the product key?</p>
<p><strong>No, the Product ID determines the channel from which the software is acquired, Retail, OEM, Volume License. It also determines the type of support you get. The Product Key is used to activate the software and pair it with your computer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Where can I find the product key if Vista was pre-installed when my system was purchased?</p>
<p><strong>Usually, this is found on the COA sticker attached to your computer, either at the top or side or in the battery or memory compartment if its a laptop.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Where do I download the upgrade to Windows 7?</p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 is not available for download, it is available as a retail package in limited stock.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How do I know if I have the full version of Windows Vista?</p>
<p><strong>If it came preinstalled on your computer, it is the full version.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If necessary, can Windows 7 still be purchased and how much will it cost?</p>
<p>You can find OEM System Builder software from dozens of online merchants. The current price for OEM Windows 7 Professional at Newegg, for example, is $140. When I checked a few minutes ago, Amazon was offering OEM Windows 7 Professional packages from multiple
 sellers at prices ranging from $101 to $150. When I checked just now, a package specifically intended for refurbished PCs cost only $50 for a 64-bit copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no technical limitations to prevent you from using OEM software on your own PC, although this software will work only for a clean installation and not for an upgrade. In the past, Microsoft has been remarkably inconsistent in its advice to customers
 about whether this practice is allowed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.<br />
<br />
Full version (Retail):<br />
<br />
- Includes transfer rights to another computer.<br />
- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.<br />
- Expensive<br />
<br />
Upgrade version (Retail):<br />
<br />
- Includes transfer rights to another computer.<br />
- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.<br />
- Expensive, but cheaper than full version<br />
<br />
OEM System Builder version:<br />
<br />
OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I would advise going back to the Xerox support center and asking them if there is even a driver for the scanner for Windows 7. There's a chance that the drivers that came over in support of this device were for the printer only. Another option would be to
 take a look at the Device Management Software download that Xerox offers. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.support.xerox.com/support/workcentre-pe120-pe120i/downloads/enus.html?operatingSystem=win7x64&amp;fileLanguage=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.xerox.com/support/workcentre-pe120-pe120i/downloads/enus.html?operatingSystem=win7x64&amp;fileLanguage=en</a></p>

<h2>            Blue Screen Error</h2>
                    I bought a lenovo laptop around early September. Within the first few weeks of purchase it did the whole restart and blue screen dealio. It's supposed to be a brand new computer. The only big thing i've downloaded is my antivirus. I didn't pay much attention
 cause I thought its new its just adjusting. It's been doing it for sometime now. I just want to see if there's anything

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the seller and Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. As OEM Lenovo is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs
 to resolve. Added the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Keep in mind the more you do the more they will claim it is something you have done.<br />

<h2>            Missed reward points for 3 years, since I went to xbox one.</h2>
                    <p>I have not been receiving reward points on any purchase for the past 3 years. Such as games purchased digitally, movie rentals and movie purchases, game add-ons and ect.... I specifically remember purchasing Garden Warfare 2 because it came with 20,000 points as a special and I never got those. I recently bought Battlefield 1 and it was supposed to come with 5 dollars worth of points with it. I only got points for surveys. I am very dissaticfied with xbox and the rewards program. please help me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Hello Wayngsta TC,</p>
<p>You can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the&nbsp;MyMissions&nbsp;page at&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-or-&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. By earning a one star&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders,&nbsp;in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for&nbsp;MyVIP.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>In&nbsp;September 2014&nbsp;we changed to the MyVIP policy.&nbsp;As a result, payback based off Gamerscore (MyAchievements) was discontinued. In September 2015, we made some refinements to the program. One change that happened was an adjustment of MyVIP purchase thresholds. If you did not reach any MyVIP ranks with your purchases from September 2014-August&nbsp;31st&nbsp;2015, you were placed at a default rank. Since you are a&nbsp;zero star&nbsp;member, you do not get payback Credits on your purchases. You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Regarding your offer Credits, there was no offer in March that would have awarded 20,000 Credits for a single purchase. The closest equivalent would have been the MicrosoftStore.com offer for 15,000 Credits, but that offer is for physical pre-orders only. The Battlefield 1 offer ended the first week of September. Since your purchase was made after this offer period, it was not eligible for that offer.</p>

            Hi tdehan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 version 1903, Microsoft have added ‘acrylic’, a visual design from the Fluent Design System, to the Login/Lock Screen Background. The translucent texture of this transient surface helps users focus on the Sign-in task by moving the actionable controls up in the visual hierarchy while maintaining the users’ accessibility. This behavior is By Design and expected if Transparency settings are enabled in Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors, since the Sign-in Screen will respect the transparency effect set. 
<br />
<br />If you don't like it:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt;  Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors
<br />Scroll down the toggle off 'Transparency'
<br />
<br />Keep in mind this will disable transparency throughout windows. You can't pick and choose where its enabled.

Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 41, 46, 1)">
I am using Windows 10 RS5 17713 build and setup windows hello(finger print and PIN) using my microsoft account, My device contains discrete TPM.<br />
I did Clear-TPM to clear everything from TPM, but still i can use my registered fingerprint to login.<br />
Does it mean Clear-TPM doesnt clear Windows Hello container from TPM or TPM is not at all used for windows hello even if device is TPM capable?</p>

            <p>Deleted Items is probably corrupt. In the off chance that you are keeping messages you want to save in Deleted Items, (a garbage pail), move them to a local folder you create and then do the following.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the DBX file for Deleted Items and delete it.&nbsp; A new one will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>General precautions for Outlook Express:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>
<p>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095</a></p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs and account setting changes. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently.

<h3> maynen93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 and Flight simulator x is not working correctly togheter.</h2>
                    There is a problem with Windows 7 and Flight simulator x togheter. <br />
The game crashes due to an error with win 7. <br />
The problem has been discussed and It has to do with the "UIAnimation.dll file that is
<br />
located in system32. <br />
But there is no solution to the problem, only some suggestions from users all over the world
<br />
that if you remove the dll file it will be solved or switch it with a Vista version of the file.<br />
<br />
<br />
The solutions works for different users but It's not a 100% working fix. Since I have paid for<br />
&nbsp;Windows 7 and a huge amount of people have this problem, we want a solution to this that works.
<br />
If It worked for XP then a there should not be so hard to fix this for those people who works
<br />
with this. Is windows 7 working with this already or what's going on? Is there already a fix
<br />
from windows 7? <br />
Users have suggested the following fixes: <br />
<br />
Run FSX in compability mode for windows 7! (Not working). <br />
<br />
Remove the dll file! (Worked in the beginning but had side effects <br />
like sceneries and objects in the game disapeared. And now It's crashing anyway.)
<br />
Switch the dll file with a vista file! (I dont have the vista dll file availeble so I can't do that.)
<br />
<br />
Reinstall FSX! (No because the same problem is showing up after the reinstallation and the
<br />
problem isn't that the game was installed incorrectly.) <br />
<br />
Ok so I hope I can get some feedback <br />
on this and like I said, many people have this problem. And there are many people who have
<br />
this problem. <br />
<br />

            Hello! Thanks for the reply!<br />
<br />
I'm using 64bit. FSX Deluxe edition. I took a look at the link you gave me. It says that the Deluxe Edition is not compatible. What exactly does this mean? Can I fix it somehow so it will be compatible?

            <p>According to my experience, for older programs stability to run in Windows 8 64bit, including Flight Simulator X ,
</p>
<p>it is best to install directly to Drive C:\ do not install into c:\Program Files or c:\Program Files (x86). This
</p>
<p>includes my stocks trading software it worked well now in Windows 8 64bit.</p>
<p><br />
Set the .exe file properties to C:\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator x\fsx.exe\Property\compatibility\Run this
</p>
<p>program in compatibility mode for\windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
For stability make changes to fsx.CFG, back-up before you do, set:</p>
<p>TEXTURE_BANDWIDTH_MULT=n (n=30-40 for dual core, 70-90 for quad core)</p>
<p><br />
The default is 250 that makes Flight Simulator X crash so easily, so in fsx.CFG change according to your video
</p>
<p>card memory, for example if your video card memory is 1 GB set to 1024 acordingly:</p>
<p>TEXTURE_MAX_LOAD=4096 (for 4096×4096 textures)<br />

<p>Новую тему создавать не стал. Купил на psngames.org GTA V. Прислали акк и пароль. Через 2 дня игра не запускается из-за возврата денег. Сапорт через несколько часов по моей просьбе дает новый акк. Через 3 дня игра не запускается опять по той же причине.
 Сейчас сапорт пишет, что такой игры в данный момент нет.</p>

<p><strong>Guinesseg</strong>, ну к данному вопросу (CDKeys) это не относится, т.к. там, (CDKeys) присылают эл.ключ на игру, а не связку аккаунт+ пароль, как вы описали (я так понял тот ресурс по играм для PS?). Подозреваю, что это из-за "угнанного" аккаунта
 - от сюда и проблемы, что через некоторое время игра и аккаунт исчезают...</p>
<p>Так что экономить (в наше время) нужно, но с умом.</p>

    <title>language and keyboard layout keeps changing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            language and keyboard layout keeps changing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read through a lot of forum posts but nothing really seems to help for this slightly annoying problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 PCs and 1 surface tablet. They all run windows 8.1 but one of the PCs has a Germany IBM keyboard attached while the other PC has a US keyboard. I use a German keyboard because it has special characters that English keyboards don't have in case I
 want to write something in my native language. I live in Australia so I install the English version of every application or for windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I log into all 3 computers with the same credentials. Almost every time I use any of them the keyboard and language settings are almost randomly changed to something not very helpful for this computer. Windows even added a third layout (US, US) which I can't
 remember to have chosen by myself.<br />
</p>
<p>I thought it might have to do with using the same account on different PC's. So I set the advanced settings for each computer to override "the default" input method or language. This didn't help. It still switches language and keyboard constantly. Where
 does windows get "the default" from? From my account I log in with? Is this a restriction in my account? Can I only &nbsp;choose one input method for all computers I work for or do I have to change this every time I use another computer if they have different keyboards
 attached?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really understand the idea behind this. Why would I want to use a German keyboard layout on a PC that has a US keyboard attached. Does Microsoft assume that we bring our keyboard to every PC we use? I understand that this could be helpful for tablets
 with no physical keyboard. But for a PC with a physical keyboard attached it doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or do I miss something here. How can I make the PC not care about what keyboard I have attached to another PC?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Stefan&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but I tried your suggestions already. Having it set per application would make it even more confusing because I would need to change it for each application I use (eg. Internet explorer, mail, office etc.) on every device. I need it
 too be set per PC and not per application.<br />
</p>
<p>I think it started with windows 8.1 being used on all 3 computers now and logging on with the same profile everywhere. When I had windows 7 installed on my PC #1 with the German keyboard attached and logged on with a local profile it did not change unless
 I wanted to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be that I have a PC with a German keyboard attached and another PC plus a surface tablet with an US keyboard. I use the same login for all three machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after I use the surface tablet it looks like my other PC with the German keyboard attached is set to US keyboard layout and the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable this functionality? I *always* use the German keyboard on PC #1 while I use US keyboards on the other 2 machines. All 3 machines have English as the main language set and that's fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable the automatic language change? The settings seem to be saved in my windows login profile (@live.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Stefan</p>

            I am experiencing the same problem with my two different PC's, one bought from the US and one from Germany. Which means I have one US keyboard layout and one German keyboard layout. If I'm logged in from the German-layout PC I have to switch the keyboard
 to German; than say if I log in to the other (USA) PC afterwards (after logging out from the German one) then I have to set the US keyboard. Apparently my Outlook account uses same keyboard layout one I select from either of the PC, also on the one which is
 using the other one. I couldn't find any selection on the net about this.<br />

However this is what I would do if my own brand new computer had that issue, Been there, done that and learned the hard way what can happen during the procedure as well as further down the road.
<br />
<br />Since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact System Maker's Support and the seller. As OEM they are responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance. Feedback definitely helps us help all.

<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

            Hi Anne.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Exact same error was solved here by doing a Repair Install:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/the-exception-unknown-software-exception/20960c54-bb0b-4854-a64c-1c2845c16949">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />You can first go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />But If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />
<br />Since its a new laptop, I would attempt a factory reset to see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br />See instructions how to do that:
