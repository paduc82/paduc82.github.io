    <title>files on CD-RW say &#34;waiting to be written to disc&#34; -- how do I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            files on CD-RW say &#34;waiting to be written to disc&#34; -- how do I do that&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if this seems simplistic or has been previously addressed, but I couldn't find the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have put files onto a CD-RW (Windows 7 desktop) by "Save as" in an Adobe InDesign document, as well as by copying the same document from&nbsp;my file folder contents list and pasting it onto disc's open window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously "saved as" documents from a few days ago, read "Files contained on disc" in the Location column.&nbsp; However, the newer docs -- both "saved as" and "pasted," read "files waiting to be written to disc."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the differerence? They open up okay.&nbsp; I occasionally get a window pop-up from lower task bar which reads "Files waiting to be burned to disc -- click this balloon to see list" but nothing opens up when I click on the balloon (maybe because DVD/CD
 window is open??)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an icon on CD window for "Burn to disc" -- when I click on that, it rejects the current disc and reads "Insert a disc. you can't write more files to this disc because it has already been finalized (which I didn't do anything to finalize it) - please
 insert a writable disc. Could I somehow have finalized it without realizing it? (How do you finalize?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My concern is that I want to make sure the latest, unwritten files are safe, as they are for back-up. Should I write onto a new disc anyway?????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!!</p>

            Hi Annie,
<br />
<br />When all else fails, the manual approach is your best option to transfer the files, the built in Photos App can be a bit unreliable, and you will have more control over the files are transferred . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Fie Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar) 
<br />
<br />On the left click 'This PC' 
<br />
<br />On the right double click your device or the DCIM folder (whichever shows up) 
<br />
<br />Then simple select the files you want to transfer and drag them into the Pictures folder in the left pane of File Explorer 
<br />
<br />That's it!       
        </p>

<h3> slark101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 52 - USB ports not recognizing connected USB devices stating that &#34;Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Error Code 52 - USB ports not recognizing connected USB devices</p>
<p>I have recently purchased a new laptop with Windows 7 and had no initial problems connecting USB devices (mouse, hard drive, camera etc.) to the ports. Since installing a number of windows updates none of my USB ports will now recognize any hardware that
 is connected to them.<br />
<br />
The error code is quoted as follows <strong>"Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious
 software from an unknown source. (Code 52".<br />
<br />
</strong>I have been into Device Manager and notice that each USB icon has a yellow exclamation mark icon next to it. I have uninstalled each USB port and scanned for hardware changes which has no positive affect. I have also tried to 'Update driver software'
 in device manager and again this tells me that the driver is up-to-date for each USB port.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Boot into
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Advanced Boot Options</span></a></strong> and disable driver signing checking.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer
 and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disabling driver signature enforcement has helped a lot of users in fixing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also delete the USB "Upper Filter" &amp; "Lower Filter" Entry and check if that helps.

<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to the USB Recovery Drive which you are supposed to create on a flash drive, not an external hard Drive?</p>
<p>Microsoft warns about Data being deleted.</p>

<p>Creating a recovery drive will erase anything already stored on your USB flash drive. Use an empty USB flash drive or make sure to transfer any important data from your USB flash drive to another storage device before using it to create a

<div>which has a list of codecs supported "in-box". </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But for your purposes, since you can't find a Windows Store app that can add</div>
<div>midi functionality, then you won't be able to play midi files on your RT device.</div>

            Hi IronBreed76
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's execute following steps for this problem. Please update me once done.
<br />
<br />1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to invoke Task Manager &gt; Go to the “Processes” tab &gt; See which programs are currently running in the background of the system and     If you found an app that uses Camera, end that program
<br />
<br />2. Reset Camera app 
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; Scroll down and click Camera&gt; Click Advanced options &gt; Click Reset &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and Reinstall Camera app
<br />A. Uninstall
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter 
<br />Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsCamera | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />B. Reinstall
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter 
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.WindowsCamera | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />4.Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices
<br />Locate your Webcam
<br />Right click &gt; Roll Back
<br />If Roll back doesn't work - Right click &gt; Update Driver
<br />If above doesn't work, go to your computer manufacturer's website, download latest webcam driver and install
<br />
<br />5. Turn off your Antivirus temporarily and test. Your camera may get blocked by AV. Don't forget to turn on AV after the testing is over.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<br />
I just went from XP Pro to Windows 7 on my Sony Vaio PCV-RZ24G desktop.&nbsp; The only drivers I can't find are Multimedia Video Controller and SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio.&nbsp; Are there drivers available for these with Windows 7?&nbsp; Any help will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;
 Thank you.

            Video drivers.. can be one of two.. <br />
<br />
nVidia = <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index5.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index5.aspx?lang=en-us</a><br />
<br />
SIS = <a href="http://www.sis.com/download/agreement.php?url=/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sis.com/download/agreement.php?url=/download/</a><br />
<br />
Bear in mind that Sony didn't even supply drivers for Windows Vista for your model. It is not a good candidate for upgrading to Windows 7. If neither of the above web sites have anything that works, you may have to lok for a 3rd party Windows 7 compatible video
 card, assuming that your computer has a free slot for one. Check the manual.. <br />
<br />
For sound, I can't find anything for SoundMax. Again, you may have to look for a 3rd party Windows 7 compatible sound card.<br />
<br />
Try running Windows Update for drivers related to both elements. If you have no luck, the alternative is to re-install XP..

 I do not receive any Windows update errors.&nbsp; At the Windows Update page it says "Updates were installed:&nbsp; Never"<br />
<br />
My other Windows Vista machines have received updates since 10/24/2009.<br />

Can you Validate at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/</a>?<br />
<br />
What Windows version (e.g., WinXP 64-bit SP2; Vista&nbsp;Home Basic 32-bit) was installed on the computer
<br />
Did you format the HDD prior to installing Vista Ultimate 64-bit SP2?<br />
<br />
Did you purchase&nbsp;&amp; install&nbsp;an Anytime Upgrade?</p>

I formatted the HDD prior to performing a clean installation of Vista Ultimate 64bit and Vista 64 bit SP2 from CD/DVD.<br />
<br />
I did not purchase an "Anytime Upgrade".<br />
<br />
Thank you for the responses.<br />

Any other ideas?

            Part of the Reset is (re)installing WUAgent v7.4.7600.266, if necessary.&nbsp; If you weren't able to install it manually, I'd doubt&nbsp;a Reset will float your boat. YMMV, of course.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How did you reset Reliability monitor?</p>
<p>2. What exact alert was set on the Event Viewer and what changes have been made recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>If you have not followed these steps to reset, follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
a. Press <strong>Windows key+R </strong>key to open <strong>Run.</strong>
<p>b. Now, type <strong>%programdata%\Microsoft\RAC</strong>.</p>
<p>c. In the RAC folder, you will find Outbound, PublishedData, StateData and&nbsp;Temp.</p>
<p>d. Now, delete the folders.</p>
<p><span>e. Restart the computer.<br />
Now, check this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may take Reliability Monitor a few to 24 hours to display results again after
<br />
being reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, run a System File Checker(SFC) scan to check for any corrupt system files.</p>
<p><strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong></p>

            Hi,<br />
I restored the system image saved with virgin SO, I did some tests and see the results in the following images.
<br />
Hello<br />
<br />
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1oAHYjK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://1drv.ms/1oAHYjK</a><br />
<br />
<br />
New: SO performed the basic configuration 05/luglio/2014, Update "Windows Update 8.1 (KB2919355)" removed on 07/luglio/2014 h:10:00 before and after clearing all the errors in the Event Viewer!<br />
New1: This appears when I press "View reliability history"<br />
New2: Installed update "Windows Update 8.1 (KB2919355)" to h 10:15: and this is the result.<br />
New3: h:10:30 The image "New1" no longer appears by pressing the "View reliability history", and after clearing all the errors in the Event Viewer this is the result!!!<br />
Is that clear?

    <title>SideWinder X8 Symbols&#47;Charging&#47;Batteries query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjohns86  say:</h3>
<h2>            SideWinder X8 Symbols&#47;Charging&#47;Batteries query</h2>
                    <p>Evening,</p>
<p>I'd like to know what the various symbols that appear in the display window on the left side of the mouse mean - two keep popping up in particular; the first is an outline of a battery that has a small line at the bottom (assuming it means batteries are
 empty?) The second is again a battery outline with a lightning bolt inside (assuming it means charging?). The flashing that accompanies these lights varies; sometimes it's rapid flashing, other times a slow fade/pulse.</p>
<p>If I am correct in my assumptions, I seem to be having issues keeping the batteries charged - how long should fully charged batteries last in this mouse, on average? (I realise without giving the specs of the batteries that this might be a variable answer).</p>
<p>Finally; are HR6 and LR6 batteries interchangeable for the X8? I've been lead to believe that LR6 batteries are single-use, yet these are what the user manual calls for and specifies that they are the&nbsp;<strong>only
</strong>battery to be used. I find this odd (and perhaps it's just my battery ignorance here) that single-use batteries are recommended for a device that recharges...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clarification on the above would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The product guide is where I saw the reference for "only" LR6 - the documentation does not answer my question.</p>
<p>The quick start guide mentions amber lights flash when the mouse needs charging, doesn't describe or explain the symbols - the documentation does not answer my question.</p>
<p>The Technical Data sheet mentions batteries but does not give a code, only that AA are to be used - the documentation does not answer my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even stated in my question that I have read the user manual (product guide). Your response did not seem to factor that in whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, please could you give "further" assistance; i.e, some.</p>

            <p>You're not actually reading my question.</p>
<p>I am asking for confirmation regarding the symbols, not the lights.</p>
<p>I am asking about battery types and if they are interchangeable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty clear that you're either not reading my question properly, not understanding my question or just using macro responses. You might as well troll me with "Let me Google that for you" at this point because you're being completely unhelpful.</p>

</p><p>Consider the topic closed, I'll go somewhere else and ask for help. Shame the "official" website for the product has such clueless representatives.</p>

            Mr. John. You're absolutely right, I have the same mouse X 8 and the same problems. Did the bridge, did not help. This is a mistake in the production. China assembly and lack of proper control. Is current company to admit their mistakes, and do recall
 the goods free repair regardless of warranty. Company Sony and repair matrix camera free cash pay, I give up after 7 years and have done for free. Shame on your company.

<p><span>Hi
<span>djtonystar,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>You won't be able to convert the word document to jpeg format using word. However It is possible to convert a Microsoft Word document into the JPEG
 picture format using the Microsoft Paint application.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Word document you want to convert to a JPEG.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Make sure all the content you want in the JPEG can be seen on the screen. Anything you cannot see on the screen will not be included in the JPEG. To get
 more onto the screen, use the "Zoom" option to zoom out. To make any features bigger on the JPEG, zoom in.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Find the
<strong>"Print Screen</strong>" key on the keyboard. This key is usually located at the top of the keyboard above the arrow keys.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Press
<strong>"Print Screen</strong>." This will copy the viewable contents of the Word document.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Open
<strong>Microsoft Paint</strong>. Paint is located on the <strong>
Start menu under "Programs and Accessories</strong>."</span></p>
<p><span>6. Choose "<strong>Paste</strong>" from the Edit menu in Paint. The picture of the Word document you copied will be pasted into Paint.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Crop out the parts of the document you do not want. You may not want portions of the Word document such as the menus. To crop, use the Select tool, which
 is the dotted line rectangle, to select what you want to crop out. Then, choose "Copy" from the Edit menu, "New" from the File menu and then "Paste" from the Edit menu.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Convert the Word document to a JPEG by saving the document. Choose "Save" from the File menu. Type in the name you want to save the document as and choose
 "JPEG" from the drop-down menu.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is useful.</span></p>

<h2>            Halo&#58; The Master Chief Collection for PC.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i was going to send an email to Microsoft, but it wouldn't go through. and this looked like the best way to contact them. Excuse me if this in the wrong section, i am new to the community.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
</div>
<div>
Hello. My name is Caleb. I am 10 years old, and i just want to say,</div>
<div>
I absolutely LOVE the halo series, And i am a PC gamer at heart, so you can imagine my disappointment when i saw Halo: The Master Chief collection was a XBOX ONE exclusive. I know, you probably will not release a game just because a little kid sent you an email
 asking for it, I'm just saying, Halo started on pc, it should have this game. I am sorry to say i own a ps3, i only have it because of how cheap it was atm. My family is more or less poor, and i am saving up all my money to get a gaming pc. I really, really
 dont want to spend 349 dollars for a console that will only be used for Halo. There's a petition online for it to be released, with 10.000+ signatures! Please, let us finish the fight. I will gladly buy it on release day.</div>
<div>
Heck, i spend 2 hours a day, playing Halo: Combat Evolved. I was an Xbox kid before, and Halo 3 defined my childhood. The music brings back so many memories, making mines and telling my friends that are new to the game they give superpowers, making levels,
 i was DEVOTED to my xbox, then one day, it broke. I had to bang on the xbox to make the games run, and they didn't work 99 percent of the time. My brother found a ps3 on craigslist for 100 dollars. We had to change. Here is a picture of my mint condition Original
 Xbox, and drawings of Master Chief. If this is the end of Halo, let us PC gamers Finish the Fight.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
-Sincerely, Caleb.</div>

            I'm sorry to tell you this but it'll probably never happen. &nbsp;Halo is microsofts biggest exclusive. &nbsp;Microsoft uses it ro sell its own hardware. &nbsp;Its simple competition. &nbsp;If i can buy every xbox one game on steam why buy an xboz one. &nbsp;Same goes for the
 ps4. &nbsp;Its all about exclusives.

<h2>            Can&#39;t access more than 2TB of HD.  Known MBR limitations. Tried GPT of the disk...no luck.</h2>
                    I have read community questions/discussions on known limitations of MBR related 2TB limit.
<div>I have Win7 Ultimate x64.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a 3TB Hard Drive. &nbsp;Going into diskmanagement utility, I see "grayed out" 800MB unallocated space. &nbsp;However, I can not assign "simple volume" or drive letter to it. Obviously, the 2TB MBR can not be "extended" to include this additional 800MB space.
 &nbsp;All options for that unallocated space are grayed out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I tried few other options and I got 0x80042468 error - so I followed advice at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2604034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2604034</a>, went back to reformatting the HD and converted the entire HD to "gpt" (GUID
 Partition Table). &nbsp;It successfully converted to gpt. &nbsp;Then I go back, re-install Win7 U x64 - and everything is back to square one. &nbsp;The unallocated space is grayed out and I can not assign a simple volume/drive letter. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What am I missing, Microsoft?</div>

<p>This does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run cmd and computer mgmt as administrator.&nbsp; During <em>diskpart</em>, I can select disk 0 (I only have 1 disk, part of it is reserved for system - 100MB, rest 2TB is MBR and additional 746MB is unallocated). Once I
<em>select disk 0</em>, the <em>clean</em> command returns an error saying - "Virtual Disk Service Error: Clean is not allowed on the disk containing the current boot, system, pagefile, crashdump or hibernation volume".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, I can not run <em>convert gpt</em> either.&nbsp; Convert gpt gives similar error: "Virtual Disk Service error: the operation is not allowed on a disk that ocntains a pagefile volume".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what do we do?</p>

            Hi  Leslie_xyz
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />The Visual C++ Redistributable is a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file required by programs or games built using Microsoft's Visual Studio software development environment. When a program requires a DLL or some other supporting file to run, this is called a dependency. The MSVCR.DLL stands for:
<br />
<br />MS - Microsoft
<br />V - Visual
<br />C - C++
<br />R - Redistributable.
<br />
<br />Browsing your Apps and Features Setting or Programs and Features Control Panel, you might see multiple versions of the redistributable installed. A particular app installed might be utilizing one of them, so, removing any version can cause an application to malfunction. Some apps might even require updated versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable such as 2010 SP1 or 2012 Update 4.
<br />
<br />A DLL helps app creators efficiently reuse common components that make a program work. Instead of reinventing the wheel and bloating their code each time, developers can reuse the libraries in the MSVCR.dll. This in return can reduce the size of a program and provide better performance and memory utilization. Some applications are written using specific versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable. If your computer does not have the full Visual C++ development program installed (which you likely won't unless you are a software developer), a program will come with what is called a Runtime Component to facilitate that particular program. The Runtime Components are just the essential pieces of code that make the software work.
<br />
<br />The error indicates that a particular version of the Visual C++ Redistributable required by the program you are attempting to install is either corrupt or missing. In this case, MSVCR110 represents the Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable. Other versions include:
<br />
<br />MSVCR71.dll, MSVCR08.dll, MSVCR09.dll (2008 or 2010)
<br />MSVCR120.dll (2012)
<br />MSVCR130.dll (2013)
<br />MSVCR140.dll (2015)
<br />
<br />you can download the version required by the application. The program will indicate the version of the file required if an error pops up during or when executing the app. Users should also be aware that some programs might require either the 32 or 64-bit architecture.
<br />
<br />Below are links to download the appropriate redistributable for the version you might be attempting to install:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable (x86)

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I downloaded the VCC+ 2017 and also Intel driver upgrade.&nbsp; Problem appears to be that designated video RAM is only 32 mb, and I need 512 mb.&nbsp; I edited the register and checked BIOS for option to increase designated RAM, but no luck.&nbsp;
 Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform Automatic repair from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and check if this helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To perform Automatic repair on Windows 8.1 computer follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.</span></li><li><span>The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer.

Hi Sara. Thanks for the reply. The information about my computer is<br />
<br />
ASUS ROG GL551 series GL551JM-DH71 Gaming Laptop Intel Core i7 4710HQ (2.50GHz) 16GB Memory 1TB HDD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M 2GB 15.6" Windows 8.1 64-Bit<br />
<br />
I was able to use the Refresh option to get my computer back to its initial state. This did uninstall all of the programs I installed, but I had all of my data backed up so I didn't lose anything.<br />
<br />
It is interesting that the only <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/SingleProductReview.aspx?reviewid=4180575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
review for this laptop at newegg</a> is by somebody who was having the problem of getting DRIVER_POWER_STATE_ERROR Blue Screens. I was also getting these errors as he describes until my computer degenerated into blue screen problems on boot up. I fully expect
 that I will start getting those problems again.<br />

Be sure to check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems), their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any)<br />
about any known issues. Be sure to update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers,
<br />
and the other major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Those alone may
<br />
resolve some or all of these issues.<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop <br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>
