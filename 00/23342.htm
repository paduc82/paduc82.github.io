    <title>Digitally organize labels for printing and cutting. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Digitally organize labels for printing and cutting.</h2>
                    <p>I have a set of labels I print out that are&nbsp;3 columns across and 4 rows down.</p>
<p>Every six months I have to print out labels to disseminate to individual people.</p>
<p>The number or people and thus pages might grow or shrink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I've&nbsp; printed the labels I use a paper cutter to get them all cut out then I begin the arduous task of trying to organize them.</p>
<p>If I have them in alphabetical order the labels will populate such that "A" starts in the top row of Column A. B would be placed in Column B Row 1 and so on. Once I take all of these papers put them on a cutter and cut them into stacks, almost all the formatting
 is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It occurs to me that the formatting is not random. If I were to set it such that it figured out how many pages there were going to be it could organize the labels such that "A" would start on Row 1 Column A, but "B" would be on Row 1 Column A of Page 2.
 Thus when cut in the paper cutter the stack of labels would be in the correct order.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone devised how to do this?</p>

            <p>So you don't mind 'wasting' paper?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I understand correctly, you want to print out a whole set at a time, then start the next set for the next user? How many sets do you typically print?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a printer with more than one tray?&nbsp; Put colored paper in one tray, then print a colored "cover" page between each set.&nbsp; That would make it easier to separate the sets.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is the document set up to create these columns? Are you using a table or the "columns" feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you need to insert a page break between alphabet letters. The specific type of break depends on the way you have the document structured.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, could you upload a short example document showing the document organization so we can play with it.

            <p>No, I must not have described it properly. Sorry. Let me give some context.</p>
<p>In my office we have property that belongs to the company, cell phones, laptops, iPads...</p>
<p>We issue this property to people and security checks for property tags as they leave. This property tag is simply a label with identifying information. These tags expire every 6 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a label with the employee name, item serial number and other such information.</p>
<p>I like to organize the labels by office number. That way I can walk around the office and hand out the new labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think about how the labels are going to print in a mail merge they print Column A Row 1, Column B Row 1 and so on.</p>
<p>However if I were to print 13 pages of labels and then use a cutter to cut all 13 pages at once, the stacks would be out of order.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case there are 3 Columns and 4 rows on each page, so there are 12 labels per page.</p>
<p>Once they are cut the label on the top of the stack will match line 1 on my merged spreadsheet. The second label in the pile will match line 13 of my spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking for a way to make it so that after I cut all 13 pages on the cutter, the stack would be in order. That wouldn't be so hard if I knew that there would always be 13 pages. However, the number of pages changes depending on how many employees have
 been hired or have separated. </p>
<p>So I'm trying to figure out how to have word merge the spread sheet and figure out how many total pages there will be which should be the total number of rows on the spreadsheet divided by 12 (the number of labels per page). By doing that it would come up
 with the number of pages(I'll pretend it came up with 13). Then it would say, Put line&nbsp;1 from the source spreadsheet on&nbsp;Column A, Row 1 of page 1, then skip 12 rows and put line 13 on Column A, Row 1 of page 2. It would continue this 13 times. The 14th line
 of the spread sheet would appear on Column B Row 2 of Page one and the process would repeat. That way when I put the 13 sheets in the cutter and cut them the stacks I would have would already be in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make more sense?</p>

            <p>How about adding a helper column to sort on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You determine the number of you will print then number the lines that way that forces them to sort the way you want.
<br />
</p>
<p>For discussion sake lets say you have 3 offices / pages you want to stack.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f566740-4176-472d-995f-63885bf61db3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f566740-4176-472d-995f-63885bf61db3" /></a></p>
<p>The first box is how you enter data by Office</p>
<p>Second box I've added the sort helper column</p>
<p>Third box I've sorted on the helper column</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to either add manual page breaks or pad the pages with blank lines.

    <title>Sharepoint&#47;Teams Person Column Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james gira  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint&#47;Teams Person Column Issue</h2>
                    <p>So here is the problem, we have a SharePoint/Teams site created and a custom list there.&nbsp; The list uses Person or Group columns and works great, but only for owners and not users.&nbsp; When an owner looks at the list, everything looks as it should but when a
 user goes to the same list, the Person or Group fields are all blank.&nbsp; I have confirmed that owners do not have a problem and that this is a permissions issue but am unsure where the issue actually lies.&nbsp; Users have Edit permissions for the site and the List
 Permissions are standard (Manage Lists, Add Items, Edit Items, Delete Items, View Items, Open Items, View Versions, Delete Versions, Create Alerts and View Application Pages).&nbsp; When users enter data, the field works as it should and allows them to search and
 select a user for the field.&nbsp; When they save the record and return to the list view, the data appears to be gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><span>Hi James,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your query in Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your descriptions, I created a MS Teams site, then add a custom list app, then add a Person or Group column, test and I have no issue to see the data with site owner account or the site member account. This seems not an issue can be reproduced,
 and it should not be related to permission. It seems more like a display issue specific to this column.
</span></p>
<p><span>To further narrow down the issue, please help us collect information below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Please switch between classic experience and modern experience to see whether the issue happening to both.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Please create a new person or group column and check whether the issue happens to this new created one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

    <title>Using Windows Device Recovery Tool to update AT&#38;T Lumia 635 Go - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daviddubya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows Device Recovery Tool to update AT&#38;T Lumia 635 Go Phone to Denim</h2>
                    <p>I have read the <strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool</strong> is one method that can be used to force an update to Denim on an AT&amp;T Lumia 635 Go Phone.&nbsp; As frequently discussed in this and other&nbsp;similar forums, the AT&amp;T 635 Go Phone has not been updated
 to Denim - yet.&nbsp; There seems to be some question as to when, if ever, the Denim update will be provided for this Go Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the <strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool</strong>&nbsp;to get to Denim, will my phone continue to get subsequent updates, such as Windows 10?&nbsp; Or will I be required to use
<strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool</strong> to&nbsp;install new updates post-Denim?&nbsp; Here's a link to the
<strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool</strong>&nbsp; page:</p>

            <p>Epstein - Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have seen several discussions about Denim on the AT&amp;T Lumia 635 Go Phone.&nbsp; The suggestions range from wait until the update is available from AT&amp;T, which could be never, to forcing an update to Denim by at least 3 different
 methods.&nbsp; Those methods include using Windows Device Recovery Tool to force the update, which you indicated will not get the job done.&nbsp; Another suggestion is to unbrand or debrand the phone which involves a&nbsp;rather complicated procedure, and might be irreversible.&nbsp;
 A third suggestion was to unlock the phone and reinstall the software, which might be the same as unbranding/debranding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reliable way to upgrade the AT&amp;T Lumia 635 Go Phone to Denim, that&nbsp;allows getting subsequent updates, including Windows 10?&nbsp; Or do I just wait and see what AT&amp;T decides to do about Denim on this phone?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">We appreciate your efforts in bringing this matter to our attention.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you wish to change the default folder where you attach your files in Outlook.com. However, I find your next statements confuing. Please bear with me.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>"I thought windows was supposed to remember the last folder which I opened but it doesn't."</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To verify, when you said windows, did you mean Windows as the operating system?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>"I was able to specify the default folder prior to my having to do a system restore due to another problem."</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Just to clarify, where do you access your account, via<font color="#000000"> w</font><font><font color="#000000"><font>eb browser (Outlook.com), through a Mail Client such as Windows Live Mail
 or a Mail App (via mobile device)? How did you perform a system restore in Outlook.com? What is the "another problem" that you've encountered?</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We would highly appreciate if you could give the exaxt error message that you are getting (if any) prior to this issue.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Please be informed that there's no way you can move, rename or delete folders like Inbox, Junk, Drafts as well as Deleted and Sent folders in Outlook.com. However, you can manage subfolders. You can create New subfolder by right clicking on any of
 the Main folders.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us and for clarifying what it is that you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon silmulation,&nbsp;when you click Insert to select files as attachments, the Windows Explorer will display the location/library where the items (files/folders)&nbsp;are previously opened/selected. It is by default.&nbsp;For example, you've inserted a file as attachment
 that is located in the Pictures library. If you wish to add a file again as attachment, you will be directed to Pictures library where you've previously opened/selected a file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I try it insert a file i am directed to the desktop where my specified file is located. I can then open that file and ad the docs with in that file. I am trying to get it to skip the step where it goes to the desktop. I want the default file to

            In general, if something works in safe mode and not when booted normally, the cause is some kind of add-in or driver.&nbsp; Boot normally, but disable your browser add-ins.&nbsp; What happens then?

            You cannot be having "the same issue". &nbsp;This forum (and thread) is about Outlook.com, the web-based mail service. &nbsp;Your problem is about Office Outlook, which is completely unrelated. &nbsp;I'll be glad to move your post to the Office Outlook forum if you explain
 clarly what the problem is.

                    <p>I am trying to convert Powerpoints from other authors into the Presenter add-on to be scormed.&nbsp; The default audio type is M4A, which cannot be read by Presenter. I am using Powerpoint 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change the default audio type to MP3 or WAV so that Presenter can import it? Or any other suggestions as to how to handle this?&nbsp; I believe they are recording with Insert&gt;Audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am currently downloading the individual files, converting them one by one and uploading them into Presenter. There must be a better way! Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 not able to send emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded my laptop to windows 10 about 6 months ago and outlook was working fine. However, its been a month now and i'm not able to send emails using outlook. However, when I used the native mail program or O365 web client, it works fine. I have already
 uninstalled and installed the outlook multiple times. I have a also run the sfc /scan multiple times. I have tried many things but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, I changed the setting to not use cached mode recently and it started working fine. But the performance is really very slow. hence I had to change it back to use cached mode in outlook. Now it stopped working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account type configured on outlook 2016 is Microsoft exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>

I understand that you canâ€™t send emails out from the Outlook 2016 client. Based on my experience, I suggest you first make sure that

the Outlook client is up to date</a> and try the SARA tool to check and fix the possibly existing issues in the Outlook client. You can refer to the article to download the tool and then choose to check â€˜I have issues sending and receiving mailsâ€™ option as
 the screenshot below:<br />

            <span>Hi Avinash,<br />
<br />
I understand that you have already ran the SARA tool and got no positive outcome. So I would consider that whether the Outlook profile data could have some issue when you upgraded your operate system. So I would suggest you refer to the article below to create
 a new profile and add your Office 365 account into this new profile:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create profile and set up an e-mail account in Outlook</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists in the new profile, I would suggest you use the fix it tool to completely uninstall the client and then download the Office suite from Office 365 portal again.<br />

<h2>            &#91;Sakha Language&#93; Is it possible to create a language pack of my own native language&#63;</h2>
                    Is it possible to create a language pack of my own native language?<br />
I know that my nation (unfortunately) are living on the territory of Russia. Simply Russia does not support (perhaps not even permit) the native languages of indigenous peoples in recent years.&nbsp;But the presence of the Tatar language (also in Russia) convinced
 me that our (Sakha) language can be promoted too.<br />
Can I participate in the translation?<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the Sakha language is available in the language pack of the Windows 10 you could add that language and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Start</strong> button and then <strong>Control Panel.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Language </strong>and then <strong>Add</strong> language.</li><li>Select the <strong>Sakha</strong> language and then <strong>Add.</strong></li><li>The language will be added to your language list.</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful in regarding the adding of the Sakha language. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, weâ€™ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

Are you saying you installed the Sakha pack and it's not your language or is it just a keyboard layout, can you give us a few more details also you might want to post this in Feedback Hub

            It says "Language pack is unavailable", and I have only a keyboard layout instead of full interface translation. Simply there is no Language Pack for this language, and my question is "How can I participate in an interface translation to Sakha language?"

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.
</span><span>However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Is the issue specific to some sites or issue is with all websites?</span></li><li>
<span>Are you getting any error message/code while opening those websites?</span></li><li>
<span>Do you have any security software installed?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry, to know that you are facing this issue. It might be caused due to changes in Internet Explorer settings, some add-ons also may cause this issue. If the issue is specific to some websites
 then it might be due to compatibility. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to run the fixit provided in the following article and see if it helps you to fix the issue. This fixit diagnose and repair IE problems that make IE slow, not secure, unstable or crash,
 caused by add-ons not working or inappropriate security settings. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Fix Internet Explorer issues to make IE fast, safe and stable</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Fixit doesn't help, lets try these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There could possibly be a problematic add-on which might be causing the problem. Letâ€™s try the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer
 in <strong><span>No Add-ons</span></strong> mode. If the problem is not present in No Add-ons mode we can diagnose that it is an add-on that is causing the issue, and from there we can take steps to locate and disable
 the add-on. To open <strong><span>Internet Explorer</span></strong> in
<strong><span>No Add-ons mode</span></strong>, please do the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet&nbsp;Explorer icon on the taskbar.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click the <strong>
<span>Tools</span></strong> button, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Manage add-ons</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Under <strong><span>Show</span></strong>, tap or click
<strong><span>All add-ons</span></strong>, and then select the add-on you want to turn off.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click <strong>
<span>Disable</span></strong>, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Close</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<strong><span>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></strong></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more clarification you may refer to the link provided below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Delete the browser cache and check. Follow these steps to do so.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Start Internet Explorer 11.<br />
b. On the <strong><span>Tools </span></strong>menu, click
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong>. If you can't see the Tools menu, press Alt to display the menus.<br />
c. Click the <strong><span>General</span></strong> tab.<br />
d. Under <strong><span>Browsing History</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Delete</span></strong>.<br />
e. In the <strong><span>Delete Browsing History</span></strong> dialog box, click to select the following check boxes, and then click
<strong><span>Delete:</span></strong><strong><br />
<strong><span>Temporary Internet Files , Cookies , History</span></strong></strong><br />
f. Click <strong><span>Close</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong> to close the
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong> dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persists and the issue is specific to some websites then&nbsp;I would suggest you to open that websites in compatibility view and see if it helps.

<h3> simonrad99  say:</h3>
<h2>            critical emails lost after upgrade to outlook from hotmail</h2>
                    <p>I have just realised that I have lost nearly 4000 emails, many of which were critical for my business and personal affairs after I was virtually forced to upgrade to Outlook from hotmail. I have used hotmail on PC many times in last 365 days, and have tried
 recovering deleted email (just recovered 154 emails which I meant to delete).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can you help as a matter of urgency. I also pay to be a hotmail plus user, mainly as this email account is used for my business also, but I cant see what good that does.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can someone help ?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I already had my mobile phone configured for hotmail, i simply have the option to delete from server when removed from inbox set. This ensure that emails I delete from the phone are removed from server copy (or go into deleted folder). This should not
 cause nearly&nbsp;4000 mails to suddenly dissapear (all mails prior to 14th August seem to have gone from Inbox, but not folders)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I am fairly certain I havent been hacked, and having seen a number of other posts this seems to be a problem specific to migrating to Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) I have no email rules set up to delete anything</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please can you suggest how i can recover?</p>

<br />
<br />What i can recommend you is:
<br />
<br />Try deleting OneNote and reinstalling it?
<br />Check if it has last update?
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day

<p>My company is using Office 365 version 15.15 utilizing Microsoft Azure to actively synchronize to AD every 3 hours. The problem is that whenever someone changes their AD password it does not sync to Office 365 OWA or their Outlook client. Any suggestions
 on what to check?</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, Iâ€™d like to collect some information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Do you use DirSync, AAD Sync or AAD connect tools?<br />
2.&nbsp;About â€œOffice 365 version 15.15 utilizing Microsoft Azureâ€, may I know whether you use Outlook for Mac 15.15?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can you provide more detailed information about how they change passwords?<br />
4.&nbsp;Does the issue occur for all users or some special users?<br />
5.&nbsp;If the admin helps users to change password in AD users and computers, does the password sync to Office 365?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>
        </p>

<p>Erick,</p>
<p>Thanks for your follow up. </p>
<p>1. We use DirSync</p>
<p>2. Yes Outlook for Mac 15.15</p>
<p>3. The users change their AD passwords on their Macs through System Preferences.
</p>
<p>4. It occurs for all users</p>
<p>5. No when I change users passwords they do not sync to Office 365.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>To further narrow down the issue, cloud you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Does the password sync before or it never syncs after you set up the DirSync? If it works before, did you change anything recently?<br />
2.&nbsp;If it never works after you install the DirSync, have you checked the Enable Password Sync checkbox when running the DirSync tool configuration wizard?<br />
3.&nbsp;By default, the DirSync will synchronize password or other attribute changes every 3 hours. May I confirm whether it still doesnâ€™t work after 3 hours? If so, have you tried forcing directory synchronization? You can use the directory synchronization Windows
 PowerShell cmdlet to force synchronization. The cmdlet is installed when you install the Directory Sync tool.<br />
1)&nbsp;On the computer that is running the Directory Sync tool, start PowerShell, type
<strong>Import-Module DirSync</strong>, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;Type <strong>Start-OnlineCoexistenceSync</strong>, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;If you tried the question 3 and the issue persists, please go to the Forefront Identity Manager (miisclient.exe) and check the synchronizations you have done. Are there any errors or warnings? Whatâ€™s the status of updates?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>Erick,</p>
<p>The answers to your questions are below:</p>
<p>1. Does the password sync before or it never syncs after you set up the DirSync? If it works before, did you change anything recently? I believe that it did work before. I am replacing the admin so I do not know for sure.</p>
<p>2. If it never works after you install the DirSync, have you checked the Enable Password Sync checkbox when running the DirSync tool configuration wizard? Yes Enable Password Sync is checked.</p>
<p>3. By default, the DirSync will synchronize password or other attribute changes every 3 hours. May I confirm whether it still doesnâ€™t work after 3 hours? If so, have you tried forcing directory synchronization? You can use the directory synchronization Windows
 PowerShell cmdlet to force synchronization. The cmdlet is installed when you install the Directory Sync tool. Yes it does not work even after the 3 hour sync.
</p>
<p>1) On the computer that is running the Directory Sync tool, start PowerShell, type Import-Module DirSync, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>2) Type Start-OnlineCoexistenceSync, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>4. If you tried the question 3 and the issue persists, please go to the Forefront Identity Manager (miisclient.exe) and check the synchronizations you have done. Are there any errors or warnings? Whatâ€™s the status of updates? No errors or updates.</p>
<p>Is it possible to test these commands in Powershelgl on a select number of users say an admin AD group?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>The admin should have related permissions in Office 365. If the admin in AD group has different permissions from admin in Office 365. The answer is no. Given the situation, I suggest you use the Office 365 Global admin to run these PowerShell commands.</p>
<p>Before running PowerShell, please let your AD admin change a password for a test user. After that, you can run the PowerShell and check the information in the Forefront Identity Manager. Please let me know the result.</p>

<p>To answer your question the admin which is me has equal permissions for AD and Office 365. Since this is the case can I select certain users or groups like admins? If so how do I accomplish this?</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>If you only want to sync certain users or groups, the answer is no. You can just sync all users. It will not affect other users. Meantime, you can also try re-installing the DirSync tool if it is the old version.</p>
<p>Please let me know any results at your convenience.</p>

    <title>Outlook won&#39;t send email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john caporale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t send email</h2>
                    I'm making this a new question because the nonsense tech crap responses to all the others is just that.<br />
<br />
There are NO attachments and the size of the mail doesn't seem to matter. Many with one sentence have not gone.<br />
I'm connected to the internet<br />
emails go to the same addresses from my laptop running Outlook and from my iphone, no problem. All my email is hosted on Google servers.<br />
It's not every outbound email and it applies to both my work and personal email which are both managed in the same Outlook<br />
Some days are worse than others, like today, nothing wants to go from my desktop PC.<br />
The icon on the email starts out a flying email and changes to a pen on paper.<br />
M$ tech support has previously spent a couple hours on this with little success.<br />
I am not ripping things apart in an effort to blame something other than Outlook. This problem is so common it is ALL OVER the Internet! Stop worrying about adding things to Outlook and fix what is already there!

<p>Your rant provides no useful information eg the type of mail account IMAP, Exchange or? - google servers says nothing.</p>
<p>Whether you have repaired MS Office?</p>
<p>What com add-ins are shown in OL, whether active or not?</p>

<p>My "rant" is where I'm at after months of this and twice support took over my PC and accomplished nothing except deleting temp files, disabling add-ins and wishing me well. My "rant" is the product of many many wasted hours on this. My "rant" comes from
 posting on their FB page with no response from them. My "rant" is the product of fully expecting to waste another two hours with someone in New Delhi connecting into my PC and fixing nothing. My "rant" is fueled by the incessant nonsense that comes from them
 about all the new stuff they add to these apps yet fundamental processes don't work reliably.<br />
<br />
IMAP. both accounts. No Exchange.<br />
<br />
Outlook repair has been run 3 times with no change.<br />
<br />
Add-ins active, disabled makes no difference. They always suspect it's the iCloud sync add-in but it never resolves anything. And, if it was, it should have been resolved long ago. This is not an isolated issue. Google it and you'll see it's a widespread issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attachments, make no difference, outbound domain makes no difference, it's wildly random. I JUST sen t an email to a person with two pictures, no problem, yet an email to another person in the same office with just text in it, has been sitting there for
 4 hours.</p>

<p>There, that's the Microsoft we all know and love... "let us know how it turns out for you"!<br />
<br />
Thank you! I appreciate the concern.<br />
<br />
So, apparently you don't have any means of tracking previous support cases...<br />
<br />
The network is configured just fine. Intermittent random issues aren't typical of a network misconfigured. The PC is hard wired. Access is clean and fast. My laptop is configured exactly the same but uses WiFi, and I've not experienced this issue on it.<br />
<br />
Never ever get any errors, the emails just sit there in the outbox, randomly alternating between my personal account and my work account.<br />
<br />
Workarounds are unacceptable, completely and utterly unacceptable. Not to mention, they're widely available on hundreds of posts about this issue and I've tried them all, to no avail.<br />
<br />
And they wonder why I posted a "rant"....</p>

<p>Same with me and they always want to find what we screwed up. My machine was a fresh indtsll in february and had no mail issues until summer and its gradually gotten worse to the point where more than hslf my enails dont go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the icon next to the mail on your outbox a pen on pad? No one can tell me what that means or why it changes to that. Thereâ€™s no icon like that in their icon list.</p>

            I agree with this but Microsoft should set up windows 10 to display tablet on the main screen.&nbsp; The display settings&nbsp;are able to identify between Display 1 and 2 so the tablet mode can be encoded to do the same.

            This would be good.&nbsp; In Windows 8.1 I had one monitor in traditional desktop mode complete with a fully functioning "start" button I bought for about $2 and the other was in tablet mode with all my favourite live app tiles such as mail, weather, calendar,
 news, maps etc.&nbsp; It was a really nice hybrid that worked perfectly for me. I've been on 10 for a short while now and I'm starting to wonder about going back to 8.1.

<h2>            Access 2010 adding attachments</h2>
                    I have a Access 2010 database and cannot add attachment. Getting message"operation is not supported for this type of object". Any suggestions?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What your meaning is that you have a table which contains a field, and its type is attachment, when you add a attachment to that field in the Datasheet
 view, it was throwing "operation is not supported for this type of object" error message, or Did you add attachments using vba macro code with sql? you'd better describe your issue in details. Here is a article about the attachment field in Access 2010.</span></p>

<h2>            My review on Windows Mobile 10 for the Lumia 640 LTE The bugs so far</h2>
                    <p>Initially I found this install to be a great asset to the phone. The general tweaks to the UI were noticed such as using a lot more transparency to keep the images as clear as possible and the improved menu design. Although this is a preview build I wanted
 to highlight some of the issues that I have been encountering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primarily. I have all my start screen organised into folders. These folders can take up to 5 seconds to expand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The multitasking ability of this OS is terrible. Spotify often cancels if there is another sound swource within FB or Instagram&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications take a long time to load</p>
<p>The smoothness of scrolling is (old school)</p>
<p>The intuity of where I should save my pictures from the one drive has gone. They are image files being downloaded (saved folder please)</p>
<p>Applications do not close with the back button anymore.</p>
<p>Loading pictures defaults to web, surely for speed the default should be the local storage.</p>
<p>Applications crash on the back button. Instagram, Facebook,. images</p>
<p>The phone can take up to 5mins to boot as it tries to chkdsk my SD card after it shuts down</p>
<p>There are menu items such as encryption with no information (what encryption is this, certificate, key based, how do I recover an encryped device)</p>
<p>Caching of images is very slow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search needs the ability to &nbsp;look at settings within folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why cant you add a text entry for adding email address rather than typing it out each time? I work with many.</p>
<p>bluetooth fails on connect with another device other than sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will try to keep this updated as and when I find issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>that had already changed on WP8.1, not on 10. it's up to app developers to implement which behaviour they want.</p>
