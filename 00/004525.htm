    <title>Email display too big for reading pane - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Email display too big for reading pane</h2>
                    The size of an open email is displaying too large for the reading pane. I know that I can reduce the size of a single email to fit the pane, but then it becomes almost too small to read. Besides, I don't want to have to adjust the size of each email in
 order to have it fit into the pane. This issue is not present in Office/Outlook 2013. I know this has been an issue for other Outlook 2016 users and I would like a&nbsp;permanent solution as 2016 was not cheap and I don't want to have to go back to Outlook 2013
 (unless MS want to refund the purchase price of 2016.) Any relevant help would be appreciated.

            <p><span>Hi Audrey,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know what type of account you have configured in Outlook. (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync or an Exchange account)</span></p>
<p><span>Was there any updates installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try opening Outlook in safe mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, close Outlook. Let us type in ‘Run’ in the search bar next to start button, click on the 'run' icon that appears – in the 'Run window' type in Outlook /safe and hit ok. (Note: There is
 a space between Outlook and /).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Go to Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Manage section, select COM Add-ins and click on Go.</span></p>
<p><span>Now uncheck the Add-ins and click on OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, let us try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Let us press Windows+r on the keyboard (simultaneously) the Run appears.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type outlook.exe /cleanviews (Leave a space after Outlook.exe)-&gt; Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: There is a space between Outlook and ‘/’. The above mentioned command restores Outlook to default view settings and all the custom views that you created will be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane (Leave a space after Outlook.exe) -&gt; Click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps you. Please let us know if you need additional information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thanks for your assistance. I followed your instructions. It works half the time. One time I will open Outlook and the emails fit into the reading pane. The next time they do not. When they don't, I can immediately close Outlook and reopen it and they
 fit. Doesn't make sense.

<p>
</p><p>What I did find, that when the Reading Pane extends too wide into infinity, this is copied to the Print Preview as well wanting to print also over 2 or more pages to accomadate the width.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using your fix, the Print is also fixed. I have made a permanent link with the

    <title>Where is the &#34;snap to objects&#34; feature in Publisher 2010&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancygail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the &#34;snap to objects&#34; feature in Publisher 2010&#63;</h2>
                    From my reading on the forum I'm gathering the old "snap to objects" does not work the same. Used to be pretty simple..&nbsp;Turn&nbsp;it on and you can snap to a nearby object and align it quickly on one side or the other without zooming in. I've found the Page
 Design area where it has the boxes for Align to Objects and Guides but I honestly can't see that it does&nbsp;anything&nbsp;when I select them. Again I"m wanting to snap to other objects... as in snapping a photo to match the top of the photo next to it. I realize I
 can select them both and use the "align" feature however the "snap to objects" was faster.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I guess I'm trying to verify... am I flat out of luck on this? &nbsp; Also... my red lines that supposed&nbsp;help&nbsp;align things seem to be speratic... they show sometimes and other times not. Those might be more helpful if I can get them to show all the time.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thank you!</div>

            <p>There is a snap to function in Pub 2010. If has been moved and renamed...don't ya just love the new ribbon menu?</p>
<p>Go to the Page Design tab and check the options to Align to: guides and objects. Hover your&nbsp;mouse over Guides or&nbsp;Objects to see the tool tip.&nbsp;It does not work as well as the old snap to function in my view, but it is there. It is easier to see how things
 line up if you go to View &gt; check Boundaries.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Henry the 8th</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi I recently downloaded the OneDrive app after my Windows 8 phone upgraded to windows 8.1. I opened the app and was presented with a sign in screen with my sky.com email address already typed in the username box, and a message asking me to enter my Microsoft
 password. My Microsoft password doesn't link to that email address but I tried it, only for it to pop up again. At the same time I was presented with 17 app downloads saying attention required. I tapped them only to be presented with the same sign in box and
 a retry all or cancel. From the email I was sent about one drive I can go to one drive page and when asked can sign into my Microsoft account?! Can anyone help please, I've emailed Microsoft who say its Windows phones responsibility? Many thanks. 😉

            <p>Hello Harry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having with your phone.&nbsp; It sounds like the primary issue is getting your apps updated.&nbsp; It also sounds like you are being presented with a sign in page that is prepopulating a different email
 then the one that is currently used as&nbsp;a Microsoft account on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my understanding is correct I would like you to try the following.&nbsp; On the sign in page, look for a link that reads something to the effect of "sign in with a different account".&nbsp; This should clear the email from the username field and allow you to enter
 the account being used on your phone.&nbsp; Enter that and the corresponding password and try signing in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this allows you to get signed in and to get your apps updated.&nbsp; If I am not understanding the issue properly, please provide some clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

            Hi 🙋 Mark and thank you. I am trying to sign into my Windows phone which was recently updated to 8.1. The sign in page which appears when trying to access the one drive app, doesn't give me this option sorry, just save, and cancel. Harry😉

            <p>Hello Harry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; The OneDrive application should be using the Microsoft account on the phone to sign in.&nbsp; The account that would be used is the first one listed as Microsoft account when you go to settings &gt; emails + accounts.&nbsp; If you do not
 see an account listed here, tap the + icon and then Microsoft account and add your account here.&nbsp; If you do see an account listed here, tap and hold this account and select the sync option.&nbsp; If the account fails to sync you will see an "attention required"
 message or a "not up to date" message.&nbsp; If you do see this, tap the message and tell us the error you see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the account has fully synced and you continue to have this sign in issue when launching OneDrive, I will have to request screen shots at this point as I am not sure what is being described.&nbsp; The process to take a screen shot of your phone is detailed

            <p>Hi 🙋 Mark excuse my delay in reply. I go to email and settings but my Microsoft listed shows my sky address with attention required in blue</p>
<p>
When I tap and hold to sync it just goes back to attention required. When I double tap the account I get that sign in box again! In my apps list I have device hub attention required and yep the sign in box! During my attempts I did get an error message number
 80860006, but that was in apps where attention is required. How do I send you screenshots please Mark? Many thanks. Harry😊</p>

            <p>Hello Harry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple things I would like to bring up in this post.&nbsp; The first is the email you see listed on the phone as Microsoft account.&nbsp; If this is the Sky.com email that you previously mentioned being the wrong email, you will need to reset the phone
 to get a proper email on the phone.&nbsp; The Microsoft account listed on the phone is the primary account and what will be used for Store, OneDrive, Xbox Music, Xbox Live and other service access.&nbsp; If this account is the one you want to use, then we will need
 to focus on getting this sync error corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would suggest you do is go to settings &gt; time + date &gt; turn automatically set to OFF &gt; set the time, date and time zone.&nbsp; Be sure to make sure the year entered is correct.&nbsp; Once you have entered the time and date manually, go back to emails
 + accounts and sync the account one more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues the next thing to do is go to settings &gt; location &gt; turn this OFF.&nbsp; Once this is turned OFF try to sync the account one more time.&nbsp; If you have not already tried syncing your account over a different WiFi network, please do this to
 ensure the issue is not with the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final thing I would suggest at this point is to check your account for two step verification.&nbsp; You can find if this is currently ON by signing into your account at
<a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; Once signed in go to security &amp; password.&nbsp; There will be a section related to two step verification.&nbsp; If you have the option to turn this OFF, please try turning this off and then rebooting
 the phone and syncing your account one more time.&nbsp; If it is already OFF, leave it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as a screen shot is concerned.&nbsp; If you would like to post a screen shot you would want to attach that within your post.&nbsp; If any screen shot you plan to provide includes personal information, please do not provide that shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Hi CurtBroyles,</p>
<p>After my research, please try to reinstall Office 2016 and check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as this kind of issue is more related to the Outlook client instead of our Office 365 online service, to ensure you can get the most dedicated assistance, we suggest you turn to our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook support forum</a> for further assistance if the issue persists after reinstallation. Experts there would like to hear from you. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Your time and efforts will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Sam</p>

            You may have inadvertently moved it off screen. Try reducing the resolution on your display. If it's visible, drag it to the center, restore your resolution, then drag it to where you'd like it.

            Hi Steve,
<br />What happens when you try? 
<br />
<br />Click in the header or footer and then choose Document Info &gt; Filename to insert the Filename field or choose other fields.   Or insert it manually -Ctrl+F9 for the {} brackets then type FILENAME \* MERGEFORMAT<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/588338f9-4ca5-4069-b462-bb12c153299a?upload=true" />

<strong>Headers</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>...<br />

Personally, I prefer using field codes for page numbers:

</span>You can easily place a path and filename in the footer of your document. What do you do if it appears that these elements don’t reflect the real name of the saved file? Perhaps it could be simply because the fields used have not been updated.<br />

<p>Correct, when you click in the header or footer area, both show as editable. You should see a Header &amp; Footer menu tab in the ribbon, with the button to add document info fields. Click in the header or footer to edit it.<br />
<br />
You can also use the Insert menu tab to insert fields inthe header or footer&nbsp; - in the Text group on the right is the Quick Parts button - choose Fields to insert any field, or choose one of the fields under Document Property.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Decimal and Thousand separator problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using the Swedish version of Microsoft Excel. That means that I am using comma as decimal separator. To avoid confusion, I am using blank as a thousand separator.</p>
<p>When running the following vb-script:</p>
<p>dim xl&nbsp;<br />
dim xlDoc&nbsp;<br />
dim xlws&nbsp;<br />
set xl = GetObject(,"Excel.Application")<br />
set xlDoc = xl.Workbooks.Add<br />
set xlws = xlDoc.ActiveSheet<br />
xlws.Cells(1, 1) = "1,234"<br />
xlws.Cells(2, 1) = "1,23"<br />
xlws.Cells(3, 1) = "'1,234"<br />
xlws.Cells(4, 1) = 1.234</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following results:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc9eea9b-9adf-422d-a8b8-04b26146076b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The decimal separator is set to "," (comma) and the thousand separator is set to " " (blank).</p>
<p>Please note the presceeding quotation mark <strong>(')</strong> in the row "xlws.Cells(3, 1) = "<strong>'</strong>1,234""</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly A1 should either be treated as Text or the decimal separator should be recognized and treated as such.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current result is that the cell A1 is 1000 times bigger than expected, and might lead to disaster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>JS</p>

            <p>Try converting the string you get from the database into a number in your code using the Val() function. Then store the value to the cell rather than a string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ie</p>
<p>If the string you get from the database is called "MyStrVal", something like the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim MyNumVal as Double</p>
<p>
</p><p>MyNumVal = Val(MyStrVal)</p>
<p>.Cells(1,1) = MyNumVal</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Krysg,</p>
<p>To answer your question, yes. In my opinion the best way to do that is via VBA. I've used that approach many times over the years to create custom reports of Project data in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not familiar with VBA, or at least with Project VBA, you might want to take a look at the following Wiki article. Although it doesn't export timescaled data, it will give you a starting point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32126.ms-project-truncated-project-notes-when-viewingexporting.aspx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also search the Project customization and programming forum where various examples of VBA have been posted. (https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=project2010custprog)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to learn more about Project VBA, I recommend Rod Gill's book on the subject. His book does have examples of exporting timescaled data. You can find out more at:&nbsp;http://www.project-systems.co.nz/project-vba-book/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft components don&#39;t update or see the Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffinindy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft components don&#39;t update or see the Internet</h2>
                    <p>Using the newest build of Windows, everything works great: Internet, downloading and installing programs.&nbsp; But any service from Microsoft can't find the Internet: Windows Update won't update, Microsoft Store won't load, Windows Features won't install new
 features, even in-place upgrades won't work.&nbsp; I have tried reinstalling several times - same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested that I downgrade to the previous build, 1630 I believe.&nbsp; With the 1630 build, I get through the installation, get to the final "Just one minute", and it hangs there forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my options are a version that won't update or use the store, or a version that doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Desktop with an i3 processor, 16GB of memory.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; 15063 won't update.&nbsp; Build before that doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>NIC - I REALLY thought there might be something here.&nbsp; I have an onboard NIC that doesn't work right, so I have a USB3 Ethernet adapter.&nbsp; But the onboard NIC isn't active, and IPCONFIG just shows the USB adapter.&nbsp; Dang.&nbsp; I was hoping it was that easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I installed the build on a VM (VirtualBox), and it runs/installs fine.&nbsp; Of course, it uses emulated hardware, and all my other things on this computer can access the internet fine, so I'm not surprised.</p>

            The onboard nic might be the culprit because the system components wants to use it. Even if it does not have a correctly working driver or even if the nic is disabled. the only way out of this dilemma for me has been to connect all onboard nics with a
 cable to the router or switch or whatever connection you have to the internet. The only way for me if I have a broken nic has been to use wifi instead. If you use 2 onboard nics only one nic can have a fixed IP address to the gateway, the other one must be
 assigned dynamic by DHCP.&nbsp;

<p>So even if it's a non-functioning NIC, it can still screw up Microsoft's system?&nbsp; And every other app and system can see through the inoperative NIC, but Microsoft's internal systems can't?&nbsp; As screwed up as computers can be, that seems extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the NIC doesn't work, so I can't set it to DHCP.&nbsp; And it's attached to the motherboard, so I can't remove it.&nbsp; So you're saying there's nothing I can do?</p>

            How do you know the nic is faulty? Have tried to remove the onboard nic from the onboard-list in BIOS? Have you tried the motherboard manufactures homepage to find an updated driver for Windows10? Or find an older driver and install it in compatibility
 mode? Have you tried this forums or other wiki pages to find out to reset the network? Have you tried to install another operating system&nbsp; Windows 7 as an example? using an alternate harddrive to avoid conflicts with your Windows10 installation.

<h2>            Unable to send OneNote pages via e-mail through Outlook in Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm all about the modernization of OneNote, but there seems to be some core functionality missing that makes it difficult to use the app in a professional setting. Because OneNote is used as our preferred program for note taking during meetings, the ability
 to send these notes out via e-mail is incredibly important. When going to "share" a page in OneNote for Windows 10, I only see the ability to share through Twitter and the Windows Mail app. Am I missing something?

            Unfortunately, your options are limited with the windows 10 app.  You can use both the app and the desktop version (if you have a click to run version of office installed). 
<br />
<br />The windows 10 app only uses mail - and if you have the apps configured, skype or twitter. Unfortunately, this cannot be changed. You can add your account to the app so you can share by email.

<h2>            Registry entry for MaxFileSize</h2>
                    Office OL 2007<br />
Vista<br />
<br />
I've read that the maximum file size of a pst file can be adjusted by <br />
modifying the registry entry MaxFileSize. Supposedly this is found at <br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\PST or at <br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\PST (Article ID: <br />
832925 at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832925#appliesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832925#appliesto</a> is unclear<br />
which).<br />
<br />
But I can't find such an entry in my Registry. Am I to understand that I must create these entries as new?<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft does not have an "Office"<br />
folder, and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook does <br />
not have a "PST" folder.<br />
<br />
I'm getting a warning that my pst file is too large, so I must do something. <br />
(It's at about 1.9 GB, and I believe the default max size is 2.0...)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>I also thought you were on the edge, but you are off by&nbsp;more than&nbsp;an order of magnitude. The PST Size limit is 50 gb:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982577</a></p>
<p>Regardless, you probably will find that outlook will speed up if you can reduce the PST file size.</p>
<p>The following blog post describes how to reduce the size of your local data file by using synchronization filters:</p>

<p>But I do get the "too large" warning at 1.9 GB. I seem to recall someone telling me the last time I got that warning that it may have something to do with the fact that the pst file dates all the way back to when I had Office XP. (I believe the max pst size
 for that version was 2GB, and could not be increased.) Could that explain the warning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Cannot Configure E-Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sir sly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Configure E-Mail</h2>
                    
I know I'm not crazy because I've done this before on my older Pocket PCs.&nbsp; I 
have recently purchased an iPAQ 211 and I'm trying to configure my e-mail to 
connect to a POP3 account.&nbsp; When I open up my e-mail program on the Pocket 
PC, I get a "Select an Account" screen.&nbsp; There is an option entitled "Net 
E-mail Account: Tap to setup a new account."&nbsp; Well, I tap it and nothing 
happens.&nbsp; So I go Menu-&gt;Options and a list of accounts open up: "Outlook 
E-Mail" and "New Account..."&nbsp; I click "New Account" and nothing happens.&nbsp; Any 
idea why I'm not able to configure this?

The device is using Windows Mobile 6 Classic
CE OS 5.2.1711 (Build 18165.0.5.0)

 waste of what was a workable scanner.</p>
<p>Thanks for replying, Joe.</p>

            <p>It seems to be Visioneer policy, an attempt to get you to buy a new model. I had the same thing from XP to 7 with one of their scanners. Unlike printer manufacturers, who can play with cartridge pricing to get you to upgrade, it's easy to saturate the scanner
 market and not many people need more than one scanner.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 Fails to Prompt for Updated Credentials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithk_bbc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Fails to Prompt for Updated Credentials</h2>
                    <p>Our organization's password policy requires users to reset their password every 90 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since implementing Office 365 we just went through our first 90 day expiration period and it was PAINFUL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We run Windows Azure Active Directory Sync every 15 minutes and have had no issues with syncing data up to the cloud - but the local clients seem to be stuck on using the old saved credentials.&nbsp; Users can log into Office 365 OWA with no problems
 with their new passwords, so I know the passwords are updating correctly on the O365 side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost&nbsp;all&nbsp;of my users were unable to connect to Office 365 via their Outlook 2013 clients due to having saved their old credentials when setting up their account for the first time.&nbsp; I found that the only ways I could fix this were:&nbsp; deleting the
 saved credentials from credential manager on the computer (Windows 7&nbsp;ENT)&nbsp;and then rebooting, which would cause Outlook to prompt for the correct credentials on the next run.&nbsp; Or, if I completely removed and re-added the email account in Outlook that would
 also resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially what I'm seeing on all of these machines is that Outlook opens normally, but is not connected to O365 Exchange.&nbsp; Users are unable to send or receive emails but are not prompted for their new passwords to resolve the connectivity issue.&nbsp;
 Is there a setting I am missing that would help resolve this problem, or anything I can do to avoid going through this all over again 90 days from now?</p>

            <p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much experimentation I actually figured this one out on my own. &nbsp;The problem ended up being a third party application with Outlook integration - in our case Webex Connect (IM with Presence and Calendar Integration)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We found that if we started Outlook with this application open that it would not prompt for credentials, but that if the application was closed things worked normally. &nbsp;It's as if some third party apps that have Outlook integration (MAPI maybe?) 'lock' something
 related to Outlook and prevent it from prompting for credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize that I don't have more details or much to offer beyond that, but maybe you've got a similar application in your environment causing the same sort of issue.</p>

            <p>Awesome!&nbsp; You put me on the right track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in our case,&nbsp;there was a Cisco WebEx client installed even prior to us installing the Office 365&nbsp;suite with Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;We never purposely wanted&nbsp;Outlook and Cisco&nbsp;WebEx to be integrated.&nbsp; It just&nbsp;so happens that the two existed together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I&nbsp;went ahead&nbsp;and uninstalled the Cisco WebEx client.&nbsp; Did some testing&nbsp;on a few users,&nbsp;having them change passwords in Active Directory.&nbsp; Outlook never skipped a beat.&nbsp; Took the password change without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the only question is the next time&nbsp;I or others need to actually attend a WebEx meeting online, the Cisco WebEx&nbsp;client will be installed again, and will that 'break' Outlook once more?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use WordArt (on the Drawing toolbar). One of the patterns in the top row is an arc. If you really need it to be circular, you'll have to drag the bounding box to be square instead of a rectangle.</p>
