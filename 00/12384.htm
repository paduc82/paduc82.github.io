<h2>            Windows Defender PUP&#47;PUA protection blocked BitTorrent</h2>
                    <p>I turned on Windows Defender PUA/PUP protection and then tried to install BitTorrent,&nbsp;but the process was blocked and BitTorrent was deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does BitTorrent really contain&nbsp;a virus?&nbsp; Is there a way to make sure while still keeping the PC safe and to add
 an exception&nbsp;for&nbsp;it if it's safe?</p>

            <p>I honestly don't know.</p>
<p>I neither use Windows 10 nor Windows Defender nor BitTorrent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try to disable the Windows Defender PUA/PUP protection?</p>
<p>Or to disable WD real-time protection during installation of BitTorrent?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ask BitTorrent support and/or in their forum?</p>

    <title>Access changes my data type when I use lookup wizard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access changes my data type when I use lookup wizard</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use lookup wizard on Microsoft Access to form my foreign key. I want my foreign key to be a short text data type format (because my foreign key is a common species name). I am also forming a one to many relationship between my two tables.
 When I am in design view, I use the lookup wizard to form the foreign key, and everything turns out fine, except that Access automatically changes the data type from short text to number. If I delete the relationship in the relationship view, change the data
 type back to short text, then return to the relationship view to remake the relationship; firstly, Access thinks I am trying to make an indeterminate relationship, not a one to many; and Access refuses to let me make this relationship because it says no unique
 index found for the referenced field of the primary table. However, I have set primary keys for both of my tables, so I don't know why this error is showing up? I did this same process to form my one to many relationships between other tables with short text
 data type foreign keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it ok to leave the original one to many relationship with the automatically adjusted number data type? Will this work when the data type is text?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, a couple of things.&nbsp; Yes, the Look-up Wizard will do that which is why you should not use it (one of the many reasons you should not use it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, having a unique number as the Primary Key (PK) is not a bad thing and preferable over using Text.&nbsp; You should have a table that holds the look-up values and you can use Autonumber as the PK.&nbsp; Then link to the Foreign Key (FK) in the secondary
 table which should be Number - Long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now in your secondary you will see a number but easily adjusted by using a query and adding the Look-up Table.</p>

            It is not recommended to use lookup fields on the table level. and this is one of the reasons. Access (correctly) is telling you your lookup table should have an autonumber primary key not a text field. Numbers perform much better in joins that text fields. 
<br />
<br />Lookups should be done on the form level not the table level, using list controls.

    <title>Placeholder content moving between layouts when switching between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshuabalsillie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Placeholder content moving between layouts when switching between layouts</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>This is a continuation of:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_win10-mso_2016/slide-master-placeholders-content-moving-across/4bddf8f2-c72e-4ce6-93b0-bd26397fefdb">Slide Master placeholders content moving across
 layouts</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, editing the XML is not really a good solution since there doesn't appear to be a built in XML editor, meaning this workaround could break after any update to Microsoft Office. Understandably you do this once your template is fully completed
 to avoid your XML edits being overwritten, but I wouldn't call this a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Description</p>
<p>When you create a layout, duplicate that layout, then create a slide from the first layout, changing the slide to the second layout moves content between placeholders. The reason stated in the aforementioned article is that the placeholder ID (idx="") changes
 between slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Duplicated layouts where all placeholders of equivalent type, do not all have content
<ul>
<li>At least one placeholder of equivalent type does not have content</li><li>example: content = picture (have not tested all placeholder combinations)</li></ul>
</li><li>Duplicated layouts and second layout has deleted placeholders</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't happen for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Duplicate layouts where all the placeholders equivalent type, all have content
<ul>
<li>example: content = picture (have not tested all placeholder combinations)</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Expected Experience</p>
<ol>
<li>Placeholder IDs remain consistent across duplicate layouts.</li><li>If placeholders are deleted in a duplicate layout, remaining placeholders retain their IDs.</li><li>If placeholders are added in a duplicate layout, new placeholders get new IDs starting with the highest ID + 1.</li><li>If a placeholder deleted from a duplicate layout is then re-added via copy + paste from the original layout the placeholder ID is retained</li><li>The experience described in 1-4 should be duplicated for slides in Normal view.</li><li>A slide converted from a layout with few objects to a duplicate layout with many objects fills in the few objects correctly, based on their IDs.</li><li>A slide converted from a layout with many objects to a duplicate layout with few objects, should fill in the few objects correctly, based on their IDs. The duplicate layout then creates new objects, retaining the IDs from the layout with many objects.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Thoughts</p>
<p>This would not only make things easier for people building templates, but also those that use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This type of functionality would only potentially be an issue for people that don't duplicate a layout when designing templates. Given the expected experience, additional content areas would be created over top of the slide, as opposed to guessing where
 to put content. Since PowerPoint does a poor job of this anyway I don't think this would negatively affect many users, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint only does a good job of reassigning content when the layouts are close to identical. The only scenario I can think of, where this works well, is if you know exactly the content you will include in your slide ahead of time.</p>

<p>Lol I didn't even notice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my comment regarding XML, it's not outside of realm of possibility that Microsoft could change the way the product handles or checks data. For instance if they started using JSON as a file structure instead of XML, or drastically
 changed the XML structure. Or perhaps when a PPT file is loaded it checks the XML for programmatic inconsistencies (manual overwrites) and switches them back.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that Microsoft would do any of the things I mention, in fact I highly doubt it, but my point is that it's not good practice to rely on custom workarounds or plugins that aren't widely supported. Take Internet explorer for instance, Microsoft
 Edge was such a drastic change, not initially supporting add-ons (not sure if that's still true). This was (and may still be) a paint point for companies who relied on IE add-ons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, Microsoft's track record for software updates has been less than graceful at certain points.<br />

<p>If the pdf is web based, ie it can be reached with a hyperlink begining http:\\, then you can just add the #page=x to the end of a hyperlink created using the insert Hyperlink command.</p>
<p>If the file is not web based then you can use the following command line:</p>
<p>&lt;path to acrobat reader&gt; /A &lt;open parameter&gt;=OpenActions &lt;path to pdf&gt;</p>
<p>like this</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat 10.0\Acrobat\AcroRd32.exe /A "page=2=OpenActions" "C:\example.pdf"</p>
<p>As Peter suggests you will need to use some VBA code to trigger the command.&nbsp; Also versions of the Acrobat Reader will vary so check the location and version of the reader. This could be a problem if you plan to distribute the workbook across computers of
 diferent configuration.</p>

    <title>Unable to create new contacts in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to create new contacts in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I attempted to update an address in the address book.&nbsp; After filing, the address disappeared.&nbsp; If I go to the contacts page I can see it.&nbsp; However, it does not appear in the Address book.&nbsp; Now if I add any new contact,
 it shows up in the contacts page, but not in the address book.&nbsp; How can I get new contacts, input in the address book, to show up in the address book?&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp;

            First, new contacts should actually be created using the Contact page.
<br />
<br />Next, 2 common reasons that contacts located in a contact folder are
<br />- no valid email address/fax number is contained in the contact item (the email address also  needs to be "resolved" (underlined)  in order to be considered valid
<br />- the contact folder where the contact item is located is not a member of the Outlook AddressBook

<p>Karl, thanks for taking a look at this.&nbsp; I am not following your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The address book provides an option to create a new contact.&nbsp; I have been using this option for years and am perplexed that, today, was the first time I could not create a new contact.&nbsp; I respect your advice not to create contacts with the method provided
 by Outlook but I would like to continue to use that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked and the e-mail is valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand the "<span>the contact folder where the contact item is located is not a member of the Outlook AddressBook".&nbsp; The Contacts are in the Outlook program so perhaps this is an issue I can explore.&nbsp; That said,
 the contact I created is in the outlook program under contacts and not showing in the address book BUT other contacts are in the same location and in the address book.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me know if you have any additional suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thx!&nbsp; Brian</span></p>

            Just for information's sake, an AddressBook is a specialized view of the contact foldlers that are designated to be a member of it. I don't know you're particular environment so it  may well  be that you only have one contact folder defined in your profile
<br />
<br />So the question becomes whether or not you can actually create a new contact or if your AddessBook service has become corrupted and/or the contact folder where the contacts are actually located has become corrupted
<br />
<br />Rather then go back and forth with a 1000 questions and endless options, going to suggest understanding  how contacts and the Outlook AddressBook wok from which we can proceed  with further Q&amp;A

            Unfortunately, it's doesn't. The email communications (e.g newsletters) are all in French. Yet my MS account location is in Canada and the language is set in English. I'm looking for a setting page to change the language of communication. Not to change
 the system language of a particular PC.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I have checked with two Microsoft retail stores in Chennai. They do not have office 2016 with media. Only the downloadable version is available. One of the retailer's even checked with regional sales office and reverted that media
 option has been discontinued and might not be available in future. </p>
<p>
</p><p>These outlets were earlier Nokia priority stores and now they are called Microsoft store (Microsoft authorized reseller). Hope you had referred only to these as Microsoft store in your reply. In case you are referring to any specific store at Chennai, please
 let me know the&nbsp;address/&nbsp;link to locate it.</p>

<br />
them, globally and/or for select correspondences? Thank you. <br />

<h2>            latest Windows 10 mobile build cannot access Office365 account</h2>
                    
<p>Using the latest Windows 10 Mobile build, I am able to add my phone to my work account/Office365 account in SETTINGS&gt;ACCOUNTS&gt;WORK ACCESS, but if I try to add my Office365 email account I get the message "your organisation needs you to beef up your security"&nbsp;with
 a more detaisl message saying "your device must be managed by &lt;My org&gt; before you can use this application and then some more details - interestingly, the "Device Platform" is Android.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the screen blacks, on reopening I get the&nbsp;error message "we're sorry but we weren't able to do that Error code 0xcaa5007a"</p>
<p>I have reset, manually added a PIN number and rebooted</p>
<p>We have a few hundred Windows 8.1 Phones that do not have the problem.</p>

<p>The issue was a compliance policy in Intune <a href="https://manage.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://manage.microsoft.com</a> (even though we don't have an Intune subscription this still plays a role in Office365 MDM)</p>
<p>I had&nbsp; a compliance policy only applying to a test group (which I was a member of) and only to iOS and Android devices - which strangely my Windows 10 mobile device seemed to be recognised as. Removed this policy and I could then get my Office365 mail working.</p>

            <p>Hi Anita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not sound good, but is not that terrible as yet. For one, after a few of those failed boots your system should automatically recover to the prior build. So, that's the first thing you should check: start it a couple of times and see if after a
 few tries it goes into recover mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't, then there are other things you need to do to repair you build. Please be so kind and post some more details as to your PC hardware (MB, disks) and please also specify what build is failing to install (and from what build)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<h2>            How to access my old Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Skype on my computer when it had Windows 7, and my work IT dept. upgraded my computer to Windows 10. When I downloaded Skype again, I was routed to a Microsoft login since I couldn't sign in with my old Skype password. Now I have what seems like a
 new Skype account and I don't have access to my old Skype account with all of my contacts. How do I merge these accounts, or at least be able to sign into my existing account??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Merging of these two account is not possible. Hence, you will have to abandon this route.
<br />
<br />Old Skype account should be accessible through your Skype User Name (Hope you are not using your e mail ID). To diagnose your old Skype Account - <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</a>

<h2>            Selecting versions of IE 8 to use</h2>
                    I have IE 8 installed on my machine with version number 8.0.6001.18702IC. There's a site that will not show up correctly (the columns and headers on the page show up skewed) and our IT department told me it's because the site isn't compatible with IE8.
 However, another person on my team has IE8 with version 8.0.6001.18702 and his shows up fine. I imagine it has something to do with the IC at the end of my version that's causing the difference with the views. How do I get the version that does not contain
 the IC at the end? If this isn't the issue, what other options do I need to check/change to get this page to view correctly?

The <strong>IC</strong> tag on your IE8 version denotes <strong>Internet Content Provider</strong>&nbsp;(cf.

or<br />
<ol>

<h2>            Error code&#58; 80070425 - Hotmail&#47;Gmail&#47;Web Browser not working&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically I have had a problem since Sunday (14th April) where my Hotmail and Gmail isn't updating displaying the message 'not up to date' on both. When your press them you get the error code: 80070425. Coincidentally, ever since this has happened my internet
 browser has not worked either so the two problems are obviously linked. I've restarted the phone countless times and tried syncing/using the internet with both wifi and mobile internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an HTC 8S and am in desperate need of help! Any assistance would be very much appreciated.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hey Jameskil17, </p>
<p>Thank you for posting at the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to turn off and on internet connections in your phone and do a soft reset by holding down the Volume Down + Power button for 10 seconds until the phone restarts and vibrates.</p>
<p>If one of the account are not your primary on the phone , try to remove it and re-add to see if it will refresh and sync again.</p>
<p>With your primary account, try to change password and add security proofs under
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> .</p>
<p>If you still experiencing the issue after it, I would suggest turn the back up on in your phone and try a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jameskil17, </p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are saying is that the Hotmail account set up in your phone as primary account is not yours and was set up in the phone when you purchased it?</p>
<p>You will need to do a hard reset in the phone then James and enter your account on it.</p>
<p>Make sure to put on back up under settings&gt;back up and hard reset it on settings&gt;about&gt;reset this device. It will put your phone as default settings, enter your Microsoft account on it, should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before to enter Microsoft account, login at <a href="http://www.xboxlive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xboxlive.com</a> with the account you will use and accept terms of service if you haven't done it yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>My recommendation:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go into the two %userprofile% microsoft\outlook folders and delete all of the files. (<a href="http://www.outlook-tips.net/beginner/filepath.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.outlook-tips.net/beginner/filepath.htm</a>)</span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to Control panel, Mail and delete the profiles.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Go into the registry and delete the outlook key - then do a repair install The key is at: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>(There is a second outlook key with addin info - that shouldn't need to be deleted. )<br />

<h2>            Contact Links automatically unlinked</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have performed several hard resets due to contact/people hub&nbsp;bugs (among others).&nbsp; I have just performed my 7th hard reset 2 days ago.&nbsp; As I was cleaning up my contacts in Outlook.com, I noticed that some of my contacts have been unlinked&nbsp;again.&nbsp; I have
 found this a recurring problem every time I perform a hard reset and start syncing People Hub.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered the same problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have never reset my windows phone 7 but on my windows phone 8, I had to do the linking even though the same contacts were already linked on outlook.com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am probably guessing a feature downgrade from phone 7 to phone 8 for some reason. Honestly, this linking is not transparent enough in the whole windows ecosystem. For good or bad, I have very few contacts and I have migrated most of them to live account.
 So, this never bothered me. but I clearly remember that when I did a phone reset on my phone 8, I had to link them manually.</p>

<h2>            Fresh outlook move... now folders don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2013 and I also have recently move my web based email to outlook for&nbsp;a better interface.&nbsp; I followed all of the instructions that were given to me from my email provider (homestead.com) and got my email setup.&nbsp; I can receive emails.&nbsp; I can
 send emails.&nbsp; All of my email and folders appear to have synchronized as well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that I have many folders that I use to organize my email.&nbsp; In my outlook interface, if I try to move a message over to a folder, I get this message, "Cannot move the items.&nbsp; Could not complete the move.&nbsp; The items may have been already moved
 or deleted." I get an "ok" button and that is all.&nbsp; No message can be moved OR deleted at all.&nbsp; My inbox is now filling up and needs to be organized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Office 2013 on Windows 7 X64.&nbsp; I am running Outlook update version 15.0.4551.1512.&nbsp; All other office&nbsp;programs work just fine.&nbsp; If I sign into my web based email interface, my folders all act properly.&nbsp; It's only in outlook that I cannot move
 my folders etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not locate this same problem on the forums, so I'm asking.&nbsp; Any clues to this?&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p>found the answer to my problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my own, I might add. I even called up Microsoft and got one inch from paying $40.&nbsp; The guy on the other end said to try removing my account and reestablishing it.&nbsp; Didn't even tell me how to remove my account.&nbsp; Outlook wouldn't let me follow his advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I FINALLY discovered that if you go to your account settings and click "repair" account, then manual, then "more settings" then "advanced" there are two check boxes at the bottom of this page that dictate the motions of folders and deleted items.&nbsp; I UNCHECKED
 these two boxes and WHAMMO! my problem is solved.&nbsp; Now I can move items to folders and delete them properly.&nbsp; Thanks a million all you people who helped.</p>

            Try using a different browser? If it still doesnt work, you can use PowerShell to create the rule instead. The cmdlet you need is New-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule.

            Hi Lidor,<br />
<br />
Firstly, please see if the rule you created has been synced to the server side. To do this, you can run the cmdlet
<em><strong>Get-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule</strong></em>. If you can see the rule you created, it implies that the rule has been applied. But the issue is related to your browser (not showing the newly created rule or something like that). You may consider
 to change another browser (IE, Firefox or Chrome) like Vasil suggested or clear the cookies/cache of the browser you are using.
<br />
<br />
Also, try the following steps to help narrow down the issue:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contact another admin of your organization to create the same mobile device (ActiveSync) rule and see if the issue persists.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try creating another mobile device rule (on your side) and see if it will disappear in your browser after it is refreshed.
<br />
<br />
In addition, according to your description “a rule where Android and iPhone devices that are trying to access our exchange server will be allowed automatically”, the PowerShell cmdlet about creating the corresponding rule should be
<em><strong>New-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule -Characteristic DeviceOS -QueryString "iOS and Android" -AccessLevel Allow</strong></em>. So, for your situation, can you clarify whether you are suing this cmdlet?
<br />
<br />

Alan<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><em><strong>Get-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule&nbsp;</strong></em>returns empty.</p>
<p>After creating a new rule using <em><strong>New-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule -Characteristic DeviceOS -QueryString "Android" -AccessLevel Allow</strong></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Get-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule&nbsp;</strong></em>does return the rule, but once again after i wait 10-30 seconds and run
<em><strong>Get-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule </strong></em>it returns empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it with another admin user and creating different rule.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is not a browser issue for sure..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">any more ideas?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Lidor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For "Tried it with another admin user and creating different rule", do you mean that another admin can create the rule?&nbsp; Or, a different rule?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I'd like to collect your unwrokabe admin account (email address) in the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">

            <p>Hi Lidor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarification. Since the issue persists with all the admins, the issue should be further investigated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, please provide the related 3 screenshots (you created a new rule in the browser, a new rule via PowerShell, the result of “Get-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule” after 10 to 30 seconds).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I need to collect your tenant information in the private message for further checking.</p>
