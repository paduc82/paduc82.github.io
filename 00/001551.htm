<h2>            Mac Outlook 15.21.1 Office365 Account prompts for Office365 credentials every time Outlook starts</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE 4.29.16 - Still no answer from anyone at Microsoft on how to fix this. Best I can tell that this was a security feature as part of 15.2.1 that you can't turn off. Maybe someone from the Office for Mac team can shed some light on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I upgraded to 15.21.1 today and every time that I start outlook, it prompts my for my Office365 credentials. This only happens on outlook and not any of the other Office applications, It is NOT and activation prompt. It is email and password prompt for Office
 365. Can anybody help?</p>

            For what it's worth, I'm having the same issue, though it seems to happen after I've closed the program for some length of time. I don't have to re-log in when I quit the program and then restart it.

            I am also having this same issue. Clearing the Keychain does not help either. It seems like when I shut down or restart my Mac, and then use it later it prompts for the Office 365 password.

            <p>Actually, I just tried a test. It seems like Outlook is not working correctly with the Mac OS X keychain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you delete the Keychain(s), and then only start Outlook it will ask for your Office 365 credentials.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you launch Word, it will say "Sign In", so for some reason typing in your Office 365 credentials in Outlook does not activate Word, Excel, or Powerpoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you sign into one of the other Office apps, they stay signed in. Outlook on the other hand seems to continually have the same problem (perhaps it uses a different keychain, or the keychain isn't working properly with Outlook).</p>

            <p>My experience exactly! Appears that the Mac Outlook team has not communicated to anyone about this new security measure. &nbsp;Its called "Office 365 Modern Authentication" but no documentation or ability to turn this off or configure. Microsoft strikes again...</p>

            <p>Thanks for posting about your issues here. I'll post some background, and then hopefully we can make some progress on troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting with the 15.21.1 release, Outlook now uses Office 365 Modern Authentication (also called ADAL) instead of Basic Authentication to connect to Office 365 Exchange Online accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's more info on the <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/11/19/updated-office-365-modern-authentication-public-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
feature</a>&nbsp;and a support <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Plan-for-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-Deployments-043807b2-21db-4d5c-b430-c8a6dee0e6ba?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, if you have an O365 Exchange Online account, and Outlook detects that Modern Auth is supported for the account, the account will be promoted from using Basic Auth to using Modern Auth. For users with on-prem Exchange or other mail accounts syncing
 via IMAP or POP, Basic Auth will continued to be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As pointed out above, there is no configuration or setting to choose whether to use Basic or Modern Auth for O365 accounts. We realize there is confusion about the release of the feature and overall lack of documentation. We appreciate the feedback. This
 feature was one of the top requests for O365 accounts, as it paves the way for Multi-Factor Auth and removes the need for Basic Auth.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as pointed out above, there is now a connection to the rest of the Office apps in terms of shared "Office Identity" in the keychain. However, there is still a distinction between Outlook and the rest of Office in terms of signing into document services
 and adding mail accounts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when signing into Word/Excel/PowerPoint (WXP), each app will become signed in for document services (i.e. OneDrive for Business), but the associated mail account (i.e. Exchange Online) will not automatically be added in Outlook. However, after
 manually adding the mail account in Outlook, if you delete the keychain entries (everything with ADAL and everything with Office) then WXP will become signed out and Outlook will also become unauthenticated (the mail account won't be removed, it just won't
 be connected). This connection is due to Outlook and the rest of Office now sharing the same authentication stack and use of ADAL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this background helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll reply to some of the individual posts to see if we can help troubleshoot.&nbsp;</p>

            Sooo....for those of us with O365 exchange, there is no option other than to wait until there is some kind of fix in the future? We will have to keep entering our credentials every time we log into Outlook?

            <p>Sorry to hear you have to keep entering credentials, I realize that is very painful. I would like to help you debug the issue, as we're hearing various reports and maybe we can find a common theme. If we do identify that a product fix is needed, we'll get
 it into our next release (we release monthly, and Office Insiders get the release approx. one week in advance).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here are some questions that will help us get started. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are these always the modern auth prompt (O365 sign-in page that can be customized for your organization) or are they the native Outlook prompts (blue Outlook logo) or some combination of both?</li><li>For multiple prompts, are they while Outlook is running normally (in the middle of a session), once each time on restart of the app, or several times on each restart of the app? (you mention "log into Outlook" so just want to clarify)</li><li>Is the email address you've used to sign into WXP with the same as your O365 mail account in Outlook, and do you have the same address in the account's email address and user name fields in the accounts pref?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This will get us started, and I can also send details on how to capture logs to help us investigate further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>One Drive and Microsoft Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            One Drive and Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>I'm completely lost on how to get three computers Windows 10 with Microsoft Office 365 to access a One Drive account.&nbsp; I downloaded the Office and installed it on the PC's and I have the PC's with a link to the One Drive. But when I open any files it gives
 me error messages. like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c45a304-679a-404c-9ba8-4bd8066633b2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c45a304-679a-404c-9ba8-4bd8066633b2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to one drive and did a share with the other two PC's/email accounts.&nbsp; And when writing this I now see the yellow triangle up by the name.&nbsp; That was never there before. So now I have to figure that out too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All we want to do is be able to open any of the files that we saved to the one account on One Drive from any of the three PC/accounts and be able to modify and save them.&nbsp; I was able to use the online office to open the files and edit them.&nbsp; But I don't
 like the web based office.&nbsp; I just want to click the Excel shortcut button for the desktop version and go. The web based one made me have to change the printer settings every time I went to print a file I opened.&nbsp; We didn't have any issues until we got a third
 PC and and had to upgrade our Office from 2010.&nbsp; we all could access the one Drive and do what we wanted to.&nbsp; Now we can not unless we go online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Doug,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your descriptions, I assume they open files within from Office Excel app &gt; File &gt; open &gt; select the connected OneDrive for Business location.
</span></p>
<p><span>To explain the normal behavior of this feature: </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>To add OneDrive for Business connection to Office, you need to sign in with the OneDrive related account in your Office client.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>To keep this connection valid, you need to keep signing in this account in your Office client.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">That means, if you don’t sign in with Rori’s account, the connection will be broken. You can click the sign in account to check whether Rori’s account is connecting well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">If you don’t want to sign in Rori’s account on all computers, there’s another way you can try:
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)"><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">Access Rori’s OneDrive site via web browser first with your account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)"><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">Access a folder, then click “sync” button to sync folder to your desktop. Please notice that OneDrive is more like a personal usage service, so you can’t click
 the “sync” button in the root folder to sync the whole site without signing with Rori’s account. But it’s ok for you to sync just a folder with your own account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)"><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">Go to the local sync folder, you can now use your account to edit files there without signing with Rori’s account. And the local sync folder will sync changes
 to cloud server. In this way, all steps can be done locally.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you still want to add connection to Office, we also recommend you use SharePoint Online instead of a OneDrive for Business account to collaborate files. OneDrive is more like a personal usage while SharePoint Online is more related to team work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It’s ok for the notification about “We opened this workbook read-only from server”, just click “edit Workbook” button to switch to edit mode from read-only mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the “Upload Blocked” error, can you upload new files when they are using Rori's OneDrive Online? As the error message is about the permission, this step can check whether they have the permission to upload new files to Rori's OneDrive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena</span></p>

<h2>            the &#34;others&#34; folder in storage sense....</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Just getting used to the phone and discovered a folder for file, music even comics that cannot be read yet take up a growing amount of space on the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't empty the space, can't delete the folder or touch it. Tried connecting to the PC to get at it but the same folder remains invisible. Was this part of the pls for windows phones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Starting to feel quite uncomfortable about buying this phone. Rather getting confused that files like my comics cant be opened routinely and now this...HELP!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Anyone?</p>

<h2>            Image quality in publisher</h2>
                    <p>I'm hoping someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have inserted a logo into publisher which is saved as a 300dpi jpg. I resize the dimensions to fit my document and all looks good. However when I save the document as a PDF to send to a commercial printer the image is pixelated and not the same DPI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can stop this happening as I like using publisher but am wondering if I need a different software for my publications?</p>

            <p>Ae you using Pub 2010? Pub 2013 has a bug associated with inserted objects 'blurring' when converted to PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I believe if you want optimum results then you should resize, resample and optimize your images in a third party image editor before you insert it into a Publisher page at 100% scale. Don't rely on Publisher to do the image editing work. But then
 I started using Publisher when the image editing functionality was rather rudimentary...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you will ignore that advice you should make sure the aspect ratio is locked before you resize a picture within Publisher. Right click the picture &gt; format picture &gt; size tab. You might want to reset the picture to original size, and then check the
 aspect ratio option before you resize the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are in the format picture dialog &gt; Picture tab &gt; compress pictures and choose Commercial Printing as the target output. You also have the option to compress all the images at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you produce your PDF make sure you are using the 'High Quality' or 'Commercial Press' settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps use the .PNG format for your logo instead of a JPG. PNG supports transparency and may be a better choice for logos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try a different PDF tool to see if you can get better results. I like the freebie
<a href="http://filehippo.com/download_primopdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">primopdf</a>&nbsp; . Like all free utilities always choose the custom install vs. the default and carefully read as you install and opt out of installing extra toolbars and 'junk' that you don't want. This will compliment
 the Office pdf tool as you can append pdf files which you cannot do with the Office tool, plus it works with any program that can print.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other devices that will currently find the device while your Surface will not?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have any luck would you please file a Feedback Bug? This will capture log files that should help us debug the situation. After filing the bug please respond to this forum post witht the title of the bug and then I will be able to track it internally.</p>

<h2>            Email subject is readonly but it should not &#40;when using custom message class&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
Hi,</p>
<p>
I was advised to repost my question here.</p>
<p>
using IPM.Note objects in reading view you can change the subject and save the modification on closing the item. I have an Outlook email form which has been published on an Exchange server. But although the subject field is not marked as readonly in its properties
 on the reading view I can not modify the subject when my form is used to display the reading view of the message.</p>
<p>
A little bit more detailed:</p>
<p>
You can easily try it yourself: open a received mail message item in Outlook and edit the subject of that message by setting the cursor in the subject field (although it is looking as it were readonly) and enter additional text. When closing this message Outlook
 asks you whether to save the modifications or not.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Now I have my own form for my custom message class (i.e. IPM.Note.MyCustomMessageClass). This form has been published on an Exchange server. Using the developer tab in Outlook 2010 I can select a form to design. There I select the library for personal forms
 to search in and the published forms appear. I select my form and the Outlook form designer opens that form. I switch the view to edit the reading layout which is different from the composing layout. Now I can edit the properties of the subject field which
 displays the message subject in my form. The control for doing this is the default control and has not been changed. I checked that the "Readonly" property is not checked. So my conclusion would be that I can edit the subject field of my custom message form
 in reading mode. But I can not. And I do not know what is wrong.</p>
<p>
I also checked the code behind this form but there is no code setting the properties of this field to readonly nor is there any code handling any events of this control. I have to add the information that it was not me who originally designed this form and
 I am not able to contact the former developer.</p>
<p>
I hope I was detailed enough. :)</p>
<p>
Does anyone know what I have to do for this to work?</p>
<p>
King regards<br />

<h2>            Aligning images next to text block</h2>
                    <p>I noticed on some of the sways featured on the Sway website that images can be located next to a text block, either to the right or left of the text block. &nbsp;I cannot seem to accomplish this. &nbsp;I have tried grouping a block of text with an image, but the image
 is either positioned above or below the text block.</p>

            <p>Hi Eric- sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>That particular Sway is using a vertical structure and a style from the first row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every style has it's own magic that we're continuing to build out -- for the time being you can get that effect by having an image follow a long flow of text. You won't get that effect if the text the image follows isn't long enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also our layouts are adaptive so depending on the device or screen size you are presenting on-- you won't get that effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We continue to tune and hone, and a great way to work with Sway is when you focus not on a particular effect, but layout your content, and experiment with Remix, mood and structure to find the output that best suits your message. Our hope is that every output
 is great, which can be a bit unfamiliar if you're used to pixel level control.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Problems posting status updates on Facebook</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm having real problems with Facebook at the moment which is really annoying and I'd like to know if this is a configuration issue or a limitation of Windows Phone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The basic issue is that I cannot "post a message" - namely update my Facebook status.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I go into my "Me" tile and click "post a message".</div>
<div>Making sure I've set "Post to" to "Facebook", I enter a message and click on the "post" button.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The result I get is a screen that says:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can't post message</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We're having trouble posting you message to Facebook</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've given the option to "try again" or "cancel". &nbsp;Trying again does not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm wondering if this issue is less about privacy issues but something to do with the fact that in addition to my normal Facebook page, I also manage another facebook page for a separate group. &nbsp;If you end up managing other facebook pages, does this break
 the ability to post to Facebook from my HTC Mozart phone on Mango?</div>

            <p>Hello Anonymous14559:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with your Windows Phone.&nbsp; I have done several Facebook posts from my phone lately via both the ME tile and via the Facebook downloadable application.&nbsp; I have yet to run into any issues
 posting or updating my status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, I believe you are running into a larger phone issue here.&nbsp; The fact the phone is getting hot and the battery is dying fast tends to indicate hardware issues or phone OS/firmware issues.&nbsp; As you have tried several networks I say we focus on
 the phone itself and maybe your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try all the following steps to see if you can make any progress with the Facebook issue or with the overheating/battery drain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soft reset the phone by going to settings &gt; application &gt; Internet Explorer &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once you are done with that, press and hold the down volume button plus the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots.&nbsp; Monitor the phones behavior and
 try another Facebook post.</li><li>Delete the Facebook application from the phone.&nbsp; Once that is done, please go to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the Facebook account &gt; select delete.&nbsp; Once the account is removed from the phone or if you are not able to remove the account from
 the phone, go to <a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a> and unlink your Facebook and Microsoft account via the related accounts &gt; manage other accounts &gt; edit under Facebook &gt;&nbsp;remove this connection completely&nbsp;path.</li><li>Once this is done, perform another soft reset of the phone and then read your Facebook account to the phone.&nbsp; This should ask you to connect the account with your Microsoft account, please do so.&nbsp; Once this is done, go back to
<a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a> and click on related accounts &gt; manage other accounts &gt; edit under Facebook &gt; check all boxes.&nbsp; Once you have done this, go to the phone and tap settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the
 Microsoft account &gt; select sync.&nbsp; Try posting to Facebook via&nbsp;both the Facebook app and via the ME tile.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. The phone is working fine. The issue is excessive CPU usage or data usage while trying to update facebook status. IE and AII other functions are fine! Heat and battery life is result of 30 minutes of trying to make the update post.

            <p>Hello Anonymous14559:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; By "running the Windows phone beta" I suspect you are referring to having the 8.1 developer preview installed to your phone.&nbsp; If that is the case I have the following suggestions.&nbsp; I have posted via the Facebook app on a phone
 running the 8.1 preview and had 0 issues with the post updating.&nbsp; As mentioned in my previous post, this does indicate this is an issue with your specific phone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for the official release of the OS to see if this resolves the issue.&nbsp; The preview does not include any firmware updates for the phone so the official release very well may lead to improved performance.</li><li>If you have a Nokia phone, consider looking into Nokia's software suite that allows users to reinstall their previous OS and firmware.&nbsp; Once you do that you can either continue with 8.0 until the official release or try reinstalling the preview.&nbsp; I have
 seen reports of this correcting several issues customers have had with the preview.</li><li>You can always try posting to the 8.1 developer preview forum where others running this OS may have additional feedback or suggestions for you,

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow I forgot the password of it because I have been using some email account management software application for quite some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After contacting tech support, and they redirect me to answer questions about that email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I couldn't pass the ID verification by answering those questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That email account is my MCP account, which contains all my ID information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that possible to contact outlook or hotmail support in a way, so that I could provide my photo ID copies to pass the ID verification process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, what would be contact information like, email, telephone, webchat, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0e303841-7a76-4513-b07a-d0c3a186d2de" title="Mehmood AzadChaudhry">
Mehmood AzadChaudhry</a>. Office Mobile lets you create, edit and share office documents on the phone. You might not be able to edit a Microsoft Office document on your phone depending on what's in it or how it was last saved. Here are some of the more common
 things that make a document read-only on your phone. The file is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Saved as an older type of Microsoft Office document, such as a Microsoft Word 97-2003 document (.doc), Microsoft Excel 97-2003 workbook (.xls) or Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003 presentation (.ppt).<br />
• Digitally signed.<br />
• Marked as final.<br />
• Protected using rights management.<br />
• Protected with a password.<br />
• Protected with restricted editing rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Excel workbooks are read-only if they have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Formulas that aren't supported on the phone.<br />
• Scenarios.<br />
• Data validation in one or more cells.<br />
• Array formulas.<br />
• Data tables.<br />
• Slicers.<br />
• Macros enabled.<br />
• Large column or row widths.<br />
• Formulas that contain links or references to other workbooks.<br />
• Formulas with structured references.<br />
• Formulas that contain references, content or formatting beyond cell IV16384.<br />
• Longer formulas, such as a formula that is longer than 512 characters or has more than 30 arguments in it.<br />
• Shared workbooks with tracked changes.<br />
• Workbooks with dialogue sheets.<br />
• XML markup that isn't formed correctly.<br />
• OLE objects or ActiveX controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the file types you can open w/ your Lumia using the Microsoft Office Mobile, see:

<h2>            Calculate a formula after constructing it with CONCATENATE function</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have constructed a formula with the CONCATENATE function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=+CONCATENATE("+AVERAGE(",$B6,"_",$C6,"_",$D6,"!",F6))<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result of the Concatanation is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>+AVERAGE(M_B_1!C$11:C$86)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my formula. To make the formula do the calculations I need to press F2 and then ENTER, giving the result, say 95.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So having the formula &nbsp;written correctly, is there a way to somehow avoid the steps "F2-Enter" to make the formula calculate and give the result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I need to do this about 2,000 times</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>The result of the Concatanation is:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Do you copy and paste values first? In that case the result will stay in the cell as a text string.<br />
</p>
<p>You can try this alternative:&nbsp;=AVERAGE(INDIRECT(B6&amp;"_"&amp;C6&amp;"_"&amp;D6&amp;"!"&amp;F6))</p>
<p>I've assumed this is your setup:</p>

<br />
Remember, voicemail messages are not stored on your phone, they are stored by your network. The text message you receive is merely a notification that someone has left you a message, nothing more.

<h2>            Cannot clear Outlook Search</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a customer who is having issues with their Outlook Search. &nbsp;They have added additional fields to their Search in Outlook 2016 on Windows 10, and report that they are able to search and find the appropriate e-mail by using a combination of sender,
 subject, attachments, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, sometimes (and reportedly quite often) after doing a search and dealing with the appropriate e-mail, they are unable to clear the search box and search for something else without closing and re-opening Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if they search for an e-mail from John, they cannot clear John's name out of the search box to then search for e-mails from Luke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone come across this before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Brent,<br />
<br />
According to your description, I would consider that this issue occurred on multiple Outlook clients. Firstly, I'd like to confirm the detailed Outlook 2016 client version. You can check this by clicking File-&gt;Office Account-&gt;About Outlook.<br />
<br />
Then, as you said the search can return the results, that means the search index has no issue. This issue could be related to the Outlook client itself. So I would suggest you run the following Outlook command-line switch:<br />
<em><strong>outlook.exe /resetsearchcriteria</strong></em><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><br />
You can right-clicking on the start menu and then select 'Run' to enter this command.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

<p>We want to be able to reset the search criteria WITHOUT closing Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, search for e-mails from one person, then search for an e-mail from someone else, or some other criteria. &nbsp; At the moment my customer finds the only way he can do that is to close and re-open outlook.</p>

<p>Hi Zoey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, I'm not sure if my customer is closing the search or just trying to clear the fields. &nbsp;They have added several filters to their view as per the below image. &nbsp;In this example, they are unable to clear the "From" field to enter a new
 name and do a new search. &nbsp;However, they report that this occurs regardless of the field they try and search.</p>

    <title>Font size in Word changing by itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> databaseben  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font size in Word changing by itself</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2007 i noticed a peculiar problem regarding font size.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>While i am using 12pt font size, there are paragraphs in my manuscripts where the font size changed to 11.5, even on the same page where 12pt paragraphs are.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is causing this?&nbsp; I truly hate to go page by page, paragraph by paragraph seeing which
 ones are 12 pt and which are 11.5 and set them back to 12pt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to the cause of this? I mean if all the paragraphs were set to 11.5 without my permission then there may be some kind of logical reason for this.&nbsp; But some are and some are not at 11.5.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i do change from 11.5 to 12 there is a tiny difference; of course.&nbsp; But it truly is noticeable when both sizes are on the same page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>~dbBen.</p>
<p>
btw: Please dont suggest anything with templates cuz im not using them.&nbsp; Also dont suggest to do a select all and mass change everything to 12pt.&nbsp; This is not going to work my highly formatted guides.</p>

            How did you change the font size in the first place? Try modifying the paragraph style you are using; that should do the trick.

            <p>well, thats the point. I didnt change the font size. I have been using the same font through out all the guides. The only difference is the size, which i had settle for 5 distinct sizes - nothing more and nothing less.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The base size for everything is 12pt.&nbsp; And from here it does down to 10 pt and not 11pt.&nbsp; And upwards to 14, 16, 18 and 20 pt.&nbsp; So when i see 11.5 suddenly mixed in through out the guide, i became infuriated, especially since this particular manual i am
 working on is 4 months old and was a-ok until yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally i am using only 1 font style and it is either bolded or regular.&nbsp; There is no italics or strikethru's, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what i did notice this morning is that some of the 11.5 pt paragraphs and titles are in the font of Arial.&nbsp; But should of been Gothic because this is what I have painstakingly ensured the font style of all my guides would be in.&nbsp; So throughout the guide,
 many places are in gothic720&nbsp; at 12pt but in other places it is arial 11.5 - which is utterly pathetic to have occurred all of a sudden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i looked up font substitution section of word options and it clearly cites substitute gothic with arial.&nbsp; Now word is telling me that the font style is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; But how can this be? The gothic720 font is still on the font list.&nbsp; The gothic720 font is
 still is use in many areas throughout the guide.&nbsp; Yet only in particular areas, the words were converted into arial 11.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, if anything, if the g.d. gothic720 all of a sudden went missing after years of having it, then why not substitute gothic720 12pt with arial 12pt, instead of arial 11.5?&nbsp; Its utterly ridiculous!</p>

<p>Well, the factory default font in Word is 11 points Calibri, so you must have changed the font at one time. I'm asking how, specifically, you did that. As I wrote, modifying document defaults or modifying the relevant paragraph styles is the best way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you just select text and apply font formatting, for example by using the controls on the ribbon, the underlying default font will inevitably resurface sooner or later. This will cause a lot of wasted time in your work. As a start, modify the
 document default font in the Manage Styles dialog box. In the Styles pane (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S), click the Manage Styles icon and go to the Set Defaults tab. Make the desired changes. If you want to transfer the settings in the dialog box to your template, select
 "New documents based on this template" before clicking OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the missing font is concerned, the font file could be damaged. See if you can copy the font file from another computer, or just reinstall it, if you purchased it yourself.</p>

            <p>yes, i recall calibri is 11pt - which i hate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did download the font but then wondered if perhaps the font i had was infected and then zapped by antivirus.&nbsp; The only thing i found was that font files with extensions of .fon are typical carriers of virus's.&nbsp; But who knows how to be sure "especially"
 since there are dozens of sites with free fonts!&nbsp; Makes you wonder what is the deal? Where are they getting money to host their sites if the thousands of fonts are free and replicated all over the net?&nbsp; So this would make a good medium to infect many computers
 via free fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I could not afford losing years of work because of a missing font.&nbsp; So I downloaded it and installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i did a "replace" for the arial font with the gothic720 font.&nbsp; Then i did another replace for 11.5 font size with 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Im back on track now.&nbsp; In the interim, I am awaiting a response from the website administrator of the free font site regarding the questions before i make a donation for downloading the gothic720.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any thoughts on the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>dbben</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps: now i see Word wants to substitute a font called JoannaMT with NewTimes.&nbsp; I dont know where it came from nor do i use it.&nbsp;

            <p>A quick check shows a number of reputable sites selling the Gothic720 font face. If you purchased it, it is unlikely to have a virus. To eliminate the possibility of the font having become corrupted, check your license to see if you can re-download a newer
 or replacement version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a free version, it is possible that it is corrupted. You could try downloading and re-installing it — but if this font is important for your corporate style, I'd recommend you consider purchasing a licensed version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can embed fonts in your files: File &gt; Options &gt; Save, and turn on the "Embed fonts in the file" checkbox. Note that this is only possible for TrueType and OpenType fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative to correcting the problem with Find and Replace, you can use the Styles dialog to select all instances of a variant of a style:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Styles dialog (Alt-Ctrl-Shift-s), click Options... and turn on the "Font formatting" checkbox in the Style Pane Options. This will cause the Styles list to include font variations of styles, and you should see things like "Body Text + 10.5pt".
</li><li>Right-click on one of these variants and choose "Select all X instance(s)". </li><li>You can then either apply the style you want while still in the Styles dialog — or drop out and use the Font dialog to alter all of the selected instances.</li></ul>
<p>The advantage of this method is that it will show you all of the variances, so you don't have to rely on discovering them by accident.</p>

            <p>Yes, "embed fonts" is enabled and i think this is why many portions of the document retained the font style and didn't default to arial.&nbsp; Yet it doesn't explain why the portions did change to Arial plus reduced the verbiage by 1/2 pt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to using "styles" in word and customizing it, i gave up it long ago.&nbsp; What happens is that any customization seems to revert to the defaults unexpectedly.&nbsp; In my opinion, it occurs after windows updates for word.&nbsp; So i stopped wasting my time.&nbsp;

<p>You should really give paragraph styles a chance in Word. They are crucial to making your work in Word efficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the default font in a document, or any defaults you can change on the Set Defaults tab of the Manage Styles dialog box, is a good start.</p>

<p>There are some things you can do with CSS for email messages. You might look at the coding for the A tag that might modify the underline.</p>
<p>One would hope you weren't trying to hide links in a message because if I received an email that the links were "hidden" I sure wouldn't trust the email.</p>

            <p>Well, I agree with Palcouk that a form with even one such overburdened combo needs reconsideration!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the recordsource of the form? What's its pupose - to select or search for data (in which case it's not going to meet that purpose) or just to display data (for which a Report, perhaps in the new interactive Report view) might be preferable? Could
 you consider using a "light" form, as is often needed for interaction with large backend tables or with client/server backends? Such a form would be based on a single-record (or very few record) recordset with code allowing the user to navigate to any other
 record, by dynamically changing the recordsource?</p>

            Phone stops working means, is it restart or not? If it doesn't restart and only shows black screen then now you can't do anything by yourself. Go to Nokia Care Point and give them your mobile for reflashing the firmware. If it shows white light and switch
 off or nothing work then try this before going to Nokia Care Point. Switch off your mobile and remove your memory card. Now press and hold this 3 key "green call key, * and 3" together and switch on your mobile. Press and hold down that 3 button till country
 insertion dialogue appear. If this not solve then go to Nokia Card Point.
