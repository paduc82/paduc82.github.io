    <title>Unwanted Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unwanted Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite A105-4254 computer which I have used for quite some time with no problems, all of a sudden last week I wake up to find my computer has upgraded to a newer (build) version of Windows 10.&nbsp; I immediately recognize that the wireless
 icon is gone on the welcome page and when I get to my desktop I don't see my wireless router or any network listed.&nbsp; So I go to my Device Manager and notice that there are several yellow triangles with exclamation points within including my Intel Network Adapter.&nbsp;
 After searching&nbsp;Google, I tried to update my drivers but all said that they were the latest and my internet won't work.&nbsp; The only way to get it to work is to go to an earlier build of this OS, but the computer keeps going back to the newest version.&nbsp; Can someone
 out there help me?&nbsp; I never wanted to be upgraded, I called Microsoft and Toshiba and I got the frustrating answer of incompatibility issues.&nbsp; My computer came with XP, which was my favorite OS.&nbsp; If I factory reset can I get XP back on my computer?</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just getting back to you about my wireless dilemma, I finally decided that the easiest thing to do was to get the adapter.&nbsp; So I went to Office Depot yesterday and picked up a tp-link AC600 adapter, plugged it in before I went to work yesterday, and to my
 surprise and delight I saw the wireless icon in the bottom right corner again when I came home!&nbsp; Went ahead and entered my password and BAM, my internet was back working (that is how I'm typing this email).&nbsp; Thanks again for the suggestion...hopefully I will
 never have to worry about this again no matter how old my computer is and however many updates Microsoft have in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>KingCadillac&nbsp; :-)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t prompt me for password</h2>
                    Just moved and got Fios internet installed yesterday, and Windows 10 sees the router but when pressing "connect," does not prompt me for a password and says "can't connect." &nbsp;Have tried rebooting everything, typing in the commands, driver is updated, etc.
 &nbsp;can't "forget this network" since that option is not available. &nbsp;Have had no issues with other devices in the home. &nbsp;PLEASE HELP!

<h2>            Windows 8 won&#39;t recognize my Nokia Lumia 822</h2>
                    When I plug it in and check the phone out under Explorer it doesn't display any contents (folder is empty.) The phone app on my PC gives me a generic error message and recommends that I restart my phone.

            <p>Hi Doctor SugarBear,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>Try the following steps if Windows 8 is not recognizing your Nokia Lumia phone.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>1. Swipe up on the home screen, and make sure it is unlocked.
</p>
<p>2. Check that you have latest updates installed on your PC.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>- Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Update.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- Click Check for updates and wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>- Click View available updates.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>- If the important update "Microsoft - Other hardware -WinUsb Device" is found select it and click Install.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>3. Check and update your driver version manually.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>- Click Start, right-click Computer, and then click Properties.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>- Click Device Manager, located in the left column. </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- A window will appear with the name of your computer and a list of files. If you don't see the files, click
 the name of your computer. The name of your Nokia Lumia should be listed under Portable Devices. If the phone was incorrectly installed, it may be listed with a yellow exclamation mark or, it may be listed under Other Devices as a USB device or an unknown
 device.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>- Right-click the name of your phone and then click Update Driver Software.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>- Select Search automatically for updated driver sofrware, windows does find a driver and installs it as “WinUsb Device”.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- After the driver installation is complete, Close the open windows until you exit the Device Manager. If
 you're prompted to restart your computer, do so.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>4. Confirm that the phone is allowed communicate through Windows Firewall.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- On your PC, go into the Control Panel.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- Open the Windows Firewall, turn the Firewall Off.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- Connect your phone and then turn the Firewall back On.
</p>
<p>5. If there is no entry in the Device Manager for your phone, your computer is not recognizing that the phone is connected to it.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- Make sure that you're using the USB data sync cable which was included with your phone.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>- You may also try another port on the computer, but don't use a USB hub or the ports located on the front
 of your computer.</p>
<p>Let us know if the steps helped to fix the issue.</p>

            It's installed as Windows Phone, not the specific make and model. The Nokia web site doesn't have the drivers either, just a user manual. I've tried everything else (updates, firewall) and no dice.<br />

            <p>This is a serious bug and I'm glad I ran across this forum post.&nbsp; I moved an SD card which was previously formatted and used on an android phone.&nbsp; When this card was inserted in my Lumia 822, not only did the SD card not show up within Windows Explorer as
 a mounted drive, the internal phone drive would not mount either.&nbsp; There was no way to access phone or card memory (including the sync program) while this SD card was inserted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution was to backup all the data on the SD card, reformat it within phone settings and then move the pictures/music/video back onto the card.</p>

            So I have (still) the exact same problem. I find it hard to understand, that after I updated to 8.1 my Lumia 820 is nowhere to be displayed in the explorer (though the phone is recognized as RT825| Nokia Lumia 820). It worked fine before the update. My
 system is updated on both devices, so why is there this problem? Also, after formatting my sd card, there is no difference. I also took it out but its the same. After that, i did some google-searching, turns our that this is a common problem Lumia Users are
 experiencing. I tried some solutions which worked for some, but still the same. <br />
<br />
Here is what i tried:<br />
- downloading the latest winusb device driver -&gt; Didn't work or rather i already had the latest<br />
- manually picking driver from a list and then selected Mobile Device -&gt; Didn't work<br />
- manually picking driver from a list and then selected USB-Device and then winusb-&gt; Didn't work<br />
- Installing Nokia Suite-&gt; Didn't work<br />
- Formatted sd card and then took out sd card - &gt; didn't work<br />
- Trying all USB-Slots on my computer (6 in total)<br />
<br />
This is frustrating. What's the point in having a so called "Windows Phone" when even "Windows" itself can't recognize it? And please no "That's a Nokia related problem", because it is not. This is clearly related to the Windows 8.1 update, so it is software
 related.<br />
<br />
I would be happy to see someone actually having a solution for this problem. I'm on the edge of going back to Android, because connecting your device to your Computer was so much easier.<br />

            I have had a major problem with my lumia 822 connecting to multiple computers lately. I have attempted to connect via USB and the USB continues to connect, then disconnect, over and over again rapidly. I attempted to remove the driver and reinstall it
 but it doesnt appear to exist when I go to the device manager, etc. This is incredibly annoying and I need to get this fixed so I can charge my phone.

            Vinod, I replied to the general thread here but I feel it best to respond directly to you in hopes that I can get a direct answer because Microsoft makes it a nightmare to get assistance.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have had
 a major problem with my lumia 822 connecting to multiple computers lately. I have attempted to connect via USB and the USB continues to connect, then disconnect, over and over again rapidly. I attempted to remove the driver and reinstall it but it doesnt appear
 to exist when I go to the device manager, etc. This is incredibly annoying and I need to get this fixed so I can charge my phone</span>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I found out what the problem was for my case above. </p>
<p>the cause of the problem was the windows media player which I uninstalled because I use other media players. Once I installed the Windows media player again Lumia was recognized and now everything works just fine. Via explorer I can manage my files per drag
 and and drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so if you connect your Lumia to computers without windows media players it won't work. The wmp seems to have essential files for the connection between Lumia and PC to work properly.</p>

<h2>            Unable to perform Windows Update error 80073712</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 3 weeks ago I am unable to use Windows Update. I get a succession of fails and error codes</p>
<p>I am running Windows 8.1 with 500GB disk 4GB RAM and Intel i5.</p>
<p>I have now a backlog of Updates (10 at present)</p>
<p>I get error code 80073712(amongst others)&nbsp;checked and ran the Command Prompt instructions for DISM.exe / scanhealth. It found some problems, "fixed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still unable to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran the resident Windows Update trouble shooter and it found 2 problems</p>
<p>Potential Windows Update Database error detected 0x800F081F (fixed)</p>
<p>Windows Update components must be repaired (fixed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still unable to update</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Update for Windows Defender worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the suspicion that my Windows 8.0 software key is corrupted i.e. the software Update gets downloaded from the Microsoft server but when it is time to install it, it does not find a valid license / authorization and gets chucked out. Defender does
 not need a license and gets approval.</p>
<p>I have an ASUS with preloaded 8.0 from origin and I do not know where to retrieve my software license or where to reintroduce to test this theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bar resetting my entire computer to 8.0 and having to reinstall all my apps again I am at a loss of what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions would be most welcome</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paulo</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>1. Do you remember making any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you have any third party antivirus software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3. When you say “</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Bar resetting my entire computer to 8.0”, did you try to perform the reset of the PC</span><span>?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be related to corrupted <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Update components and not with license.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Since you have already tried to run the Windows Update troubleshooter and

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Exit the command prompt and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,<strong> </strong>you may try performing a SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Praseetha for your extensive and detailed reply. I will try to answer your questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have not made any software changes that could be related to this issue. I changed anti virus prior to this fault but soon replaced it by the standard Windows Defender</p>
<p>2. Reverted to Windows Defender prior to this fault</p>
<p>3. I have not resorted to reset or refresh my computer yet. I would not like to do it and have to reinstall all the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 weeks ago I lost access to the internet for a long period of time I. e. I had the equivalent speed of a dial-up connection 160Kbs!!! My computer started behaving erratically for lack of app syncing and of course even an update of a 10MB file would take
 ages. </p>
<p>My broadband service is now resumed, all software and apps are now updated but this problem with Windows Update persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to install the updates one by one, the download bar goes to 5% and then it jumps straight to error 80073712. After this happens any other Update file goes straight to the error without attempting to download it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran all your suggestions without success. After each of them I ran the Update trouble shooter and always got the same error result stated on my OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Potential Windows Update Database error detected 0x800F081F (fixed)</p>
<p>Windows Update components must be repaired (fixed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think that when I was offline for that long period my resident Microsoft credentials / key license got corrupted and the Windows Update server does not allow me to download the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More suggestions welcome</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this already</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paulo</p>

            <p>Hi Paulo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue persists and if you doubt it is related to the license key corruption issue, you may try the following steps and check.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>You may perform a Phone activation and check.</p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type: <strong>slui.exe 4 and </strong>
press 'ENTER'.<br />
b. Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
c. Choose the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">'Phone Activation'</a></span>option.<br />
d. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If you have tried only the commands to DISM.exe / scanhealth, you may try running the following commands and check.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap<strong>Search</strong>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click<strong>Search</strong>.
 Type <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Type the following commands. Press <strong>Enter </strong>
after each command.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> It may take several minutes for each command operation to be completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&gt; DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&gt; DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Close the command prompt, and check.</span></p>

</p><p>Depending on the size of your drive or the bad sectors, this might take several hours to run.</p>

    <title>Xbox One disconnects from wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottmckenzie1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One disconnects from wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Xbox One keeps disconnecting from the wifi. When I go to connect again, my wifi doesn't show up. It doesn't seem to be a problem with my wifi as I am in a call the whole time. So the problem must lie in the xbox. When I can't connect; I turn it off and
 on, which barely works. Then I turn it off and unplug all the cables and leave it for a while, this works most of the time however it doesn't take long before I disconnect again. Also sometimes it says that my wifi is wired, and I am definitely not using wired
 internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is very annoying as it always disconnects me in game, so it would be greatly appreciated for any help.</p>

<p>Hey there Scott, </p>
<p>
</p><p>So yea, that does actually sound pretty annoying. </p>
<p>If those steps previously posted didn't help the way that you wanted, I would also say to try perhaps what we call a soft reset.
</p>
<p>It's a factory reset that if done correctly should resolve any software issues that the console could be having at the moment and doesn't uninstall any of your games. Before you do that though, be sure that you know all the sign-in information for any/all
 accounts on your console(because it will remove them and you'll have to redownload them).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have all that information&nbsp;follow the steps here <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi CF.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to repair the store:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi CommFox ,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us.
<br />
<br />
<br />Press WIN + X and in the menu choose System symbol (administrator).
<br />
<br />• In the command console you have to copy and paste the following:
<br />
<br />PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$ manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore) .InstallLocation + 'AppxManifest.xml'; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $ manifest} "
<br />
<br />• This will register the Microsoft Store application again. The process may take a while, it is normal.
<br />
<br />* Once the process is finished you have to restart the computer.
<br />
<br />-------------------------
<br />As an alternative solution, you can try to change your DNS to Google DNS or Open DNS
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R&gt; Type ncpa.cpl and Enter&gt; Right click on your network&gt; Properties&gt; Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4)&gt; Hit Properties&gt; Make sure the following are verified
<br />
<br />Google DNS
<br />
<br />Select Use the following DNS Server Addresses&gt; Preferred DNS Server - 8.8.8.8&gt; Alternate DNS Server - 8.8.4.4
<br />
<br />OR
<br />Open DNS
<br />
<br />Select Use the following DNS Server Addresses&gt; Preferred DNS Server: 208.67. 222.222&gt; Alternative DNS server: 208.67.220.
<br />
<br />Let me know if it helped

            Hello CommFox,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

    <title>Problems with restoring chat history when upgrading OS or Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ubu english  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with restoring chat history when upgrading OS or Skype</h2>
                    <p>My problem is that I switched from an old Win8 machine running classic Skype to a new Win10pro machine running MS Skype (v.12). On my new box, I can see all of my contacts from when I started using Skype (years ago) to the present but there is no chat history,
 except for the most recent conversations on this box. I surmise from this that my contacts are archived on Skype servers but the actual chat history is stored locally (except for the last 30 days which is also held in the cloud). I still have my old box, so
 presumably the chat history is still there, in a local file. So, it looks like I have two stores, which together hold my complete chat history. Ideally, I would like to have access to my complete chat history on my new box, which begs the question, can I merge
 the two stores and integrate that with MS Skype on my Win10Pro machine. That would be great, and very nice to have, and it would allow me to have all my Skype chat data in one place, that continues to be updated as I use Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what I really need at a minimum for business and legal purposes, is a complete record of all my chats with all my customers. I also need to be able to view these files, perhaps as a CSV in Excel. For that I would need a way to export my full chat
 history from Skype 7 on my old box, and do the same from my new box. Not ideal but at least I would have a permanent archive of my Skype 7 chat history and and active archive on my new box from the time switched over.<br />
<br />
Am I making sense? Any suggestions as to how I might get a permanent and complete history on my new box or a how I could go about creating an accessible archive from the old one?</p>

            You should reinstall Skype 7 (Classic in order to restore your chat history):
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>USB MICE UNUSABLE &#47; Error CODE 10 Device Manager &#40;PS&#47;2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB MICE UNUSABLE &#47; Error CODE 10 Device Manager &#40;PS&#47;2 Bug&#41;</h2>
                    Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
I'm encountering a really annoying and unpredictable problem: for a reason I ignore, my mice (Mad Catz RAT 7) isn't recognized by Windows and has just stop working.<br />
<br />
When I plug it in, the mice's leds lights up 10sec then suddently light off, and the cursor/clics don't move/operate at all.<br />
I've tested my RAT 7 on a different computer (Dell XPS 13 L322X, running Windows 10), it works. Then, I plugged a different mice on my computer (Dell XPS 15 9560, running Windows 10), this one didn't work and wasn't recognized too.<br />
Moreover, all my USB ports works correctly (tested with other stuff like USB Drive, External Drive, External SoundCard, Windows Phone...).<br />
<br />
So, the problem is on the software side.<br />
<br />
There what my device manager shows:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e65e5985-f232-427e-8bd7-6d1904e1569e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e65e5985-f232-427e-8bd7-6d1904e1569e" /></a><br />
<br />
We can see that the RAT 7 is still recognized as the driver is still installed on my computer.<br />
Since, I've tried to uninstall/reinstall this driver, but it didn't change anything to my problem.<br />
<br />
On the picture, we can see a "PS/2 compatible mice" that can't actually rune (error code 10):<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed53fae5-5770-4e96-86f0-647755a19c2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed53fae5-5770-4e96-86f0-647755a19c2c" /></a><br />
<br />
I've tried to uninstall this device from device manager, and plugging again my RAT 7, without success.<br />
I've tried to uninstall everything under "USB bus" including the host one and restart, without success too.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've tried this tricks too:<br />
<br />
_built-in Windows problem/issue solver in administrator mode + Microsoft Fix it tools<br />
_attempt to delete registry keys "Upperfilter"/"Lowerfilter" in LOCAL MACHINE, but those keys appeared to basicaly not exist on my system...<br />
_system restore before the bug appeared<br />
_attempt to repair from a Windows 10 live USB boot<br />
<br />
...WITHOUT SUCCESS :'(<br />
<br />
I'm asking you now becaus I'm kinda running out of options actually, and I strictly don't want to reinstall/format my system as I've been doing it 2 weeks ago and been reinstalling my whole CAD/DAW software suites...<br />
<br />
I'll send you every kind of logs files that could be useful! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwindowsforum.com%2fstyles%2fdefault%2fxenforo%2fclear.png" /><br />

<p>The track is just new. This happened before I raised windows 10 to something like this. The more I charge the more I stay at 99%. And it always shows up, it's never 100%. What I **** talking about is not related to the battery life, it is completely software-oriented
 and if I return to win8 surely the problem will come to an end</p>

<p>You may want to try the freely available Google Picasa&nbsp;http://picasa.google.com</p>
<p>I switched from Kodak Easyshare to Google Picasa and am pleased. Google's application seems to run much faster than Kodak Easyshare and is feature full, but there are some downsides.</p>
<p>Google Picasa insists on scanning your computer for pictures. This can sometimes be annoying since Picasa will not always find the pictures immediately upon transfer. &nbsp;Also, Picasa sometimes needs some coaxing to properly detect my docked Kodak Camera when
 using the default XP Drivers. This might have worked better if I were to have installed the drivers that came with Easy Share
<strong>before</strong> installing Picasa. Since you already have the Kodak drivers installed for your camera, Picasa may detect your camera easier than it did mine.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t send mail from Drafts in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sashton63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t send mail from Drafts in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I decided to try Mail in Windows 10. I've sent mail a few times that was kicked back for one reason or another. MS put the original into the Drafts folder. But there is no way to resend it! Resend option is grayed out. There is also no way to move it
 anywhere but Junk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this or will everything that goes to Drafts become useless? I need to know because I am trying to decide what mail app to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - out of all the relatively useless Categories you have, wouldn't Windows 10 or Mail be a useful addition? Ah, I see, you have to drill down through three layers to add one category...</p>

<h2>            Screen flickers and distorts using bootcamp</h2>
                    Hi, I am using bootcamp on my MacBook pro early 2015 to use windows 8.1. However, the screen flickers and distorts. I have tried reinstalling windows and the problems still the same. I disabled my iris intel 6100 graphics drivers and the flickering/distortion
 stopped. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks

<h3> bandroid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing photo&#39;s with windows 10 default Photo software very reddish and blurry</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before my printer was conected on a windows 7 PC. and this printer printed flawless photo's. real colours and very sharp.</p>
<p>We changed to a windows 10 laptop, and when i want to print a photo with the default software , the photos are less sharp and reddish. when i do it with GIMP they are fine, but i hate gimp for printing if i is none standard formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i took the windows 7 PC out of the attic and printed the same photo. it was again flawless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the default windows photo app in windows 10 buggy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>any good free printing software?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            This definitely is a bug. Give this a try first to see if it helps:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Photos
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates 
<br />
<br />If not, please file a bug report and send me the short link so I can vote on it:

<p>Dead pixels. I have a Windows XP computer that has it too. You can use 3rd party programs to fix it. However, it might be unremovable
</p>

<h2>            Automatic Boot repair loop</h2>
                    <p>My laptop lenovo 315 ideapad is hung up in an Automatic Repair loop showing message for logFiles inside srtTrail.txt, possibly the reason is that I pressed the power button twice when booting. I have attempted all the solution options in below mentioned
 links -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/automatic-repair-error-srttrailtxt/e462bd3f-2b92-4ed1-8b1c-ed4866256f46</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;https://www.howto-connect.com/fix-srttrail-txt-windows-10-error-automatic-repair-loop/</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main intention is to retrieve my onedrive folder, which contents significant data and the drive hasn't synced&nbsp; since january 2019, but crucial data updated on daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to perform reset option with keep my files provision in it, as it is unable to finish the operation.</p>
<p>I am able to access my dual boot Linux Ubuntu but the Onedrive folder shows up as unsupported reparse point&nbsp; and a file worth few KBs.</p>
<p>Lenovo diagnostics test shows failed for drive self test, short self test as failed leading to rigor conclusion of hard drive corruption. However, if that was the case I wouldn't have been able to access all my files through dual boot.</p>
<p>Possibly a windows 10 issue...!</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Try manually repairing boot records, using these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.<br />
<br />
2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.<br />
<br />
3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.<br />
<br />
4. Under Advanced options screen, click Command Prompt.<br />
<br />
5. Type following commands one-by-one and press Enter key after each:<br />
<br />
BOOTREC /SCANOS<br />
<br />
BOOTREC /FIXMBR<br />
<br />
BOOTREC /FIXBOOT<br />
<br />
BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD<br />
<br />
6. Close Command Prompt and see if you can boot now.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps!<br />

            Hi Saura,
<br />
<br />I would suggesting removing your hard drive and using an external connector to connect to another Windows based PC. Then browse to the OneDrive folder that way. 
<br />
<br />Windows will tell you if there is a problem with that drive. if it's corrupted you may need to send it to a data recovery specialist.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
<br />Ryan

            <p>I had exactly the same problem on Win10 after a couple of crashes and an attempt to update. It refused to install or run, always giving error 0x80070003 in Store update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to finally clear the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I did was this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) First,&nbsp;open an elevated command prompt window,&nbsp;and run the command to clear Store cache:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wsreset</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Now start PowerShell console and do the steps you mentioned earlier:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the full package name:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get-appxpackage *castle*</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.)&nbsp;Then force remove the package using the fullname you find from step a:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove-appxpackage Microsoft.AgeCastles_1.14.36.0_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; *This time the remove worked without the error (only if Store cache was cleared first).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Close Store app (from Task Manager) and restart it again.&nbsp; Do update or install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I still had a failed update attempt listed in the&nbsp;Downloads and Updates&nbsp;section (I forgot to clear it before doing the remove-appxpackage), so I just did a retry,&nbsp;and it ended up downloading the entire game over (not just an update) and it worked
 fine.&nbsp; I used similar steps for a different game I had problems with and it worked there as well, but&nbsp;that one I had to search for game again and do Install.&nbsp; So either retry update or install depending on what Store thinks your&nbsp;state is.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps anyone else seeing this same (or similar) problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Clester,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to run SFC scan and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong><span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted
 files. If a </span><strong><span>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</span></strong><span> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right click on the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, click on
<strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Type “<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>” without the quotes and hit
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>After the scan, restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong>I<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> suggest you to perform
</span><span>a </span>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Clean Boot</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> to
</span><span>check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Putting your system in
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual
