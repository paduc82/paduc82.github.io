<h2>            I cant get my computer to run with out screen flashes and annoying crashes.</h2>
                    <p>Insider preview build 16299</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive had so many problems in this particular build.&nbsp; okay where to start. ] screen flashesI get a lot of them following closely behind are app freezes. I work a lot with picture files and music. I am an artist so I have purchased and downloaded from Microsoft
 several apps known for creativity and features which help me evolve artistically.so...&nbsp; It seems&nbsp; every app or file I&nbsp; use daily are affected so its terribly frustrating. My files are missing or have changed when I reopen them. Application&nbsp; I use will close
 without warning with this it doesn't matter if i save all the way through a project if it crashes it is gone or changed to the very beginning.&nbsp; I cant use my music files because there is so many screen flashes and audio sound&nbsp; is so distorted music sounds
 terrible to tell you the truth. My pictures and video files are a constant hide and seek game. Everything I love is such a pain to do anymore. Ive been patient with my self and this pc. there have been times where this is all I do is prepare for a project
 by&nbsp; trouble-shooting but it does not matter i will follow every step everything is great and when i restart my pc hopefully crossing fingers... it begins again. back to square one Or the loop. Whatever I am doing is clearly not working.&nbsp; its driving me senseless.
 . Updates are no where to be found. Every time i troubleshoot a problem this seems to be the the issue ... I have pending updates. So I click on updates and I see none.&nbsp; i search for updates and download them and start all over and the same issues all over&nbsp;
 time after time. I come back and find ... no updates installed. Its a problem Ive tried to resolve but am exhausted from my efforts. i have more than one disability one very challenging. This creators update I was very excited about... But not so much anymore.
 Im losing my drive to get back on this badly bruised pc. Its hard to imagine a finished project in the future. One drive its not working its missing some of my biggest files. I don't even want it on my pc or handling anything I find valuable. I am looking
 elsewhere. Microsoft I am also one of the Insiders because I love to help for one but the biggest motivation for joing The insiders group was to have insight as to why my pc is not functioning as it should and how i can assist in making windows 10 better.
 I hope I have helped somewhat. Ive been challenged. Ive looked for answers by trouble shooting and through posts ive read. I am old who always looks at a given situation such as this update, as a new opportunity for growing. But i am a grumpy old woman now.
 I am asking,can we even resolve for issues? Or do I need to scrap this silly and derailed imposter. Grandma DOGDasani Help&nbsp; waiting on next.&nbsp;</p>

Is this Insider Preview?  Have you tried rolling back in Settings&gt; Recovery&gt; Go Back?

1) Please work through this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs are done: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00

3) If no  Safe Mode, from the Advanced Startup Options use the Command Prompt at boot to run the Repair Commands in the Checklist:  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reloaded an image of 16299 and updated to 16299.15 again from an image this time... The problem does not exist...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reloaded an image of the installation of 16299.15 that had problems, and it is currently OK as well... There may have been some type of graphics driver update tht happened after the image was created... For now it is OK...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we are on the subject I think I should mention some strange behavior I observed while upgrading 16299 to .15...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;The downloading of updates during the install was extensive... Far longer than usual... Even when the screen to install Windows 10, and Keep Personal files was appearing, it was still downloading and continued for at least another 15 minutes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; After rebooting and "Updating" the machine quickly went to 30%... the screen went black momentarily, then started at 0% again... This happened multiple times, and I have never observed this behavior before...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 5 tries it finally settled down at 16% and proceded to 30% and a restart normally...</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The installation would repeatedly hang at certain percentages... 42% for instance... then suddenly jump to 75% and restart... It did this again at around 82% after which it suddenly jumped to 98% and hung again...</p>
<p>Everything eventually completed successfully and I have noticed no issues so far...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; I did the same upgrade to a Win 7 Pro SP1 image... Strangely, it displayed none of the unusual actions of the 16299 to 16299.15 upgrade, and upgraded the same as the previous builds...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a bit off subject, but I thought the weird stuff may have contributed to the OP's problem... Restarting while still downloading maybe...</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your assistance. I'm truly grateful. Even more so that Ive read there is progress for some and I cant wait to give it a shot as well. Ive been at my wits end because my pc will not reset. I followed all the steps suggested without success.
 My pc will not reset... Im going to try one last time before i give up. Is there a logical reason why a pc wont reset?? Please advise me if anyone else is having this issue. Im hanging in there hoping something magical will happen</p>

Anyone knows what/how the auto-tagging params are added to the destination URLs if the URLs in question are already composed of a third party redirection tracking link (that should remain untouched).</p>

            <p>Good Afternoon Carla,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your question. When setting up the auto tagging you will see these to options.
</p>
<br />
Add
 UTM tags to my destination URLs
<p>
</p><p>If you choose Replace all tags it will just remove what is there and insert our standard tag.</p>
<p>http://www.destinationURL.com?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Sales&amp;utm_content=Clearance&amp;utm_term=Shoes
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you keep the tags we will just leave the tag alone and only add it in cases where there is no existing tag at all</p>
<p><a href="http://www.destinationURL.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.destinationURL.com</a> would then be appended to add</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.destinationURL.com?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Sales&amp;utm_content=Clearance&amp;utm_term=Shoes

            <p>When I signed up with skype and bought some credit balance as well as a subscription for a telephone number I did not expect to have so much trouble with the cash outflows later on.</p>
<p>When my tax comissioner asked me for the tax invoice I was not able to get any legal document, he would accept. The only paper I was able to download was a monthly statement. Great, this document is only of use to keep track of all the things I buy but has
 no legal value when it comes to tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have expected to much more from Skype and Microsoft - to know, what documents their customers need later on to firstly declare cash outflows officially, as well as to get the paid VAT back (by VAT declaration). But no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not going to buy any more stuff on skype, since it only caued me headache and money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only advise German business customers not to buy anything on skype until this issue is resolved.</p>
<p>

    <title>how do I delete extra rows in excel&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidlobenstine  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I delete extra rows in excel&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I am using Excel for Mac 2011. A few weeks ago, I noticed that the two other spreadsheets I have been using for years suddenly had thousands and thousands of empty rows -- 1,048,756, to be exact.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The result is that it takes forever to load and do simple sums and all the rest.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The standard method of highlighting an empty row and clicking delete doesn't actually erase all of these empty rows. And I can't find any solution in the forums to delete such a large number of empty rows.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, when I open a new workbook, it automatically has thousands and thousands of empty rows. So it seems like there is something screwed up with my preferences, but I can't find anything in preferences that determines the total number of rows.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do you have any brilliant ideas?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>If you read the message you Replied to you'll see that the number of Columns &amp; Rows is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, however, Excel does not print the unused parts of a worksheet that extend beyond the actual content area of the sheet. It would seem that your assumption is correct -- You need to examine how you're going about creating the PDF [which is a

            <p>Hi shiftless,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due system, update error or hardware issue.</p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to Hard Reset the phone; as all system and update errors can be fixed, by restoring system to factory settings. To do that please follow steps below;
</p>
<p>1. First Backup your stuff;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>*You can also sync your phone with pc and backup your stuff manually, via sync app or in Explorer Mode, by drag and drop - to make sure that files are stored locally.</em></p>
<p>2. Next you can proceed with Hard Reset;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/reset-my-phone</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*make sure that device is charged properly, as this might take anything from few minutes up to several hours.</p>
<p>3. After that you can restore from backup;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When Hard Reset is done, make sure to;</p>
<p>- setup Wi-Fi</p>
<p>- Settings - Date+Time, setup manually/Auto-Off</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know, if the issue persists.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Add My Templates to Quick Access ribbon</h2>
                    I have Office 2007 running in Windows 7 and I would like to add access to My Templates to the Quick Access ribbon.&nbsp; I have created a personal template that I use constantly and I would like to be able to open that template without having to go through
 the steps of clicking on New and then My Templates to get to it.&nbsp; Is there any way to add My Templates to the Quick Access ribbon so that I can just click on it?<br />

<div>
<p>What should I do to make it work? What step should I add?</p>

</p><p>Hi KrzysztofSawtyruk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read you post carefully and I want to share with you my idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4467880/how-to-copy-items-between-two-sharepoint-lists-by-using-flow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to use Flow to copy items between two data sources</a>, You must populate all the required columns. There's no requirement that the names of all columns in your two data sources be the same, but there must be at least one column (of your choice) that will
 be able to uniquely identify items between the two data sources.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I found that the second system is slower on all my dual boot PC's. Of course, it would have to do that the second one is the Insiders on all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my new PC, the main system's boot time to the desktop is 20 seconds, compared to almost 2 minutes for the Insiders.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dual booting does not choke your system. Even if it is called dual booting, you only boot to a single system. And that system has all the resources in your computer available to it. All RAM, all CPU cycles belong to that system only. Except that you may
 share the HDD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Insider build is slower in your system, then that may be because Insider build may not yet be optimized.</p>

            <p>Further to my post above, if you have a fairly new system that has UEFI motherboard which has a compatibility support module ( CSM ) on it and two separate HDDs /SSDs, then you can use one HDD/SSD for GPT-partitioning and the other HDD/SSD for MBR-partitioning
 to install two separate Windows 10 installations that do not affect each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scenario, you can boot to any HDD/SSD by selecting boot priority during boot time or giving priority in boot order in BIOS.</p>
<p>

            <p>It looks like some are talking just about Boot Times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case the reason the second is slower is because of the Fast Start. If you turn that off every OS system boots as fast as your computer is capable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Win 10 Fast, Win 10 Release Preview and Win 7. Any of them can be set to Default and time delay can be set as low as 3 seconds. If you can react fast enough to select which OS you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Fast start is on and you go to any thing other than the default it seems to me that the computer had to Reboot to go to anything except the Default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Fast Start Off you have to select which OS you want by moving up or down with arrow keys but the second you hit the Enter key You are up and running in seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not win 7 boot is faster than either of win 10 builds.:)</p>

            <p>Try resetting the Office connection.&nbsp; You can do that through Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Office.&nbsp; Otherwise, as mentioned earlier in the thread, you'll want to make sure the primary account on the phone is the same as what you're signing into the app with.&nbsp;
 Under Settings -&gt; Email+Accounts, it will be Windows Live (for Windows Phone 7 models) or Microsoft Account (for Windows Phone 8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, frequently just restarting the phone and syncing the primary account will fix it.&nbsp; You can restart the phone easiest by holding the power button for 15-20 seconds.&nbsp; When it comes back on, go to Settings -&gt; Email+Accounts and tap and hold on the primary
 account and tap on Sync.</p>

<h2>            O365 Groups&#58; Shared Templates lists &#38; Shared site columns</h2>
                    <p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Office 365 groups per client account, where we retain standard information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that we can have standard lists saved in a template gallery that are accessible to all Office 365 groups? Does a Office 365 group work as a separate site collection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, would it be possible to have shared site columns? On the main site collection, we created standards master lists (as an example, a list of all possible Operating System versions), that then were used for Choice type site columns, which then could be
 used on all subsites. We were looking to do the same but using Office 365 groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paulo</p>

<p><span>Hi Paulo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Office 365 group site is slightly different from the team site. When you create a new group, you can’t use the custom site template to create the group site
 and the group site is created automatically. So if you want to use the group features based on Exchange Online, you may need to manually upload some content template like a list template via the way I recommended above. However, for creating subsites in the
 group site, you can use the custom site template including the lists and columns you want, to avoid some issues, I suggest you create the same lists and columns as the team site template you use in the group site and then navigate to the group site&gt;Site Content&gt;Site
 Settings&gt;save it as template first. Then you can navigate to the group site&gt;Site Content&gt;Subsite&gt;Custom&gt;use the group site template to create subsites. The content such as lists and site columns in the group site template will appear in the created subsites.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>"SMS sync is enabled (No phone connected).</p>
<p>We were unable to find an SMS Relay enabled phone. Check that SMS Relay has been enabled on your phone by going to Skype &gt; Settings &gt; SMS."</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Android device (Note 8) I go to my profile, click the gear at the top right of the screen. The Settings screen is displayed and there is no SMS option there. I poked around other places and still found no way to turn on this SMS Relay. Maybe it's there
 but I missed it. Does anyone know where this option can be found? Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Thank you I wasn't aware of the Preview Version, and hadn't come across anything online that mentioned it. I will install it and look for the SMS Sync option. Also, after posting my question (of course after) I found other threads specifically discussing
 the removal of SMS Sync in the latest versions, so if those discussions are correct that explains why I don't see it at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I appreciate the information and will give the preview version a shot.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007 not saving pop3 password. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lerlh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 not saving pop3 password.</h2>
                    <p>The laptop is running XP SP3 and happily will save passwords for Outlook Express. I have tried all the options in Microsoft support notice Article ID: 290684 and have checked exhaustively for malware and viruses. It will pass the test when setting up the
 account but as soon as you complete and try a send/receive&nbsp; the error box pops up requiring a password. Of course the same thing happens when you restart Outlook. It appears to create entries in the Protected storage registry key but some how fails to store
 the password or cannot access it.</p>
<p>I have removed Office and used the Microsoft Office install clean up routines to tidy up before the reinstall but no joy. I have also installed Office 2003 temporarily and encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>It would appear something is corrupt with XP or the registry but what is the issue. If anyone has some suggestions I would be immensely grateful.</p>

<br />Can you try changing the user agent string in any of those web browsers you are using to see if it helps?
<br />
<br />See steps how to do that:

            Hi Le.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The site is not opening with any warning for me in Edge.  
<br />
<br />I suggest you use another browser.  I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser.  Set the preferred one as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />If you need to report a website that is being falsely labeled a phishing site, see here:  <a href="https://www.interserver.net/blog/why-your-site-is-flagged-as-a-phishing-site-in-google-and-what-you-can-do-to-remove-the-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.interserver.net/blog/why-your-site-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
