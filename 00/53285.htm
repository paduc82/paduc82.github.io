<h2>            &#34;CD&#47;DVD drive device driver is missing&#34; Windows 7 Pro Installation from 8</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Windows 8.1 64-bit (Hp Envy) laptop. Upgraded to 8.1 pro so that I could have downgrade rights to Windows 7 Pro.<br />
<br />
I changed to Legacy Boot in order to boot the Windows 7 Installation Disc (I have an external optical drive connected by USB). I've also downloaded an official Windows 7 Pro 64-bit (English) ISO and used the Windows tool to create a bootable USB. This confirms
 I have no problem with my copy of Windows that I'm trying to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I begin the installation, I get the message displayed in the title, as many have. I only have USB 3.0 ports (4 of them), so I cannot utilize the solution that most have, which is switching your USB drive to a USB 2.0 port from a 3.0, or merely just
 changing USB ports after canceling installation and re-clicking 'Install Now'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot try to locate drivers obviously since it's missing the USB drivers to begin with. I've researched the solution where you disable AHCI in BIOS, but I don't believe that mode exists for my computer, since BIOS's verify from manufacturer to manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other solutions are there out there? I've been researching for hours over the past couple of weeks, no luck yet. I really don't want to return my Windows 8 laptop, but if I have to I will, and I can just stick with my old laptop and upgrade its specs
 manually. And no, staying with Windows 8 is not an option, ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any assistance you can offer!</p>

<p><strong>Are you sure your computer even supports Windows 7?</strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>
</span></span></p><p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 8 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>

<br />
<span><span>
<p>Consumer versions of Windows 8 Pro that come preinstalled on PCs have downgrade rights to a previous version of Windows (example: Windows 7, Windows Vista).</p>
<p>If your copy came pre-installed on your system, you may downgrade your copy to Windows 7.</p>
<p>If not you need purchase a copy of Windows 7 and install the same on your computer.</p>
<p>• Downgrade rights are only available for licenses obtained through OEM or Volume Licensing (VL) and not apply to Full version (FPP).</p>
<p>• OEM downgrade rights apply to Windows 8 Pro and allows for downgrades up to two prior version</p>
<p>• Software Assurance through VL (Volume licensing) provides the greatest flexibility, allowing for downgrades to all prior versions and editions besides Windows 7 Ultimate and Vista Ultimate editions.Without Software Assurance coverage, VL has downgrade
 rights to prior versions of Windows with the exception of Enterprise.</p>
<p>• It is not possible for a Windows 8 copy with multi-language function to downgrade to Windows 7 Pro or Windows XP Pro as multi language function is exclusive to Windows 7 Enterprise edition and not available for Professional edition.</p>

            <p>Okay, didn't know about downgrade rights being only OEM. Shouldn't affect Windows 7 installation tho. I've already done all the steps provided by the pcmag link, that's why I'm asking about the missing driver problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hp does support drivers for Windows 7 on my machine, I've already got them all. But if Windows 7 installation can't even read USB drive or USB CD/DVD drive, they're of no use.</p>

    <title>Change Windows 7 Professional from 32 bit to 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwsmith80202  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Windows 7 Professional from 32 bit to 64 bit</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a refurbished Gateway computer yesterday. It was running Windows Vista 64 bit. I had purchased directly from Microsoft a download&nbsp;of Windows 7 Professional a few months ago. When I installed it this afternoon, it did not give me the option to
 install the 64 bit version, instead, it installed the 32 bit version. How can I change it to the 64 bit version.</p>
<p>This computer has 6GB of RAM and I understand I need the 64 bit version to take advantage of that. Any other advantages?</p>

<p>You will need to download the 64 bit .ISO file from Microsoft, burn it to a blank DVD and install it.</p>
<p>Go to the Microsoft Store website, log in with your store account, select Download Options and select Windows 7 64 bit and proceed to download.</p>
<p>Burning a Windows 7 ISO File on a DVD<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/977640</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

    <title>Taskbar flickering on boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nils olesen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar flickering on boot</h2>
                    <p>So what happened is that I tried to boot the computer, but I got several error messages regarding not being able to access group session or something similar, both before I saw the login screen and after. I could not log in to my account at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then shut the computer off normally, and on the following startup, it initiated windows update. However, the update messages kept blinking frantically, not like they normally do during an update, so I cut the power after about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the next boot, I was able to log in as usual, but I ended up with the taskbar flickering while the rest of the desktop was black. I was not able to interact with the taskbar at all, but I could access the task manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I tried to use the startup repair from a USB boot device, but it failed. All of the system recoveries I tried also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to reboot in safe mode&nbsp;and this time desktop icons were visible and working, but the taskbar was not. I was able to use the "Godmode"&nbsp; on the desktop to do some troubleshooting, but all of them failed.&nbsp; Before rebooting I disabled all non-windows
 applications on boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lo and behold, nothing happened and I'm back to the blinking taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can get the computer to work normally again without erasing the entire drive, and how on earth can I avoid this from happening again? I'll gladly live without internet if Microsoft intends to wreck my computer on every "update".</p>

    <title>Problem with Analog Stick Sensitivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timrr-&#91;xboxvenue&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Analog Stick Sensitivity</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new Xbox One Controller a couple weeks ago and it's been working fine until yesterday. I went on GTA Online and when&nbsp;I noticed that my left analog stick wasn't working. I restarted the game&nbsp;and it began working again but now the sensitivity is very low (Only on&nbsp;the left analog stick) and I can't perform wheelies on bikes or turn normally in any vehicles. I tested to see if it would work on other games and the same thing started occurring. This is strange, because it never happened to any of my old controllers.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go in to Device Manager...Sound, Video, and Game Controllers, and see if you have any yellow error triangles next to your audio devices...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess would be that you need to update the drivers for your audio device(s).</p>
<p>You should be able to find them at the Drivers+Support&nbsp;webpage for your computer model...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, find the Audio chip number\model, and look at he chip manufacturers website for updates..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the audio problem is from a individual chip, or if it is part of your graphics device...</p>
<p>If you find nothing wrong in the audio, you could check that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Flickering &#38; Shadow&#47;Ghost Images</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Recently there was a Windows 10 update and since then I have been experiencing a flickering screen and shadow app screens/dialog boxes (when I shrink or close a ghost image remains). This happens after 2-3 hrs of working. Previous to the Windows upgrade it
 also happened but only after 10-12 hrs using a graphics intensive programme - only occurred 2-3 times during last 4-5 months.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Now it happens afte 2-3 hrs even when using standard apps like Excel. Previously it was only flickering but now it is flickering and have the ghost/shadow problem. I have tried the standard suggestions like upgrading drivers and uninstalling apps as suggested
 on your site.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
This is very frustrating as I have to shutdown surface pro for about an 1hr and then start again - then the problem re-occurs after 1-2 hrs and I repeat the process and this is having a big impact on my work flow and time.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
No app or software has been updated, downloaded or installed other than the windows (and possibly Microsoft Office) updates as per the normal update regular process.</p>

    <title>Audio driver&#47;card related BSOD crash dump - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctorschneid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio driver&#47;card related BSOD crash dump</h2>
                    <p>I have a 1.5-2 year old computer.</p>
<p>BSODs began appearing around 4 months ago but didnt really cause issue.</p>
<p>Recently they have become far more frequent.</p>
<p>The errors appear to be directly related to the audio drivers or sound card.</p>
<p>Upon running the programs audacity (sound editor and recording software), or reason (music production software) I receive a bsod driverIRQL_not_less_or_equal (0x00000001)</p>
<p>Plugging in speakers or microphones also returns the same blue screen with different parameters.</p>
<p>Initially I beleived the issue resided in my asio sound driver. Uninstalling the driver did not do anything.</p>
<p>Now I have narrowed the issue down to the Realtek sound driver. I found that disabling my intel sound driver does nothing but disabling the Realtek driver results in an instant blue screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dump files appear to be impossible to obtain.</p>
<p>I would like anyone who knows of a possible solution to please send any advice or information that would be able to help resolve this issue. Thanks for taking the time to read and consider my issue.</p>
<p>Below is the most recent bsod screen.</p>

You are talking about Hotmail. Yes ?<br />
Next time please specify so others know what you are referring to.<br />
Bear in mind this is Vista forum. Technically we don't deal with&nbsp;or expect to receive hotmail problems.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 has a terrible User Interface - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobeisenberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 has a terrible User Interface</h2>
                    <p>COMPLAINT.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10 is contemptuous of users' needs</strong>. Every user should use File History and System Image Backup. Yet these are very hard to find. Cortana is more or less useless. It finds almost nothing. Try it yourself as an entry to backups or
 image backups or file history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And File History and System Image backup are <strong>not listed under Windows System
</strong>OR <strong>Windows Administrative Tools in the Start Menu system</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, <strong>File History and System Image Backup are difficult to find even from Control Panel</strong>.&nbsp; This sort of thing suggests that the people responsible for Windows 10 are arrogant and are not in fact users of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there are three general ways to approach Windows 10: Cortana, Start Menu, and Control Panel.</p>
<p>NONE OF THEM ARE USEFUL for this most elementary process that every user should do.</p>

            Sorry resetting the Windows update this did not work for me. I can install all other updates, except for this one. There is something about this specific update that won't finish on my Win 7 computer.

            <p>So after the Troubleshooter reported that it fixed some issues, and prompted me to try again. I ran the
 install of that same update and it is still stuck, but this time the green progress bar was now 100% green (see screenshot below). Before the Troubleshooter fixed it, the green progress bar would get stuck at 50%.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/041c9593-78fc-45be-96af-de8b35052e9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/041c9593-78fc-45be-96af-de8b35052e9e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ran the "sfc/scannow" from the Command prompt as administrator, and it reports "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally hard reboot the computer after the Update gets stuck. Shall I do the same thing now?</p>

<p>Did anyone ever come up with a solution?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> treblig41  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell XPS 8300 bluetooth problem with Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    Since upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 over 3 months ago the inbuilt Bluetooth that came with the Dell XPS 8300 desktop no longer works.&nbsp; It does not even show up in device manager.&nbsp; I saw too late that Dell doesn't support this model on Windows
 10, even though it was a top of the range desktop just 4 years ago.&nbsp; Does anyone have the same problem or, even better, have a solution please?&nbsp; (I've tried the suggestion of renaming the old driver file but Windows 10 says very forcibly that I don't have
 permission to do so.)

            <div>Thanks again for the suggestions for getting Bluetooth to work on a 4 year old<br />
Dell XPS 8300; Pentium i7, 16GB RAM, 2TB HD, factory installed Bluetooth.<br />
I was stirred into having another go at using the workaround suggested on the<br />
Dell forum previously referenced (see above).<br />
It seems to have worked this time and here are the details, in 4 Stages.</div>
<div>A. Download the Lenovo Broadcom driver installation file (h0wz07ww.exe) from the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lenovo link given in the Dell forum shown in my earlier post. i.e.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Go to http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds031759 and download the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; driver install file and readme file.</div>
<div>B. Delete any existing Bluetooth drivers as follows: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Press Win+X, then click Control Panel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click Program and Features. (Search for "Program" if you don't see it)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click View then select Details.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Type Bluetooth in the Search box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Uninstall all drivers listed.&nbsp; I had two.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Close Control Panel and ReStart the PC</div>
<div>C. Install the new driver:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. In File Explorer, find the file h0wz07ww.exe, right click and choose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Run as Administrator.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete installation and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Finally delete the files saved in the step 1 if you wish.</div>
<div>D. The blue Bluetooth icon then appeared in the System Tray and I was finally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; able to connect other Bluetooth devices to the PC. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for the properties of the Bluetooth driver and hardware gave:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 12. By repeating Steps 2 to 5, the new bluetooth driver is shown as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lenovo Bluetooth with Enhanced Data Rate Software".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 13. Opening Device Manager, the Bluetooth card itself is shown as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dell Wireless 365 Bluetooth Module".</div>
<div>
<p>Strange to have to go to Lenovo to get a Dell factory installed Bluetooth card
<br />
working, but it seems to be a Broadcom unit underneath.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the post.</p>
<p>I followed the process, but no luck.</p>
<p>See my steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lenovo Bluetooth file installs the Broadcom Bluetooth driver (see screen shot below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a25e534f-b1ed-4778-9edb-374d318829fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a25e534f-b1ed-4778-9edb-374d318829fd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebdf4979-9804-49cd-b763-e3d7505de657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebdf4979-9804-49cd-b763-e3d7505de657" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, after I hit Finish,&nbsp;it then asks to install the enhanced data rate software (see the screen shot below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccbb8d8d-f595-41e6-8b16-8b2612b6e7a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccbb8d8d-f595-41e6-8b16-8b2612b6e7a7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I chose&nbsp;not to install the enhanced version and restarted the computer.&nbsp; Still blue tooth missing from All Settings -&gt; Devices and Device Manager and also from Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I started again and when I got the above stage, I chose to install Bluetooth with enhanced software.&nbsp; Following message window pops up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0c1ab75-0610-4c60-95f7-8ac78c234ad4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0c1ab75-0610-4c60-95f7-8ac78c234ad4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking he cancel button, I however restarted the computer hoping it might got installed.&nbsp; Still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 last year.&nbsp; Bluetooth was working fine until last month.&nbsp; I think recently anniversary updates also got installed. That may have caused the driver removed and now I do not see any traces of it on my Dell XPS 8300 desk top.&nbsp; I tried
 installing Bluetooth 360 driver from Dell in Windows 7 compatibility mode as well as without compatibility mode.&nbsp; But it ends up&nbsp;as&nbsp;this can't be installed on this version of Window (window10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP Pavilion 17 E048CA&nbsp;laptop had the same issue.&nbsp; HP however is better as they provided the upgraded version of driver for windows 10 and now Bluetooth on laptop is fine.&nbsp; Dell is either not doing anything on this matter or probable late.&nbsp; There is no
 response from them on their community website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help from Microsoft, because their updates are causing a lot of problems now and a lot time is being spent on these issues.&nbsp; Previously printer driver got removed from desktop and laptop both.&nbsp; I had to reinstall it.&nbsp; And before that there
 was problem when windows update threw out the AMD Radeon driver.&nbsp; It somehow got fixed in later windows patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft, are you there? are you listening? Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

All the other cords I've tried plugging in dont snap in and dont keep the controller charged. I have an xbox one elite controller.&nbsp;The cord that came with that stopped working after not even a week.

<h2>            Fraud&#47;Spam call from unknown tech support</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Fraud</p>
<p>I got a call on my cell from a "microsoft tech saying my computer had an internet virus and hackers were getting into all my information - but this was after my computer did start issuing a warning notice that there was a virus - I couldn't get it to stop
 until I turned it off.&nbsp; I turned it back on the next day and it was still blaring.&nbsp; The thing is the "Tech" didn't seem official.&nbsp; I asked what it would cost and he said he could help me but if not, we'd go from there...odd response.&nbsp; Is this a scam?&nbsp; What
 about the message on my computer?&nbsp; I called MS tech support and the guy said they do not call out to customers - ever.</p>

            <p>Hello Eileen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, Microsoft won't call to customer.&nbsp;There are some cases where Microsoft will work with your Internet service provider and call you to fix a malware-infected computer. These calls will be made by someone with whom you can verify you already are a
 customer. You will never receive a legitimate call from Microsoft or our partners to charge you for computer fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I guess the call you've received might be a suspicious spam call. If you think you might be a victim of fraud, you can report it. For more information, see&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/online-privacy/avoid-phone-scams.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Avoid
 tech support phone scams</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, go for a complete System Scan with Windows Defender or with available Antivirus Software to see if any malware causing issues with your computer. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning
 and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. Go to the

<span>Download Now</span>, and then follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep posted if you require further assistance.</p>
