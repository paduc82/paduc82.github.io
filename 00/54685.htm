    <title>Windows 10 latest update caused overheating&#47;ruined battery life - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 latest update caused overheating&#47;ruined battery life</h2>
                    <p>My laptop installed a windows update a few days ago and then for the next few days it would heat up and turn the fan on literally just from turning on, when before it could stay cool without the fan for hours if I wasn't running anything demanding. I restarted/switched
 it off several times but there was no change, and my battery life, which is one of the main reasons I liked the laptop because I need it for the library/campus, was cut from 6+ hours to less than 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled the update, had to reset because of errors, and now after taking hours out of my week the laptop is back to normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, even though I selected 'defer updates' and set my connection to metered the update has downloaded itself and is forcing me to install it soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some way for me to stop this update at least for a few months? My laptop &nbsp;is literally worthless to me with so little battery life, I won't be able to take it to lectures anymore or sit in the library for more than 2 hours, and I can't imagine my
 laptop being able to run games or whatever for long without overheating completely. It's just unfair that I can't defer it until it is less problematic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<h2>            Inaccessible_boot_device</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i was watching tv show on laptop and when i went to pause it nothing was responding, not my keyboard, not touchpad. I left it few minutes to see will something change and when it didn't I restarted laptop and than I was faced with problem i still can't solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon every restart i get Innacessible_boot_device error and option to restart or go to advanced settings. Nothing under advanced settings works, not repair, not safe mode, not troubleshooting etc. I think i have exhausted my options there because nothing
 works and I always get end message "there was problem while resetting your computer".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After calling technical support they told me it must be because I turned laptop off while there was update going on in background i wasn't aware of, and keyboard and touchpad wasn't working at that moment because it so happened their drivers were updating
 at that moment. So I broke update in process and now I can't do anything but endless cycle of failed restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know can I do anything to reboot it or put it back to factory settings or anything, it's two months old ASUS ROG GL753V and i don't mind losing files because everything is backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for answers!</p>

<p>Hi Balq,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</p>
<p><br />
•&nbsp;When was the last time it was working?<br />
•&nbsp;What is the version of Windows installed on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;Does it happen with all the files?<br />
For the picture icons not showing you will need to enable the thumbanil view for the files.</p>
<p>Using Folder Options in Control Panel, you can change the way your files and folders function, as well as how the content in your folders is displayed.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Open <strong>Folder</strong> <strong>Options</strong> by clicking the <strong>
Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking<strong> Appearance and Personalization</strong>, and then clicking Folder Options.<br />
•&nbsp;Click the <strong>View</strong> tab, and then select the<strong> Always show icons, never thumbnails</strong> and
<strong>uncheck</strong> the box.<br />
•&nbsp;Click <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Apply</strong></p>

<p>For the default icons show up for the files that are not associated with any file you will need to either install the program that supports the file type or make sure that the files are associated with the right file type on the computer.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open the folder that contains the file you want to change.<br />
2.&nbsp;Right-click the file that you want to change, and then, depending on the type of file, either click Open With or point to Open With and then click Choose Default Program.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click the program that you want to use to open this file.<br />
4.&nbsp;Do one of the following:<br />
•&nbsp;If you want all files of that type to open in the same software program, select the Always use the selected program to open this kind of file check box, and then click OK.<br />
•&nbsp;If you want only that file to open in the software program this one time, clear the Always use the selected program to open this kind of file check box, and then click OK.</p>

    <title>Microphone function is not working in Headset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microphone function is not working in Headset</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Microphone Issues</p>
<p>Alright, so, I've looked this up, and I rarely see this problem, and when I do, the solution doesn't seem to work.<br />
<br />
So, I recently purchased a new headset, my first as a matter of fact, as well as a new keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; Everything seems to work fine except for the microphone included with the headset.&nbsp; When I try to use it, the sound isn't detected.&nbsp; The device is recognized
 under Sound and the green bars move as well.&nbsp; Then, when I try to use the microphone with another program, nothing happens, even the microphone/speech recognition setup doesn't pick it up.&nbsp; The headset has two plugs, both which are put into the front of the
 desktop, one speaker/headset and one microphone.&nbsp; This is where they are plugged in and the headset works, so I know it isn't that.&nbsp; I see in the few answers to mess with settings and such if the green bars are showing, and I have, to no avail.&nbsp; Note, this
 is in Windows 7 and I am not good with computers hardware, software, etc.&nbsp; So saying "What's your video card HD graphics driver update" and stuff won't really help all that much, try to explain as much as possible.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit:&nbsp; The headset is the TactX Headset by Alienware, and I will try the troubleshooting now.</p>
<p>Edit #2:&nbsp; Wow, thanks the troubleshooter worked, apparently the headset wasn't set as the default device, I thought default communications device was enough, the troubleshooter changed that and now it works.&nbsp; Thanks a lot!<br />

            I did not mind Cortana when I first upgraded to Windows 10, but since my last updates yesterday, which by the way took forever and maybe added a couple things I would never use anyway, like linking my phone with my lap top, or putting people on my task
 bar; still did not fix the Flash Player issue in Edge. &nbsp; Edge is totally useless to me now that you can't get the Flash Player to work; anyway, now the search bar for Cortana is white and irritating.&nbsp; Who needs it glaring at you all the time.&nbsp; We know where
 Cortana is if we want to use it, so why shine it at us?&nbsp; Sounds like to me, Microsoft needs to review their technicians who come up with hair brained ideas that no one cares about.&nbsp; Those ideas just makes a person decide to dump Microsoft and go with Apple
 or something else. &nbsp;&nbsp; I always thought Microsoft was IT.&nbsp; Have to re-think IT.

<p>Is this a joke, you think that this is an answer. You took my money, there is no actual support other than this stupid posting board. There's no customer service to speak of, but certainly you have&nbsp;no problem taking my money and not providing the service
 I have paid for. I think the State Attorney General should be notified and have them involved in this matter, in fact the feds may have to be involved. It seems illegal to be advertising and collecting money across state lines and not providing the service
 people are paying for. By going across state lines I mean you are using the internet as you would regular mail to promote what looks like a con, you haven't provided any customer service phone numbers and I mean one that actually works and doesn't just dump
 you into please hold hell. You have my info. call me with a resolution. If there is no resolution then I want my money refunded A.S.A.P.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you don't have my contact info. the next question would be why not?&nbsp; again, you have enough info to take my money. I say take since you are not providing me with the service I paid for which is v.o.i.p. service on a Philips VOIP841 phone. Oh and to throw
 salt on an open wound you raised the annual from $90 to $149.82 wow! $59.82 jump for what???? oh yeah no damned service that's what. You know what give me back my money, keep your imaginary service, in fact everyone reading this board for the same problem
 should demand their money back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;If you want to call me back you can call my SKYPE number, I bet you idiots will actually try even though you know it doesn't work. Oh and if it forwards to my cell number be advised that doesn't work either, I try to answer the call and it won't answer,
 even if it did the primary use is to have my Skype phone at HOME ring. My cell phone doesn't need skype on it.</p>

<p>I got a MagicJack, and it's working perfectly. &nbsp;I hooked it up to my modem/router and an old cordless landline phone. &nbsp;You purchase the device for $35 and get a year unlimited free service and a US phone number in your choice of area codes. &nbsp;It's about $30
 a year after that, and you can purchase international minutes for the same price as Skype. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem with my hook-up and the customer service at MagicJack was excellent. &nbsp;Competent, polite-really superior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also hook up to your computer with USB. &nbsp;The device is about 2" x 1" x 1/2". &nbsp;Probably your phone, too. &nbsp;Check out their website. &nbsp;I'm impressed.</p>

<h2>            Application Error&#58; Oxc0000006 Computer will not start</h2>
                    My problem is the error message was Oxc0000006. It takes forever for the computer to get to that point and after clicking okay the screen goes blue. I do not have the Windows XP cds because I bought the computer from my school district as used, some licensing
 agreement. I should have made the backup discs which were sitting on the desktop but didn't. I have the computer's system software discs but they are no help because it is really the OS. I can run the diagnostics from the black screen, but can't start in Safe
 or anything else. The diagnostics say there is a problem with the read test. Error Code 0F00: 0244 Msg: Block 43441213. The tech support said to take in for repair. Is there anything I can do on my own without the Windows XP discs?

Do what Tech Support suggest and when you get it back, make the backup discs.

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection ........HELP</h2>
                    <p>Playing MSC is VERY frustrating........</p>
<p>Gets even more frustrating after a Microsoft Upgrade......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have spoken to several agents at Microsoft, &amp; still the game Freezes, Restarts at random times, the screen goes BLACK&nbsp; &amp; etc:.</p>
<p>They have tried; Running PowerShell, Checked resources, Re-Installed Win10, Ran Win App Trouble Shooter &amp; still the same scenario...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eighty percent&nbsp;( 89%&nbsp;) of the time Solitaire is OK. it's the other 20 % that's&nbsp; frustrating.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you complete a game seamlessly &amp; progress to Spider Stack Challenge it's a horror the game<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>always
</strong></span>freezes when you are about to complete a stack, it will restart again, but when it freezes the second time the screen goes BLACK.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, in the transition to the Stack Challenge the "Commercial " runs fine....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the last <strong>upgrade </strong>the&nbsp; "Notifications " showed the following message:</p>
<p>Action Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Settings</p>
<p>Application has been blocked from accessing Graphics Interface</p>
<p>Application Solitaire.exe has been blocked</p>
<p>( time stamp )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciated any suggestions from the community.....</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Azdoge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can indeed use the Windows 7-style scrolling in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search in the Windows search bar/Cortana for Mouse &amp; touchpad settings, then scroll down a bit and under Touchpad settings you will see an entry for Reverse scrolling direction. Enable this switch, and you should be scrolling like you used to in Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helped.</p>
<p>

<p>Jack</p>

<p>Hi Azdoge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you updated the drivers for your touchpad? Open Windows Update and see if there is an update there for you. If not, you can open Device Manager, select Mice and other pointing devices, and then right click on your touchpad and select Update Driver.
 Click Search the web and see if you have a new driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new driver might enable you to access the advanced touchpad settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I could help.</p>
<p>

            Your 'Trackpad' setting are controlled by the software/driver provided by the trackpad manufacturer, you do not mention brand, so go to manufacturers website and see if they have drivers for W10, if not download &amp; install the latest driver/software and
 install with 'Admin' rights / compatibility rights.

            Hi NikolaiZ since you have a GeForce GTX 1050 can I also presume you have an i3, i5 or i7 processor
<br />
<br />That processor will also have Intel HD Audio alongside your Nvidia HD Audio
<br />
<br />The latest Windows update seems to have a bug in it, lots of users are reporting loss of audio after the latest Update 
<br />
<br />The fix is to go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the audio device drivers they recommend, those will be compatible with your PC, unlike the ones installed by Windows Update . . . 
<br />
<br />From listening to other users, it seems Windows is reporting you have Intel HD Audio, but the driver you need is a Realtek driver from that Support Page . . . 
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty locating the support page for your PC, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<br />You should go to the HP website and download the audio driver they recommend, I would say that will be a Realtek Audio driver, if I am correct . . .

            Did you update to 1809? 
<br />Currently there is a bug with this version which is causing the audio driver to be removed or replaced with a Microsoft one, the solution is to visit the manufacturer’s website to download the audio driver, beware as MS is mis-stating that it’s the Intel audio driver which is missing rather than Realtek audio for some people. 
<br />You can also try to uninstall the audio driver then run scan far hardware changes to reinstall said driver.

<h2>            7-10 Multiple Error _ No taskmgr,cmd,regedit and access is denied</h2>
                    <p>So recently I upgraded from 7 to 10, the thing is its already crazy buggy when it first started.<br />
so first Edge doesn't work... then after 1 hour, I gave up and restart the computer and reset my PC.<br />
Afraid of losing my stuff, I choose to keep my files.<br />
<br />
then the good news is Edge is now&nbsp;working.<br />
<br />
now... new problem discovered.<br />
I discovered..<br />
1. Task manager doesn't work anymore (does work before reset)<br />
2. I'm in admin local account, however C drive access is denied (but I guess that normal for W10)<br />
3. that does not stop there. most programs (app) on C drive is also not accessible. like<br />
taskmgr, cmd(admin), gpcedit.msc and somewhat others on system32. <br />
4. when I tried to run them it says "windows cannot access C:\WINDOWS\system32\taskmgr.exe"<br />
error code 0x800704b3<br />
5. troubleshooting/diagnosis doesn't work it says "A problem is preventing the T.Shooter from starting"<br />
error code 0x80070005<br />
<br />
so I tried to search for solution most of them doesn't have exactly like mine.<br />
cmd cannot run as administrator is one of the main thing I can't do most of the solution found online.<br />
<br />
so yeah. keep in mind I'm signed in as administrator. just that it is not seem to be working as one.</p>
<p>system is mess up I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help.<br />
thanks in advance, </p>

<h2>            duplex printing in windows10</h2>
                    I installed my Windows10 upgrade yesterday. Now, when I request duplex printing using my HP 6400, I get a pop-up telling me duplex is not installed on the device (it is), and refuses to print two-sided. How do I fix this?

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>What happens when you try to login to desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>Is your login password not accepted?</span></p>
<p><span>What changes were made on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Perform System restore from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)</span></p>
<p><span>a) Insert the Vista DVD, and boot from the DVD.</span></p>
<p><span>b) As you want to boot the computer from the Windows Vista DVD, you need to press a key, on your keyboard when you see the prompt. You should now see a black screen with a white status bar at the bottom
 stating Windows is loading files.... After a while, the status bar will turn completely white and you will see a screen stating that Windows is loading. The Windows Setup environment will continue to load and when finished you will be presented with a screen
 that prompts you for information about your location and language.</span></p>
<p><span>c) At this screen you should configure the Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options so that they are set correctly. When done, press the Next button. You will now
 be at the main Windows Vista setup screen where you would normally install Vista on to a computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d) As we want to repair the computer, you should click on the Repair your computer option. This will bring you to a new screen where the repair process will look for all Windows Vista installations on your
 computer. When done you will be presented with the System Recovery Options dialog box</span></p>
<p><span>e) Select the Vista installation you would like to repair</span></p>
<p><span>f) From the system recovery options, choose system restore to perform system restore.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />

</em></strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940765</a><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Method 2:<br />
Startup repair.</em></strong><br />
<br />
If you have a Windows Vista installation disc:</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Insert the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS:
 frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>7. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes
 repairs.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><em>Method 3:<br />
</em></strong><br />
Check if you are able to boot into safe mode.<br />
<br />
1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Click the Start button Picture of Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button Picture of Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span>•If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will
 need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>•If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe
 mode).</span></p>
<p><span>4. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot in safe mode then perform clean boot and check which third party software or service is causing this issue.<br />
<br />

<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp; </span>Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>7.<span>&nbsp; </span>After the computer starts, reinstall and start the program and check whether the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Check for previous issues. If your issue is resolved, follow the How to Determine what is causing the Problem section in the KB article to narrow down the exact source.

    <title>Windows 10 ISO - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 ISO</h2>
                    I was able to obtain my iso for Windows 10.&nbsp; My question is can i use this ISO image file i understand that you have to make sure you have to have a product key to do a clean install. Do i have to purchase a Windows 10 product key for this? or if i select
 upgrade, does it require a new product key even if my copy of Windows 8.1 or does it go by the free upgrade?

<h2>            Digital Download of PES 2015 accidentally deleted - how do I replace it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Followed the instructions on the "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-IE/xbox-360/store/redownload-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Redownload Xbox Content | Xbox 360</a>" page, but unfortunately when I browse for PES 2015, there is no 'Add to Queue' or 'Download Again' option. I&nbsp;can merely view the page on the Xbox Marketplace, which only gives me screenshots and an overview of the game.</p><p><br /></p><p>Is there some path I'm missing?

<h2>            Windows 7 Product ID not recognised by Microsoft</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 sucessfully in early December 2009 and successfully activated the product using the Product Key supplied. I am now trying to get product support for a backup problem and Microsoft is not recognising the 20 digit Product ID that is
 dipalyed on my PC when I go system information. Have I got to reactivate Windows 7 and if so, how do I do this?

            I was about to hunt for my Costco receipt, but decided to give it one more try. This time, when I clicked the link to ask tech support a question, I was redirected to a MS page that asked me to change some of my security setting for my trusted sites. I
 followed MS's directions, refreshed the page, and was asked to enter my product ID, and voila, it was accepted. However, I had meanwhile already fixed the problem for which I had been originally tried to get tech support, so I proceeded no further.&nbsp; Guess
 it was just as well that things went haywire the first time.<br />

<h2>            Xbox Live Networking service not shown in services.msc </h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>There are some issues running Forza Horizon 3 online. The issues are mostly teredo-related, but i've fixed all that. The Xbox-App says i the teredo settings are obtained and i should be ready to go. Also all the required ports are forwarded via my router
 and firewall.</p>
<p>Still get an error regarding DNS Settings in-game</p>

<p>Now i checked my services.msc, and noticed i'm missing 2/3 Xbox services. i only got the Xbox auth. Management, but missing the Xbox Live Networking service and another one which i forgot the name of.</p>
<p>Now i've tried downloading a seperate .reg file but regedit prevents me from installing it and returns an error that roughly says</p>

<p>"cannot import [name].reg, not all data is written to the registry. some keys are being used by the system or other processes or you don't have permissions to make this edit."</p>

<p>i've also tried importing it using PStools but with no luck either.</p>

<p>A friend of mine send me some .dll files to check (.dll.mui files that are from the missing service) but those files are on my pc, but just the service is missing?</p>

<p>Could the problem be the missing service that i cannot connect to the online Forza servers?.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Tablet buttons disabled</h2>
                    After upgrading&nbsp;my Fujitsu U-810 tablet convertible&nbsp;from Vista Home to Windows 7 Home, my tablet buttons are disabled. Screen orientation can't be rotated, up-and-down scrolling doesn't work, Ctrl-Alt-Del button doesn't work, etc. Fujutsu says my drivers
 are up to date: typical Fujitsu help.

            After installing an operating system you must then install drivers/utilities for all your hardware. You will only get these from Fujitsu's website for your specific model computer so go there and download/install all your missing drivers and utilities.
 When you say that "Fujitsu says my drivers are up to date", does that mean you already manually installed the Windows 7 drivers? It certainly sounds like all your drivers are still missing. Are you sure your tablet computer is supported in Windows 7?
