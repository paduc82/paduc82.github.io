<h2>            automatically capitalize first word of sentence</h2>
                    I wonder if there is a setting to automatically capitalize the first word of a sentence when composing an email, just as Microsoft Outlook does. &nbsp;It would be very helpful for me!

            Thanks for letting me know. &nbsp;Just out of curiosity, since others also would like this feature - has Microsoft been made aware or should I send a request/comment to them?

<h2>            Windows 10 - complete screw-up</h2>
                    <p>I followed the Register for W 10 procedure and found at some point that it had downloaded to my laptop so I foolishly continued to the Update and Install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then (now 3 days ago) I have been waiting for the wretched thing to complete and allow me back in. I have no Desktop or access to any program software (Open Office etc.), I cannot go to Control Panel or any other place to stop or reverse this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point I managed to get to System Restore just after switching on and restored to a date prior to Registering but could not change the 'Automatic' Windows Update setting to 'Notify Me', it simply ignored the change of option,&nbsp; before updating and so
 after a short time the thing set off by itself and re-downloaded and started the re-install procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I kill this download and return to my nice safe and trustworthy Windows 8.1 environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased this Packard Bell EasyNote TE about 18 mths ago from PC World and it did not come with any disks so I have nothing to use to start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me to get back to the System Restore place that I managed to access first time, before it loaded Desktop, is there some key combination immediately after switching on that allows you access to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice. My system was so messed up that none of your suggested key strokes had any affect - the system was so unstable that it would partially boot through to the normal desktop but was then frozen completely or it would flash on and off at
 such a rate that I could not choose to open Control Panel or anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left it for hours to see if something would self-diagnose and stabilise the system and after about 8 hours turned it all off in despair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rebooted it stayed stable for just long enough to open the Troubleshoot option and I then chose Restore option and the whole system closed down and restored my factory default settings. When that was completed I was back to a very stable Windows 8
 and had to choose the updates to Windows 8.1 from the lists of 187 updates that it was suggested I then load. I did this successfully and then rebuilt all my application programs, OpenOffice, etc by downloading and re-installing all that I needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now up and running again with a stable system but I will never get back that week of my life trying to undo the damage. I will not be updating to Windows 10 anytime in the near future!</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

            Yes, the upgrade to Win 10 is a nightmare. Errors and problems all over the place. I've spent hours trying to take two PCs from Win 7 SP1 to Win 10 and it's been problems and aborted attempts all the way. And it's not like I'm a tech idiot, I build systems
 for people in my spare time. &nbsp;We run Macs as well and they have never once had any problem with their OS upgrades (which are free too)... they just work. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            I purchased my laptop in Jan 2015 it was running windows 8.1.. took the upgrade offer at the end of July and it's been one nightmare after another. I get the same error every week or so that .. CRITICAL ERROR "Start up and Cortana are not working. We will
 try to repair this when you next restart" I click to restart and the same error comes up.<br />
I know when the error is going to happen because it starts with NONE of the icons in the task bar (bottom of the desktop screen) work. so far I have been advised by a windows help desk person to make a new administrator account delete the old one and see it
 that works.. it did for about 4 days, then the errors started again.. I have done the repair and recovery on start up about 3 times which works again for a few days then error comes again.. I was then told I could revert back to my previous windows version
 before 28th Aug ( my months trial) so I tried. Unfortunately it told me I had to delete all new accounts made since upgrading to windows 10.. I only had the one account (the new admin one I'd been told to make) and no option to delete it so I couldn't revert
 back and the time allowed elapsed! <br />
so now the errors continues to pop up and I am at m wits end, I am not technically minded and seriously can not afford to take my laptop into a shop at the moment.. I am so very disappointed with windows 10 and don't really know what is causing the errors.<br />
I reset my laptop a few days ago , it came back on ok , although all the acer programmes that were on it when I purchased it have gone .<br />
Can anyone please tell me how to stop this error happening and what to do? ... I wish I'd never upgraded now!!!

This might be a little late were you running any <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3rd party Virus/Malware/Driver updates/Speed boost
</span></strong>type of programs, as we have found on this Preview/Insiders site that many of those type programs have caused problems, if you on back on Win8.1 and want to stop the Nag. to upgrade Win10&nbsp;just go to&nbsp;your upgrade and look for KB3035583 uninstall
 it, also look for it in updates not installed and click on it and hide it, sometimes you may have to do it a 2nd time. as for the Acer programs just go to Acer site and you can reload them if you want most are bloatware.&nbsp;

            <p>I eventually had to find a way to get into the System files by continually switching the on/off button on the laptop until it finally allowed me access to the system files outside of the Windows format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option that I could see that would allow me to remove all the downloaded and partially installed Windows 10 files was to accept the option to reset my laptop to the factory settings stored in the partitioned section of the hard-drive. I knew that
 this would remove all my personal application software but I had always had an up to date backup of personal files so this didn't seem too bad an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Reset position i.e. only bare files as originally installed, I went through the procedure to advance from Windows 8 - Windows 8.1 - Windows 10 without trying to interrupt the process and without trying to use email etc or any other application.
 After what seemed like hours we made it with a fully operating and what seemed to be a stable Windows 10 platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only then did I seek to reload and install 'Open Office' and various other personal application choices. All those who I had purchased from recognised my email address and passwords and were able to let me download again without problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have (I think) all that I wanted on my system and running with Windows 10 quite happily, although every now and again I get some peculiar error message but the system self-diagnoses and repairs itself thankfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if you have experienced anything similar to my struggle, you too may have to bite the bullet and go back to the factory installed settings. Make sure you take a backup of all your personal files and folders before you commit to Reset because it irrevocably
 wipes all from your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now made a 'mirror drive' on an external hard drive incase anything untoward happens in he future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck with it - it is surely a major mess up that Microsoft have got us all testing for them for free!!</p>

            <p>Nobody running a laptop should be upgrading his OS without checking first with the OEM making his laptop...I'll never know why people with laptops don't seem to understand what they've purchased--which is a custom machine which more often than not requires
 device drivers from the laptop OEM--the generic, retail drivers posted on the nVidia/AMD/Intel sites &amp; elsewhere simply won't work properly if at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had little to no trouble at all upgrading my desktop, but I built it myself and it has all tier-1 quality components for which the manufacturers are making regular Win10 drivers.&nbsp; The only time anyone with a laptop should be upgrading to Win10 is when
 the manufacturer of his laptop gives the green light and provides the hardware drivers required...!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 is the best thing Microsoft has ever done...but if your hardware doesn't support it you might as well not bother with it at all, imo.</p>

            <p>I have to agree most off the shelve laptops tablets or desktops come with specific drivers. I have moved to windows 10 on 8 machines from tablet to desktop with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice is as follows</p>
<p>back up all personal files</p>
<p>back up all drivers using double&nbsp; driver to USB stick</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.boozet.org/dd.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check your manufacture web for windows 10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>update to windows 10 using online media tool</p>

</p><p>check for missing drivers and use driver backup made earlier to sort missing drivers.</p>
<p>I have found that windows 7 and&nbsp;8.1 driver work most of the time, not failed on me yet even vista drivers have worked for me on older machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>make sure windows 10 is activated if not do not do the&nbsp;next step if is has not activated but wait till it is some times it takes a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think your is not as smooth as you expect a fresh in stall will normally sort it out, that's why you need to back up everything.</p>

            <p>Since the Excel crash does not happen constantly, you may restart the Computer in clean boot to make sure no third party applications are interfering Excel and verify the
 status.</p>
<p>Once done try to open and save Excel file and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>Refer the article mentioned below on how to do clean boot:</p>

</p>
<p>
<span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting in clean boot, ensure you restart the computer in normal mode.</span></p>

</div>
<div>I have a&nbsp;wearied issue.&nbsp; I am using Office 2010. This post is regarding watermark not printing on office 2010. When i insert the custom watermark it is showing fine, There is no issues on that. When i send to printer it is not printing. Previously it used
 to work properly. I don't know what happen suddenly it stops printing only the watermark image. But the thing is when i add watermark on a blank sheet &nbsp;and if i try to print&nbsp;it is&nbsp;coming&nbsp;fine, Also if i insert some other picture it is printing fine, Also i
 can print the same image if the washout box is checked. I don't think that there is no problem with the image i am trying to use. I was wondering what could be the problem. This problem occur on excel as well. Please help me to resolve this problem. Your earliest
 reply will be&nbsp;appreciable.</div>

            I can the the watermark in the print preview.
<div><br />
<div>I tried with another document with another picture it is printing fine. I think i have to change some settings in the watermark or header or footer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried same one on the new document, Still no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also tried to print as a XPS and PDF file, Still no luck. Watermark is not&nbsp;appearing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have another catch. The picture that iam using as a watermark. If i print without any image or text it is coming fine. When i insert some thing it started doing like this, another one, I tried with importing different picture it is coming fine. So i
 don't know what should i do now...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other work around???&nbsp;</div>

The watermark prints here but due to the way in which the size has been increased, it is very jagged (and hence would be considered unsatisfactory.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Rules not Running Automatically - Annoying</h2>
                    <br />

<div>After upgrading from Outlook 2010 to 2013 my rules don't run&nbsp;automatically anymore. When I was on 2010, all of my rules ran automatically. Now on 2013, the rules do not run automatically. &nbsp;If I run the
 rules manually (selecting the rules icon, "run rules now") they all work as designed. I've tried deleting all of my rules and recreating but I get the same result. I have also tried running scanpst.exe and renaming the&nbsp;Outlook.srs file.</div>

<h2>            Can I transfer my OneDrive and Office 365 to a different Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>When I got my new laptop it came with Windows 10 installed. During the setup it asked for an email address and for some
 reason I put in my Gmail address. In doing so, I inadvertently set up a second Microsoft account (I already have one at live.com). Now I have: (1) a Microsoft account at live.com that I use for Skype and email; (2) a Microsoft account with a Gmail address
 as an identifier that is associated with my OneDrive and Office 365, and (3) a Google Gmail account that I use for email.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I would like to know is there a way I that can transfer my OneDrive and Office 365 that is associated with a Microsoft
 account that uses a Gmail address as an identifier to my live.com account? <span>
&nbsp;</span>If I can do this, it will greatly reduce my confusion.</span></p>

<h2>            ActiveSync continually disconnects and reconnects</h2>
                    I have an LG Incite (CT810) from AT&amp;T that arrived today. I installed the software that came with the phone and ActiveSync works great, except the phone and/or software seems to terminate the connection after a minute or so. As then perpetually cycles
 through the connect, update, disconnect process as long as the phone is connected - I finally had to disable ActiveSync because the sound effects got annoying while I was trying to find a solution.<br />
<br />
The phone still shows up as connected to the computer, but apparently won't let me access it since I turned off "Allow USB connections" in the AS settings. Can I get Windows to recognize the phone as an external storage drive so I can bypass AS?<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate your interest in Windows. I see that you are looking for a registry key to delete temporary files (cache) for Java that are stored in AppData. Java cache should be stored with other internet cache. The cache files are stored in:
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Privacy. </strong>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are the options to enable and disable it: </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>CleanTIF=1</strong>(check the box “temporary Internet files and website files”).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>CleanTIF=0</strong>(uncheck the box “temporary Internet files and website files”)</p>
</li></ol>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: The registry is a database in Windows that contains important information about system hardware, installed programs and settings, and profiles of each of the user accounts on the computer. Windows often reads and updates the information in the
 registry.</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, software programs make registry changes automatically. You should not make unnecessary changes to the registry. Changing registry files incorrectly can cause Windows to stop working or make Windows report the wrong information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please take a backup of the registry. Follow the steps given in the link:

<h2>            Configured CORS request not working Version 11.0.9600.18349</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS : Windows 7<br />
Browser Version : IE 11.0.9600.18349<br />
Update Version : KB3160005<br />
When calling a configured CORS Ajax POST request (allowed from Server) I get the following Error:<br />
SCRIPT7002: XMLHttpRequest: Erreur réseau 0x2ee4 :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/225dfe1f-b69a-4247-81ae-0a031f390ed1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/225dfe1f-b69a-4247-81ae-0a031f390ed1" /></a></p>
<p>Although, this works fine in Version 11.0.9600.18163 :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60c0dda1-79ec-40ab-bf3d-be59bf4cae82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60c0dda1-79ec-40ab-bf3d-be59bf4cae82" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any security updates done in the patch ? And why it was working in the version (11.0.9600.18163) and still working in other browsers ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

    <title>Zeus trojan pop up disables computer..Windows Defender offline - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Zeus trojan pop up disables computer..Windows Defender offline didn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked all over to find someone who has used Windows Defender offline to get rid of the scam Zeus trojan that pops up and completely disables my browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading the supposed solution to use Defender offline, I gave it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see anything caught by Defender. Will I know if the virus/malware is gone, or do I just have to wait and see if it pops up again?</p>
<p>It's really annoying to have to shut all windows down when this thing keeps coming up.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help anyone can give. I am on Windows 10 on a fairly new laptop. I am also wondering if I need a malware detecting program along with Defender.</p>

Run a full system scan with an alternate virus scanner </p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I recommend that you run Disk Cleanup or CCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Delete temporary files</strong>. </p>
<p>To delete temporary files: Do a disk cləanup. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, in the səarch box, type
<em>disk cleanup</em>, and then, in the list of results, click disk cləanup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And/Or </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CCleaner</strong></p>
<p>One of the single-best system maintenance tools around. Can be used for cleaning junk, browser safety, startup management, and plenty more. A must have on almost every system.</p>

<p>If you are speaking of the tech support scam, it's not a virus and as of this moment, no security program can stop it. If what I highlighted in bold works for you, and it should, then you only have to close the window with the popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's a common scam. <strong>Click the OK button at the bottom of the popup. You should then see a box Do not allow this site to create new messages. Check it and then close the window.</strong></p>

D TaylorYO.</a>&nbsp;I understand that for some reason your phone can't get a cellular signal. To verify, are you using the same SIM card on the phone? Have you tried inserting the SIM to another phone? Were you able to connect to WiFi? If the answer to all the
 questions is yes, please try Window Device Recovery Tool. Just like Hard reset, WDRT will delete all personal data. Please create a backup to avoid data loss. Please look at the link below for the instruction.</p>

            Yea it was just the sim card messed up. They sent me another one (because the STUPID sales associate at the store said it wasn't the sim card) and everything is working just fine. Life is good again. Lol 😁

D TaylorYO.</a>, Does it only happen when using Cortana? Are there any changes if you turn the phone off and on? Have you tried checking if there's an update available for your phone? Go to
<strong>Settings&gt;phone update&gt;check for updates</strong>. We look forward to your reply.

<p>
</p><p>Had this problem previously but a major corruption of the operating system required a format of the drive containing the operating system, and on re-install of W10 the 'Frequent' function was available.&nbsp; System update a few days ago and since then 'Frequent'
 function no longer working.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and we regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I suggest you to identify the recent Windows update you are referring to. To do so, you need to check the settings through Windows update. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the Settings Charm with the shortcut Windows Key<a href="http://solverbase.com/w/File:Windows_Key.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Key"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsolverbase.com%2fimages%2f7%2f71%2fWindows_Key.png" height="17" width="24" /></span></a>+
 I.</p>
<p>2. Click/tap <strong>Change PC settings</strong>. </p>
<p>3. Click on the <strong>Update and recovery</strong> and click on the <strong>
View your update history</strong>. </p>
<p>4. You will now see a list of your installed Windows Updates. If you click on any one of the
<strong>"Successfully installed on (date)"</strong> links&nbsp;, you will find&nbsp;more details for that update. You can choose the ones you wish to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now follow the&nbsp;below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer performance&nbsp;</strong>option from the list.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the<strong> </strong>Troubleshooter.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>It's a good idea to delete add-ons if you suspect they're causing performance, compatibility, or security problems. Check if the issue still occur while using Internet Explorer in a no Add-on state.</p>
<p>Ref: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></a></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>If the above still does not help, try to reset the Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>I had tried the 'Troubleshooter' process without any reported problem or correction.&nbsp; The 'reset' did return the working of the 'Frequent' tracking.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>With the reset all non-necessary add-ons were stopped, haven't tried re-activating any at this point.&nbsp; Very few were active initially, and none were added from the original point where 'Frequent' was working/not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the one problem that was not fixed, and not previously mentioned, is the frequent report of a webpage needing to recover.&nbsp;

            I still have this problem. If you accidentally "forget" a device, how do you "unforget" it with Bluetooth?

<h2>            Probs with &#34;blu406-m.hotmail.com&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem once before.&nbsp; It was very annoying before it just went away.&nbsp; It is back now and I do not remember what I did before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 365, and when I tried to open Outlook the other day a window appeared asking me for my password to log onto the server.&nbsp; My email addy was already entered as the user name.&nbsp; I have tried all the passwords I have for Microsoft accounts.&nbsp;
 I have even established a new pw to my live.com account but this pesky window will not go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I press OK and it comes right back.&nbsp; I press cancel and nothing happens.&nbsp; I press the close button in the upper right and nothing happens there either.&nbsp; This window insists on staying on top of any other window I have open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robyn</p>

            Access hotmail via web browser access, if the menu bar shows something other than Outlook.com the account has been migrated to exchange

<h2>            Forwarding Emails doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Forwarding Emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook Mail:&nbsp; My URL is <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/mail/inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/mail/inbox</a>&nbsp;for your information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My primary account is Outlook Mail owa and I have my mail forwarded to Gmail.&nbsp; Have done this for ages.&nbsp; All incoming emails are automatically forwarded to Gmail.&nbsp;<strong> Having said that why is it that any emails I send are not forwarded to Gmail?</strong>&nbsp;
 I have to literally forward them myself.&nbsp; This has just started to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate your input and answer to this query.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
