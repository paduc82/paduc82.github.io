<h2>            Xbox Live Tenure &#40;Xbox Staff can you help me please&#33;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi :)</p>
<p>Ive seen that some people have been getting their tenures reset when they upgrade their account, or download it onto different xbox's etc, and then the staff/moderators have been solving it for them on other threads.</p>
<p>I have had Xbox Live since 15/02/2006, and have held a gold membership every day since that date, but over several accounts throughout that time. As at this time the tenure feature did not exist. So I thought nothing of creating new gamertags and discarding
 older accounts,</p>

<p>&nbsp;But now that this tenure feature has been integrated into the dashboard and profiles - I feel a bit shortchanged :)</p>

<p>although my tenure for my current account is correct on 2 coming up 3. Although its not massively important, It&nbsp; would be nice if I could be recognised for being a member for the correct amount of time on my current profile which is now permanent, now that
 I am aware of this tenure feature.</p>
<p>Whereas before on the older xbox, I would use codes and trials to extend a membership or create new ones to start over on the online features on games like Halo 2.</p>

<p>I know it is possible to the 'powers that be' to modify the tenures after the mishaps with the "1 month upgrade resulting in an additional year to be added to the members tenure" and peoples tenures getting smaller after making changes to the payment details.</p>

<p>I know that it is only a little thing, and policy is probably that you don't do it. But given the amount of time and money I have put in to the service for the last 6 years. It would be nice if you could make an exception, and I can be recognised as a longer
 serving member on my profile.</p>
<p>I did ask a manager previously after they had to apologise about a member of staffs phone manor on the helpline, and she said she would get it sorted out for me as a way of saying sorry for the poor customer service I received, but I didn't get a response
 after that call, and she was part of a managers office, not a call centre, so I haven't been able to speak to her again.</p>

<p>I know its just a number. But I would appreciate it alot, its only 5 minutes of your time getting it changed, which I don't think is much to ask after almost 7 years of membership.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>James (DefyDefine)</p>

<p>Hi there. Due to you changing / creating new accounts there is nothing that can be done. The tenure number cannot simply be added or changed. LIVE detects the amount of time that current account has been on a Gold membership and then applies the specific
 number to the account. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply MeanMachine, do you work for Xbox Live?</p>
<p>And although I dont' know too much about which department actually does it, I know that they actually can modify it.
</p>
<p>About a year or so ago, there was a malfuntion/glitch with the accounts and renewal system, so that everytime you added a 1 month subscription top-up to your account, it accredited you with an enitre years tenure on your profile.</p>
<p>Weeks later, these people then had their tenures reset back to the correct time/date.
</p>
<p>Also the manager that apologised for my poor experience on the phone said she would sort it out for me, suggesting that it can be done.</p>

<p>No, I do not work for xbox LIVE. Yes they may be able to reset tenure when a fault occurs with their system but they wont adjust your tenure number just because you spent some time on a different account. If you would like an official answer then you can
 PM one of the xbox support staff that provide help to these forums. Click on one of the stickied threads above this one and hit the small envelope icon under their post. :)</p>

<p>Hey Defy, MeanMachine is correct here. I'm afraid we cannot award tenure for time that you were on a different account, on a Free Account, or time you spent on a GT before that feature existed.

<p>Hey Defy, I believe that agent may have been mistaken, but you are welcome to call back. However, I don't know that they will be able to connect you with the same agent.

<p>The agent wasnt mistaken, it was an Xbox Live manager on the phone, who had called to apologise about appauling service from one of the 'agents.' &nbsp;Like I said :/</p>
<p>She said she would do it for me, as part of the apology for the poor service I received.</p>
<p>I fully understand that the policy is you cant do it etc etc. And the Tenure is set from the date of account creation. And that is what you are told to say. But it can be modified, and maybe they dont ever modify them, or you dont know anybody that can.
 But I was promised by a member of staff they would do it for me?!?!</p>
<p>I know the answer when I ring the call centre is "no it cant be done", or "it doesnt work like that" But that is because they themselves dont have the ability or permission to do it.</p>
<p>BUT this was the entire point of my thread - Im trying to get past the generic answers like this, she even said its not normally done, and that it is an automatic setting. But she would make an exception and get it sorted.</p>
<p>If you guys on the forum dont have the ability to do it, please can you elevate my query to the relevant people (i.e the managment people that phoned me, or somebody with similar status/power) That might be able to actively do something about it, rather
 than just repeat the same thing, that I came here to try and bypass.</p>
<p>Im not trying to come off rude, and I understand you are only trying to help, and what you are saying is perfectly acceptable in trying to help me. Maybe it was my fault in the way I worded my thread, but I came here because last time I rang the call centre
 it was a nightmare (hence the apology) So I was trying to do it the old fashioned way of solving it in-writing method.</p>

<p>Hey Defy, I'm sorry, but the agent was in fact mistaken. Tenure cannot be awarded for experience on other Gamertags. However, if you have the SR number where the agent told you that the change would be made, I would love to take a look. I'm currently looking
 at your current Gamertag, and I don't see any mention of this issue in any of your SRs. If you do have that number, please send me a PM, using the envelope icon below my post. :-)

<p>Im not sure what you mean by SR, It there is any record of the conversation it will be attached to the complaint I made, as the phonecall was made in regard to that.</p>
<p>But Im not sure I gave out my gamertag to clarify who I was, that wasnt part of the security questions. She only asked for my gamertag after I asked about tenure.</p>
<p>Please note, Xbox rang me. I did not ring them, dont know if that helps</p>

<p>selected install, pressed Shift-f10 to go to the command windows using diskpart I set up the drive as being GPT then rebooted the pc again</p>
<p>using EFI boot from the DVD. The install went as per normal, creating 3 partitions EFI/MSR/MBR and the install went as normal until it rebooted the second time and went to start services .. it then told me it could not continue and that the machine would
 continue setup after a reboot. reboot booted from hd, got to the same point again and again it failed and restarted again with the message setup would continue ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 chargers breaking</h2>
                    I've had my Surface 3 Pro for around 4 years now and in this time I had 5 chargers. The current one is falling apart too so I will have to buy another one. Has anyone had similar problems?

            Describe what you mean by falling apart. I have had several SurfaceConnect chargers have their end caps fall off, but that is usually after stepping on them.
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a78165f-4a12-4416-88f2-370538ed9f14?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a78165f-4a12-4416-88f2-370538ed9f14?upload=true" /></a><br />
If this describes your situation, a little superglue around the edges and at the internal end of the charger's end cap should keep it in place. If the magnet falls off, like in this picture, you can slide the magnet back into the charger, making sure the rounded
 side of the magnet faces the side where the charger contacts are.

<p>The issue is more than likely due to current MacOS permissions that is negatively affecting Skype and other programs (lag/improper execution); not Skype itself. There are two solutions that can resolve this type of issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a new macOS user, log into that account, try to use Skype. If this works, this proves an issue exists with the other account.</p>
<p>2. Attempt to repair the permission problem in the failing user's account home folder.</p>

            <p>Hi ,<br />
I searched lots of Q&amp;A from answer.microsoft and none of them was completely useful so after lots of try and errors i found this useful specially for
<strong>iWin</strong> games:<br />
1. in the folder that you installed your game find the original executable file (it has a "<strong>.EXE</strong>" after it or in front of it under the type you can see "<strong>application</strong>")<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27333c72-1622-469f-b154-2a1f66de7279" /><br />
<br />
2.Right click on it and choose <strong>properties</strong>.<br />
3.choose "<strong>Compatibility" </strong>tab.<br />
4. make the setting like this picture:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8497a6ac-b7f5-40f2-bc55-9ef18b238c1e" /></p>

<h2>            Automatic updates, have to download one at a time.</h2>
                    This all started&nbsp; quite awhile ago. Automatic updates would no longer download. Various error messages came up. I tried to get help from Hewlett Packard, went through all of the things they suggested, some of them are listed in your FAQs.<br />
None of them did any good. Now when i turn on my computer in the morning i find that they are still failing to download. The only thing that seems to work is, i restart the computer, go to each update separately and uncheck the mark in the square. Then i have
 to start at the top and check each square one at a time and download each new update one at a time. This morning for instance i had eight updates that failed. Each time i downloaded one, i had to restart the computer. In all it took me an hour to get the eight
 installed. I am running Windows Vista Home Premium on an HP Pavillion a6130n PC

    <title>Design mistake Surface GO - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> svenvan de velde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Design mistake Surface GO</h2>
                    <p>I bought the Surface GO 4 weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very happy with my purchase. This is a great product and fit for frequent travellers who spend a lot of time on airplanes, like me ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I had to return my new Surface GO for&nbsp;<strong>repair</strong> after one week! There is a design flaw that everyone should know when considering to buy the Surface GO!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The loudspeakers on the GO are visible on the front pane. You'll find on the top left and right side small carves in the glass at the place where the loudspeakers are ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>These carves are not really visible, as they are covered with a very small strip of black matte cloth, that is covering these loudspeaker openings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The design flaw is that these cloth strips are&nbsp;<strong>glued</strong> on the top of these openings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would normally not be a problem,&nbsp; weren't it that it is a problem due to the unintentional usage that I had with the Surface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my travels, I carry one of the latest Samsonite backpacks. These are professional travel assistants that allow me to carry my personal devices without much hassle from airport to airport.
</p>
<p>Within the backpack, there is a small sleeve specifically designed for tablets about 11 inch wide. I used this sleeve to store my surface and carry it with me. That sleeve has soft cloth and is a bit "thick". And&nbsp;<strong>that is a problem for the Surface
 GO</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hairs of the sleeve give friction and touch the cloth of the loudspeakers when gliding the tablet in and out of the sleeve!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, the 2 strips covering the loudspeakers detach and after a week of random usage, you'll find the GO without these strips. They will have come loose and the loudspeakers only grey covers will be visible, making the GO less pretty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I returned my GO after a week of usage @ media markt for repair and have been now 3 weeks without the tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to highlight my DISAPPOINTMENT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also to warn future users of this defect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've put this post under the category SCREEN as this is a screen problem!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide the repair details I got from Media markt if needed. My tablet is now @Microsoft for repairs and have received ZERO communication from Microsoft till now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Yeah, there are dozens off inexplicable design and interface flaws on the Surface Go. Apparently it's just the Microsoft way of doing things.&nbsp;

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Touch controller firmware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slam3d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Touch controller firmware</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my touch screen no longer works anymore, In device manager the surface touch controller firmware has a yellow triangle and says error code 14 (restart your device).I have tried this many times and it doesn't work. Instead, when booting, the surface logo
 also says 'please wait while we update your device' for a split second and the surface boot loops for 20 to 30 seconds flashing&nbsp;'surface' a few times before starting windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the unistall and reinstall method, tried to reinstall the touch firmware drivers. Also used the surface diagnostics tool but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im assuming that the surface tried to update the firmware while i had gone out and failed because eveytime i turn it on from shutdown it tries, for a split second, to update the firmware. But it fails every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I can no longer update my device to the newest ver of windows as it has a boot error, which again im assuming it's because of the touch firmware failing to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had posted this issue yesterday but it got deleted.</p>

    <title>Why do I get a double apostrophe on US-International keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t-kay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I get a double apostrophe on US-International keyboard config&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>since a couple of days whenever I hit the apostrophe key (net to the enter key) I get a double apostrophe. Also when I use the shift key in combination with said key I get double quotes instead of single quotes. Now I use the US-International keyboard configuration
 so when I hit the apostrophe key it shouldn't actually display anything at all until I hit another key. Now I get double apostrophes and double quotes like so '' and "" with a single keystroke.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've never seen this before and I can't find a solution anywhere.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- Have you made any changes to your computer because of which the issue started?<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you to follow the steps from these articles in order to resolve the issue.<br />

            I didn't make any changes to my computer. It happened while I was typing. None of the solutions in your post helped me. I'm using a laptop so I don't have an external keyboard messing things up. Like I said I have the US International already set up. I
 actually think the US International keyboard configuration is broken. The US keyboard config works as it should.

            Sorry for the delay. I finally had the chance to try this suggestion. Unfortunately, my key was "generic". Somehow my key worked for months before the motherboard died. Support's only recommendation was to buy another key.

<h2>            Intel Video driver update Windows 10, causes boot issue on PC.</h2>
                    <p>I'm researching an issue that seems to be the same as:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_repair/no-display-after-windows-update-with-intel-video/c2f97dc9-2dc1-44d9-a337-4e3d4877eb84</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above topic is locked down.&nbsp; I can't reply or add a question to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix appears to be well thought out and explained concisely.&nbsp; The fix includes a mention of Startup Settings to select&nbsp; boot in low-Res Mode.&nbsp; Which is great.&nbsp; The person with the issue replies... 'that Startup Settings is not available'.&nbsp; To which, there
 is no further reply / response on what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone provide additional help on how to enter low-Res mode for those of us that do not get Startup Settings?</p>

<p>Hello Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Are you getting any sort of error message when experiencing the blank/black screen?</li><li>Have you already tried to enable the low-resolution video? <span>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.
 If this didn't work, refer to the steps below:</span></li></ul>
<p>1.&nbsp;Press and hold the power button on your PC until it powers off.<br />
2. Press the power button on your PC to turn it on.<br />
<span>3. </span>Repeat steps 1 and 2 above until you see the <strong>Windows logo screen</strong> or
<strong>Please wait</strong> during boot. Usually it may take up to 3 times.</p>
<p>4. Click on <strong>See advanced repair options</strong>. </p>
<p>5. <span>After your PC restarts to the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> &gt; Enable low-resolution video mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>We have several big-screen Westionhouse displays (IBW-Interactive White Board).&nbsp; The PCs are mounted behind the displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of the displays has experienced the issue following an update from Windows 10.&nbsp; The PCs begin to boot but they never get past the American Megatrends screen.&nbsp; It is though the PC is stuck in the POST process.&nbsp; There is no error displayed.&nbsp; (Normally
 the boot process displays the American Megatrends screen and you see the "circle of dots" as Windows is loading, then the Windows 10 Lock screen is displayed.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The information I found on the PCs:</p>
<p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p>The&nbsp;IWB-PC01 PC MODULE&nbsp;from&nbsp;Westinghouse&nbsp;is the optional interactive control module for the 55, 65 and 70" series of Interactive White Board touchscreen monitors. The module is powered by an Intel i5 processor, and conveniently fits into the provided rear
 side slots on the white boards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The motherboard may be a TH87G-P Series from Wibtech.&nbsp; (Not 100% sure)</p>
<p>Also, the BIOS is from American Megatrends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>************************************<br />
We have already tried the actions you suggest.&nbsp; We never get to any screen that allows us to select "Startup Settings".&nbsp; We also have tried the suggestions from the thread I listed in my original post.&nbsp; No option for "Startup Settings".<br />
</p>
<p>***********************************<br />
We believe the issue is a video driver update.&nbsp; We would like to boot in Low-Res mode and revert the video driver back from before the update.<br />
</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. Would you be able to capture an image of your computer's screen when booting into Advanced Options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, Let's try to run the command below using the Command Prompt from the Advanced Options.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the Advanced options screen, click the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> option.</li><li>In the opened <strong>Command Prompt</strong> interface, type in the command below:<br />
<strong>bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy</strong><br />
</li><li>Hit <strong>Enter</strong> to execute the command.</li><li>A message that says that the&nbsp;“The operation completed successfully” is displayed below the command once finished. Close the Command Prompt window.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

            Yes. "Driver Update" by Slimware is also known to have caused this issue.

            you should be able to get just the cord that goes from the wall to the charger (much less money). but yes, you can get the full European charger.

            You could try to see a person that can open the device and remove the water but if you cannot find a person capable of doing that, you are pretty much screwed if you didnt buy Microsoft complete.&nbsp;

<p>I am progressing. Now, when I click install, it gives an error code; 0x8002000a. It never did that before. I guess some of the advice I got worked in some way. I hope this helps you better to identify the problem. &nbsp;I'll be anxiously awaiting the next step.
 Thank you.</p>
