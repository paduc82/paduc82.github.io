<h2>            NOKIA CONVERSATION</h2>
                    
<p>I've been on the nokia beta app website to download the latest application of nokia communities that suppose to come with nokia chats and nokia communities only to find that out that those app are now graduated and are now part of the commercial versions,
 or downloadable right from something called ovi store.</p>
<p>While all those app where still in beta form, i could download them and install them on my phone and evaluate them, all hoping to be able to enjoy the final versions as the beta versions were buggy. Nokia seems to forget that he didn't post those 2 app in
 all ovi stores he has around the world, well i'm living in china, and i find those app nowhere in the ovi store right from my phone here in china. What is nokia thinking? he's building phones and app for only europe or what? where the fck are all those missing
 applications? and if the applications can't be loaded on the online ovi store of china, why not load it on a official page s60v5 nokia applications for anyone who can't download from ovi store from their country to download it from that web site? We are in
 2010 and soon in 2011 and some companies like nokia still sucking BIG BIG TIME... Jesus. I need nokia to rectify this policy he's having since by allowing asians to have app that europeans can't have and not allowing asians to have app that europeans can have,
 what the hell is that? a new way of making discrimination? a new discrimination inovation? is that the way you mean CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE? &nbsp;I believe and i know that i'm not the only one being victime of this new type of discrimination from this stupid company
 called nokia. many people all around the world can't download app they want from what so called ovi, yet they call it store. I need those nokia conversation app, i've used them and took part to the beta programs and why the he ll won't i be able to use the
 commercial version nokia? Who are those doing things that way in that company? Where are the commercial version of the conversation applications??? even if i have to pay for it, WHERE ARE THE FCK'N LIIIINKS NOKIA, WHERE ARE THEYYYY???</p>

<p>Whoa whoa whoa, calm down DUDE!!!! First of all I think Nokia would be a she not a he lol. Anyways, what is your phone? There are different applications available for different phones, it be nice giving us some more information before starting to complain!
 And besides, this is a user to user forum, just because you complain on here doesn't mean nokia is going to listen, if you want them to listen to you then be nice enough and use the contact button and EMAIL them. Thanks</p>

<p>First of all i'm not your dude, understand me very well??? Well... second, I do not need any solution out there, i need those nokia conversation apps, plus what makes you think that nokia won't listen to me? i've mail them nicely with my issues, guess what!!!
 they are busy connecting people. So i'm pretty sure that nokia workers are over this forum, if not who the h ell is the moderator? not a nokia agent? that's what i'm talking about, nokia can't keep on fooling people, i've took part to the beta program, they
 release the apps, NOKIA CHATS AND NOKIA COMMUNITIES. It's very strange that the apps are no where to be found except somewhere named ovi store, and who knows nokia knows how he love dealing race by race, and country by countries, and that's why, a certain
 type of phone for japan will have a japan code and the same phone in germany will have a german code, the same ugly stuff goes on with ovi, and they aren't cleaver enough to know that they have to build a website that will hold all their apps where anyone
 can go and buy them if they need it. Actually ovi suck very well, smell hell as well.</p>
<p>And last... i'm on a ugly phone that i have to off and on almost 20 times a day before it can work out otherwise it just get freez for what reason... I dare asking nokia to know the reason why. A phone they call flag ship phone nokia n97 with 54mb of internal
 memory. Who are those shaping the future this way trying to say SHAPING THE FUTURE TOGETHER???</p>
<p>I mad at the idea that i can't find those apps it's making me sick sick sick this nokia</p>

<p>OK just so you know, even I can't get the nokia chat on my Nokia N97 so its not only Asia and I'm in USA. And second, trust me you keep writing things like that on here they will delete your account which would be fine with me. So yeah I don't have nokia
 conversation so stop complaining about you being the only one not having it.</p>
<p>Nokia N97 was a mistake, yes it was a big mistake by nokia and we all know it so I don't think you telling us is going to change anything. Nokia has forgotten all about N97 so I suggest you move on to something else beside a Nokia phone. Thanks DUDE!!!</p>

<p>Oh just so you know, Nokia Communities does not exist anymore, Nokia stopped it long ago but I guess you already knew that right? And for Nokia Chat, why in the world would you want to use that on your N97, it slows down the phone that's already slow! Use
 Nimbuzz or Fring, those are much better, so stop complaining when there are better solutions for Nokia chat!</p>

<p>Communities support stopped with the end of the beta test , I had it on my N97, I live in the UK and it is no longer available, it is the social app for Symbian^3 now. As for Nokia Chat there are many applications for IM as kman mentioned nimbuzz is one
 of them, as for your attitude and communication methods and style, I sincerely hope that the version of Ovi Store you have has the 'Chill Pill' app available and you download it ASAP&nbsp;:smileywink:</p>

                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; At first everything was fine but then my print spooler stopped working and would not restart then MS Office would not open, so, I went back to Windows 7.&nbsp; Now I cannot open web pages in IE11 and Chrome.&nbsp; I contacted
 my ISP for assistance and they had me ping two IP address, both were successful, then they had me pink yahoo.com and it was also success.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can send and receive email in Outlook.&nbsp; I can also open ITunes and stream live radio and other content.&nbsp; My online
 backup service backs up new files.&nbsp; I just can't open web sites in my browsers.&nbsp; I have run the Windows Diagnostic and it says it cannot determine a connection problem.&nbsp; I have no idea what is going on.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact error message on the Internet Explorer homepage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear you had the hassle to downgrade to Windows 7 due to internet issue.&nbsp;I would certainly assist&nbsp;you with the issue.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; The below screen shot is what I get when I try to open IE 11</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3960d429-31c0-4fa1-8601-54649ccab754" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on Fix Connection Problems, it runs the diagnostic and indicates it cannot determine the problem (I get this no matter what web site I try to open).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;attempted method 1, but there was no option&nbsp;Internet Explorer Performance as you described (you will notice in the below screen shot it is not included in the list of choices).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd0635d2-0903-4e9c-828e-a33306e3fd41" /></p>
<p>I did however try the Internet connection options and as you can see, I get the same response.&nbsp; I also tried the Network Adaptors with the same result.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be39aa8d-86d1-4252-9983-82f394787a19" /></p>
<p>I moved on to Method 2, and again, there were no Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons) in the list of choices.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c188f5a-74f4-4c3e-a23a-6bb2d6d73bed" /></p>
<p>I did however click Tools in Internet Explorer and went to manage add-ons and all of my add-ons were disabled, and I still could not open a web page.&nbsp; I then went to method 3, some of which was done when I attempted to have my ISP assist me, and I uninstalled
 IE 11 and tried to open web pages in IE 10 , which did not work, and reinstalled IE Explorer 11, but it still would not open web pages.</p>

    <title>Exploit can potentially affect millions of handsets, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Exploit can potentially affect millions of handsets,</h2>
                    <b>Breaking news on the latest News Websites.</b><br />
Security researchers made public an exploit for many Nokia handsets that enables remote attackers to disable the ability to send and receive text messages.<br />
A single malformed SMS message can prevent some handsets from sending and receiving further SMS and MMS messages, security researchers warn.<br />
Once infected, the phone has to be factory-reset to restore text message capabilities.<br />
Nokia has not responded to inquiries as of press time, but this exploit could possibly receive a patch through an over-the-air firmware update. Additionally, the exploit could be spotted and stopped at the carrier level by blocking messages with the malicious
 formatting.<br />
This known as "Curse of silence"<br />
<b>Is there anything I can do to block this attack on my N95 phone?</b><br />
<b>Can I please have a quick response to this message from a qualified Nokia Support technician?</b><br />

<p>Nokia Fixes 'Curse Of Silence' Exploit The vulnerability could crash millions of Nokia handsets' SMS system with a single malformed text message. By Marin Perez InformationWeek January 28, 2009 07:53 PM Nokia (NYSE: NOK) has released a fix for the "Curse
 of Silence" exploit, a denial-of-service attack that could potentially shut down millions of phones' SMS systems. The exploit enables malicious programmers to specially format an e-mail to be sent as a text message by setting the message's Protocol Identifier
 to "Internet Electronic Mail." If the message contains more than 32 characters, certain S60 devices would not be able to receive other SMS or multimedia messages. Depending on the handset, the vulnerability could damage the targeted phone with a single message.</p>
<p>Millions of handsets were potentially vulnerable to this exploit, including UIQ devices and handsets running S60 2nd Edition Feature Packs 2 and 3, S60 3rd Edition, and 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1. Nearly any device capable of sending SMS as "Internet Electronic
 Mail" can send a malicious message.</p>
<p>Users who are vulnerable to this exploit can <a href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=download&amp;x=&amp;y=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download</a> an <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/smscleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SMS Cleaner</a> from Nokia. Once installed, the application will cleanse the device of malformed messages and restore the functionality of the messaging system. Once the application
 has completed the process, it will restart the phone and uninstall itself.</p>
<p>The exploit was discovered by researcher Tobias Engel of <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
F-Secure</a>, and it was made public at the <a href="http://www.ccc.de/congress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Chaos Communication Congress</a> event last year. The security firm said it made Nokia aware of the exploit months before it was exposed, and it sold
<a href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=software&amp;x=&amp;y=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
software</a> that protected users from the vulnerability.</p>
<p>While there hasn't been a widespread attack on smartphones, most security experts believe it's a matter of time with vulnerabilities showing up for high-profile devices like the
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/iphone/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210605451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            How do I expand the range of a list in a cell drop down&#63;</h2>
                    I've added choices to the list that I want to appear in cells in my spreadsheet but can't figure out how to have that expanded range show up in the list that shows up when I want to make an entry in that cell. &nbsp;Is there a limit? &nbsp;Even if there is, I can't
 figure out how to modify or edit the list that shows up. &nbsp;Tried List Wizard, it shows the new expanded list in the cell, not as a drop down choice. &nbsp;Thanks in advance

            If your list is on a worksheet, use a self defining name to reference the list. For example, if your list is in A1:A100, and you will be adding/deleting from this list, define a name (like "MyList") with a reference in the refers to box as:<br />
offset($a$1,0,0,counta($a:$a),1)<br />
<br />
Then in the reference in data validation or a reference in a drop down or list control, simply refer to mylist.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Desktop alert settings</h2>
                    <p>We just&nbsp;upgraded to Outlook 2016 (32 bit) on terminal server 2012 R2 and was trying to change the new message alerts that popup on the top right of the screen.&nbsp; I wanted to down to the&nbsp;bottom right corner where they were in the old version but&nbsp;I don't think
 I can do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;when I go to Outlook File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; Message Arrival.&nbsp; I don't have the option to click on 'Desktop Alert Settings' to change the length &amp; transparency of the alerts.&nbsp; How do I get this option?</p>

                    Hi all, I developed an Access database on my old home computer using Access 2007.&nbsp; It was loaded on to the server for the organisation it was developed for using Access 2013.&nbsp; I now need to create a new form and when I go to design view the Form Design

            There is no official announcement from Microsoft on this yet. The only fact for now is, that in all announcements about Office 2019 OneNote (the desktop version aka OneNote W32 or OneNote 2016) OneNote is not listed. This does not affect the UWP app from Windows 10.

<p>If you use the insider you don't have to use the update advisor.</p>
<p>On the insider set to release preview to get Creator.</p>
<p>You would have to use the WDRT, takes you back to 8.1 and use insider to get back to 14393.67</p>

 example, Setup!$A$1 would be a reference to the tab that contains the data i want - like 2017, 2018 etc - say 2017Sales, 2018Sales, 2017Expenses, ......</p>
<p>2) Same approach for $L$9:$L$73 =&gt; can I have a cell in the "Setup" tab that references my Start and End?&nbsp; For example, say I want to compare sales in January 2017 vs July 2018 so my Start and End rows (and columns, too) for January 2017 and July 2018 would
 be different for each month - singly for a bar graph or as a comparison in a scatterplot.</p>
<p>3) Is it possible to have a variable end so that it's the LAST filled entry in a column?&nbsp; That is, assume I'm comparing daily sales for July 2019.&nbsp; If I do a scatterplot from July 1 - July 4th I'll have data for these days.&nbsp; However, if I want to have the
 5th also then I'd like to have the last date referenced here.&nbsp; There are two (2) LAST DATE scenarios: A) Last data in the column (July 4th) and B) the Last Data I want in the column.&nbsp; Scenario "B" is when I want to compare, for example, March 3 - April 3 rather
 than March 1 - March 31st or February 15 - April 20th etc. when there is data through the end of June.&nbsp; I suppose I can use the "last row", 32000ish, for Scenario A since, iirc, Excel ignores cells without data but is there a better/different way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afaik, Excel Select Data and graphs require me to manually reset the tab and/or the ranges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense!&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA!</p>

    <title>The Windows Phone 10 UI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> king-man55  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Windows Phone 10 UI</h2>
                    I was saddened to hear that Microsoft will be dropping support for Windows 10 Mobile in 2019. The UI the os sports is, in my opinion, far superior to that of Android and iOS. So my question is this: will Microsoft bring the W10 mobile UI to Android phones
 in the future? It would make me very happy indeed, as the forced transition to a new Android phone would be far less jarring and disappointing with such an option. It would be such a shame to see the best part of a great operating system vanish simply because
 the devices it was on weren't popular!

<h2>            Notebooks disappeared after closing them &#40;cannot reopen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I closed several notebooks in OneNote (Version 15.16). When I tried re-opening them only 2 of the 5 notebooks appeared in the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the other notebooks were not synced with my gmail account / OneDrive, as I have had OneNote for many years. If I remember correctly I was able to save them without logging into an account by then. Is that possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find the files on my laptop (mac), and I can't find them in my gmail / OneDrive either. Any ideas where they could be? I really need those notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I have tried reopening them, checking the 'deleted files' and searching in the system files.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Abcxzy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there are no local notebooks for OneNote on Mac, your notebooks should be associated with your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try logging into <a href="https://www.onenote.com/hrd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneNote Online</a> and check whether the notebooks are located on that specific account before adding it to your Mac's OneNote.</p>

</p><p>I did try logging in with another account to check if the notebooks are in it. It said that it was 'temporarily suspended' so I had to re-activate it. Probably because I haven't used it in many years. Unfortunately there weren't any notebooks in it. Could
 they have been deleted because of that?</p>

            <p>I am guessing you are talking about the built in Dataform which is not a userform.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the best of my knowledge and light testing, the build in dataform displays the values the same as you would see them in the formula bar.&nbsp; So it is generally the underlying
 stored value.&nbsp; For dates, it doesn't show the date serial number but generally the short date format.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dataform originates from the Excel4 macro language days&nbsp; (Excel 5 and earlier).&nbsp; If you wanted to modify it this is what I found in the old help files for that era of Excel:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You can still use custom data forms created in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or earlier. To edit the definition table of the custom data form, use the Dialog Editor from Microsoft Excel version 4.0."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would have to learn a lot and get more resources to even begin thinking about doing this.&nbsp; I would advise building a custom userform to do this.&nbsp; I believe John Walkenbach has already done that at his site and made a generic equivalent.&nbsp;

<h2>            How do I insert and OLE image object into a Word document from an Access database&#63;</h2>
                    I have an Access database with fields including descriptions and images. I would like my Word document to query the database to be updated with the images and data found in the Access database.
<br />
<br />
I tried the Mail Merge, but the images are not shown. Instead there an alphanumeric name.
<br />
<br />
I would like my database photos to appear in the Word Document. <br />

Thanks.<br />

            That is not possible, as far as I know. The images have to be stored as separate files, not in the database itself.

            It seems to me like that would be a most basic function to have in an office suite. I may try my luck with LibreOffice.

    <title>Importing CSV files into Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john_sur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing CSV files into Excel 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is a problem or not, however, each time I import a CSV file into&nbsp;an Excel 2010 work book it adds&nbsp;the import file name&nbsp;into Name Manager.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>LIFETIME.csv</p>
<p>LIFETIME_1</p>
<p>LIFETIME_2</p>
<p>LIFETIME_3</p>
<p>
</p><p>and so on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that sooner or later I'm going to hit a limit.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this issue?&nbsp; Why is this happening.&nbsp; Is there a way to avoid this from happening and if so what is it?&nbsp; I'm not very good at writing macros (of this complexity at least), so
 if someone has code to delete range names I'd appreciate hearing from you but I would like to avoid using macros if at all possible.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

<h3> bp tech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange Scan Behavior - bat, com, exe, cmd, dll, pif, lnk,</h2>
                    I have "Detailed File Share" auditing enabled on a server that hosts a share my PC is mapped to. &nbsp;When a MS Security Essentials scans executes on my PC it eventually starts scanning my mapped drives. &nbsp;In reviewing the logs on the server I can see the scan
 traverse the directory tree but at the end of every folder or file its adding its own extensions. Since the folder with the extra extensions added on does not exist then Detailed File Share auditing logs an entry in my event viewer.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>For example:</div>
<div>If the folder name is \Folder1 the detailed file share auditing logs show that folder1 was accessed but then I see other attempts at \Folder1.com, \folder1.dll, \folder1.bat, \folder1.com \folder1.dll, \folder1.pif. &nbsp;None of these other folder exists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It does this with files as well.</div>
<div>file.xlsx, file.xlsx.com, file.xlsx.dll, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For now I have turned off scanning mapped drives and confirmed that the strange file access has gone away. &nbsp;This tells me these event logs are due to the scan behavior of the MS Security Essentials client.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not have this detailed logging enabled on my client so I cannot tell if its adding the same thing is happening on my local drive scan.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why is MS Security essentials searching for files that do not exist? &nbsp;Why is it adding its own extensions to my folders and files?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to imagine that this is normal behavior for the scanning engine, though I am not privy to the inner workings of it.</p>

<h2>            Build 10122 Firefox38.0.1 &#40;only&#33;&#41; screens and buttons Off-Axis</h2>
                    After Build 10022 Update, "only" Firefox has probelms, and bizarre ones too. In Build 10074, same Firefox version was fine. When started, Firefox opens in previous (saved) location, but interior sub-areas are off to the lower-right by 1/8-inch... and touchpad
 cursor does "not" activate any Menu et al buttons "until" positioned 1/8" above a button! Also noted: text entry into search box or address-bar is "delayed" by many seconds, after each key-press. Am going to try DOM and other tools to examine pages/screens
 for possible causes and fixes... but it appears it may be due to yet-another 'new' M.S. abstraction-layer of the re-designed-every-month 'graphics engine' and/or 'browser engine'. We see mainstream web-sites with on-line reports that Build 10122&nbsp; [quote] "IS
 A MESS" [unquote]. Any other beta tester experience these issues with Firefox?? ***All other(M.S.) windows open and work normally...***

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
One of the reasons why the feature Panning hand is not available is that your OneNote app is not up-to-date. For us to elaborate the issue further, kindly answer the questions listed below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the operating system installed on your tablet?</li><li>What's the version of your OneNote 2016? Here's an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> that you can visit to see how to check it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, we recommend that you update your Office 2016. Here's an article that you can visit to see how to do it:

            Highlighting cannot be made part of a style, but text shading can. In the <strong>
Modify Style</strong> dialog, click <strong>Format</strong>, then <strong>Border...</strong> Select the
<strong>Shading</strong> tab and select the desired color. If the style is a paragraph style, you will be able to apply the shading only to
<strong>Paragraph</strong>, but in a character style, <strong>Apply to</strong> will be set to
<strong>Text</strong>. Paragraph shading will extend the full margin width, but you can apply a shaded character style to selected text.
