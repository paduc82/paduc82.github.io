<p>Hi Gregory,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brismith/2018/12/07/project-online-getting-started-with-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Project Online: Getting Started with Roadmap</a>,<span>&nbsp; </span>Roadmap is only available for customers with the Project Online Premium or Project Online Professional sku.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It IS NOT available (and will not be made available) if you do not have a t least one of these.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Customers with the older Project Online with/without Project Pro for Office 365, or Dynamics customers who have Project Online through the PSA sku will not be able to activate Roadmap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there are more information you can get from this developer thread which will keep updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About how to use Project Roadmap, I find
<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Project-Blog/Announcing-Project-Roadmaps/ba-p/268466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
another clarification</a> for you. It also said <span style="font-style: italic">When we all agree its ready for all our customers, we will begin rolling it out to the rest of our Project Online customers.<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Win 8.1 USB Drivers for Lumia 1520</h2>
                    Are there special USB drivers for Win 8.1 to allow the 1520 to be seen as a full USB device instead of just a MTP device? The Hyper-V VM environment already has the Windows Phone SDK's installed and the RDC specifies redirecting recent plugins to the VM.

    <title>Trashed message in IMAP account reappear in Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radmancoral  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trashed message in IMAP account reappear in Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I have this problem on both an iMac and a MacBookPro. Both with same version of Outlook and running MacOS10.7.5</p>
<p>When I delete messages from the Inbox they go away but reappear a few seconds/minutes later. This only happens with an IMAP account managed by Network Solutions. I also have a standard Mac account (also IMAP) and this problem does not happen. Sometimes,
 if I open the message and then delete it, it does not reappear in the Inbox, but when I look at the trash, I will have multiple copies of the same trashed message. I have talked to Network Solutions multiple times, but they only "reset" the account and after
 a few minutes, the problem reappears. This issue does not happen when I open/check this IMAP account with an iPad/iPhone. I am trying to diagnose if the problem is an Outlook problem or if it is a Network Solutions problem. I was about to close the Network
 Solutions IMAP account and open it at another email provider, but I am not sure who is at fault.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

            <p>Dear ArshadKhan88: thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>I followed your advise. I then reopened Outlook, but when new messages appeared on the Inbox and I deleted them, they reappeared again on the Inbox a few seconds later. When they reappeared, I marked them as read and deleted them again. Once I marked them
 as read, they have not reappeared, but now there are three copies of the same message on the Trash. I do not really care if the messages get duplicated or triplicated (or more) as long as they stay in the trash. But, apparently, unless I mark the messages
 as read and then trash them, they reappear into the Inbox. (to be complete, sometimes even if I mark them as read, they reappear in the Inbox)</p>
<p>I have programmed Outlook so that, when I close the program, all of the messages located in the Trash are deleted from the Server. In fact, when I followed your advise (close Outlook, logged into the Server and trash/delete the messages manually), there
 were no messages on the Server trash folder because, apparently, Outlook had deleted them when I closed it. So every time I close (quit) Outlook, it performs a similar operation as that you suggested, but the problem continues.</p>
<p>If any one else has any suggestions, I would really appreciate it. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Dear ArshadKhan88:</p>
<p>I really did not want to test and see if a new "identity" would work. As you well know, it is a lot of work. In order to try and figure out if it is the software (Outlook) or the e-mail provider, I opened a free e-mail account at a different provider. Interestingly,
 this provider had very specific instructions on how to set up Office for Mac 2011 Outlook so that it would properly work with their e-mail service. Basically all of the suggested setup was very similar to other instructions I have seen, except for one item:
 on any IMAP account, going to the Advancedâ€¦ button, one gets to a new window with three choices, Server, Folders, Security. If one chooses the "Server" button, the last choice in that new window is called : IMAP Root Folder:â€¦. On my .Mac (iCloud, or .Me),
 I do not have anything written as a Root Folder and the account works without problem. The e-mail provider with which I have a problem of reappearing trashed messages also does not suggest anything to be written in this box. But the new e-mail provider suggested
 to write "INBOX" as the Root Folder. When I did that on the e-mail account with the problem, Outlook eliminated the account and reopened it with all of the various folders. To make sure everything would work correctly, I followed your advise, that is, close
 Outlook, open the Webmail of the problematic provider, trash/eliminate all e-mails in the Trash, log out of the webmail and Open Outlook. I did this a couple of days ago and Outlook has been performing as it should: any message I trash, either Read or Unread,
 remains in the trash. I have seen one or two instances where the messages get duplicated in the Trash, but they do not reappear in the Inbox and so I believe (cautiously) the problem is solved. However, even though I am not a computer genius, I would love
 to understand what the change of writing INBOX as the Root Folder did in the behavior of Outlook.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

            <p>Mr. ArshadKhan88:</p>
<p>after much testing on both my work iMac and my home MacBookPro, I still get the same problem as before on both computers. When I trash messages from an IMAP Inbox, very frequently they get back into the Inbox, especially if the messages were NOT read, but
 sometimes it also happens with messages that have been read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your advise and I created a new Outlook identity, making sure there were no messages in the trash folder of the webmail application. I then waited for them to sync. I am actually testing three different IMAP accounts and without meaning to infer
 that these problems are the provider's fault, these IMAP providers are: Network Solutions, Runbox and Apple (iCloud). What is really incomprehensible is that I do NOT have any problems with the iCloud account. I can trash, move or do whatever I want with that
 account, it is always reliable. The other two accounts constantly have the same problem of Trashed messages reappearing into the INBOX. &nbsp;I want to stress the fact that this is happening on two completely different Apple computers, but running the same MacOS
 10.7.5 and Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 version 14.4.1 . If I try to explain what is happening when I trash a message, it would seem as if the software (Outlook) does not remember that I trashed a message and when it synchronizes with the mail server, it
 first looks at the server INBOX and compares it with the Outlook INBOX for that account. It sees that there are some files missing between the two and makes them reappear in the Outlook INBOX (you can &nbsp;actually hear the arriving mail sound). And frequently,
 it looks at the server Trash folder and it compares it with its own Outlook trash folder and sees that the two are different and so it puts a copy of the trashed file in outlook on the Server Trash folder; it would seem this is the reason I see more than one
 copy of the trashed file in the Trash folder (either the server or the Outlook trash folder). I am not sure if I was able to explain myself. What I am trying to suggest is that it is a problem of timing between Outlook and the IMAP mail server. At any rate,
 I would very much appreciate any suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Dear Mr. ArshadKhan88:</p>
<p>I have now created new identities on both computers and they both continue to do the same thing: trashed messages reappear in the Inbox, especially if they have not been read. What I also noticed is that, if after I trash a message a immediately "Synchronize
 Now" &nbsp;the Inbox folder of the appropriate IMAP account, the problem basically does not exist. I will probably get multiple copies of the trashed message in the Trash folder, but I do not get the message in the Inbox again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just cannot understand why I get this problem in two different computers and why I do not get this problem with the Apple/iCloud/.mac account which is an IMAP account.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any feed back.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>I'm having what appears to be the same problem, using Outlook 14.4.7 on OS 10.8.5.&nbsp; I just created a new identity, set up IMAP, and the IMAP folders were empty.&nbsp; Mail was successfully downloaded and sync'd from my domain server, and everything seemed to
 be fine, but I was noticing that some of the messages I deleted (not all) then reappeared in the Inbox, even though I confirmed by going in the Trash folder that I did in fact actually delete them. So i deleted them again, and when i checked the Trash there
 were 2 copies of those messages. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes legitimate duplicates are received that are actually separate messages, due to other reasons on the sender's side or something that occurs in transit.&nbsp; Those have different times in the "Date Sent" field, but i confirmed the duplicates in this
 case have the same date/time.&nbsp; This is worrysome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears some other users were having this problem too: </p>

<h2>            Outlook opens in minimized window. Windows 10, Office 2013.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>When I open Outlook it opens in a minimized icon on the taskbar. Next, I can position the mousepointer on the icon, right-click, selsct "maximize", and that way I get to open the window.&nbsp; The moment I try to resize or move the window it "falls" back into
 the icon again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue cam "out of the blue" after everything having worked well for weeks.</p>
<p>My Office version is Home and Business 2013 (a stand alone, not a 365). </p>
<p>My mail account is a Microsoft Exchange, which has been added by buying "Office 365 Business Essentials".</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I posted the same issue about 2 months ago, but didn't have the luck of someone posting a solution, so here I try my luck again...)</p>

            <p>Thanks Brian,</p>
<p>I does not appear to help.&nbsp; Whether I choose "move" or "resize" in the window peek I cannot get the window to open or to appear on the screen.&nbsp; If I chose "maximize" it opens to full screen, but then when I try to drag the window to my other screen it closes
 as soon as I try to move it (or resize it). Next, I can maximize it again and it opens on that second screen.&nbsp; But it's a bit cumbersome to do every time (open Outlook, then hold mouse over icon, maximize, drag to other window, then maximize again).</p>

            Try right-clicking the taskbar and choosing "Cascade windows", "Show windows stacked", or "Show windows side by side" then.

<h2>            Outlook calendar does not sync after being offline</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the title but it's hard to find a better one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my env:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WP 8 + Windows PC (win 8.1) + Tablet (win 8) all running office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem is on the tablet (I guess). If I'm connected to the network (it just has wireless - no 3g) I can work and do any changes on my calendar and those changes will be replicated to my phone / pc.</p>
<p>On the other side, when I'm not connected to any wireless network and I add an appointment, then it's not synced to my other devices. Outlook download updates from other devices but it doesn't "upload" the calendar entries created ON THE TABLET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm disconnected and I add appointments into the built-in calendar app, when I switch back online it sync everything, but this is not what I want to do. I want to be able to work just with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really tried almost everything, please let me know where I'm wrong.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Outlook is in offline mode, you wonâ€™t be able to receive any updates neither the changes made will not be synced with other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what are the updates is synced with Outlook when it is operating in offline mode?</p>
<p>Which built-in calendar app are you referring?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide us the detailed information about the issue which will help us to analyze and assist you in better way.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I am outside the office and my tablet is not connected to the internet I can obviously add an appointment to my calendar and this is not synced to the other devices: this is correct. Now, when I connect my tablet back to the internet I expect that my
 outlook (on the tablet) sync the new appointment to the other devices, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regarding the built-in calendar, I mean the calendar app that you have on the start screen (and yes, it uses the same account)</p>

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today when I turned on my computer I found out that language bar is missing. I managed to restore it, but it's not stylized as the other taskbar icons (network, sound, notifications) and it isn't visible, cause letters are black and it can be seen only if
 I set taskbar color to something brighter (orange, red or something like that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to bring back the old language bar?</p>

<br />When I open Outlook on my laptop and click on the calendar it say (this computer only) 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />This calendar is in an IMAP account. It doesn't sync to anything - and if you delete the imap account, you'll lose the calendar. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; my iPhone and iPad. 
<br />My recommendation is to install the iCloud addin and sync calendar and contacts to iCloud. It will pull the calendar and contacts out of the 'this computer only' folders and put them in the icloud. 
<br />
<br />Your other option is to use an Outlook.com mailbox for calendar and contacts.

<p>hi aaron,</p>
<p>iâ€™d like to confirm which scenario is yours.</p>
<p><strong>scenario 1: you want to add and remove licenses in one subscription.</strong><br />
if yes, it is not feasible to do that. however, you can try &nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/disable-office-365-service-plans-with-windows-powershell-a1754aa5-5055-47a4-82e1-2291849cb476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">disabling office 365 service plans with windows powershell</a>.</p>
<p><strong>scenario 2: you want to remove usersâ€™ licenses of one subscription and assign them licenses of another kind of subscription</strong>.
<br />
if yes, try the following steps:<br />
1. install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
microsoft online services sign-in assistant for it professionals rtw</a>&nbsp;from the microsoft download center. then install the

<strong>run</strong> to run the installer package.<br />
2. open windows powershell as an administrator.<br />
3. to connect office 365, run the command <strong>connect-msolservice</strong>, and enter your office 365 work or school account credentials.<br />
4. run the command <strong>get-msolaccountsku</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0b95bef9-7421-4733-b273-0d27b461f3f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0b95bef9-7421-4733-b273-0d27b461f3f9" /></a></p>
<p><br />
5. run the command <strong>set-msoluserlicense -userprincipalname *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -addlicenses "peihaiyu:exchangearchive" -removelicenses "peihaiyu:o365_business_premium"</strong>. here i assign pei5 with the exchangearchive license and remove

<h2>            Office 2013 uninstall&#47;reintall issues</h2>
                    I've tried to uninstall and reinstall office 2013 in order to fix a small email issue and wish i had not. I am receiving an error message of "the language of this installation is not supported by your system" if I try to uninstall from the control panel
 and I am receiving and error message of "microsoft setup bootstrapper has stopped working" if I try to install from the CD/DVD. I have tried the "fix it" tools from microsoft and tried to go through removing everything from the registry but when i follow the
 steps i have to delete "office15" from which I get the error "this file cannot be deleted as it is open in another program". I'm at my wits end with this and need help. Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response but I seem to have solved it on my own. I was following The manually uninstall office 2013 for MSI installation guide here&nbsp;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and just couldn't get rid of the office15 folder but I have solved
 this by moving/renaming and then deleting. Once I followed the guide all the way through it seems to have worked for me. Ridiculous how long it took to solve such a simple issue though&gt;</p>

<p>Thank you or replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which edition of Office 2013 is installed on the computer? <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Is it MSI or Click to Run version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the edition of the Office 2013 is home and student, home and business or professional, then it would be click to run.
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to remove Office manually from the computer and reinstall it:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Ensure to read the disclaimer or take a

<p>
</p><p><span>Once removed, restart the computer and reinstall the Office program.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sangeeta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! Actually I've searched the FAQ on MS support website and tried all possible solutions including changing "<strong><em><a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://example.com</span></a></em></strong>"
 to "<strong><em><a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://www.example.com</span></a></em></strong>". But it only works on very few websites and still fails on others.</p>
<p><br />
Currently when I tried to ignore the error with "<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1); font-weight: bold">Continue to this website</span>", it showed the pic attached in my original
 post, which means I CANNOT access the website although I choose to ignore the certificate error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really suggest MS to UPDATE this FAQ (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/certificate-errors-faq#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Certificate errors on IE 11: FAQ</span></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia 7100 question&#33;</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
I just want to clarify something...Can I download music to my Nokia 7100? I'm reading several posts that say I can't...they say I can only download mp3 ringtones. I'm confused because this phone was advertised as having a music player!<br />
Any help is appreciated!<br />
Thanks!

<p>you only have 4 mb memory on this phone which would just take one song so the answer would be yes it plays music,but no room to download more than one&nbsp; song ,it will hold a good few mp3 tones,you should go for the nokia 5130 if this is your budget range</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials - rubbish</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running xp but thats no issue. Have used Microsoft Security Essentials and can honistly say its rubbish. Dont know what the deal is here but *you would think* The big boys at Microsoft, the tech guys, Nasa engineers, the big cheese techs we all rely
 on would come up with something better than this - or is it just another money making scam?</p>
<p>You can search for hours and hours on this site looking for a solution and just run around in perpeptual circles - especially if your machine is infected</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials does not do the deal - it will inform you but never erradicate the ROOT problem - hence your on a merry go around and becouse we all trust Micro *soft* or should this be *Not so soft* we likely ending up purchasing a product
 we simply dont need - AS the "trust me" software that Microsoft dish out wont do the proper job - if needed</p>
<p>Mission - to detect and eradicate a trojan virus or a bit of spyware - thats easy for the *A TEAM MICROSOFT BOFFINS*? Wrong - it will find them and constantly remind you about rhis deadly threat without actually doing something about it - like period hence
 you get the pop ups and your computer in the meantime runs like jack slowwwwwww</p>
<p>Hey ever tried looking at your TCP settings cos if you dont this Microsoft Security Essentials lets everybody have a good look regardless of a spyware built in programme</p>
<p>I had about 20 live active spyware por mailware or malociouse programmes running in the background and the tried and trusted, go anywhere, do anything, trust me I am your best buddy programme Microsoft Security Essentials - done jack!!!</p>
<p>I downloaded a free Virgin media anti virus programme - very sad - but it sorted out all the problems in 60 minutes - how can this be? What are all the other cheapo virus programms looking at and can solve in a hour that the BIG BOYS from Microsoft cant?
 - or can they and just want you to trust them by desplaying life threatening pop ups in an effort to convince novices that they know the deal - the big picture = upgrade and give me some lolly. Way forward!</p>
<p>Do I guess you can say Microsoft Security Essentials is much of a moneyspinner and rip of as the virus you originally got - its a bad infection and may work on facebook</p>

            If it was asking you for money, it was not the genuine Microsoft Security Essentials. It looks like you have been the victim of a scam fake antivirus. Hopefully, the program you got from Virgin Media has fixed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
