<h2>            IE 11 will not open on Windows 7 on my Laptop &#38; Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a massive tech and have had a weird issue. IE11 on Win 7 home will not open it flashes tries an just closes.</p>
<p>I've tried <em>without add ons</em> <em>resetting user setting</em>s, <em>on/off in windows</em> as per other posts and&nbsp; ran sfc and it repaired any issues nothing.</p>
<p>Have installed fire fox works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I there anything else/obvious i can try?? It's also happened on my Desktop so I'm presuming it has been caused by a recent update to something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled my laptop back to a restore point and it worked again until it then updated again as I'd not turned the function off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really got me this one.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If AVG security software is the culprit try to disable/remove it and till it get fixed you may use Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) and see if it helps you to keep your system free from viruses/malware. For downloading MSE you may refer to the article
 mentioned below.</p>

 find contacts, and a host of other problems.&nbsp; Give us Hotmail back or I will have to find email elsewhere.&nbsp; I am self-employed, work from home and MUST have reliable email services - SO, my question is:&nbsp; why is "Outlook experiencing problems at the moment"&nbsp;....

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below: 
<br />
<br />I suggest you to perform the uninstall Office 2016 with the Microsoft tool and then perform the procedures for manual uninstall, it was also recommended to delete all Office activation keys through the CMD are install on the PC: 
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall Office from a PC computer: 
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/es-es/article/desinstalar-office-de-un-equipo-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=es-ES&amp;rs=es-ES&amp;ad=ES" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/es-es/article/desins...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall Office manually: 
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/es-es/article/desinstalar-office-manualmente-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=es-ES&amp;rs=es-ES&amp;ad=ES" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/es-es/article/desins...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Next, you must run the following commands in CMD to disable previous versions of Office installed on your computer: 
<br />
<br />Run the following commands, look for the System Symbols program (Command Prompt) and right click and open as Administrator.

            Hi quiz-a
<br />
<br />Did you purchase a subscription to Office 365 or a full licence to Office 2019?
<br />
<br />Office 365 will run on Windows 7, Office 2019 will not and has a minimum requirement of Windows 10
<br />
<br />Where did you purchase Office from, was that a 3rd party retailer?

<h3> cc1138  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10130 just refuses to install on Acer Aspire V5</h2>
                    I've been wrestling with this problem and trying to get help with it here on the boards ever since Build 10130 was released, and I'm just about at the end of my rope here. I own an Acer Aspire V5-552P-X617, and four successive attempts to install the newest
 build have all failed. Once on the Fast ring, twice on Slow, and then once from the ISO, and every single time, the result was the same-- it would install fine all the way up until the color-changing "Setting a few things up" screen, and then completely fall
 apart. The first two times, it got stuck on a black screen and forced me to hard reboot, leaving me with a corrupted, non-responsive version of the OS, and the second two times, it just stayed perpetually on the "Unfortunately, it's taking longer than usual"
 screen until I hard rebooted. Is this a driver thing? Most of the people I've talked to who have this problem have either Acer computers or something that runs an AMD CPU;&nbsp;I have both. Is it worth trying to fix this, or

            <p>I installed Build 10130 on an Acer netbook.&nbsp; I first set the BIOS to Factory Defaults.&nbsp; This enables Secure Boot, which in turn requires NX.&nbsp; Many with Build 10130 install issues had to enable NX in BIOS to get Build 10130 to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is no separate option to enable or disable NX in my Acer BIOS, I made sure it was enabled by selecting Secure Boot (and the only way I could select Secure Boot was to choose Factory BIOS settings).</p>

            Hmm. It does make sense, I had secure boot disabled each time I tried this. I just reset to Factor BIOS settings, so I'll give updating via Windows Update a try one more time and see what happens. I'll update here if something happens.

            <p>I enabled secure boot and deleted the registry junk (leftover from rolling back)&nbsp;to enable the update to 10130, but now I keep getting an Error 0x8007007e. What's that?

            10130 is sent on both slow and Fast rings now.&nbsp; I would use a 10130&nbsp;ISO, if you have one, to save download time, but maybe that is not an issue for you.&nbsp; You can put it on a USB flash drive using Rufus or Windows 7 USB DVD Download tool and upgrade Windows
 7 with it by running Setup.exe.

            If this doesn't work out, I'll go the ISO route; I do still have a bootable USB drive containing it that I made via Rufus. As for now, it successfully downloaded from Windows Update after I switched rings (not sure why it made a difference, but I'm not
 complaining), and I'm just gonna see where it goes after installing. It didn't show an error message right before restarting (as it did the last time I used Windows Update for this build), so that's hopefully a good sign.

            Well, this is unsurprising-- same result, it froze up on the "taking longer than usual" screen again. Will have to roll back.

<h2>            Populating only the empty cells in Access 2010 table.</h2>
                    I'm creating an Access DB at my new job, and they need me to combine information from 3 excel spreadsheets, 2 from other departments and 1 from another company, with various column headers into 1 table. I have been able to do this step, however some of
 the cells are missing information that my team will be collecting through our own research. The excel spreadsheets continue to come in daily with updated information, and I need to import their information into the table without losing the information that

 I find the due date information and populate it in the cell, the next day I don't want an append query to wipe my due date back out because their excel spreadsheet doesn't have the information contained in it. Does this make sense? I o

Access has records and fields - not rows, columns, and cells. &nbsp; One hundred fields is an awful lot of fields. &nbsp;You probably need to break the 'spreadsheet' format into related tables. &nbsp;Post your field list with datatype. &nbsp;Explain the purpose of the data collection.
<div><br />
<div><b>1)</b> You can run an UPDATE query to change a field from NULL to the new data IF you have some key to correlate the old records with the new data.</div>
<div><b>2)</b> If the data is a date, using DateTime field, you can update if NULL or update to a later date using IIF function.</div>
<div><b>3)</b> Append queries always ADD records unless you use criteria such as not duplicating the value that is your key in the record. &nbsp;A delete query needs to have criteria so as to only remove the proper records.</div>
<div><b>4)</b> you need to run at least 2 queries, an append and an update query with proper criteria but you must establish a key field.</div>

<div>What you NEED to do is analyze the data in your spreadsheets and create MULTIPLE tables to receive this data. Use the power of a relational database to your advantage.&nbsp;</div>

            I actually knew they were records and fields, I apologize for calling them cells rows and columns. I have discussed using multiple tables with my boss and he wants them left in the 2 tables based on the company we're collecting the information from. Therein
 lies my problem. I added a primary key so I would have unique identifiers, but one of the spreadsheets don't have this number, and there's no way for me to get them to add this field to make my work easier. I would use the order numbers from the spreadsheets
 but again there are empty fields on the spreadsheets, approximately 70 of the 3600 records, so I couldn't use this as my unique identifier. Likewise, new orders are added and others are deleted every day, making it even more confusing for me to do this without
 their spreadsheet having my unique identifier on them because I can't get a static excel spreadsheet to run from. Is there a way to make it run the update query on only the ones with site addresses populated, and leave the ones tha

<div>Unless your boss is a knowledgeable database designer then he should not be calling the shots on how you design the tables. And you can show him this response if you want to.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is up to you to design the tables properly and then up to you to configure the output that the users need. If you go ahead and with a "spreadsheet" design, you will be constantly jury rigging to work around it.</div>

            Thank you for your help. I talked to my boss today and explained the issues I was having and explained the benefits of doing it the way I wanted, separate logical tables and relationships, and once I explained the benefits, he told me to do what worked
 best and to let him know next time when he's "being a dummy." It's my fault for not doing what I knew would work, and attempting to do what he wanted when he has no DB experience. Lol. Thank you so much!!!!

<h2>            Why I can&#39;t remove the weather app &#40;and other apps too&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>what's the concept behind, that it is not possible to remove Weather and other apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Start -&gt;Rightclick on the Weather tile or a rightclick on the Weather Apps in "All Apps" =&gt; No deinstall!</p>
<p>2) Start-&gt;settings-&gt;Sytem-&gt;installed Apps &nbsp;=&gt; Deinstall is grayed out.</p>
<p>3) Systemcontrol-&gt;programs =&gt; no Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst answer would be, that the APP can control if a deinstall is possible or not, what about Apps from "the bad boys"?<br />
No sorry, the OS and the user should control the Apps, not the App the OS and the user. This answer would make no sense.<br />
---------<br />
4) Open the powershell and enter&nbsp;get-appxpackage *FULL-APPNAME* | remove-appxpackage ???<br />
Serious, MS really think any enduser will to this?<br />
</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>So, what's the point behind this? Weather, video, OneNote, maps, calculator much more, have no possibility to remove the app, why?</p>
<p>Is there any&nbsp;halfway logical reason for this?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the link, seems to me this App remover is very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can imagine that MS prevent the users from removing e.g. the APP store, Edge, Settings and other apps. But I have not any idea why the user can't remove calculator, weather, OneNote and other apps.</p>
<p>Because of this is not possible for many apps, I don't think this is a bug in each app, but it's maybe a "bug" in the Windows app concept in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions to avoid this Problems are great, but I want to know a reason for this, maybe I overlook something.</p>

<h3> cts2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 &#40;Office 2013 Professional&#41; Pivot Table Not Loading When Calling Data Table Connection to SQL Database</h2>
                    I have an odd situation. &nbsp;I can call data from a table in a SQL database by clicking the Data tab, "From Other Sources" and then following the wizard and specifying the table I would like to load. &nbsp;Works just fine. &nbsp;I would like this data, however, in
 a Pivot Table. &nbsp;When I use, insert Pivot Table, and specify the remote data connection, it renders a blank pivot table and doesn't give me the option to select the Pivot Table Fields - everything is missing. &nbsp;I have done the same thing by trying to load a
 stored procedure. &nbsp;It appears Excel is making the connection (just as it does when I do it directly with the simple table), but somehow it is not rendering the information back into the Pivot Table. &nbsp; In fact, Pivot Table has stopped working all together.
 &nbsp;If I import a CSV file, specify the area, and click to render, the field list is blank. &nbsp;What is going on? &nbsp;How do I get Pivot Table to start working again.

<div>Any help appreciated.</div>

<p>There's no way to really control the animation of gifs in PPT. You may be able to fake it though. Copy the gif and paste special as gif to get a non animated copy. Now animate the real gif to appear and the fake gif to disappear when the fake is clicked.
 Note you cannot control the start of the gif animation it will just be running invisibily.</p>

            After update to 9879, or clean install Windows 10 Build 9879 - keyboard LED's do not more work. No light. You can do what you want - LED's stay dark. Switching Num Lock, Scroll Lock or Caps Lock work, but no light feedback. Embarrassing, Microsoft.....

            I seriously hope this isn't the last build for 2014 as this build is a right bug fest apps will either not start or they crash explorer.exe it worked fine with 9841 things started going wrong in 9860 and have gone berserk in 9879 just watching a video
 is enough to have to force an reboot as the stat bar and anything on it stops working the desktop is left with just a colour back ground no picture and I have to use ctrl+alt+del to be able to use the power button for a restart&nbsp;

<h3> dswapp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Picture text wrapping format macro</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">I have tried to create a macro in Word 2007 to format the text wrapping of pictures to TopandBottom.&nbsp; I'm not very knowlegeable about VBA code, but using examples and help, I've come up with the following.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p>Sub PictureFormat()</p>
<p>Set myDocument = ActiveDocument<br />
With myDocument.Shapes(1).PictureFormat<br />
Selection.ShapeRange.WrapFormat.Type = wdWrapTopandbottom<br />
.RelativeVerticalPosition = _<br />
&nbsp;wdRelativeVerticalPositionParagraph<br />
&nbsp;.Left = CentimetersToPoints(3)<br />
&nbsp;.Right = CentimetersToPoints(3)<br />
&nbsp;.Top = CentimetersToPoints(2)<br />
&nbsp;.bottom = CentimetersToPoints(2)<br />
&nbsp;.WrapFormat.DistanceLeft = 0.2<br />
&nbsp;.WrapFormat.DistanceRight = 0.2<br />
&nbsp;End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be code that isn't necessary and I am sure I am missing some essential code.&nbsp; All I want to be able to do is click on a picture, hit a macro that changes the text wrapping to Top and Bottom so that any text will appear under the picture.&nbsp; If anyone
 can help me, I would be sooo grateful.&nbsp; I've tried really hard to figure out VBA code, but I'm lost.</p>

            <p>Sorry about that. Questions sometimes "get lost" if they aren't seen by someone with the appropriate knowledge before they scroll off the first page or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macro you posted has a few problems. The main one is that the constant you used in the .WrapFormat.Type assignment shouldn't have the "and" in the middle; it's just wdWrapTopBottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you want is the macro below. It might need some tweaks to position the picture where you want it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Pro Plus expects the computer to be connected to the internet</h2>
                    <p>I just installed MS Office 2016 Pro Plus with a MAK license on a Windows 10 Pro laptop that cannot (is not allowed to) connect to the internet (ever). The installation worked just fine and I did the call in activation for it which also seems to have been
 successful. However, now every single time I open a Office program it pops up with a window saying "Let's try that again Make sure you're online, and try again. [Try again]". How do I make it stop showing this window? It is very annoying and is actually causing
 a problem with some macros I need to run in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same version of office installed on another laptop that is running Windows 10 Home that this window does not show up on (also never touches the internet). I'm actually due to upgrade the OS to the Pro version, it's just a coincidence that I found
 this window doesn't show up when opening Office programs on it.</p>

            Hi  Soundman1974
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Could you check if the solution in the following article resolves that?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-repeatedly-prompts-you-to-activate-on-a-new-PC-a9a6b05f-f6ce-4d1f-8d49-eb5007b64ba1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office...</a>
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.       
        </p>

<h2>            Approaching Deadline Alert 3 Color Code</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a spreadsheet to highlight approaching deadlines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have set deadlines for project completion across&nbsp;dozens of projects:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to format cells that will set 3 color alerts as the deadline approaches:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Red: 7 thru 1 days out&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yellow: 8 thru 10 Days out&nbsp;</p>
<p>Green: 11 thru 14+ days out</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like for the cells to not only show the above colors, but also display the days remaining within the colored cell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now the cell displaying the deadline begins in cell i2 - the cells in which I would like to display the alert begins in j2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me out creating the formula and format style? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            settings for larger text won&#39;t stay for emails</h2>
                    I have my settings for emails&nbsp; the 16 size and for Comic Sans but every time I type an email the size goes right back to 12 .&nbsp; The font I set does work some times.&nbsp; Also, while typing a message and go back to the beginning&nbsp; of the sentence to correct a
 word or add a comma the size and fonts go right back to the default.&nbsp; How many time do I have to fix the settings for them to stay put!!

<h2>            sync from onedrive for business with sharepoint</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have question. We have customer who uses Onedrive for business and he is syncing files with theirs Sharepoint on Office365. He has one laptop where we changed HDD by cloning it to another one. After this process Onedrive stopped syncing and forgot sync
 libraries. Is there any way how to tell Onedrive client that folders and files are locally placed in the right folder and not sync it all over again? When I tried to sync it it creates folder like "Documents 1", "Pictures 1"... right next to original Documents,
 Pictures etc. How can I set the folder for syncing is not Documents 1 but Documents?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not for the first time it happened. They have 6 laptops and this error appeared maybe twice in a month without any previous problem or changing anything. It just stops sync Documents and create locally Documents 1 folder and start sync into this folder.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>Martin V.</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>Which version of the OneDrive for Business client are you using, OneDrive for Business 2013 or OneDrive for Business 2016?</p>
<p>From your description, I think it is a normal behavior.<br />
If you sync the site libraries from the cloud first time, a synced folder such as C:\Users\Administrator\OneDrive for Business will be created.<br />
When you copy the folders and files from C to D, the location of the synced folder will be changed and the OneDrive for Business will stop syncing. When you re-sync the libraries, as the initial synced folder is there which losing the syncing function because
 of being copying, the OneDrive for Business client will create a new synced folder named C:\Users\Administrator\OneDrive for Business 1 on your computer.</p>
<p>To solve the issue, you can follow the steps below.<br />
1. Click <strong>Stop syncing a folder</strong> in the OneDrive for Business client.<br />
2. Exit all Office applications.<br />
3. Go to&nbsp;<b>Control Panel</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>User Accounts</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Credential Manager</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Windows Credentials</b>.<br />
4. Remove all credentials there(This will remove your stored passwords.).<br />
5. Run regedit as an administrator to open Registry Editor.<br />
6. From Registry Editor, browse to:<b> </b><b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity\Identities</b>(OneDrive for Business 2013 is 15.0.).<br />
7. Check to see if there are any folders listed under&nbsp;<b>Identities</b>. If yes, delete them.<br />
8. Download the Fix it tool from&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the kb</a>&nbsp;and use it to clean the caches of the OneDrive for Business client automatically after backing up the files. Then, open the OneDrive for Business client to
 re-sync the files.<br />
NOTE: before running the <b>Fix it tool</b>, please read carefully and make sure you understand the sections ”Data that you lose when you run this tool” and “Back up your data and record any currently synced sites” in the article.<br />
9. Restart the computer and go to <b>Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;right click OneDrive for Business 2013/2016-&gt;Run as administrator</b>.<br />
10. Delete Document and Document 1 in your environment.<br />
11. Re-start syncing.</p>
<p>If something is misunderstood, could you provide us with some screenshots related to the issue you encountered for our clarifying?<br />

<p>Hello Cliff.</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>I am afraid that your solution will resync all folders again and "re-download" files (14GB in 35000 files) and folders which are already stored in C:\Users\user\sharepoint\ isn't that right? I have 2013 version and I didn't copy anything. We just made a
 clone 1:1 old harddrive to the new one and replaced them. So path is still the same - C:\users\user\sharepoint . When I take a look into &nbsp;the sharepoint folder all those folders which are not synced looks like a normal windows folders but folder which is synced
 has Sharepoint icon. When I tried to stop sync, shut down onedrive, rename folder from documents ( windows folder icon - not synced) to documents 1 (sharepoint icon - synced) it changed the icon of the folder to sharepoint icon and start syncing but almost
 every file in it displayed an error &nbsp;that the file must be open in connected program (Word, Excel) before syncing. When I open any of those files it says the file has newer version on server and ask me which version I want to store. I understand this warning
 but problem that those files are the same. Same date, same time, same owner, same rights, same content.
</p>
<p>Will your solution work on this problem? Or it will delete all cached and synced files/folders (after backup) and sync it whole again?</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>When you do a 1:1 clone, the OneDrive for Business will stop the sync process . So even though the path is the same, the folder isn’t synced and to make syncing successfully in the new hard drive, you may need to clear the OneDrive for Business
 2013’s caches and perform a re-syncing. In addition, in your environment, you have stopped syncing and renamed the synced folder. It will also result in some issues. So could you back up the files, clear OneDrive for Business 2013’s caches by the Easy fix
 tool, delete all synced folders and then perform a re-syncing to check the outcome? This may be the most effective way to fix the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for your effort.<br />
Cliff</p>

            Hi Andy,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, I would like to help you with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You can do the following to fix this problem:
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Update McAfee and Malwarebytes to latest. If update doesn't solve the issue, uninstall both McAfee and Malwarebytes.
<br />
<br />If you need more help, just let me know.
<br />
<br />Cristina       
        </p>

<h2>            IE and Chrome crash when trying to upload photos</h2>
                    When trying to upload a photo to an internet site, IE and Chrome crashes. It all worked fine a few weeks ago but now every time I try it crashes. Have tried to restore to a previous point but that doesn't work. Also tried other various options from previous
 posts.

            <p>You are experiencing a somewhat similar problem as reported with IE and Chrome hanging
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/explorer-process-bes-error-when-attempting-to/bd00ee32-497f-4e88-93e7-5bfb6def3283">

<p>
</p><p>As in that topic you could try using WhatIsHang to get more information on the hang:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, consider creating and providing a dump file&nbsp;of Internet Explorer at the time of the hang:</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time of the IE hang&nbsp;open the Task Manager (Ctrl +&nbsp;Shift + Esc) and then right click the hung&nbsp;Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe)&nbsp;&gt; Create Dump File</p>
<p>
</p><p>Locate the dump file (iexplore.dmp)&nbsp;which should be in&nbsp;your user Temp folder which you can open by the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R &gt; type<em> %temp%</em> in the&nbsp;Open box &gt; OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upload the dump file to a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive (SkyDrive) or similar site&nbsp;and&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dump file may be quite large so you could zip and compress the dump file with a third party application such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Hebrew 2010 Calendar coming up even when English is set as default</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am running Outlook 2010. I recently installed the Hebrew Language Pack for its support of Hebrew dictionaries etc. I have English set in default and my Office is running in English.
 Unfortunately, the calendars in places such as the "Due Date" section in Tasks are&nbsp;written from right to left (i.e. Hebrew)&nbsp;instead of left to right (as in English).</span></p>

<h2>            How do I switch ie 10 from desktop mode to metro mode&#63;</h2>
                    Why can't I get the metro mode of ie 10? I just upgraded to Win 8 Pro and I know others who have too, but theirs is already in metro mode and mine is not. Anyone know?

<div>Thanks!</div>

Hold down the Ctrl key and scroll the mouse wheel. One direction makes it bigger, the other direction makes it smaller.</p>

<h3> emus  say:</h3>
<h2>            StdevIF</h2>
                    <div>I'm trying to find a standard deviation if certain criteria are met (like AVERAGEIF). I've read previous posts and tried&nbsp;</div>
<p>=STDEV(IF<span>(</span>AND<span>(</span><span>A1:A100</span><span>)</span>=3,<span>(</span><span>B1:B100</span><span>)</span>="Female"<span>)</span>,<span>C1:C100</span>)
 and confirming as an array with CMD+Shift+Enter. (I've tried a bunch of other variations too, but this seems to be most in line with previous discussions.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It doesn't work. I'm guessing it's a problem with arrays, since CMD+Shift+Enter doesn't do anything at all (no curly braces). I'm using Excel for Mac 2011.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
