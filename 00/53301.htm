<p>This maybe the last Christmas with my Mom-She wants copies of a home recorded DVD to give to family as a gift. I am trying to install Pinnacle Studio Plus&nbsp; on windows 7, but I keep getting a message I need administrator rights to install. I have tried right
 clicking on the icon-enabling in safemode and using CMD but unsuccessful.&nbsp; Please help this needs to be completed in 2 days.</p>
<p>Sincere Thanks, Joy</p>

    <title>Where are the check disk reports&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where are the check disk reports&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi, </p>
<p>How can I view the results of a 'ckeck disk' operation on my C drive. </p>
<p>When I run 'check disk' on my D drive a grey box appears at the end of the process giving the results (ie. this is fundamentally because I can run 'check disk' on the D drive without having to restart the netbook. However, when I run 'check disk' on the
 C drive it is only possible to do so after a restart (ie. a scheduled disk check) and although a report appears on the screen at the end of the process this is only for a brief period of time before it changes to the logon screen. It is therefore not possible
 to read it in full and it is only viewable if I just so happen to be looking at the screen at the brief moment it appears. I want to be able to look at the results in detail and for as long as it takes to read them after logging on again - can anyone please
 let me know how to access them (I think that they are kept in the Documents and Settings folder/System Volume information, an area that for some inexplicable "reason" I cannot access, even as the Administrator!).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span>Hi David</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After the check disk runs and the computer restarts, perform the following.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Control Panel </span></b>/ <b>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Event Viewer</span></b> <b><span style="font-weight: bold">Double Click</span></b> the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Logs</span></b> in the left side menu to expand.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Application</span></b> log.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Right Click</span></b> the <b>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. Type
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">wininit</span></b> in the box and click
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Find Next</span></b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the center section click the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Source</span></b>/<b><span style="font-weight: bold">wininit</span></b> line that is found.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the lower section, you will see the

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>you can read the result of the <strong>check disk </strong>in <strong>Event Viewer</strong>, here is how:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/96938-check-disk-chkdsk-read-event-viewer-log.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/96938-check-disk-chkdsk-read-event-viewer-log.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to <strong>acces </strong>to the directory "<strong>System Volume Information</strong>", you have to
<strong>add yourself to the permissions to that folder with full-access</strong>. Just be sure to
<strong>remove</strong> them when<strong> you're done</strong> as you don't want anything bad running under your name that can make unwanted changes.</p>
<p>Here is how:</p>

<h2>            SCCM compliance status for patch</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to fulfill audit purpose to check the compliance status for the OS patching&nbsp;for all the client PCs (around 2000)&nbsp;in a specific date.</p>
<p>SCCM has a reporting function that can show the&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;percentage by comparing the patches installed with&nbsp;the&nbsp;released patched (in my configuration is all patches released 90 days before).&nbsp;If&nbsp;it is possible that I can throwback and extracted the snapshot
 for the compliance status&nbsp;/ the&nbsp;patch list which have been installed for a specific date (like 31 Sep 2017)? Thanks.</p>

            Hi, ThomasHansen258
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<h3> brutis65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Update to version 1709 problems</h2>
                    <p>I<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> just did an upgrade to version 1709.&nbsp; When I log into my account all my personal files including photos, documents, video, music, favorites and desktop icons are missing.&nbsp;
 After searching I did find these files that were relocated to different folders on my computer.&nbsp;
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">They were in the root directory under Users.&nbsp; Note that I have two users so there they were for both users.&nbsp; All files were inside these folders so I copied everything back
 to their proper locations.&nbsp; Now the folders Windows created during the update are named the same except they have added a dot after the name and then added the computer name.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Like this (yourname.computername).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So I thought all my problems were solved.&nbsp; But wait, I now wanted to use an app that I downloaded from the App store and I'm thinking it was the only one I downloaded.&nbsp; But it was gone! Nowhere was it found!&nbsp; No problem, I'll just download it again from the
 Windows Store, but where did the Store go!&nbsp; That also was gone.&nbsp; I searched for anyone else that may have had the same problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Many who did recommend uninstalling the update.&nbsp; First thing I did was back up everything.&nbsp;
<strong><span>I might interject here</span></strong>, before doing any update from Microsoft
</span><span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">BACKUP! BACKUP! BACKUP!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; You should make an image of your entire
 PC so when the update goes south you can restore your PC.&nbsp; It won't make any difference if it's a required update but make sure you back up your data as well.
<br />
So now I will try and roll back the update and follow the instructions.&nbsp; The next problem when trying this method is that it is telling me that because I have created two new Users since the update that I must delete them first.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Well I can tell you Microsoft that I did not create any new Users!!&nbsp; You have!!&nbsp; By creating these two different identities with the dot suffix.&nbsp; So now what!&nbsp; I can
 delete the other user.&nbsp; Fine, but I can't delete myself because I'm logged into my account and I am the administrator.&nbsp; Please let me know anyone has seen this behavior when updating Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I have 30 days to try and roll the update back or just maybe
 time to do a fresh install?</span></p>
<p>

<br />
<strong>I will explain the problems below (all below happen <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
simultaneously</span>):</strong><br />
&nbsp;1. My computer can't play any offline video/audio (If you double click Video/Audio, Windows Media Player just loading without result)<br />
&nbsp;2. My computer can't play any video from facebook (but in progress bar i can see it buffered but when play button click, nothing happen/not played)<br />
&nbsp;3. My computer can't play video/audio from Youtube and other sources in any browser.
<br />
&nbsp;4. My Flash Player freeze when open flash object in any browser (tested in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Mozilla FireFox</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Google Chrome</span>).<br />
&nbsp;5. Every game not responding if i tried to open it.<br />
&nbsp;6. Microsoft Windows 10 system and its user interface looks normally except all point upon.<br />
<br />
<strong>What i have to do? I will explain below :</strong><br />
&nbsp;1. Update Graphics Driver to the newest driver, currenty using 361.43 version (<strong>NOT WORKING</strong>)<br />
&nbsp;2. Change Protected Mode for Adobe Flash Player to Disabled (<strong>NOT WORKING</strong>)<br />
&nbsp;3. Reset Windows 10 to clear all applications and settings (<strong>WORK BUT IT HAPPEN AGAIN</strong>)<br />
&nbsp;4. Restart/Reboot the device (<strong>WORK TEMPORARY BUT IT HAPPEN AGAIN</strong>)<br />
&nbsp;5. Uninstall Mozilla FireFox and delete Adobe Flash Player directly from directory and then install it again (<strong>NOT WORKING</strong>)<br />
&nbsp;6. Use command prompt and type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and the result is "<strong>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</strong>"<br />
&nbsp;7. etc. (i forget too much method i try but still not working)<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Let’s try fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The issue you are facing could be due to the display driver is being outdated. Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the display adapter driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate for <strong>display adapter</strong> and click on it to expand.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>
uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic display adapter driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the display adapter driver. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>update.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to go to the below link and click on <strong>AUTO DETECT YOUR GPU</strong> to detect your graphics card and check for the latest updated driver.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run sound audio troubleshooter, it will automatically detect the problem and fix it. Follow the below method.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and click on <strong>

            <p>Hi Billion, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already do Method 1 and 2, it's not working. Successful in progress but not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already do Method 3 too, but it's stuck in Playing Audio window with statement :</p>

<p>
</p><p>The loading screen happen continuously (approx. 30 - 40 minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you need more system information such as log file or something else to help identified problems ? If yes can you explain to me what log files you needs ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your attention, help, and idea. :D</p>

            Hey there husadakingdom,<br />
<br />
I'd follow Billion's suggestions and post back with some results.<br />
I would also test the storage drive if it's functioning properly. My recommendation would be to download and run WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic and see if the drive passes both the quick and the extended tests. Yo can also get another tool to verify the results
 and give you the raw values of the S.M.A.R.T. status (they can give you a more detailed picture of the drive's condition). Running chkdsk /r from the CMD is also a goo way to test the drive's health. Here's a link to WD DLG: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=LWkzYD<br />
<br />
Post back with some results!<br />

            According to the WD diagnostic tool your drive is bad and you should perform a backup as soon as you can and consider replacing the drive as your data is at risk. This is due to problems with the drive, possibly having bad sectors. Here's a manual for
 the diagnostic tool in which you can find a list with error codes at the end: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=5oyeFx<br />
<br />
I would assume the chkdsk /r would give you similar results. Post back when you have more progress :)<br />

            I would try the drive on another computer with another SATA cable (if possible) and perform again the WD DLG tests and the chkdsk /r test and see if the results are the same or differ in any way. Also try getting the raw values of your S.M.A.R.T. status.

            If your BT device is working with another computer then it sure sounds like the BT on your computer is faulty. It can be disabled, if it is not now, and then you can add a BT device such as a BlueSoleil to restore BT to the computer.
<br />
<br />
As an example : (There are many makes available.)<br />

            If this is the wrong place, then where is the appropriate forum? I have also tried to get a key&nbsp; and it don't work! When I try to get the key,&nbsp;it makes me log into Windows Live and it dies there. All I get is !Done (some sort of error but it won't tell
 me) at the bottom of the screen, and a bunch of animated dots making a circle in the middle of the screen. I have waited&nbsp;an hour for a response from the Windows Live page to give me a key&nbsp;or should I wait longer? I just checked again, and it has informed me
 that there is an error on the page but not what the error is. The dots are still running in a circle. I do not get any&nbsp;page to fill out any information. And 'yes' I am registered in Windows Live.

Use ANY other web browser (I used Opera) then:-</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Login to live.com</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Paste&nbsp; <a href="https://profile.microsoft.com/RegSysProfileCenter/wizard.aspx?wizid=7c945c1b-d351-4f77-b526-36e696a413d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will work fine,&nbsp; the issue it seems is IE (which MS will not admit to), I'd spent over a month with this issue - think surely it cannot be a fault with IE, then when I tried the above it worked first time.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen System Thread Exception msrcp.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benthepen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen System Thread Exception msrcp.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently started getting a lot of different bluescreens on my PC. After some frustration I backed up my important files, formatted my system drive and primary data drive and reinstalled Windows 7 Professional 64 bit. This didn't fix my bluescreen errors
 at all. I'm running my OS off of a solid state drive, and installed two 2TB drives in Raid0 before reinstalling my OS. I have the drivers for RAID for my motherboard, they seem to be working properly, and I'm not writing to them or reading them so I doubt
 this is the source of my problem. The analysis of my crashes by WhoCrashed is below.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p> 
<hr />
<br />
7 crash dumps have been found and analyzed. A third party driver has been identified to be causing system crashes on your computer. It is strongly suggested that you check for updates for these drivers
 on their company websites. Click on the links below to search with Google for updates for these drivers:
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dxgmms1.sys+Microsoft Corporation+Microsoft® Windows® Operating System" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">dxgmms1.sys (DirectX Graphics MMS, Microsoft Corporation)</a><br />
<br />
If no updates for these drivers are available, try searching with Google on the names of these drivers in combination the errors that have been reported for these drivers and include the brand and model name of your computer as well in the query. This often
 yields interesting results from discussions from users who have been experiencing similar problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read the topic <a href="http://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed_troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
general suggestions for troubleshooting system crashes</a> for more information. <br />
<br />
Note that it's not always possible to state with certainty whether a reported driver is actually responsible for crashing your system or that the root cause is in another module. Nonetheless it's suggested you look for updates for the products that these drivers
 belong to and regularly visit Windows update or enable automatic updates for Windows. In case a piece of malfunctioning hardware is causing trouble, a search with Google on the bug check errors together with the model name and brand of your computer may help
 you investigate this further.

Bug check description: This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.
<br />
The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.

The crash took place in a standard Microsoft module. Your system configuration may be incorrect. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver on your system that cannot be identified at this time.

<p>This crash came moments after adding the new crash... I'm not sure how I can troubleshoot a BSOD thats different every time.</p>

            <p>Similar experience, three Win7 BSOD crashes since 27 January 2013 after installing a series of updates through Windows Updates. Each time, the machine was sitting alone largely idle when it crashed and restarted.</p>
<p>Various bugcheck STOP codes, analysed the crash dumps, wide variety, all within Microsoft drivers, netio.sys, msrpc.sys, etc.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the debugger is unable to fetch symbols online for some of these MS modules...</p>
<p>My system is *very* simple, 100% clean, no fancy hardware or hardware changes since the machine was built, no new applications installed around that time, so I tend to think it is a newly-created OS stability problem.</p>

<p>UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP (7f)<br />
This means a trap occurred in kernel mode, and it's a trap of a kind<br />
that the kernel isn't allowed to have/catch (bound trap) or that<br />
is always instant death (double fault). The first number in the<br />
bugcheck params is the number of the trap (8 = double fault, etc)<br />
Consult an Intel x86 family manual to learn more about what these<br />
traps are. Here is a *portion* of those codes:<br />
If kv shows a taskGate<br />
use .tss on the part before the colon, then kv.<br />
Else if kv shows a trapframe<br />
use .trap on that value<br />
Else<br />
.trap on the appropriate frame will show where the trap was taken<br />
(on x86, this will be the ebp that goes with the procedure KiTrap)<br />
Endif<br />
kb will then show the corrected stack.<br />

            You would get it from a working copy of Windows XP, put it on a USB thumb drive, and copy it to your hard drive using the Recovery Console or a Bart's PE. You could even do it with a Linux Live CD using an NTFS driver.

<div>I have an Asus X540-YA laptop, and sometimes when I press the Backspace, instead of deleting the character, it writes down the combination of "74321", and sometimes some dots as well. Same thing with my Enter, sometimes it
 just types "nbz" instead of jumping a line when typing. I have tried to restore my Windows 10 the the original settings and re-install a driver ASUS sent me, but it did not help. Any suggestions what could cause it, or what could I do?</div>

            Hi Dávid,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked  
<br />

<h2>            windows 10 update kb4038782</h2>
                    <p>On update history the above update has failed (no error code) to install more than 15 times.&nbsp; Same problem with the 1703 update.&nbsp; I've been trying to find a solution to this problem since Oct 3rd 2017.&nbsp; Update troubleshooter says possible corrupt database,
 repair attempts fail every time.&nbsp; I've tried sfc scan, &amp; dism (which stops working at 97%).&nbsp; I've tried windows update assistant several times, it&nbsp;freezes at 99% every time, left computer on at least 12 hours when it reached 99%.&nbsp; I've tried every method I
 have found on the Microsoft support site.&nbsp; Another update&nbsp;kb4041691 started failing&nbsp;to install a few days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem only occurs when a restart/shutdown is required, even when I manually tried to install from the update catalog.&nbsp;&nbsp;On my installed updates
 list&nbsp;there is kb4034658 which shows to have installed on 10/16/2017,&nbsp; I'm guessing that&nbsp;one didn't require a restart.</p>

    <title>Internet doesn&#39;t seem to work after uninstalling Avira Premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> remembrance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet doesn&#39;t seem to work after uninstalling Avira Premium Edition but Google Chrome works</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I recently uninstalled Avira Premium Edition. I opted for 1 month trial but I uninstalled before the 1-month expiration. The uninstall process went fine. But when I rebooted the computer, the Internet doesn't seem to work but Google Chrome works as usual.
 When I tried to login to MSN, it said "Error Code: 80072ee7". It's something about Internet connection. I guess it must be some files that must have gone accidentally with the uninstall process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to upgrade to windows 10 you may continue running the current windows 8.1 on your system. And you will get the support for windows 8.1. However, the support for windows 8 is obsolete now and you would not get any support for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need third party anti virus to protect your system as Windows defender is already integrated with windows 8.1. If you use multiple security software on your system, they might start conflicting with each other and cause issue on your system. So,
 you may remove third party security software and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to perform a full system scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner to eliminate any issues related to virus/malware.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello, Ashish:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your prompt reply. I did not know that Windows 8.1 has a built-in antivirus program, Windows Defender! When I bought my Dell Inspiron I3646 it came without antivirus software and instead of checking first with Microsoft I simply installed
 AVG Zen Free and then I switched to Avira Free, which I currently use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few questions for you: (1) Before I download and install Microsoft Safety Scanner and run a system scan, should I uninstall Avira AV and its components (Avira Phantom VPN and Avira System Speedup)? (2) You said Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days
 after being downloaded? Does this mean I need to download the Scanner once, run a scan, and then download it a second time and scan again? Please explain. (3) Can I still scan my computer with MalwareBytes Anti-Malware?</p>
<p>If not. what is to prevent a virus from attacking my PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I'm still considering upgrading to Windows 10. But first, I want to make very certain that my Windows 8.1 desktop computer is totally virus free! I hope that I can count on all of my Microsoft friends to offer me the support that I will need.</p>
<p>Thank you again, Ashish.</p>

            <p>When you install a 3rd party Antivirus (Avira) The Windows Defender program which is built in to Windows 8/10&nbsp;just gets turned off not removed. If you should uninstall your AV then Defender gets re enabled, all it should do is update the Virus template file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safety Scanner is a standalone version of Defender with the template built in, it is inactivated after 10 days because the template will be out of date. It does not disable or replace your existing AV and is only active whilst it is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a second AV is on general discouraged because the two AV can conflict but this is only if they are installed and continually running doing background protection. Running MSS does not have that function and is only really intended to be run once to
 verify nothing has passed by the installed AV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing Windows 10 may uninstall or disable Avira during setup due to file conflicts, check on the Avira site for any specific instructions. In fact it would be best if you can review your complete installed program list and uninstall anything you do
 not use before doing the upgrade</p>

            <p>As I have said Defender is disabled when a 3rd party AV is installed, it just remains available if you should remove the chosen AV in the future. It goes so far as it is not updated when disabled and has to download templates if reactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be against competition regulations to actively prevent 3rd party applications being run therefore obstructing the installation of a 3rd party AV would bring Microsoft to the courts. They know that having more than one real time AV scanner active
 can cause significant problems so ensure that the deactivation of Defender is effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point about Microsoft Safety Scanner is that it is NOT a real time scanner, all it does is scan the hard disks for any signs of a virus whilst it is running. The main benefit is the fact that it will be a different engine to the Avira system so anything
 that is missed by one would most likely be found by the other. Doesn't have to be MSS, there are a number of others you can use the important bit is that the second scanner is not the same as the 1st.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In defence of Defender I have been using it since it origins as Microsoft Security Essentials and have
<p>
</p><p>If you were actually hacked then your chosen anti-malware is NOT working. Its job is to prevent such a thing happening and warn you that an attempt has been made. As an IT systems manager I regularly received calls from users about warning messages but to
 me that is good, it means the program (Sophos) is doing its job. Yes the user has to review where the files came from that generated the warning but from my side everything behaved as it should.</p>

            <p>Dear HairyFool:</p>
<p>Thanks for your speedy reply. First, let me apologize for not mentioning earlier that my computer data was hacked several months ago<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>before</strong></span> I downloaded and installed antivirus software and anti-malware
 protection, leaving it vulnerable for viruses and the like. The fault was mine. I purchased the Windows 8.1 Dell Inspiron on clearance and the salesman didn't mention a word about the PC needing an antivirus program!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging from your reply, it sounds as if you are a real fan of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Windows Defender</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see your point about the benefit of using <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanne</strong></span>r to scan a different engine than Avira and that way whatever is missed by one scanner could be found by the second scanner.</p>
<p>So you and I won't constantly be going back and forth with this same post, how does this sound to you?...</p>
<p>I keep using <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Avira Antivirus Pro</strong></span> as my primary AV scanner and
<p>Would those two programs conflict?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for being so stubborn but these software programs are working out best for me.</p>
<p>Please reply ASAP and thanks for all your helpful advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Running Malwarebytes with an Anti-Virus is a fairly common scenario and users seem to be happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I am not the best to answer that question as I run neither a full Internet Security package or Malwarebytes myself. I started with Avast and switched to Microsoft Security Essentials soon after it came out and have used nothing else. The fact
 is I am biased and freely admit it but having NEVER suffered any infection myself in more than 20 years&nbsp;I feel my&nbsp;choices work. My experience comes from fixing other peoples problems not mine but in reality I have not had to deal with a virus infection for
 a&nbsp; year or so. Plenty of work but none of it virus related. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a tendency for the unexplained vagaries of Windows to be attributed to an infection with the well meaning chorusing "install xxxx" and "scan with yyyy" without actually looking at what the problems is. Most of my work begins with uninstalling software&nbsp;not
 putting more on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avira is the top rated AV package so is probably the best to pair with Malwarebytes. You must use what works best for you not what I&nbsp;or anybody else eulogises about. Replace "stubborn" with "feel most confident with"</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to </span><span>Use the disk clean up option to delete the thumbnail cache for the network drive and check if that helps.
<br />
a. <span>To open Disk Cleanup from the desktop, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap
</span><span>Settings</span><span> (or if you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
</span><span>Settings</span><span>), tap or click </span><span>Control Panel</span><span>, type
</span><span>Admin</span><span> in the Search box, tap or click</span><span> Administrative Tools</span><span>, and then double-tap or double-click
</span><span>Disk Cleanup</span><span>.<br />
b. </span>In the <span>Drives</span> list, tap or click the network drive, that you want to clean up, and then tap or click
<span>OK</span>.<br />
c. In the <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> dialog box, on the <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> tab, select the check boxes for Thumbnails option to delete, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
d. In the message that appears, click <strong>Delete files</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Also refer to the link:</strong> Delete files using Disk Cleanup<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are not able to perform a disk clean up for the network drive then you my go ahead and delete ‘Thumbs.db’ from the NAS Drive itself.</span></p>
<p><span>To unhide the files, follow the steps given below.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Windows Explorer.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the Alt key to view the File Menu<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Tools, select Folder Options<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to View tab and select Show hidden files, folders and drives.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, uncheck Hide empty drives in the Computer Folder and Hide extensions for Known file types.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have unhidden the files, open the Network drive and delete the file. Now check if you are able to get the thumbnail view of the NAS drive.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>
