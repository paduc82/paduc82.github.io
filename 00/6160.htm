    <title>fillable form locked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pau.marin  say:</h3>
<h2>            fillable form locked</h2>
                    I created a form that was meant to be filled out, and tried to restrict editing to fill out gray areas and checkboxes only. It wouldn't do it, so I stopped trying. The next time I opened it and made changes to the form, I saved it and now it restricted
 editing to the whole document-- I can't even fill out the gray areas or check the boxes anymore! I tried the Developer Tab- Restrict Editing- to try to click on Stop Protection, but it doesn't give me that option (instead it gives me the option to restrict
 it, as if it were not locked already). <br />
I do know the password, but I can't get it to prompt me for one. Any ideas on how to edit this? I am using Word 2010.<br />

            The classic way to remove form protection is to insert the locked document into a new blank document.

<p>True but i recently upgraded my office 365 license which is 64 bit and it asked me to uninstall my sharepoint designer 2013 which was 32-bit at the time. Now that i need to work on sharepoint designer i installed the 64 bit version thinking it would work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at the message it lists one MS app called office 15 click to run extensibility component that it says is 32 bit which must be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i remove this?</p>
<p>

<p>Strange, if you managed to install 64 bit Office 365 there should not be any 32 bit pieces left to cause problems with this new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First place to look is Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features. Look through the list of installed applications to see if there is any mention of Office 2013.&nbsp; If there is, uninstall it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see anything in the list, then go to the following link and use method 2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<strong><span>Uninstall Office 2016 / 365 ‚Äì 2007</span></strong>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This will probably nuke your Office 365 too.&nbsp; If you have made any customizations to your Word setup or your QAT you will have to save them first because they will also be wiped out by method 2.&nbsp; (If you don't know how to save customizations we can help
 with that too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if&nbsp; method 2 does not work, try using method 3 in that article.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing the 32-bit version of SP designer 2013 and it worked with the 64-bit version of office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how that works but I'm not complaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is good. Thank you.</p>

    <title>Vlookup and sum results from multiple worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ccbeebiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vlookup and sum results from multiple worksheets</h2>
                    <p>I have 300 worksheets in the same workbook with the same table at P1 through Q5. The table looks like this. The values in Column Q are pulled from within the current worksheet. The values in Column P are the same on every worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ColP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Col Q</p>
<p>1054&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0000</p>
<p>7532&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.876</p>
<p>8832&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.000</p>
<p>16105&nbsp; 12.1150</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of the 300 worksheets has a different number in Col Q.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a formula in a summary worksheet that will sum all the Column Q values for all the Column P items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using a formula like this to pull individual data from each of the summary worksheets, but for this problem I don't need my summary page to tell me that worksheet #100 has a value for item 1054 and worksheet #2480 does not. All I need to know is
 the total of the values in all the item 1054 lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the worksheet named "2567" one formula would be: ='2567'!$H$74</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 300 worksheets all have number names between 2276 and 16700, although there is one worksheet with the name 3043N.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming there's some way around this besides creating a summary worksheet with a row for every worksheet and a column for every Column P item, but if not then I will use that somewhat more tedious solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Assuming there are no sheets that you want to skip over, you can just name the first and last sheet in a formula and then the cell.
<br />For example: =SUM('2276:16700'!$H$74) will sum all the H74 cells between sheet 2276 and sheet 16700 inclusive.

<h2>            Reading Pane options - mark as read when...</h2>
                    <p>Something odd is happening and I cant seem to find a way to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening either way, if I set to <em>wait 2 seconds before marking the item as read</em> or
<em>mark as read when selection changes.</em></p>
<p>Example, I receive 5 emails, I read them one by one and using either option mentioned above the email is shown has been read but all of a sudden all 5 go back as if they haven't been read. I select them one by one again, they show as been read and sometimes
 they go back again as if they haven't been read. What is happening here? Sometimes I need to select them 3 or 4 times till they finally show as been read. This is very annoying.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm using IMAP accounts, Gmail and Outlook (@netcabo.pt).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In safe mode it acted the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new profile with all my accounts and initially all seemed OK. One of the problems seemed to be fixed which was when receiving a new email I could see I had emails to be read.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a47aca5-31c8-4784-8beb-14c7b85fefcd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it continues to sync god knows what for more then an hour, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6af2fefe-c733-49da-b4f8-b11415e8b5de" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up giving up and closed Outlook.</p>
<p>I reopened it and all got the same. I could not see the emails I had not read yet and once again, only by clicking in each Inbox I could see the emails.</p>
<p>Also, even Outlook mark the email as read seconds after they popped up as not being read.</p>
<p>I made a small video demonstrating this. Note the third account from the bottom. There's 4 email that needs to be read. I go and click on them, Outlook signal them as read but then they pop up again as not being read.</p>
<p>The video is here:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think I'm going back to Thunderbird. That thing (which by the way it's FREE) works flawlessly regarding sync IMAP accounts and syncs with Google Calendar, something that Outlook can't which amazes me how the simplest and more obvious things continue to
 be forgotten by Microsoft.</p>
<p>What a mess Outlook seems to be right now.</p>

    <title>No More Triple Boot In My Insider Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richbutler  say:</h3>
<h2>            No More Triple Boot In My Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>Until last week I was running a triple boot system with XP Pro, Win 7 Ultimate and an Insider preview (the latest build although I can't remember the version) when my PC quit booting into windows 10. I got the infamous winloader error message and the message
 that Windows 10 would no longer support multi-booting. Now, since I was receiving my Insider builds via the insider program and had no ISO to restore from (even if they would have worked) I can't get my Insider program and Windows 10 back. I wiped and reformatted
 one of my hard drives and tried to reinstall Windows 10 hoping to upgrade back into the insider program to get back to where I was last week. Now I'm being prompted for a Key which I never had since I was a beta Insider tester. What now? Any help would be
 appreciated. Thanks in advance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I HAVE to run dual and triple boots since so many of the apps I MUST use will not run at all on Windows 10 or Win 7. Now I'm back to XP and Win7 in a dual boot.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 programs&#39; Insert &#62; Screenshot command doesn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2016 programs&#39; Insert &#62; Screenshot command doesn&#39;t see Microsoft Edge browser</h2>
                    So, many of the Office 2016 (and 2013 version) programs have an Insert &gt; Screenshot command that lists available windows. Normally it shows any other programs that are open on your PC. However, I've noticed that it never shows Microsoft Edge browser. Provided
 the window isn't hidden behind another window, I can still use the Screen Clipping mode to manually snag a portion of the window. Am I the only one? Thanks!

            <p><span>Hello Greg,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Available Window option that appears after clicking on Insert Screenshot menu shows/lists screenshots of windows that are open on the computer in the background. There is also
 a Screen Clipping option available instead of Screenshot. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why Microsoft Edge does not show in Available Windows is because, Edge is not just a browser but an App which enables Cortana and other Windows 10 apps to connect to
 Internet. This app enables users to write on the web as well, but at the same time these apps are secured so you can‚Äôt just take screenshot of the app but can include a screen clipping using the Screen Clipping option. That is the reason why it is not available
 as a screenshot. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.

    <title>WP8.1 Lumia 920 is constantly sending data out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melpzh  say:</h3>
<h2>            WP8.1 Lumia 920 is constantly sending data out</h2>
                    Hi, I recently downloaded an app called music+ from the microsoft store and since then noticed that my wifi icon changes with an arrow mark&nbsp;indicating that data is going out constantly (screen shot attached)<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82f57c38-d31c-485c-9acf-2f8ef5469fbd" />.
 I tried uninstalling the app but my wifi keeps indicating data going out. I have since stopped email synching and other apps that send/receive data, even turned off location. but the wifi icon still has an arrow on it most of the time. Has anyone else had
 this issue. Is there an app out there that can tell me what data is going out from my phone and to what endpoints. I find it very disconcerting that I cant tell at the moment and I have since stopped using this phone as a smartphone.<br />

            <p>This is part of the Cyan firmware update. There is also an arrow icon for the cellular data connection. These arrows indicate&nbsp;the phone&nbsp;is receiving or sending cellular or WiFi data.</p>
<p>You might check what apps you have allowed to run in the background. Settings &gt; battery saver &gt; slide to the left to see usage. Tap an app that is allowed to run in the background to see battery usage for the app in use and in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The arrow is there to indicate use, not the direction of traffic.</p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the post. I have now disabled every single app except 'Battery Saver' from running in the background. And my phone is still sending/receiving something. Perplexing!!!</p>
<p>The amount of data it sends or receives seems to be very small. Datasense is not helpful in this case since it shows usage in MB and it could take a few days for me to see a difference in the data amounts.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can find out what data my phone is sending out and who is it going to or coming in from.
</p>
<p>Is this expected behaviour from WP8.1 for the phone to be constantly sending/receiving.</p>
        </p>

            <p>A smartphone is constantly using small amounts of data. Location services, check email, check for app updates and more. These are not controlled by the battery saver background usage.&nbsp; It has always been sending or receiving data with 8.0&nbsp;and now&nbsp;you can
 see when this is happening with the Cyan firmware, whether it is by cellular data or WiFi.</p>
<p>If the data usage is causing unexpected usage for your carrier bill, this&nbsp;is the only time to be concerned.</p>

</p><p>I was beginning to suspect a virus/malware. Thanks for persisting in getting me to understand. I feel a bit more at ease and turned on location and email sync. But still haven't given up on my quest to identify what is being sent/received. Will update this

            <p>I'm having a similar issue with my Lumia 930.&nbsp; The interesting thing is that it only happens when I visit my mom's house.&nbsp; As soon as I get there, my wifi activity arrow comes on and stays on until I leave.&nbsp; When I get home and connect&nbsp;to wifi, the arrow
 comes on for a second or two then goes off and mostly stays off except for the expected sync of email, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reset and rebooted her router (Asus less than a year old) deleted the wifi connection on my phone and re-connected.&nbsp; Same issue.&nbsp; The battery also drains about 20% an hour when I'm there.&nbsp; These issues just started this week.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if there is something wrong with her router as I don't have this issue any place else.&nbsp; The strange thing is that everything else works perfectly.&nbsp; I get excellent download and upload speeds&nbsp;without any other issues.&nbsp; The router is set up as
 wpa2.&nbsp; I'm going to try to update the firmware the next chance I get.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, I'll try a new router.</p>

sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications functions that you can use to convert a numeric value in a Microsoft Excel worksheet cell into its equivalent in English words.</p>

</p><p>Basically, what you need do is parse the words, identified by spaces between char to identify numbers (one, two, three ... ) and units (millions, thousands, hundreds ...) , translate them into number , multiply the quantity by the unit, and all all of them
 up. I can see it being done in 4 case statements with some loops. </p>

            Hi BillLeary,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />You do not need a phone number nor a Skype Number to receive calls from other Skype Users. As long as you have signed up and are logged in to Skype, you can receive and give calls to other Skype users for free and as long as you would like to.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<h2>            E66 - Unable to terminate&#47;hang-up when called number is busy</h2>
                    I'm in Malaysia and just bought my e66 and found out this problem last Sat when calling my mom on Digi network. I need to restart the phone so that the phone can work again. This is a very very annoying problem. It can't be the network cause other phones
 don't have this problem.<br />
<br />
Any one know of any fixes to this problem?<br />
<br />
Please revert. Thanks!

<p>If you have not been able to access your account for one year, the account became inactive and all emails were deleted.</p>
<p>Filling out recovery forms is a waste of time.</p>
<p>See if you can create a new account using the old address.</p>

<h2>            Visio 2016 UML Use Case Dependency does not conform to standard</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not experienced with UML diagrams or Visio for that matter, however I believe that the representation of a Dependency in Visio 2016 is incorrect for
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Use Case</span> diagrams. It is show as a solid line with no arrow head and it should be a dashed line with an open arrow head - &nbsp;this
<em>is</em> how it's presented in UML <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Class</span> Diagrams in Visio 2016.</p>
<p>Am I correct, and if so, how can I fix it? Thanks</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; Your request can&#39;t be completed right now. Please try again later</h2>
                    I receive the following message " <em>Error: Your request can't be completed right now. Please try again later</em> " when accessing my company's shared email folders through the web version of Outlook 365. I am attempting to access these folders from
 my home network, not at my company's workstation. I have reached out to my company's IT organization who claim that this is likely a Microsoft Server issue.<br />
<br />
I was able to access this folder without issue yesterday. However, after logging into the web version of Outlook 365 today, I'm receiving that error message and no emails can be viewed.<br />
<br />
I have tested multiple internet browsers and still receive the issue regardless of browser. In addition, I have cleared my internet cache, history, and cookies and still receive the same error.<br />
<br />
I am unable to test this using the desktop version of Outlook as my company does not support use of desktop Outlook from computers not on their network.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome is an evergreen web browser. It should update itself when installed. There is no need to download the new versions with another web browser&nbsp;as they are released. Go to your chrome settings for Updates and ensure you have enabled them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find the google support forums at support.google.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a school internet connection, there may be restrictions on what you can download. For clarity include screen shots of any error messages with your questions and a link to problem websites. eg. the chrome download link you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Please check if you have updated your Word 2016 for Mac application‚Äôs version to the latest version. If no, update its version first and then do a test to see and let us know the result. Meanwhile, upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version
 information of the Word 2016 for Mac application you are using. You can access the page via Word&gt;About Word.</p>

<h2>            Zune database</h2>
                    I'm going to be refreshing my computer and reinstalling my software. I've used Zune to load some apps from MarketPlace. Is there a database that Zune stores what Apps I downloaded and paid for? That would prevent me from having to pay for them again.

<p>I can connect to the casr and make calls from the e51, but I can't get the address book to synch with the car.&nbsp; Note this works perfectly using an older 3109c.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>I had&nbsp;a similar problem before last firmware update. Which one is your phone firmware version? I believe you can transfer your contacts manually&nbsp;to the car memory via bluetooth. If you update the phone to the latest firmware like I did the sync&nbsp;should be&nbsp;performed
 every time the phone is connected to the car handsfree system but it takes time and if you have got pretty lond contact list you can spend long time to select a desired contact from the car addressbook depending on the screen size.</p>

<p>I have this same issue when synching existing notebooks from OneDrive and Sharepoint Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight I also updated to build 190318 and the same issue still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, once closed, the notebooks will not synchronize from the online version.&nbsp; When trying to open the notebooks in OneNote from the online location, OneNote responds by saying it can't access the location either because the location does not exist or the
 user does not have access.</p>
