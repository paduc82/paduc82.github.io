<p><span>Dear Skype,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As your customer service is near impossible to access here in Australia and it is quite difficult to find an sewer to anything relevant on these forums, I thought I would pen you an open letter in the vain hope people will
 see it, share it, and eventually push it to reach someone with the power to help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have been a Skype user for over a decade now. I have been using it to communicate with friends, with family, and occasionally even work. The quality of the program is remarkable, and up until now I have not had a single
 problem, in fact I had even recommended it highly around my circles. However, all good things must come to an end.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Despite only ever having accessed my Skype account on a maximum of four devices, you have now found the need to lock me out of my account as you have decided I am being hacked. I have previously been continuously logged in
 and active on Skype on my iPhone, and yet now when trying to access the phone application you have decided that I am no longer me and I do not deserve access to my account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I no longer have access to my original hotmail account that my Skype is linked to, as that too fell victim to “hacking”. Despite my many attempts to fill out your impossible “is this really you” questionnaires for both the
 Skype account and the hotmail, I am decidedly not myself and am continually being refused access to what is mine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You say your customer’s privacy and security comes first, yet you have access to all these minor details you put in your questionnaire. If a hacker was truly accessing my account they would have all the same answers as you.
 There is also no way to tell how I have gone wrong, but it is clear by the answers that I am the owner of the account. My new email has the same name, I know all the same contacts, all the expenditures, and quite frankly would be too much effort for a hacker
 to go to for an account with all of 4AUD on it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have access to my contacts, to my emails, to subject lines, to the very content which is deemed “private” that you throw out on your questionnaire, then shouldn’t you be able to tell that nobody has hacked the account?
 Shouldn’t you be able to read subject lines and realise that they are from real people having real conversations? And if, you truly think someone is hacking the account but for some incomprehensible reason decides not to do anything and just bide their time,
 couldn’t you just notify the user and urgently suggest they change password and security ASAP as so far no damage has been done?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am also left with this conundrum - my account is being used on another device by potentially another person. If you have access to the IP address of every device that has logged into my Skype account in order to determine
 this “hacking", would it not also be possible, or even be simple to detect which one has had the most access? Why is my iPhone, who has been logged on every day for the past six months, suddenly a new user? And if that iPhone was the “hacker”, why is it only
 just blocked now? Can you not just go back into your system and determine that that is me? It is the same IP address that paid the money, same IP address that made real conversation (not spam links), the same IP address that has been real and usable until
 now. If you can detect that a new user is using my account, then surely you can detect that an old, consistent user is trying to regain access.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Creating a new account is not an option. Skype is the only way I have contact with certain friends and family and to create a new account is not a viable solution.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So if the customer service does exist, please. Find a solution. Please help me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yours (unfortunately and regrettably) faithfully,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Neta</span></p>

<p>Hi Neta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the same happened to me yesterday. After having logged in to the same Skype account from the same laptop and IP for the last 12 months, 5-6 days per week, they decided yesterday not to let me in to my own account. Refusing the same correct
 password that I have been using on the same account for the last 5 years.. As I don't have access to the original email address used to create the Skype account with, and neither to the old phone number I registered with, I had to fill in the&nbsp;questionnaire
 online, but they decided that I was not able to verify myself enough..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND YOU DON'T HAVE A CUSTOMER SUPPORT DEPARTMENT TO HELP YOUR CUSTOMERS?!?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your ownership using the information that was provided. Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are committed to protecting your personal information, and our careful account recovery
 process is intended to protect you from any possible malicious activity."</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all the tools and security you guys(Skype + Microsoft) have, you surely should be able to see that it was myself, Karim Lamlih, trying to log in to the same account I have been using in the last 5 years with the same laptop and IP that I have been using
 in the last 12 months. You have advised me to create a new account, but this is not a solution for me. I have a lot of contacts, both personal and professional, in the original Skype account that I need to have access to again! I don't have some of the contacts
 anywhere else, only in my original Skype account!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a company as big as yours, this is really unbelievable and unacceptable from a customer's point of view. I almost can't believe the level of service provided by you(Skype + Microsoft!)!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do help your customers out in situations like this, when we actually need to beg you for help, you must understand that it is a really bad and unacceptable. Update and change your verification process, so that customers can access what is theirs.
 I really need to gain access to my account again, I can't stress out the fact of how important it is to me!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to hear from one of your agents/representatives soon! This is urgent and needs to be looked in to ASAP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karim</p>

<p>Guys, Skype after become Microsoft and they seem to have linked it together, it is a disaster.</p>
<p>Especially if you are a business user and you have paid for subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customer service is un-existing. If you have an issue you can talk with other customers here in this forum.</p>
<p>The chat works only to mark down your problem then they tell you you will be contacted in 48h, but you have to push them again and again by chat before they remember to contact you by email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you get their email, they ask you to fill up a survey, then (here is pathetic) you need to do a screenshot of the survey filled up and send them by email.</p>
<p>Because the SUBMIT button or doesn't work or I have no idea where it is addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pay attention that the screenshot must be JPG file, because if you maybe send a PNG file or any other image file, their computer are not able to read them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if you are enough good with computer the do all the required steps, then wait, maybe 3 or 4 weeks or maybe longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, my decade account, with year subscription just renew last month, with credit balance on it, with phone number and hundreds contacts, has just been deleted with no reason and after almost 3 weeks now I don't see any solution since they can only tell
 me they are checking my case and from time to time I get a new survery to do (+ JPG screenshot and so on...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guys, anyone has an alternative software to suggest which can make phone calls from computer to land numbers or mobile phones?</p>
<p>

<p>Me too I was forced to join skype when msn died. But skype one day suddenly stopped working. I'm at</p>
<p>law school and my fellow student all 120 of them were on the group chats for assignments now even</p>
<p>I open a new account I cant possibly be expected to locate all 120 e mails so this has detrimentally affected</p>
<p>my grades, no LIVE CHAT are you serious I cant even put my pic on my account so others can see me. You cant be this big and provide such terrible service, I haven't forgotten my password, I never gave u 2 best friends from childhood so you need to have a
 hard look at yr service because if a competitor shows up, I'll be gone and so will everyone who agrees with me.</p>

<h2>            Windows Lock Screen After Login</h2>
                    <p>Help!<span>&nbsp; </span>My Dell XPS Laptop just did the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Following the update, when I try to login to my local account (standard user), the login succeeds, but Windows then immediately displays the lock screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This occurs within about one second of logging in.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I double click the lock screen, then the login screen displays and when I enter my password I can again momentarily see my desktop and then Windows immediately puts up the lock screen
 again.&nbsp; No matter how many times I try to login, Windows immediately displays the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to backup to the previous version of Windows, but both System Restore and Recovery to a Previous Version fail to remove the Fall Creators Update.</p>

<p>This happened to my mother's computer after the Creator's Update. My mother could not log in after the update. Even booting into Safe Mode did not work. I was able to boot into a command prompt. I created a new user and put that user into the local administrators
 group using the command line. I was able to log in using the new user and apply the 2018-1 update after a couple reboots. That did not help. I applied the firmware patch from HP. That did not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other people &gt; Set up assigned access and inexplicably found my mother's administrator account set up with assigned access and no application. I removed my mother's account from assigned access. I was prompted to
 log my mother's account out and I did that. I was then able to log into my mother's account without it immediately locking the screen. It took me hours to get to this point where I just stumbled onto this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't find the account in assigned access, you might want to try putting the account into assigned access and then taking it out again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with Creator's Update has been truly horrible. On my computer, I had no video when I rebooted after the update. I had to take out my video card and boot into the integrated graphics processor. I then put in my graphics card and was able to
 boot up with video. I then had problems with the video blacking out which eventually just went away. I upgraded all my drivers but that didn't help. Tightening down the video cable screws did seem to help, so the screen blacking out (or flickering) might have
 been a cable problem after having to switch out the graphics card. But Creators Update did kill my video and it did lock my mother out of her computer. Just awful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, as a workaround you can access your previous files from this folder C:\users\account name\ then you can copy all important files to your newly created user account. Since the newly created user account has the same privilege with the corrupted
 user profile. You may delete the old one once you have completely transferred all files to the new user account and use it as your new user profile.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Firewall rules missing</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some weird reason my Windows 8 Firewall has lost its predefined rules completely.</p>
<p>Could anyone possibly export its rules and settings and post it here?</p>
<p>If no, could you please list them with their default settings so I can recreate them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched everywhere for a proper answer but I couldn't find anything.</p>
<p>Resetting the firewall is not also possible cause I receive "Unrecoverable Windows Firewall error &lt;03&gt; occurred".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if you could help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issues with our accounts.&nbsp; This does not seem to be an isolated issue.&nbsp; I'm thinking it's an authentication issue at the Xbox Live Server end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can access all our accounts with no difficulty on the web portal.&nbsp; It's only an issue logging in on the console.</p>

<p>If I select Speakers, I can click the configure button to no avail. I can't disable anything or enable anything. In Properties for speakers on the Levels section, all I have is a straight line. I've troubleshooted, uninstalled and reinstalled, updated, made
 sure Windows Audio (and Endpoint Builder) and Plug and Play are all running and on Automatic, and I've restarted my computer after each attempt at the appropriate time. I also have no option to "Open Volume Mixer" when I right-click on the volume icon (which
 has a red "x" as if it's muted, which it is not), although I'm not sure if I ever had that option anyway. I'm at the end of my wits and I'm starting to fear that my computer is done for good. Please help me, and thank you.</p>

<p>Interesting turn of events. I understand how one program crashing could cause corrupted RAM memory and cause the computer to crash and need rebooted, but it's super rare for that to cause any kind of lasting problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given everything you've already tried, the one thing I could think to try next would be System Restore (which is different from the similarly-named but very different "System Refresh" and "System Reset"). &nbsp;Unlike the later two, the first one is a "safe"
 option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
It only takes a couple of minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn’t fix the problem on the first try. When you aren’t sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.&nbsp; This works best if you
 use it immediately after a problem shows up.&nbsp; Waiting more than a week or two means the good backups can be too outdated to use.</p>

 show the Run box, type&nbsp;<strong>RSTRUI&nbsp;</strong>and click OK.</li><li>
Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>
Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore process, or try another date.</li></ol>

<p>Hey DaYm1an</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hypotactically speaking, this would be the ideal configuration you would use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/choosing-speaker-audio-output" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
speaker setting</a> you might need to change but I believe that should all take care of itself afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still having problems with this, I would suggest taking a look at the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/troubleshoot-sound" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot sound on your Xbox One console</a>, and see if can be adjusted.</p>

            Sounds like that should work. My Xbox is plugged into my tv via hdmi, but I have an optical cord running from the Xbox into my soundbar. It outputs sound to both so I just mute my tv speakers.&nbsp;

<p>You could also try buying one of those HDMI to DVi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m currently using one, but for VGA, they come with a 3.5mm jack to sound out, there a plug in my speakers, so it should be the same in your case.</p>

<p>Hi DaYm1an,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One tip I found in troubleshooting audio settings:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;If you choose the DVI TV connection setting over in&nbsp;</span><strong>Video output</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">,
 you can only get sound over optical audio, not HDMI.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 and XP on same PC</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have new HP with 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premuim.&nbsp; One important application on my older XP PC won't run on Windows 7 and&nbsp;source has no plans to issue a compatible version.&nbsp; I can keep the older PC to run this&nbsp;app but it would be better to have everything
 on one physical PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;From&nbsp;what I have read it appears either a partition on my existing drive or a second drive would be needed to install XP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing a second drive would be my preference.&nbsp; I would appreciate any suggestions or guidance on carrying out
 this&nbsp;operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Yes it can be done, however your new HP computer must have Windows XP drivers available for it so go to HP's support web site and check to see if there are XP drivers list for your specific model. If there are then see below.<br />

Windows send mi this mеssage:<br />

You can't connect to the file share because it's not secure. This share requires the obsolete SMB1 protocol, whith is umsafe and could expose your system to attack. You system requires SMB2 or higher. For more info on resolving this issue, see:<br />

<h2>            No sound on Bluetooth wireless headphones Windows 7</h2>
                    I am having trouble getting sound to my Bluetooth wireless headphones (Sony). The headphones work because I paired them successfully with my Android phone. I apparently paired them successfully with my Samsung laptop (Windows 7 home premium 64bit SP1)
 but CD's through the media player still go through the speakers or plugged-in earbuds and nothing to the headphones. The device appears in my device manager and the headphones are powered on and connected, as per the voice notification. Both the Generic Bluetooth
 Driver and the Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator are up to date and functioning properly. As per an MS Community answer, in the Bluetooth Support Services
<span>the service status is set to "started" and service type is set to "automatic". There are other suggestions on that answer page (</span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/bluetooth-not-working-on-windows-7-64-bit/50055708-ef08-494d-9115-256413c64877),

 one concerning updates&nbsp;KB3172605 and KB3161608, but I am not computer-literate<span> enough to apply the solution without clear step-by-step instructions. I have not found other articles. The headphones work neither with the Media
 Player nor through the browser with such as YouTube. Can anyone help me figure this out? Thank you.</span>

You're overthinking this problem.&nbsp; Just configure Scheduled Tasks to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/agent_notify.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
notify you of missed tasks</a> .&nbsp; If the scheduled backup date was on a weekend or holiday with the computer off, the next time you turn the computer on you will get a notification that "Some tasks did not run."&nbsp; At that point, manually start the backup task.<br />

            It might be your controller, i have dropped mine on occasion or dragged it off the desk because i forgot to take my headphones off, eventually the headphone jack just stopped working. you might need to get another controller.

                    <p>I can't seem to download the free game that came with my xbox one x (Tomb Raider). It says on the outside of the box that it is a digital download. I tried to Google it and found it should be waiting in the "Games ready to install" section, which it is not.
 Just wandering if anyone could suggest anything on here.</p>

                    I have seen posts like this, but my problem is a bit unique when compared with the others I've seen. I just got my brand new computer with Windows 8, and everything was working fine. I updated to 8.1, and double tapping the touchpad no longer works as
 a right-click. I tried going into the registry to change the values for&nbsp;<b>2FingerTapAction<span>, only to find that&nbsp;</span></b><b>2FingerTapAction</b><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">&nbsp;is

<h2>            Cannot Update to Windows 10&#33;&#33; WHY&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently on Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit, i received the notification for the upgrade (windows 10) few days back. The problem is that something called "Air Display Microsoft Corporation WDDM v1.1" is not compatible according to the scans that windows 10
 icon does. So I decided to uninstall Air display from the display manager as well as the control panel. I thought this would fix the issue but apparently it does not. I really need help, i want to get this upgrade. So if anyone has some fix please let me know</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

</p><p>I suggest you to run Windows update prior to upgrading to Windows 10. Microsoft have released driver update patches via Windows updates which helps fixes issues with drivers. If the issue persist,
I would suggest you try to download and install Windows 10 using the ISO. You may refer to the following link:</span><span>

    <title>Disable dead keys for US-International keyboard layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freeman2222  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable dead keys for US-International keyboard layout</h2>
                    Hi there!<br />
<br />
I have been using the United States-International keyboard layout (see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB 306560</a>) for a while now and there is one thing I find really annoying: The keys for the '(APOSTROPHE), "(QUOTATION MARK), `(ACCENT GRAVE), ~(TILDE) and ^(CARET) are "dead" in that layout, meaning that they don't immediately produce a character when I
 press them.<br />
<br />
I use this keyboard layout to type German text and I don't need the "dead keys" behaviour at all, because all of the German special characters (such as umlauts) can be produced by holding the right ALT key (ALTGR) while pressing another key (e.g. I can produce
 ü by pressing ALTGR+y). The dead keys can produce the same thing (e.g. pressing " followed by u produces ü) but I don't need them because I can produce them more easily otherwise.<br />
<br />
So what is so annoying about the dead keys? They interrupt the "normal" uses of the '(APOSTROPHE), "(QUOTATION MARK), `(ACCENT GRAVE), ~(TILDE) and ^(CARET) keys as you have to press SPACE to actually have them produce a character. For example, I have to press
 " followed by SPACE to produce the " character, which is really a pain if you use a lot of quotation.<br />
<br />
Therefore my question is this: Can I use the United States-International keyboard layout (see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB 306560</a>) to type German umlauts but have the '(APOSTROPHE), "(QUOTATION MARK), `(ACCENT GRAVE), ~(TILDE) and ^(CARET) keys behave as in the "US" keyboard layout, so they produce their respective characters
 immediately?<br />
<br />
If I can avoid using a 3rd-party software, that would be great. And I think I have seen somewhere that you can actually somehow "alter" an existing layout, but I haven't seen anywhere how to go about those nasty dead keys.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Chris<br />

after a lot of reading, downloading and playing with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSKLC</a>, I derived my own layout from the US-Intl layout without dead keys. If anyone is interested, I published it for download here:<br />

<h2>            Unable to log in to 1 user or create any new users Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my Windows 8.1 system to Windows 10 and all seemed fine until yesterday when I started upgrading the childrens user accounts using the family controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set up the first 2 kids no problem and profiles work fine.&nbsp; Sent an invite to the 3rd childs email address inviting them to join the family but when I then tried to log into their account to accept the invitation the login fails with the message "Profile
 service failed to load; User profile cannot be loaded".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there was nothing important on their account I thought no problem, I will delete the corrupted account and create them a new one.&nbsp; Doesn't work.&nbsp; I have set up new accounts as local accounts with and without passwords.&nbsp; Microsoft accounts using existing
 and new email addresses and every time I attempt to log in to the account I get the same "Profile service failed to load; User profile cannot be loaded" error.&nbsp; I have also attempted to create an account in a completely different name in case it links to a
 corrupted profile, same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the system file checker tool and repaired all issues but this does not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also viewed the profile keys in the registry as instructed on various websites.&nbsp; There is an entry for all the accounts that are working but not for the one that isn't and also no entry for any of the new accounts I am creating.&nbsp; Can I copy a working
 profile entry and edit it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Steven</p>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and would suggest you perform the following methods and check if that helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><span><strong>Run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)</strong> tool which fixes the Windows corruption error if there are any. Follow the steps:</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows+X</strong>.</p>

</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span><span><strong>Disable the antivirus</strong> software in your computer&nbsp; temporarily if you have any and check.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer</span></strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong></p>

<p>I have the same issue - unable to log in any new user. When I try log in I get the error message - "The user profile service service failed the sign-in. User profile cannot beloaded". Tried everything - DISM tool, malwarebites custom scan, sfc/scannow ,
 etc.. Now I tried this method 3 (enable Built-in Admin account). When I logged in to new Admin account, there was on the desktop message like this "Critical error. Cortana and start menu are not available, we try to fix it for the next signing in". I tried
 several times to sign-in but nothing was fixed and the message was the same.</p>
<p>I tried also to roll back to win 8.1, but got a message that is not possible beacuse of missing files (maybe because of system restore)</p>
<p>Eny more solutions? Clean install and losing all my working programs and files?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 completed - No change</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 completed - No change</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3 attempted - When logging into the administrator account it takes about half an hour and then fails with message that start menu and Cortana are not working and it will try to fix this next time I log in.&nbsp; The only option is to sign out.&nbsp; Logging
 in again does not fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So none of the options work and I now have the additional problem that the hidden administrator account also does not work.&nbsp; I do have access to an existing administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be informed that custom outgoing voice messages are no longer supported. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.</span></p>

            Is there any level of service that Skype provides in which I can have personalized outgoing voicemail messaging? If not, it is reason enough to leave Skype.&nbsp;
