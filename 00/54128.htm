<p>Actually, I was not trying to disable OneNote, I was trying to disable the Send To OneNote pop-up upon startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surprisingly, at&nbsp;Task Manager/Startup, disabling Sent To OneNote did not disable it - I did a full PC off and on, and there was the unwanted pop-up again.&nbsp; But back at Task Manager, under Processes, I&nbsp;selected End Task for Send to OneNote.&nbsp; One would think
 that would only end the app for the present.&nbsp; But in fact after doing this, the Send to OneNote pop-up has finally stopped showing up!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <title>GUIDE TO HOW TO PLAY CALL OF DUTY&#58; 4 SAFELY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> general extinct  say:</h3>
<h2>            GUIDE TO HOW TO PLAY CALL OF DUTY&#58; 4 SAFELY</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Hello there, For the last few days I've been playing COD: 4 and got to prestige 1 and now im trying to get to level 55 and move onto COD: WAW to prestige on it aswell. I've been playing for some time and learnt a few things. Obviously the game is full of
 cheaters/hackers. This is how to avoid problems such as the famous one (being de-ranked) and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Firsly I've found out that there is less cheaters/hackers during the mornings (from 6 -- 12 AM GBT) this is because most of the hackers are from the UK and USA. They are sleeping at this time. Stil you will find one of them once in a while.</p>
<p>- Im not sure this is just my thinking but instead of going on games with less players you should join games where there's lots of people such as Ground War. Hackers don't like to risk it there because they dont want to get reported by lots of people and
 they can get banned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- If a hacker does join and starts spamming on the top-left side of the screen. You should press the middle X on your controller and go to the dashboard. So you don't have their infection (Im not sure about this and read about doing this on one of the posts
 on this forums but still I do it to stay safe). If someone can tell me why it's recommended to do this then please tell me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- NEVER join an infected lobby, if someone sends you a message sayings "FR33 1NF3CT10N5, C0M3 J01N M4H G4M3 1T'5 0P3N!11!!!1!!". Not only you risk being de-ranked or being in a de-ranking lobby (and if you do keep reading because I've found a solution ).
 You also can be banned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-&nbsp; As I just said NEVER join an infected lobby. But still you might not even know if you are joining one. So i suggest if you ever get a random COD 4 game invite. Do not join, unless you know the person. NOT even if you played a few games with them. ONLY
 if you know them PERSONALLY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- When you join a game and there's no hackers spamming on it, stay on that one. Encourage people to stay on the lobby and if one of them goes, they could be replaced by a hacker and they would start spamming their websites and stuff. Just do what I said
 if this happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- If a de-ranking hacker joins your game and you kill someone and get - EXP you MUST inmediatly TURN YOUR XBOX OFF or GO TO THE DASHBOARD so that is not saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- NOW one of the major problems everyone is asking is how to fix the de-ranking problem. It's basically the opposite of being de-ranked. You need a hacker that can fix this. Join a game for example Team Deathmatch and if you spot a hacker send them a personal
 message asking them if they can help your un-ranked problem. If they say no, Just keep on looking you'll find one eventually. Then the hacker should invite you to a game. (I know this is going a bit against most of the things I said, but do this if you badly
 want to level up again). Now I recommend that in the game it should be just yourself and the hacker. No more people. The hacker usually changes the game a bit and spawns bots I think. Then each time you kill a bot you get +20000000 EXP a kill. Do this a few
 times until you see that you level up. There you go, your problem is fixed. I suggest that you leave after your problem is fixed so you don't get into any trouble.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading everyone and hope this helps, any questions or comments please feel free to comment, see you on LIVE!</p>

<p>[quote user="Goldy Matt"]If someone can tell me why it's recommended to do this then please tell me.[/quote]</p>
<p>this is because backing out via the start button auto saves your game and at the same time save the derank or infection to your gamertag,dashboarding does not.</p>
<p>[quote user="Goldy Matt"]TURN YOUR XBOX OFF [/quote]</p>
<p>turning off your console at the mains while the disc is spinning can damage your drive.</p>
<p>[quote user="Goldy Matt"]You need a hacker that can fix this. Join a game for example Team Deathmatch and if you spot a hacker send them a personal message asking them if they can help your un-ranked problem.[/quote]</p>
<p>sending a message to anyone asking to join a modded game,whether it is to fix your own derank or not,can result in a lifetime ban from live.</p>
<p>any participation in any modded games whether by invite or randomly joining can result in a permanent live ban if witness by xblpet.</p>

<p>Well I know I've got some points wrong. But Im just trying to put everything that I saw in these forums all togheter.1- There's quite a lot of modders from the UK and USA from what I saw. 2- Thanks 3- Alright, I diden't know that 4- I know this is not right,
 But it's for people really desperate to level up again. </p>

<p>About these infections.</p>
<p>Yesterday I joined a team deathmatch and noticed that when I was moving it was like being on an ice rink.</p>
<p>Was that an infection?</p>
<p>I immediately panicked and returned to the dashboard . What would have happened if I carried on playing?. Would the infection have been permanent? or could I have got banned.?</p>
<p>Also do all infections have those annoying spam messages coming up on the left of the screen?</p>
<p>Can I be sure that if I don't see those messages then there are no modders in the game?</p>

<p>Well, Sometimes modders do change the game settings. I recommend getting off those ones and going to look for a new game and yes I think it was. If you carried on playing I don't think nothing bad would of happened since you weren't the one breaking the
 rules but I still get out of those games. I can't wait till I reach level 55 and get my Golden guns. Then I can move on. Most of the modders advertise the websites they get infections from but some modders don't advertise so you have to be carefull always.
 If you see negative XP go to the dashboard straight away. If you don't see any messages it's usually a clean lobby (That's the nearest I can say) But there will be one or two modders maybe changing how they play themselves such as making themselves have more
 health, etc.. Just make sure that you report them if you can. If you want you can add me and we can level up togheter or something.</p>

<p>actively Participating in any modded lobbies of any kind can result in a permanent live ban,you are breaking the code of conduct by continuing.</p>
<p>[quote user="Goldy Matt"] If you don't see any messages it's usually a clean lobby [/quote]</p>
<p>the modders learned long ago that the messages were giving them away,no messages on screen does not mean its a clean lobby.</p>

<p>Theowenkiller do you play the game, You seem to know a lot of it. If you still play it can you play it with me because I just want to finish levelling up. I did not intend to do anything bad. I just wanted to help people out and make COD 4 great like it
 was again although it's not possible anymore. Sorry if I did anything bad :L</p>

<p>a good way of telling who the modders are without proof on screen is to look at their achievements for the game,you can find this via your recently played with list.</p>
<p>most of the modders have all the achievements unlocked on the same day or have gone from 0-10 prestige in one day indicated by the two 0G achievements.</p>
<p>they could also have the online achievements unlocked while offline i.e no date stamp.</p>
<p>you can report these people for system tampering.</p>
<p>edit,the 0G achievements are for world at war.</p>

    <title>Critical Process Died BSOD after &#34;PC Reset&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshsmart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical Process Died BSOD after &#34;PC Reset&#34;</h2>
                    So this BSOD isuue is almost routine at this point. From the time i finiahed my gaming beast it seems like maybe 3 months will pass before i have an issue. The first couple were my fault as i did a linux live boot and got two ssds mixed up. Then i used
 AI Suite to do an auto OC and my ayatem died about a month after. This last time before today i wanted to fix my OC from when i dropped it to run a game and right after the change, small change of a few MHz and such, the syatem cried turned blue belly up.
 My bootloader was currutped and syart up repair wouldnt fix it so i reset the pc and got nvidia driver, geforece experience, gpu tweak, Razor Synapse, steam, TES:V, WOW, curse, Adobe DC pdf viewer, and iTunes installed. I could not get my front headphones
 to play audio and thought it was due to PCI lock. With that disabled i rebooted to get my friend the BSOD. As much as i enjoy down time on my windows machine i need to get school work started. Im not sure if its ssd failure, mobo, cpu,

            The OS was super laggy and then died. I think my ssd is dead. I found an article that mentioned symptoms of bad blocks on an ssd and if you look at the big picture and not just the recent BSOD most of my random BSODS were either currupt system image, bootloader,
 or critical process died. None of them were repairable with windows tools so it seems it cojld be the drive.&nbsp;

<h2>            Circular Objects Are Now Rhombuses&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure how to explain this, but some elements that are supposed to be circles are now rhombuses. At first I thought it was just a problem on one program/device, but I later soon found out that the problem was almost everywhere. Here are some examples
 (the only examples I remember):</p>

            Hello Ryan, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor. 
<br />
<br />It seems like this is a setting issue. You might have a change in your settings in personalization on whichever website it is that this is occurring for you on. It might also be an update from the website or app itself. You should always check your personalization setting and reassure that its set to the ways you prefer.
<br />
<br />If you need more help, let me know of the website or app this is occurring on for you and id love to find out more on your issue.
<br />
<br />Thank you and good luck. Regards- Irisdiel H.

            There are no settings that allow me to change the shape of it, even though it's supposed to be a circle. On paint.net, the selection used to be a circle but changed to a rhombus, and on Discord on Edge, it was like that for forever.<br />

            Hello Ryan.
<br />
<br />For paint.net I would suggest uninstalling and reinstalling then restarting your PC as it is a Microsoft app.
<br />
<br />Just in case I recommend also running a virus scan.

    <title>Am I able to use any Windows 7 disc to perform a repair install&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeb75077  say:</h3>
<h2>            Am I able to use any Windows 7 disc to perform a repair install&#63; Is this legal&#63;</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;Moving hard drive to new hardware</div>
I built my current PC myself. It had Windows XP that I acquired as a student. Then last year I bought a retail 3-pack &nbsp;Windows 7 upgrade and upgraded the desktop and my laptop to Windows 7. &nbsp;While I was a student, I also bought a full retail version of Windows
 Vista, but I never installed it (it's still in shrink wrap).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last week my PC died - not sure what, at the very least the power supply and motherboard is gone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have ordered replacement parts to rebuild the PC, but I'm hoping I can use the same hard drive as my OS. &nbsp;In my past experience, it was never possible to move a hard drive from one computer to another and use it as boot drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I legally use my Windows 7 upgrade disk to do a repair install and will it work? Will all the defined users and their associated files still be preserved? If it won't work, I can use my Windows Vista to do a new install and then use one of the other
 licenses in the 3-pack to upgrade the Vista to Widows 7. But then I still have no idea how to recover or migrate the files on the old hard drive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of particular importance is my daughter's iTunes (she spent all her birthday money buying iTunes music), and some of my documents I created using an application called ScanSnap. I believe both these programs have some data in the %appdata% folders and
 that I cannot simply copy the files across to a new userid or harddrive.</div>

            <p>It likely won't boot on the new motherboard, which means a reinstall is required. You can do custom install with the upgrade media. The disadvantage is, you will lose a PC Authorization for your iTunes library, but you will be able to recover the iTunes
 library when you reinstall iTunes. </p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Note: When using the upgrade disc to do a clean install:</strong></p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

            That's a bit strange as Civilization V installed and is working perfectly on my Windows 10 (64 bit) computer. And I'm using the Steam version as well.

<p>Hello Juan_O789, </p>
<p>No. I can not see that choice, although it is what I read on the help page. I want that my skype number be shown when i call from skype. But I think it is not an option for my country (France).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for your answer.</p>

<p>Hi there again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you also for the reply. Only few selected countries (USA, UK, Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland) can use the Skype Number as caller ID. However, here in Skype we are doing our best just to make the caller ID to be available to all
 other countries also and it would be highly appreciated if you can send us a feedback through this link

    <title>Reattaching Surface Pen Loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lizardkingaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reattaching Surface Pen Loop</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a used keyboard cover for my Surface Pro 3. I love it and recommend to anyone. I am glad I finally found one in my price range. The downsides of buying used are obvious and in the case it is that the&nbsp;pen loop was already attached to the
 keyboard. I want to remove and reattach to the Surface, so I can&nbsp;have pen without having to have keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a recommended&nbsp;way to reattach the pen loop after removing it from the keyboard?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pen Loop's adhesive is strong, and removing it may cause damage or leave a stain on your Type Cover. Furthermore, the same adhesive strength may no longer be achieved when you reattach it to your Surface Pro 3 since it's already been used on the cover. For
 best results, we highly suggest you get a new Pen Loop at the <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pen-Loop/productID.314886000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft store</a>, or from a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further questions.<br />

            I removed mine and re-attached to a different typecover without any issues at all. Might not be the same for attaching to the Surface itself (as opposed to the typecover).

            Hi, Iván
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall entirely. You won't even need an activation number or any proof of purchase, either. Just make sure you have more than 4GB of space available, as that's how much space the file you'll download takes up. Here's how to reinstall Windows 10:

<h3> asmonky007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linksys WRT1900ac.. Nothing but problems.</h2>
                    
<p>Where do I even begin... the purchase? Linksys WRT1900.. two weeks ago.&nbsp; Just connected my 360 to it to today for the gf to watch Netflix so I could keep playing Siege open beta.. Guess who 's been on with 3 different tech supports all day and who's been
 watching it on the console that connects to Netflix...</p>

<p>Long story.&nbsp; Short version.&nbsp; Xbox 360 will not connect beyond the 'router'.&nbsp; Xb1 works just fine, the 360 doesn't affect the performance of the xb1, it runs just fine with the 360 connected to the network, it just wont go beyond there.&nbsp; Not even with the
 xb1 purged from the system.</p>
<p>Both are wireless.&nbsp; All I can find online is people having issues with the Linksys.&nbsp; Their tech support was zero help as I think they just used google and tried the basic fixes.&nbsp; Started blaming the xbox 360, which worked 2 weeks prior.. AAAANNNNDDDDD connects
 off my phone's hotspot just fine.&nbsp; Still think it's the 360? nope.. fairly certain this over priced POS that I bought (hey who doesn't want the latest and greatest when you haven't had a new router in years). Is the culprit.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Bueller? Bueller? We (Linksys tech support, Microsoft tech support, Comcast tech support) have tried various channels, broadcast modes, security settings.. you name it.. we've done it.&nbsp; Port forwards, triggers.. all the stuff that makes the magic
 happen isn't working..</p>
<p>The information I find on the router is half hate it, half love it.&nbsp; I bought it for the 'power' so to speak of the wifi.&nbsp; Needed stronger signal in parts of the house and extenders just weren't cutting it with the standard Comcast router/modem.</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain I am done with Linksys.&nbsp; I had lots of reservations about using it, and I should have gone with my gut and not the reviews I read.&nbsp; None of them addressed 'gaming' really.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So I open this up to you guys.. suggestions? Sacrifice it to the gods? Refund/Return?</p>
<p>What router would you suggest? Strong signal, able to run multiple consoles? Good tech help if needed? Works with xbox?
</p>

<p>Welp I tried OpenWRT firmware and nothing changed, leading me to believe it is in fact an issue with this router, which is odd because my issues didnt start until about 2 1/2 weeks after I installed it. It was at some point working, I even tried setting
 the 360 to DMZ and still nothing. I'm back on the linksys firmware now and cannot figure it out, Xbox one works fine, and like you said my mobile hotspot connections lets both 360s connect to everything.
</p>
<p>So I cannot download updates, connect to netflix, youtube, nothing...it connects to live, I dont play multiplayer on it so not sure that even works but I would assume it does not.</p>

<p>I've got quite the discussion going on over in the linksys forums. &nbsp;It's getting heated between an 'expert' and someone else who got into the conversation. &nbsp;They're saying it's the 360 that has issues with new gen wifi.. the guy who chimed in states that
 netgear seems to work just fine. &nbsp;I've already requested a label to ship it back and will be getting something else. &nbsp;I should NOT have to try to battle to get a very common item connected to a flagship device. &nbsp;Seriously 6+ hours trying to get it going.</p>
<p>It's a 'known' issue for the 360 s to conflict with current routers, yet other mfgs don't seem to have the issue is about all I get out of actual linksys people. &nbsp;I'm just done with them. &nbsp;I'll go back to ASUS or NetGear. &nbsp;Prices are about the same.</p>
<p>I honestly would chock it up to old tech conflicting with new tech if my smart TV's could connect. &nbsp;Sharp Aquos won't connect beyond the router either, it's not even 1yr old. &nbsp; I'm sorry but there is no support, not even a 'we are working on it.' &nbsp;The problems
 go back over a year w/ the WRT and devices not connecting. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey guys, if you're still having trouble connecting, try running a connection test and see what error you're getting. Also, in case it's caused by corrupted configuration data on the console, try clearing that and starting fresh. Go to Settings, System,
 Network, select your network, choose Configure Network, go right to Additional Settings, then Restore to factory defaults. Reboot the console, and run Test Xbox Live Connection from Network Settings and see if you're able to sign in.</p>

<h2>            Skype Video Message not available on Win 7</h2>
                    My PC is dual boot - Win 10 and Win 7. Skype on Win 10 allows video message with camera icon at bottom of page.&nbsp;Skype on Win 7 does not have the camera icon at the bottom of page. Recently I received a video call while&nbsp;on Win 7 and although the caller
 could see me, I could not see the caller. When I check video operation, it shows camera is working.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has only happened after Skype updates. Win 10 receives updates but works fine. What do I have to do to restore video message capability.

                    <i>Upgrade from 32bit to 64bit Windows 7</i>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought my lenovo N500 laptop with vista 32bit home premium shortly before windows 7 was released.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was eligible for the free upgrade program to a copy of windows 7 which i duly did, ordering a 32bit version.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have since realised that my laptop is capable of 64bit and so was wondering if it were possible to get a free upgrade to windows 7 64bit home premium?
</div>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Switch Bit Type</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>1) You'll need to use the correct bit install disk - 32 and 64bit come on a separate DVD.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>--Windows OEM from a computer manufacturer includes one bit type, if needed c</span><span>ontact the OEM computer
 manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk. Contact information for the manufacturer of your computer can be found here:

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>2) You must completely reinstall Windows when switching bit types (32/64 bit). You'll have to backup your files and reinstall all your programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>﻿3) Upgrading or simply switching between Windows 7 32/64 bit is not possible.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>4) If you are moving to 64 bit make sure your computer can run 64 bit - you can use the Upgrade Advisor to check:</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>5) Make sure 32/64 bit drivers are available for your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>6) The Windows 7 key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>7) If you want both 32 and 64 bit installed at the same time you will need two product keys.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>8) Installing the bit type you want (with a retail disk):</span></p>
<p>
<span>A. Insert the install disk, restart and boot from the DVD
</span></p>
<p>
<span>B. Click Install Now
</span></p>
<p>
<span>C. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced)
</span></p>
<p>
<span>D. Choose the partition to install Windows on</span></p>
<p>
<span>E. Continue with the install</span></p>

<span>Unless you have 4GB+ of RAM, or have programs written in 64bit, you won't notice much of a difference performance wise by installing 64bit. Make sure the computer has 32 or 64 bit drivers
 before installing the bit type you chose. Most 32 bit programs will run in Windows 64 bit.</span></p>

You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.<br />

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have in loading apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing refresh, the apps that came with your PC or you installed from
<span>Windows</span> Store will be reinstalled, but any apps you installed from other websites and DVDs will be removed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;You'll find a list of the removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC. You will not be able to restore the files, however you may download and install the apps from Windows store.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Why does Disk Clenaup say I can clean up more storage than I actually have&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So I have a first-generation Surface Pro with a 64 GB hard drive that only has about 12 GB of free space left, and I've been looking for ways to free up disk space.&nbsp; I went to Disk Cleanup when I noticed that it said I could free up to 4.00 TB of space on
 drive C.&nbsp; Looking at the categories, I noticed that it said 3.99 TB could be freed from Windows Update Cleanup alone.&nbsp;I guess my question is mostly out of curiosity, but why would it report that 4 terabytes can be cleaned up on a 64 gigabyte hard drive? Is
 this just a slightly humorous bug, or is it something that I should actually be concerned about?</p>
<p>Any insight is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks, and Merry Christmas!</p>

<h2>            Samsung Galaxy S6 not recognized, Windows cannot verify the digital signature &#40;Code 52&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>every time I connect my device to my ASUS laptop it charges but I can't transfer files. When I open the Device Manager and I double click on "MTP USB Device" (Which appears when I connect my device<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f1ebcae-ed42-48cb-b530-9e9cc1b408e4?upload=true" />),
 I get this error:</p>
<p>"Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code
 52)".</p>
<p>I tried disabling&nbsp;Driver Signature Enforcement in advanced boot option and when I connected the device, it was recognized and I was able to transfer files. Obviously after I rebooted the&nbsp;Driver Signature Enforcement was enabled again.</p>
<p>I've then tried disabling it permanently using the command "<em>bcdedit /set testsigning on</em>". This time, after rebooting I just had a watermark in at the bottom-right of my desktop and the drivers didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then created a partition and made a clean installation on windows 10. The smartphone got recognized without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make it work on my main partition without making a clean installation? This is also kind of weird because I didn't install any USB drivers manually. (I'm also not getting any updates in Windows Update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone</p>

            The WpdUpFltr is normal and the default but there could be an issue with the edevmon which relates to ESET software.
<br />
<br />Which ESET software is installed?

<br />Also, can you go to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers folder and locate the edevmon.sys.

<br />What is the "File version" and "Product version" ?

            Actually that looks normal and as such should not be an issue unless the edevmon.sys is corrupted.
<br />
<br />The edevmon.sys is a loaded driver for the phone along with the other Windows drivers and if any are corrupted could result in the "Code 52".
<br />
<br />Can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s): 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .evtx file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />

<h2>            Hipfiring crosshair... YOU SERIOUS&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just want to say I rarely come onto these forums, so making this post just shows how cheesed off I am.</p>
<p>It's hard to stay optimistic with GoW: Judgment with some of the approaches taken to cater for, let's face it, the CoD fan base, but I have managed to take a lot of new additions to the game with a pinch of salt. One thing I cannot get over is the stupid
 idea of implementing crosshairs for hipfire. The skill involved in Gears requires a player to know how to aim with the gnasher, for example, and it always has been this way since Gears 1. So why add these crosshairs now?</p>
<p>This is seriously going to impact the game, from gnasher battles to blindfiring with rifles. I mean can you imagine how much a guy taking cover and using his blindfire crosshair to pop your head from long range is going to wind you up? Without even making
 himself vulnerable? I just find that ridiculous. I understand there may be certain weapons without this crosshair, but still, My view is that they are completely unnecessary and simply destroying the learning curve which gears has always required. Am I the
 only one who thinks this!?</p>
<p>It's becoming ever so increasingly difficult to stay a loyal fan of this franchise when you are chipping away at it. Gears 1 was amazing, gritty and gory. Gears 2 was such a let down with bugs and a crappy campaign. Gears 3 was your chance at redemption
 which you achieved and have enjoyed as much as Gears 1 even to this day. Keep this ongoing achievement of customer satisfaction going. Listen to your fans before you lose a whole lot more respect from your customers.</p>

<p>Do not expect this game to play anything like the others. Just mentally block out the other three games or you will be disappointed in what Gears has become.</p>
<p>This series has been stripped and dumbed down so that the Halo and CoD players can play this.
</p>
<p>PCF and Epic know you and I and the other millions of Gears fans will buy this just because of the name so now they want the other gamers who left the series after the first was too hard for them.

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>That's true, using the D-pad is like Gears default and makes no sense for them to change it. Imagine if CoD changed their controls!? And how much hate they'd get if A became shoot and Y was jump? (Stupid controls for emphasis!) I think this is one thing
 I can come to grips with though, as annoying as it may be I find it easier to come to terms with. The hipfiring crosshair is where I drew the line at acceptance of ridiculousness</p>

<p>Wow... A friend of mine just told me that he cancelled his preorder the other day. He was on a rant about no DBNO and the changes they made with the grenades and other stuff.&nbsp;I was going to rent it&nbsp;and see if I liked what they did with it&nbsp;before I outright
 purchased it. WAS being the key word... then I found out that if you don't preorder, you miss the chance of getting a&nbsp;permanent double XP bonus and&nbsp;access to some game modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand they want to boost the bottom line and get all the preorders they can and I wouldn't mind at all if I didn't have access to a bunch of character and weapon skins if I don't preorder... but just because I want to be frugal and/or careful with
 my gaming budget and try it first, just because I'm not so sure I like what they did with the game this time,&nbsp;I now won't have access to certain game types or the ability to rank up at the same rate as others? Seriously!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually preordered every GOW game in the series... because I was looking forward to what they offered as a game and what they added to each new game... not because of what I might not get if I didn't. Looks like it won't even be staying on my rental list.
 Oh well. With Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite coming out all within a&nbsp;few weeks&nbsp;and GOW coming out right smack in the middle of them, I knew there would be one game that I probably wouldn't end up playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That decision just got easier. Tomb Raider (always wanted to try it) gets taken off the chopping block and GOW:J takes its place.&nbsp;Guess I should thank&nbsp;Epic/People Can Fail for the assist.</p>

<p>Meh... I rarely buy season passes. I'd rather choose what content I get when it's released since many times I don't play the game long enough to warrant getting the last (in some cases last couple) of map packs or w/e. Just another way for them to make more&nbsp;money
 by making me have a vested interest in getting new DLC since I already paid for it. If I decide I don't like the new content, or there are&nbsp;certain content packs I'd rather pass on for any reason,&nbsp;that's just too bad if I already purchased the season pass.
 More often than not, I come out of it saving more than I waste that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;really don't recall for certain right now, but I may have read it exactly the way you just said it anyway. Thing is, since I rarely get season passes it still pretty much pertains to me in that context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being foolish is subjective... you know the old saying about a fool and his money... I can sit back and wait to see if this game turns out to be great or a steaming pile without spending a dime. If it surprises me and actually turns out good, I can still
 get it (probably at a discount from the rental service) and the season pass as well... who knows, the season pass might be worth it by then if the discount balances it out for me? That doesn't sound foolish to me.</p>
