<h2>            Office 2016 no longer activated after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm supposed to prepare a SCCM upgrade task sequence to get all our computers upgraded to windows 10 (from windows 7).</p>
<p>I'm using SCCM 2012R2 with latest hotfixes and ADK, Windows 10 1809, Office Pro Plus 2016 with MAK licenses and windows 7 computers are up to date.</p>
<p>After tuning it, I tested it, and (almost) everything works fine.</p>
<p>Data and softwares are still there, except when I first launch an Office 2016 application, the setup pops up (I guess for an auto-repair or something).</p>
<p>Then I can launch any Office 2016 application and it will work great, except that when I open the "account" tab, it shows that Office needs to be activated.</p>
<p>Of course I tried it on various computers, I checked to see the activation status before upgrading and they were all good, but still asked for activation after.</p>
<p>I don't have any option to manually activate, and even if there was one, i'd really like to automate it, seeing that i have hundreds of computers that are gonna need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started looking for other questions about that subject, but didn't find anything I could use.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Problems Installing Office Trial on 2014 Macbook Pro Retina Laptop</h2>
                    When trying to open the downloaded installer, I receive a message stating I must change my security preferences to allow download from somewhere other than Apple store. Fine, easy enough--I do this. Then I try again to open installer and a message states
 I cannot open it without first downloading some other application...but the message does not say what this application is. I spend a half hour on hold with support and then when someone finally answers, the person tells me they can only provide support to
 people who have purchased a year subscription. The person calls me a B*@#h when I ask to speak with another person. :(

re:&nbsp; CUMIPMT<br />
<br />
I'm <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>guessing</em></span> you use the number of days as the number of periods.<br />
So, 12% loan, for 365 days for $100,000, interest paid for the first 20 days is...<br />
&nbsp; =CUMIPMT(0.0003287,365, 100000, 1, 20, 0)<br />
Returns<strong>: ( </strong>$641.26 <strong>)<br />
<br />
</strong>And not guessing, I do know that my bank calculates interest paid on savings at 1/10 of 1 percent.<strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>You seem to be laboring under the misimpression that CUMIPMT periods are necessarily monthly. That is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nper (2nd parameter) specifies the number of periods, whether they are days, weeks, months, quarters, years or whatever.&nbsp; A "period" is the time between
<p>
</p><p>StartPeriod and endPeriod (4th and 5th parameters) are the period numbers 1 through nper, in the
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">same units</span></em> as nper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important that "rate" (1st parameter) is also in the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>same units</em></span> as nper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, it is the annual rate divided by the number of such units per year.&nbsp; If the annual rate is 12%:&nbsp; 12%/365 for days, 12%/52 for weeks, 12%/12 for months, 12%/4 for quarters, and simply 12% for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, some regions calculate sub-annual rates differently, notably for EU and Canadian mortgages.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Jim's example might have been clearer (and certainly more accurate) if the first parameter were written 12%/365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I disagree with that calculation because it presumes a daily payment, part of which reduces principal and part of which reduces interest to varying degrees on a daily basis.&nbsp; I don't know of any loan that works that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, some bank-to-bank loans do work that way. I'm talking about banks that borrow millions or billions of dollars from each other for 1 to 3 days or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for us mere mortals, interest between loan payments is typically calculated based on simple interest.&nbsp; It is rarely based on compound interest. And in either case, it is based on the actual or average daily balance, not a fictitious balance that is&nbsp;infinitesimally
 reduced daily based on the actuarial method.</p>

</p><p>I believe the following demonstrates the calculation that you require. If not, please provide the details of your own example.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The amount of interest is the daily rate (B2/365) times the days between payments (A8-A7) times the previous outstanding balance (E7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Excel financial function can calculate the accumulated interest payment over multiple months, because the length of the payment period varies.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Lumia 1020 auto focus in video when used in apps... not working&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. If I want to take a video clip up close using the Nokia Lumia 1020 on WhatsApp or Skype, the auto focus just will not fire. It stays zoomed out, and is only useful for taking clips really far away. This is incredibly frustrating given that I bought this
 phone for the camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug in the phone? or is my phone broken?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto focus only works when using the actual camera app. Skype and WhatsApp seem to ignore the "auto focus" setting that I've turned on in the default camera app and the Nokia Camera app...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really disappointed. :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jez</p>

            not sure as i haven't used those apps myslef, but for example, if you use Vine, there is a setting in there that allows you to lock the focus. it appears to me that auto-focus isn't automatically enabled / enabled at all in certain apps. you will need
 to contact the developers of the apps themselves for further feedback, as this is a user to user forum only for Nokia products and services.

            <p>Hi Sonya,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The URL is essentially the full address of the website or the page in the website.&nbsp; For example, look in the upper left of the screen in the address bar and you will see:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/suggest/what-do-u-mean-url-in-one-of-the-boxes-you-ask/bf035267-bfb4-4f98-87cb-7542a62c1d57">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/suggest/what-do-u-mean-url-in-one-of-the-boxes-you-ask/bf035267-bfb4-4f98-87cb-7542a62c1d57</a>.&nbsp; That entire thing in blue or purple and that becomes a hand when you hover the mouse over it and that will take
 you to that website if you or they click on it&nbsp;is the URL for this thread you created.&nbsp; Of course, since we're already there, it would just refresh the screen in this case (or open another&nbsp;instance - depending on how you have things configured).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence the URL is the full named link you want people to click on to get to the specific webpage they are requesting or that you want them to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

            I would try going into the actual setup for the WLAN and actually entering the IP address of the WLAN, assigning an IP address to your phone, this works a treat for my N96. As I dont own a N95 I am not sure what the options are to get to this.

<h2>            n73 and &#39;sim card not valid&#39;</h2>
                    hi,
<p><br />
i searched the forum and couldn't see anything on this exact topic but am totally new so please forgive any forum faux-pas...</p>
<p><br />
i have had a nokia 6680 on the uk network 3 for 18 months. my phone allowed mms-ing and internet stuff fine, but i decided on saturday to upgrade to the n73 for the x-series deal on 3.</p>
<p><br />
my sim card is about three years old.</p>
<p><br />
when i got the phone home and charged it, it didn't quite seem right. a couple of times it would say 'sim card not valid' on start up and not boot, a few times it did boot and once i even got as far as the internet (and snake 3d). it wouldn't let me dial a
 voice call though (connection error), and if i tried to call the number from another phone came out as busy. if i tried to import the numbers i had moved to the sim card it failed with a message about the sim card (wording i forget).</p>
<p><br />
i took the phone back to the store the next day and they tried three different n73s, none of which would make a call with my sim card. they tried a motorola, ericsson and my old phone, all of which worked fine.</p>
<p><br />
[as an aside i am now worried the handset is not enabled as they gave me back the third n73, not the one that was originally aligned with my account].</p>
<p><br />
anyway, tech support called today and have agreed to send me a new sim. what worries me is that the phone did work intermittently (kind of) on saturday.</p>
<p><br />
what i am really asking is: has anyone experienced problems with the n73 and 'old' sim cards? tia!</p>

I've installed the Windows Mobile Device Center and have tried connected with the cable and the cradle and nothing is working. I can tell that some sort of a connection is being made because the computer will charge my phone... just not recognize it to sync.

<p>You are a&nbsp; brand new Insider so welcome aboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Insider group has been testing Beta releases.&nbsp; The latest Insider release 16299.15 will be released to the Public Oct 17th.&nbsp; We are now expecting our first beta release of what will become a future&nbsp; Public build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can select to join Insiders and looks like you have done this.&nbsp; You then can choose between Fast, Slow and Preview release.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you make this selection, this then becomes a waiting game.&nbsp; For the venturesome folk on Fast Lane, you should be get the
 download of the latest Insider in a few hours.&nbsp; The Slow group will not be exposed to an Insider build for some time.&nbsp; The Preview group will not be exposed for a much longer period to allow early bugs to be fixed before exposure to a group that has chosen
 to take a more cautious route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the Fast Lane and I get my Insider build immediately upon release by Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Slow Lane trails the Fast Lane and then comes Preview Release.&nbsp; All Insider builds are released to Insiders on a schedule controlled by Microsoft and cannot be
 requested outside of your chosen group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

                    I recently installed Microsoft Security Essentials, as recommended to me instead of McAfee, had&nbsp;a malware issue, supposedly resolved with malwarebytes.com.&nbsp; I have Windows XP.<br />
<br />
The real time protection on MSE keeps turning somehow turning off, I turn it back on, which takes awhile, protection shortly after goes back to off.&nbsp; I can't get even a quick scan completed.&nbsp; I do get messages about a threat (several times this week), hit clean,
 not certain it's happening giving the on/off status of protection.&nbsp; Don't know if have a virus that is keeping MSE from operating.

            It is possible real time protection will not run because of conflicts caused by remnants of McAfee or by the presence of malware. I suggest running the McAfee uninstall tool -

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps listed below and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>a. First of all connect to the
<b>Internet. <br />
</b>b. Now <b>Start RealPlayer <br />
</b>c. At the top click on <b>"Tools</b>" <br />
d. After that click "<b>Check for Updates</b>". </p>
<p><br />
5. And follow the commands on the way to <b>install the vital Updates.</b>
<br />
6. After that the <b>"Download this video"</b> button is supposed to become visible at time you watch videos with Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open your Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Tools.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Manage add-ons and change the status of 'realplayer download and record plug-in for internet explorer' into
 enable.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>: If the above steps did
 not resolve the issue then I suggest you uninstall and reinstall the Real player and check for the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            No Problems So Far, But Where Is Media Centre&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to say thanks, I have no issues using Windows 10 on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smooth transition from windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Technical Preview. All my applications worked after the upgrade, All Hardware setup straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I would love to see is the media centre &nbsp;being updated within windows 10. Please add this functionality as it will be a good thing to have built in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

this is not what I am trying to achieve -</p>
<p>I can already right click and make a selection from the drop down menu -</p>
<p>I want to make a single left click on a favorite and have it open a new tab - not replacing any existing open tab.</p>
<p>if the capability is there in the drop down menu then it should be assignable to the mouse left button as a default.</p>

            I understand what Ned is asking for. Although the wheel click works, it would be nice to see this added as a setting under the "Tabs" menu in IE. Something like.... "open all links and favorites in new tab".

            Yes I agree. In some mice, the middle mouse button is stiff and not convenient to use for this purpose. The control button + left click does work, but browsing the internet becomes a 2 hand job. Cant understand why such a simple task as opening favorites
 in a new tab does not have the logical option of simply clicking on the link to do that.

            <p>^Agreed.....this in my opinion is a no brainer, that function should be there.</p>
<p>One shouldn't have to keep doing this *monkey motion* to open a fresh bookmark in a new tab window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature is in both Firefox &amp; Opera,..... why can't Microsoft do the same for their browser to make it more user friendly?</p>

            Dragging &amp; dropping is not really a solution to the situation,<br />
<br />
when one has the dropdown Favorites open, one wants to left click on any given bookmark and have THAT bookmark open in a new tab and NOT have the current tab be closed and replaced by the new tab. The open tabs should accumulate in the tab bar from left to
 right. <br />

            Turn off the fast start under power settings and see if the problem is resolved, as I found the so called fast start has caused issues with my systems, and the problem is everytime a new build comes out MS turns it back on.

<h2>            how to I set a column width to exact size in inches</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to recreate a table my boss gave me, so I know I need a certain column to be an exact size&nbsp;- say 2".&nbsp; I cannot figure out how to make my column(s) a size in
<strong>inches.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I could do it on the home tab, format, then column width, but that lets me put in a number -- but I'm not sure what format that number is in (inches, millimeters, etc).&nbsp; But it definitely is not in inches because I tried
 that and the column came out tiny.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to do this?&nbsp; Set columns and rows to inches?</p>
<p>

            As I understand your mails sent from your account (@outlook.com or @hotmail.com) are classified as a spam by your recipients' mail system. The problem has nothing with Outlook Mail/Outlook.com.&nbsp;Maybe your contact should add your address to the white list
 of safe senders.&nbsp;

<h2>            SMTP relay through Office 365 from on-prem to internet problem with internal users</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I'm having challenges understanding why e-mails won't relay between internal user mailboxes (setup on Exchange Online)
 using the xxx.mail.protection.outlook.com endpoint from an on-premises IIS SMTP server to O365. We have a connector setup to allow mail from the external IP, the smart host points to the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">xxx.mail.protection.outlook.com
 on port 25, is set to anonymous authentication and TLS encryption. I can submit e-mails through the relay from mailboxes on the domain to external recipients, and I can even submit e-mails through the relay on the domain from users without mailboxes to other
 users with mailboxes on the same domain. But what I cannot do is submit e-mails from a user with a mailbox to another user with a mailbox on the same domain. So for example, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** assuming both users have mailboxes. This always
 goes to badmail with the following response:&nbsp;<strong>smtp;554 5.2.0 STOREDRV.Submission.Exception:SendAsDeniedException.MapiExceptionSendAsDenied; Failed to process message due to a permanent exception with message Cannot submit message</strong>.
 We need to allow messages to be routed between users, DL's, etc. on the same domain through the relay. Hopefully I'm just missing a piece of the puzzle here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
The main reason for this configuration is because there are internal applications that are configured to send through this SMTP server that cannot be changed. Formerly it was relaying through an internal Exchange 2010 server. However a migration from Exchange
 2010 to Office 365 just occurred which prompted the update of the smart host on the internal server. But now most of the applications that send mail don't work because either they are sending mail to/from the same e-mail address, or they are sending mail to/from
 users on our domain and those are always being denied with the exception above.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Thanks in advance.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the MX record for the domain is the same record as we are using for the SMTP relay smart host -&nbsp;&lt;domain&gt;.mail.protection.outlook.com. This domain is NOT listed in the accepted domains. However, there is a xxx.mail.onmicrosoft.com in accepted domains that
 is currently set to authoritative. Are you suggesting we need to update that entry or add the mail.protection.outlook.com domain? The portal says it has to be done with the Office 365 admin. Or are we pointing to the wrong SMTP server on the O365 side?<br />
<br />
Both boxes do reside on O365. The MX record is setup properly as well and as I mentioned above points to&nbsp;&lt;domain&gt;.mail.protection.outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your suggestion on Option 3 - this is how we are setup with the exception of setting an authentication method. We're currently using anonymous because we've configured the connector to allow mail from the external IP of the internal SMTP server.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>From your information, the MX record is correct. Please just check the <span style="font-style: italic">
domain.com</span> you mentioned above (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) in the EAC to check it and it's my fault to make this mistake.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Again I appreciate the help! So in this particular case what we have is a domain.com and user1 and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** would be considered the usernames for the O365 mail accounts. The internal SMTP server has no accounts - it's just a dummy virtual server
 that does nothing more than relay mail to O365 through the mx record host.<br />
<br />
There's one catch. Even though all the accounts are based on domain.com, all the accounts have a domain.gov alias. So there also exists *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. And typically users use this domain as their primary e-mail address. So when e-mails
 are being relayed, typically it's *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. But these are configured as valid aliases on each user.<br />
<br />
Both domain.com and domain.gov exist as domains in the EAC accepted domains and both as set to authoritative.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
One more thing I'm testing behind the scenes is I've been sending e-mails directly to the O365 SMTP server over a telnet session between these two users in an attempt to understand if it's really a relay issue or if there is something else going on. I just
 did a test a few moments ago between those two users and at least on the surface the mail appeared to be accepted. I'm waiting to hear back from the user to see if they actually received the e-mail or if it bounced.<br />
<br />
I'll update once I have that result.</p>

<p>Hi Geraldine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would need to know more about the issue you are having with receiving emails. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using an Outlook app, Outlook.com, or Windows 10 Mail app?</li><li>If you are using an Outlook app, <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">what version of Outlook are you
 using</a></strong>?</li><li>What error message does the sender get when he is trying to send an email to you?</li><li>Are you using a work or personal email?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using an Outlook app, I suggest adding the sender to your Safe Senders List. To do so, visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Block-a-mail-sender-B29FD867-CAC9-40D8-AED1-659E06A706E4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and then follow the steps under

<p>Thanks for replying Darleen. I'm using just normal outlook.com on my PC. I will call the sender and ask what error message it is and get an exact email address from them and add it to safe senders, as you suggest.</p>

                    <p>My Apple ID is set up for two factor authentication. When I attempt to add this ID as an iCloud email account, Outlook on my iPhone reports an error. One of the suggested fixes is to create an app-specific password for Outlook. I tried that and I got the
 same error. Attached is a screen shot from my iPhone with the suggestions that Outlook is displaying to try to resolve this. None of these suggestions work.</p>

 I did that on a document, and it shows up under my sisters name. If I close the document, and look at the "home" part of Office365, it says "Good morning, (my name), but recognizes me as my sister when I try to open my own documents. Could somebody please

                    <p>I'm using MS Office 365, and Powerpoint 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 JPGs and 1 drawn rectangle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to group 1 JPG + drawn rectangle as a unit to move around into different positions. &nbsp;Then I want to group that together with the other 1 JPG in various configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work with older powerpoints (2013 for sure was OK), quite easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I group together the 1JPG+rectangle fine. &nbsp;Then I try to group that with the 1JPG and it won't give me the Group option, and only gives me the Ungroup option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ungroup the original 1JPG+rectangle, and then select all 3 together (1JPG+rectangle+1JPG) and I don't get the Group option either, but only the Regroup option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is idiotic. &nbsp;Please give me the old powerpoint back. &nbsp;I'd rather use 2013.</p>

            <p>I think John's nailed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the JPG that won't group with the other shapes, press Ctrl+C to copy it to the clipboard.&nbsp; Then on the Home tab, click the triangle under Paste, choose Paste Special and choose either JPG or PNG as the type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try grouping the newly pasted image with the others.&nbsp; It should work.&nbsp; If so, delete the other one that won't work (I'm betting that when you delete it, the original "Click here" placeholder will appear; if so, delete that too).</p>
