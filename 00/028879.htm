<h2>            Problems with my C5-03</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I bought Nokia C5-03 some months ago and i have 4 problems:</p>
<p>1) sometimes it switches off by itself, for example when i am listening to the radio</p>
<p>2) it hangs up (freezes)&nbsp; time by time - then i have to press the red power button to turn it off and after turning it on, it works fine</p>
<p>3) sometimes, when i plug in the headphones (nokia original ones) phone does not react on it and i have to turn off/on the phone to be able to use those headphones</p>
<p>4) sometimes, when i answer an incoming call, i can not hear my phonecall partner, then i have to switch off/on the phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to fix those errors?</p>

            I have W10M on a Lumia 650. When texts are sent to me, the names of the person (or persons) are plainly listed above the texts. If you replied to a text intended for you and&nbsp;others, the reply went to everyone. If you want to reply to one person of the
 group, you would need to make a new text.

            This sounds like one of those qwerks that would annoy me greatly. However, on my phone I see the group of people listed above the text conversation. If I tap on the group of people it opens a list. Of course I always have to go tap tap tap tap tap tap
 until my phone registers what i'm trying to do. Maybe the "clickable" area is too small

                    <div>I have a table in my Word document. When I highlight one of the columns toward the end and specify that I want to change the width from .68 to .60 all of the rows in this column resize but one. When I click back down through the other rows I just resized
 I see under Table Tools &gt; Layout that they are now .60. However, when I click on the row that wouldn't resize it doesn't give any size at all for width. I turned on the function that shows paragraph/formatting but nothing appears to be in the cell. At one
 point I autofit'd the table to the window so I could stretch from margin to margin, but I have since turned that off (I'm not even sure if that was the problem). Here is a link to show the example:</div>

    <title>Inserting jpg images in Word 2010 - strange problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> biotechjen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting jpg images in Word 2010 - strange problem</h2>
                    I have a routine set of tasks that I follow on a regular basis to insert a scanned image into a Word file in preparation for creating a clean PDF.<br />
<br />
I scan the page to jpg (high resolution) and email it to myself from the scanner, then save it to my drive. I open the Word 2010 file and insert the jpg (using the keyboard shortcut, Alt+I, P, F), then I set the image to be in front of the text and crop it
 to match the underlying text. Finally I drag the image so it sits in approximately the same place as the underlying text. Thus I am "replacing" the Word document text with my image.
<br />
<br />
My problem is this: most of the time, when I go to crop and move the image, it behaves as "normal" for 2010 - that is, I can see the underlying text so it's easy to match up the text with the scanned image. However, maybe 10% of the time the image behaves as
 I would expect for an older image in Word - it's just a block that I have to move blindly, without seeing anything behind it. I know this seems like a trivial difference, but it makes a big difference for what I'm doing and is a huge pain.<br />
<br />
For the life of me I can't figure out why it's different. I am ALWAYS inserting the image the same way (using the keyboard shortcut), and I have a preset on the scanner so it ALWAYS scans with exactly the same settings. I am pretty sure this isn't a scanner
 problem, because of the presets and also because I've seen the same issue when using a different scanner. Once I even scanned two documents in succession, and the first worked fine and the second reverted back to the "old" behaviour! Almost all my documents
 are created in Word 2010; occasionally one is a .doc file, but this doesn't seem to have any correlation to the problem.
<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions for what could cause this, I would be most grateful as I'd love to sort it out! Though it's a relatively small issue, I think most of us who work with Word a lot know that sometimes it's these trivial issues that can drive us completely
 BONKERS!! <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jen <br />

            Thanks Doug. I don't see that command on my ribbon, but I tried Recolor --&gt; Set Transparent Color - is that the same thing? Unfortunately that doesn't work, because I want the image to sit over top of the existing text in the document; that command makes
 the text underneath visible. <br />
<br />
Essentially, I am trying to insert a scanned signature page over top of the same section of the Word document.

<p>With the free PrimoPDF, you can append one pdf to another if you assign the same filename to it.</p>

            Thanks (and sorry for my delayed reply). We do have reasons for doing it this way - it makes for a much better quality result since we're starting with scanned pages. This way only the signatures are from the scanned document, instead of the whole page
 (the typed text doesn't ever look as good in the scan). Plus, we sometimes have to combine info from multiple signature pages into one compiled PDF. I do have the full version of Acrobat and can do it there, but it still doesn't address the underlying problem:
 when two images are created and inserted in exactly the same way, why don't they behave the same way in Word? I am totally puzzled as to why this would happen.

<h2>            Unable to share OneNote Notebook with coworkers via OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>My coworkers and I all have Rocketbooks and we utilize OneNote to compile our client data. We have OneDrive accounts but when I try to share my Notebook with them I receive the following error messages:</p>
<p>

<p>Status shows as "Failed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to share via Desktop OneNote:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Kindly send us a screenshot of the concern for both OneNote online and desktop so we can have a better understanding of the issue.</p>

            Have you tried to sign-out and sign-in to OneNote for both the app and the online version? If you haven't, please do so. Please also check if this happening to other Notebooks, if yes, please backup all these Notebooks, then you can delete them and load
 them back again and try to share the Notebook again and check if the issue has been solved.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have other concerns.<br />

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your response. I logged out of my account online and on my OneNote desktop. I then logged them both back in and was still unable to share them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only notebook I share so I am unsure if this is happening to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed up the Notebook, closed it and then reopened it and tried to share via the desktop. It still would not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also completely deleted the online Notebook and then restored it and tried again. I received the same error message as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            It seems that we have exhausted resolving OneNote but the issue is still happening. I can suggest that this issue could be cause by OneDrive. There is a free technical support available through accessing Onedrive online.
<strong>Click</strong> the help icon(<strong>?</strong>) on the upper right . Select
<strong>Email OneDrive support,</strong> then submit your concern and follow through the instructions to request for support.<br />
<br />
If you have other queries, let us know.<br />

<p>No one needs OneDrive 😋 </p>
<p>They need <strong>access </strong>to OneDrive with any browser.</p>
<p>Your problem is shown here:</p>

<p>So why don't you use the alternative to get a hyperlink and send it manually to your people ?</p>

<p>Hi Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this as well. Giving them access to the link only allows them to view the Shared OneNote via the online OneNote version. It will not allow them to merge the Shared OneNote with their current OneNote Notebooks. Also, the Online version will not allow
 them to set a Notebook up as a location for their Rocketbook app to send notes; which was the whole purpose of the Rocketbooks and the Shared Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am discussing getting Office365 for our small business to see if this will resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your responses!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the PC recognise the device when you connect it? Have you tried to use a different USB port on your PC(preferably a port at the back)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you connect the device, the software should recognise the device, and it will either automatically sync or you can drag and drop items to the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the computer and software do not recognise the device when its connected, please do the troubleshooting steps contained in this article:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to install the latest three builds but each time it freezes at 97%! &nbsp;The latest build I re-installed Windows 10 and then tried again but the same result. &nbsp;I'm not sure what else I can do...it just doesn't want to install. &nbsp;Before the last

<h2>            Excel - RGB Colours</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way - if you find a colour&nbsp;on the internet ie a picture or something with colour to find out what RGB values&nbsp;are&nbsp;so you can replicate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is to capture the RGB value from any type of colour from various sources and work out what the RGB values are so I can use the colour in something else ie colour of a cell in excel to match the exact colour of the object that I have found
 in a picture or over the internet.</p>

<br />Is there a way - if you find a colour on the internet ie a picture or something with colour to find out what RGB values are so you can replicate them.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />There are lots of free utilities that enable capturing the color values - both web based and desktop programs. Just do a search using the words "color picker" / "free color picker programs" (or any variation thereof)
<br />
<br />One such tool (among the many available) to get you started is 
<br />
<br />Colorcopy

            All what you need is your PC, do as follows:
<br />
<br />Open the program "Snipping Tool" that is already on your PC.
<br />Click the "New" button and make a screenshot from whatever you want.
<br />Open the program "Paint" that is already on your PC.
<br />Paste the screenshot into Paint.
<br />Use the Color Picker and pick a color you like, e.g. the blue from this website, see screen shot below.
<br />Now click the "Edit colors" button on the right of the ribbon
<br />You'll see Red 0 Green 103 Blue 184

<h2>            hotmail account- security overload</h2>
                    Each time I try to log into my hotmail account from a foreign device, I am asked to verify that I am the account owner by way of security code to my mobile. This can be very annoying, especially when you are travelling and your mobile might not be working.
 How can I stop this? Thanks for your help

    <title>My account is blocked... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathonsd  say:</h3>
<h2>            My account is blocked...</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I just want to start by saying I am extremely frustrated. Since I first made my account, I've had problems ever since. Never known anything like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now and then, I'd get a message saying I need to send a verification code to my phone number. So, I ALWAYS went ahead and did just that. This isn't the first time I was asked too. I got it regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried logging into my account and apparently someone may be trying to access my account (which I very much doubt). I went ahead and tried to recover my account by entering some information in (my zipcode, skype info, etc), and it sent me an email
 to my other email address telling me that it may take up to 24 hours to verify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now getting an email saying that the information I have provided is not good enough. I have a lot of personal information and emails that I NEED access to. I just really don't have time to be messing around with this kind of stuff. I just don't understand
 why I can't enter my phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I could change all my website accounts to a new email, but most of send a confirmation email to make changes. And I'm guessing I can't access my onedrive too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully understand that Microsoft takes security very seriously, but when you can't access your own account, there's a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really sorry for going on. I'm just very frustrated. I've tried every way to recover my account, so I'd appreciate it if someone could give me a serious alternative. I could provide more details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jonathon</p>

You mention your currently block account has a security phone number that get's you a security code before. Can you not use that old phone number to get a security code to get your account back?

            <p>Hi Duncan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to help, but I'm not sure I fully understand the question.&nbsp; We have two kinds of ways to share, just a link or an embed.&nbsp; If you send the link to someone else, when they follow it, the Sway will open in their browser.&nbsp; To use an embed code, you
 need to put that into the HTML of a page and the Sway will display as a part of the page.&nbsp; It sounds to like you want to do the latter.&nbsp; I don't believe Outlook allows you to embed iframes into email as they are a security risk.&nbsp; It's possible other email
 clients do (you would need to use a program that lets you directly edit the HTML of the message and then paste the embed code there), but I'm not sure the email clients of people you are sending the mail to would load the iframe due to security reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason</p>

<p>Hi Jacqueline,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What type of embedding are you referring to?&nbsp; Usually Sways are embedded via iframes and from a quick Internet search, it looks like Mailchim and Typeform do not support that.&nbsp; I suspect they allow you to export your content into an HTML format and then
 they stick that into the email.&nbsp; Sway does allow export in this manner, but it loses much of the capability of the original Sway.&nbsp; You can try it out by opening your Sway and clicking ... | Export, choosing Word, and copying that content into a mail.</p>
<p>

            I should have been clearer.&nbsp;Our company would like to send mass emails from sway or forms that do not require the recipient to click on a link to view the newsletter or survey.&nbsp; When I have researched adding iframes to outlook emails, I've heard that more
 times than not the email will only contain&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;in the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Single Sign-on problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnwbroderick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Single Sign-on problems</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 computers for work: a laptop with Win 7 and IE9 and a Surface Pro 3 with Win 8.1 and IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, (after last MS update?) I was having problems with single sign-on accessing my SharePoint sites. I had to keep authenticating almost every time I checked a file in or out, and sometimes when just reading a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my laptop I installed a program "IE Settings" from Microsoft System Center (do not know if this is a standard MS file or something my agency created). That fixed the problem on the laptop. Unfortunately, the file was not compatible with Win 8.1 (my agency
 does not fully support Win 8.1, I am a guinea pig).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? If it requires Admin access what should I tell my support guy?</p>

<p>Hi Novosti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the <strong>Calendar Printing Assist</strong> in order to print your calendars in all the layouts that you'd like in Outlook 2013. Click
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to download this free tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to clarify if you're using an Outlook 2013 32-bit version or 64-bit version? Note that the Calendar Printing Assist will only work with the 32-bit version. If you receive an error message when installing this tool, refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2898576/-setup-cannot-complete-error-message-when-you-try-to-install-the-calen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> and follow the steps provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give us an update on the result and we'll be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>Thanks Joan</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a 64 bit OS, but a 32 bit Outlook. I ran the "MicrosoftEasyFix20118.mini" then installed "CalendarPrintAssistant" then ran "MicrosoftEasyFix20116.mini" as instructed, but when I open calendar Print assistant, there's an error message [see attached
 picture].How can I deal with this problem?</p>

<p>We'd like to know if you were able to follow the steps in the article provided above with the workaround on the<em><strong>&nbsp;Method 2: Let me fix it myself</strong></em> section before installing the program. If not, we suggest that you uninstall the Calendar
 Printing Assist, follow the workaround, and then proceed to reinstall the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were able to follow the workaround and is still getting this issue, please check the troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the&nbsp;Calendar Printing Assist icon from the Start menu and select
<strong>Open File Location</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on the&nbsp;Calendar Printing Assist shortcut in the File dialog and choose<strong> Troubleshoot compatibility</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot program</strong> from the popup window.</li><li>Check <strong>The program worked in earlier versions...</strong> box and press
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Pick <strong>Windows 10</strong> from the list box and press <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>On the next screen, click<strong> Test the program...</strong> button.</li><li>After it starts up, both the&nbsp;Calendar Printing Assist and Outlook should be working again.</li></ol>

I convinced the teamto take the E1 Plan for NPOs in favour of Google for Non-Profits; not they are all on my neck simply because they cannot print overlay calendars, lol.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34c13e96-288b-4e1c-a178-3439103962cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34c13e96-288b-4e1c-a178-3439103962cb" /></a></p>

                    The initial problem was Outlook 2007 would not save network password (using Windows 7 home premium edition).&nbsp; What I noticed was that for some reason my server address changed in Outlook but not my service provider (Cox Communication).&nbsp; I was able to access
 my webmail, but email via Outlook after the last major batch of updates.&nbsp; My email accounts are set up as POP3:&nbsp; pop.west.cox.net (110),&nbsp; SMTP:&nbsp; smpt.west.cox.net (25) for Cox Communication.&nbsp; After that last great batch of updates, my settings somehow changed
 to pop.cox.net which was the reason the password would never save.&nbsp; Now, I went to control panel to set everything everything in mail account to correspond with my ISP, now I am getting this error code.&nbsp; I will send a test message, but the server will not
 accept it. &nbsp;

<h2>            Merge two Microsoft Accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When we first set up a "Microsoft Account" you could only do it via Hotmail.com, that is how long ago it was... Now we have Microsoft Accounts created to mirror local users on our little "family network" that runs on a router with a tiny UNIX kernel that
 manages security of a NAS drive, and provides wired and wireless network support for our household devices, computers, phones, etc., etc.&nbsp; Unfortunately as those accounts got set up, the administrative requirements have changed.&nbsp; Now, the "master account"
 we would like to use is not the one which owns a current Office 355 subscription for us.&nbsp; Why can't Microsoft get its' act together and think through how this process can be managed instead of assuming everybody in the world has to throw everything away and
 start over to get a new structure?</p>

<p>Hello Dan,<br />
<br />
This is interesting. You should be able to manage the email account for the Office 365. It can sometimes get confusing which account is which but you certainly can.

<p>you need to set up a mail for exchange account on the n8 rather than a gmail one (because the gmail account only supports e-mails, not calendar/contact syncing)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with that you can sync your calendar and/or contacts and it seems to work well for those, even tho' it keeps giving connection error messages (not sure if that part is just me)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you'll still need the gmail account as well tho' if you want to also use the e-mail functionality, because the mfe is broken and can't handle them</p>

Taking the advice of the suggested article, I've checked Disable script debugging. I noticed that that box was already checked on two other computers in our house, and that they never have this issue. We'll see how this works. Thanks.

<p>Hi&nbsp;AppleKa1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking on your account associated with the email address you used to sign in to Microsoft community, I noticed that there's no CALLER ID set up on it. There are changes that has been made on the telephone providers and they requires CALLER ID for
 incoming calls from VOIP applications such as Skype. I would suggest to set up a caller id and you may follow the steps provided on this link:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248</p>
<p>
