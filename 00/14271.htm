    <title>Logo image in email signature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logo image in email signature</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have read through so many threads and answers about being able to insert a logo/image into an email signature and have tried so many things, but still it is not working for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two main answers I have tried:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uploading image to web and pasting it from url to sig</p>
<p>2. Sending sig in an email to OWA and pasting it from email to sig</p>
<p>In both these cases, I see the image when I paste it and and save it, and when I open a new message it is there. When I send a test, it's not visible, just the box around it; when I close the browser window and reopen, and then open a new message, the logo
 is not there, just the red X or box around it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens in both IE and Chrome.</p>
<p>If there is a way around this, please let me know. I'm looking for troubleshooting options. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Tiffany,</p>
<p>The workaround you provided always doesn’t work because OWA does not support adding a signature which includes pictures.</p>
<p>Given this situation, I recommend you submit feedback to our related team via <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar</a>.</p>
<p>Many features have been designed or upgraded based on customers’ valuable advice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are using the Outlook desktop client, I suggest you insert a picture to the signature .</p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I heard the same workarounds and that ain't working with OWA.</p>
<p>The below workaround may be irrelevant to this post, but it suits my needs.</p>
<p>I need add an image that goes out from my organization. Since the signature does not work. I add a disclaimer rule within which I can place an image using html code. And it works fine.</p>
<p>Step 1: create a rule for disclaimer.</p>
<p>step 2: In the message part of discaimer,</p>
<p>Append the small html code for image: &lt;IMG src="<a href="https://domain.org/picture/logo.svg&quot;&gt;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">domain.org/.../logo.svg"&gt;</a></p>
<p>It will append the image at the end of email/conversation.</p>
<p>note: URL is the same as workaround no:1.</p>
<p>"These two main answers I have tried: </p>
<p>1. Uploading image to web and pasting it from url to sig"</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Thank you for posting at the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that I know I'm afraid. Wi-fi connection is needed for updates on Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to update it when you are on a free hotspot, if you have no wi-fi yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel 2007 losing comments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thursten4moore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 losing comments</h2>
                    <p>In the last few months some of the comments in my spreadsheet have disappeared. They are not just 'hidden' they no longer exist in the spreadsheet. Some comments are still there. Any way to prevent this from happening (or fix this)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PC Technical details</strong></p>
<p>Windows 7 Pro SP1 64-bit</p>
<p>RAM = 16 Gb</p>
<p>CPU = 3.80 GHz Intel Core i7-3820</p>
<p>Hard drive = 2 Tb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Excel Technical details</strong></p>
<p>Excel 2007</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spreadsheet details</strong></p>
<p>26,789 rows</p>
<p>10&nbsp;columns</p>
<p>The spreadsheet is NOT shared.&nbsp;It sits on my personal PC at home and I am the ONLY one that uses it.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet is not used for any major types of calculations. It is a simple tracking spreadsheet that has rows of data that I can sort, filter, etc.</p>
<p>There are NO calculation formulas in the cells.</p>
<p>The only expressions / formulas in the spreadsheet are the ones used in the Conditional Formatting to set the highlight colors of cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using this spreadsheet for several years (maybe 5) and I just noticed this in the last few weeks - since just after the beginning of 2013. That doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't happening before, but in the last month or so I noticed it because
 a LARGE number of the comments no longer exist in the spreadsheet. For some of them they were obvious and were easy to add again. For others, they are gone forever because I don't remember what it was that I added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>No, that post doesn't help -&nbsp;that was a post I read when I was doing some prior research on this issue. There are MANY posts like that about this issue on various forums. As far as I can tell, most all of them involve spreadsheets that are shared, and the
 replies almost always mention that shared spreadsheets have problems and this losing of comments might be one of those problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that's why I specifically mentioned in&nbsp;the original post that the spreadsheet was NOT shared. This spreadsheet is used ONLY by me and ONLY on my local home PC, and so sharing - as far as I can tell - has nothing to do with the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, related to the referenced post, I tried the 'solution' that was posted. Although the grammar in that other post is pretty poor, I think I figured out what the poster was trying to say. Essentially he was saying (I think) that the comments were not
 deleted they were just 'hidden' and his 'solution' was supposed to be a way to 'show' them again. I tried that 'solution' and it provided no help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that's also why I specifically stated in the original post that the comments were NOT 'hidden' - they simply don't exist in the spreadsheet any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like no one knows why this is happening or what the fix is, so that's why I posted here with the details I provided. I thought maybe this forum would have some individuals who might have run across the real reason for this or at least a real solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any additional thoughts on this? It seems to be a strange and obscure defect in Excel.</p>

            I have just started having the same problem. One thing to try: after entering the comment, to complete the entry, click on the cell that that comment applies to rather than anywhere else. This seemed to work for me, but I'll let you know if they disappear
 again.

            <p>The technique described in your post is something I typically do. Not all the time, but usually. I have not found any correlation between the comments lost from cells that I use that technique and comments lost in cells that I use a different technique,
 such as clicking on a cell different from the one that has the comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that might be relevant - so any comments on this would be appreciated if you have additional information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I typically have left the spreadsheet open all the time because I use it EVERY day, several times a day. I also don't shut down my PC every day - I restart very infrequently because&nbsp;Windows Update generally will download updates (scheduled each&nbsp;night at
 3:00 AM)&nbsp;and many times will perform a restart after the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, when the restart occurs and the spreadsheet is open, Windows will often "remember" that Excel was&nbsp;running with an open spreadsheet, and Windows will restart Excel and then Excel will open the "auto-recovery" copy of the spreadsheet. Of course, I save
 the spreadsheet after almost every keystroke (I'm pretty obsessive about saving my work having had many bad experiences with that many years ago). So the spreadsheet always is in a 'saved' state, but Excel opens the 'auto-recovery' copy anyway. When I see
 the next day that a restart has occurred, I always just save the file again and Excel then just deletes the auto-recovery copy and uses the original file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I was thinking that the restart and auto-recovery sequence might have something to do with losing comments (who knows - but it's worth looking into). So now, instead of leaving the spreadsheet open all the time, I open it, do what I need, and then
 close it. So I never have the spreadsheet open overnight anymore. I have noticed that I am no longer losing comments. Granted, I have been doing this only for a week or so, ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this - whether this restart and auto-recovery might have a bug where the comments are not being saved properly and so they are lost when the auto-recovery file is used?</p>

            It's definitely nothing to do with restart. &nbsp;I was entering some comments yesterday, saving and closing the spreadsheet, reopening and finding some of the comments had saved and some hadn't. There was no restart in between.
<div><br />
<div>I also think that when I re-entered the missing ones and repeated the process, one of the comments that had previously saved, had then disappeared. I can't swear to having entered that comment followed by a click on the cell, but anyway I re-entered it
 that way and saved it. &nbsp;This morning all the comments entered yesterday are still there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So who knows. I too think that the click on cell action is unlikely to be the answer, but I thought I'd mention it. Whatever the cause, something is deleting comments and I hope someone at Microsoft has the answer as it's very annoying.</div>

            I am having the same trouble. As i save and it auto-recovers, no matter if i close it down and reopen. Slowly eating comments out of my spreadsheet. I NEVER had this problem with older windows OS and older MS office pro.

            <p>This is really annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have company purchase&nbsp;orders on spread sheets and insert comments as to what the purchase was for.&nbsp; Each year I add another tab and carry on the process.&nbsp; I have found that on my 2014 spread sheet, every comment has disappeared.
 All other spread sheet comments are still there, right back to 2009.&nbsp; They just happen to be all in column D, not that, that is of any significance.&nbsp; This happened once a couple of months ago, and again two days ago.&nbsp; I caught this one quite quickly and was
 able to right click&gt;properties&gt;previous versions - and go back a couple of days, open the spread sheet and there they were.&nbsp; I saved it as Version 2, highlighted the 2014 column D and copied/pasted into the current spread sheet, which saved me having to go
 back and try to back fill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why this happens, or why it is only on the one spread sheet tab.&nbsp; Just glad I caught it this time.&nbsp; Hopefully the fix might help someone.</p>

</p><p>I'm not sure you are talking about Outlook, as in the program itself. You control what people see in Outlook (app/client) by clicking<em><strong>File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Account Settings</strong></em>, double-clicking your account, and specifying your display
 name there. If you are using a mailbox supplied by your employer, however, you may not have control over what others see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are talking about Outlook.com (one that you use a web browser), then you can control what other see by logging into&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://account.microsoft.com/</span></a>&nbsp;and

<h2>            Some Issues Concerning with Windows 10 TP</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I would like to welcome all who are working on improving W10 TP and to those who are using it like myself.</p>
<p>I have noticed a couple of problems/glitches from the time I have used windows 10 till the latest stable build 9879. I am not sure if anyone has experienced the same problems I have right now.</p>
<p>But first I will give some info about my laptop: Nvidia graphics GTX850m with intel HD graphics 4600, 16GB ram. upgraded from windows 8.1 to W10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem is when you set up desktop background to refresh for a given time interval to other pictures, the problem is when you open a folder containing list that you need to scroll down to see the last item, however when the refresh happens, there
 will be a mini freeze and the scroll will go up automatically. Also I remember I had to set desktop background to one slide in order not to switch because it caused lag in Microsoft word. This is one way I found to avoid the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem which is probably known, after leaving your computer on for some while, windows explorer start to freeze and computers lags making it too slow to even open a folder. Even restarting windows explorer will not work. One way to solve it is
 to restart. Though this does not happen every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third problem is concerning graphics card, I know it is a technical preview so gaming will not be that great. After seeing some solutions and testing it on my laptop, non had worked, until one month later, I have installed a game in compatibility mode
 windows 8, everything worked well. Sadly I could not stop myself from updating to latest PhysX which made everything not working again. I tried to repeat but this time it nothing work, until recently I noticed something by accident, that when both graphics
 are working some games like Batman Akham City works well and some small flash games like The Binding of Isaac. However, some games like Gary's mod and FlatOut Ultimate Carnage and FIFA14 do not work when both are on, even closing intel driver shows no sign.
 But disabling Nvidia driver, games worked but of course it is slow and must set to very low quality graphics. I have tried to solve it but failed so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading, I am just posting this to help others who have the same problems and for others to fix this problem if it was there.</p>

            <p>Hi Amro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how it feels when things do not work as they are supposed to work. I tried to reproduce the issue which you have mentioned. I did not face the first issue, for me everything was working fine. You could face the first issue due to corrupt system
 files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second issue which you have mentioned regarding the File explorer that also I tried to reproduce and I did not face this issue. You could face this issue&nbsp;due to some third party application or security application. However if your computer do not
 meet the <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system requirement
</a></strong>then you could face this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the third issue related to gaming, as you already know some of the games will not work as it is a technical preview version. There are some games which are not compatible with Windows 8.1, theses games will not work on Windows 10 Technical Preview. You
 need to check the compatibility of the game before you try to install on Windows 10 Technical Preview. You can check the compatibility of the game using the link given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>See what works </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the games to work properly on your computer you need to keep the graphics driver to the latest version, therefore make sure that you have latest version of graphics drivers installed. If you are able to get the latest drivers then fine else you can provide
 us the make and model of your computer I will provide you the download link. After you install the game in compatibility mode and even if you face any issues, try to contact the game developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you. Let us know if you need further help. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I have checked the requirements from your reply, everything is fine if it is only this. However, for the third problem, all games used to work at some point until I have updated PhysX which I regret doing it. What is causing the problem when both Intel graphics
 and Nvidia are enabled? Or is there something that makes Nvidia graphic invisible even if it is enabled alone? For example when playing Flatout, I disable Nvidia in order for to make an option visible which is to select Intel Graphics to play, but when I disable
 Intel and and &nbsp;reopen the game, the only option for graphics is something other than Nvidia and Intel it was Microsoft .....</p>
<p>I had a look at what works, but many apps are missing or not applicable.</p>
<p>Looking forward for the reply.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The start menu looks redacted, but I have not manipulated this image in any way. (No background is set, so that's not a problem)Also the problem gets solved if I restart explorer.exe. As mentioned earlier this problem crops up only if the PC is kept running
 for more than two-three hours. Also my PC satisfies the minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am continuing to find alternative ways. I will come back if I find anything related.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Okay, firstly let me specify the make and model of my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor : Intel Core 2 Duo E7500</p>
<p>Motherboard : Intel DG41CN</p>
<p>Display : Intel G41 Express Chipset</p>
<p>Ram : 2GB</p>
<p>Monitor : Samtron 56V</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, my PC is beyond old, but anyway, a good OS should work on any config, especially because it satisfies all the requirements. Next up is the status of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not set up the High Contrast Theme, never used it in fact before troubleshooting today, and no I have not touched the display settings ever since installing the preview. It's only that my background is set to solid black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I see that my display driver was updated by Windows update to version 8.15.10.2702 from the earlier installed version of 8.15.10.1883. I remember it happened at the first update I ran.
</p>
<p>Anyway, </p>
<ul>
<li>I first disabled it----Problem persists</li><li>I uninstalled it----Problem persists</li><li>I Installed the old driver version 8.15.10.1883 from the Intel driver CD----Problem persists</li></ul>
<p>(It is worth mentioning here that my display driver crashed and became unrecoverable every time I opened Firefox...maybe that's why the update was there in the first place)</p>
<ul>
<li>I disabled it----Problem persists</li><li>I updated using Windows update to version 8.15.10.2702 again----Problem persists</li><li>Tried to decrease the resolution to 1024 X 768 from the recommended 1152 X 864----Problem persists</li><li>I disabled it again----Problem persists</li></ul>
<p>So after coming a full circle, I am nowhere near the solution to the problem.</p>
<p>
Waiting to hear from you(or from someone else).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the details which you have given to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run the following command on the command prompt in admin mode and then provide us the make and model of your computer. You have provided the specification of your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open Command Prompt with Admin mode please press Windows Key and X key together and select Command Prompt (admin) from the list. Later type the command
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\users\&lt;user name&gt;wmic csproduct get name </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Here C is drive on which you have installed Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the result you get after you run the above command. This appears a display driver issue, installing driver from CD does not always works, you need to install the driver from the manufacturer website. If you provide us the make and model then
 we can provide you the exact link to download the driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the asked detail. </p>

            Okay, my issue got resolved after updating to the new preview build 9926.&nbsp; And yes, I did not have to mess with my display drivers. So I believe the problem was with the last update I gave to my previous build as the problem cropped up after that.<br />

            Simple enough<br />
<br />
Install and activate on the new machine.<br />
<br />
If you have tried to activate on the new machine and got the "too many..." error message you will have to do a phone activation. When you phone in, don't bother replying to the initial prompts. Wait until you are given the option of talking to a live "service"
 rep.&nbsp; Explain that you are transferring from a dead computer. They should then allow the activation to complete.&nbsp; If not, ask to speak to a supervisor.<br />

            <p>"wanted to download something" means what?</p>
<p>If it instructed you to download Windows Defender Offline, that is valid. Otherwise I suspect that you were hit with a fake security alert in an effort to get you to download the actual malware to infect your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What infected was reported in the alert?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did you "stop" the process?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open MSE and view History -- anything showing up? If so, what are the details?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, these type of malware attacks are difficult to keep up with because they trick you into letting them install. They usually
 come from an infected web site, and usually through an advertisement. You get a pop-up from the infection and you click&nbsp;it to close the pop-up - which allows the infection to install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They can also be delivered in a "drive-by" fashion with no action needed by the user due to the system being unpatched, no matter what security software is running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you encounter one of these fake virus pop-ups while browsing, immediately do the following:<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">-Do not touch any browser window to close it or browse further</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>-Use the key combination &lt;ALT&gt;+&lt;F4&gt; to close all running programs, especially the web browser</span></p>
<p><span>--or--</span></p>
<p><span>-Immediately press Ctrl-Alt-Del and bring up Task Manager and forcibly end all instances of iexplore.exe, if using Internet Explorer,
 or the executable for your browser for any other web browser.<br />
--or--<br />
-Go to Start/Shut Down and restart the PC without touching any browser windows.<br />
-If you used task manager to close browser instances, reboot the machine.<br />
-Then go to Control Panel/Internet Options and delete all temporary Internet Files and cookies. If you are using an alternate web browser, open the browser settings to do the same - delete the local cached files and cookies.<br />
-Perform a full scan with MSE.<br />
<br />
The above steps should prevent the infection from taking hold.</span></p>
<p><span>Start here -
</span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a></p>
<p><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.answerdesk.com/</a>)<span style="font-weight: bold">
 in the US at this time.</span> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</p>

<p>This web site - <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com</a> -<span>&nbsp;
</span>contains details for many of these common infections, often immediately after they began to appear in the wild, and instructions are provided for how to remove the infections using their malware removal guides. They also have forums where you
 can seek help from people who specialize in malware removal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides MSE, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:</p>
<p>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</p>
<p>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON<span>&nbsp;
</span>and not running with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>-<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their
 latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Lifen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found your domain’s MX records is not Office365 and I can’t find auto-discover records. This is possible because you are using a third part account.</p>
<p>Please login to <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> to check whether you are using an Office365 account.
</p>
<p>If you cannot login to OWA normally, be sure your password and account are right, or you are using a third part account. You may contact your admin to confirm this situation, and get the Incoming/Outgoing server for adding your account to Outlook with
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-email-setup-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b?CTT=1&amp;CorrelationId=33ff1043-a902-42c8-9f47-06711bc6993e&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;ocmsassetID=HA102823161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IMAP/POP to Outlook</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, if you can login to OWA and send/receive emails in OWA, this is very possible an Outlook client issue, you can remove the password from Windows Credentials to have a shot:</p>
<p>Open Control Panel&gt;User Account (View by: Category)&gt;Choose “Manage Windows Credentials” (under Credential Manager)&gt;find your Outlook account and remove.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31376606-137d-4a42-9bc4-b226f1e63243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31376606-137d-4a42-9bc4-b226f1e63243" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you can repair the Outlook online:</p>
<p>Open Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;Programs and Features&gt;Right click Office 365(Outlook)&gt;change</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I need to confirm some information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you can send/receive emails in Outlook.</li><li>Can your account login to OWA and send/receive email? Do you use a third part account (contact admin)?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            It's just the displayed name, you can change it as you like:
<br />
<br />Let us assume you have a 'HelloWorld' macro in your PERSONAL.XLSB
<br />So when you add it to your QAT you should see the file relation in front
<br />Now you can click the Modify button and change the Display Name to anything you like.

                    <p style="text-align: justify">You could make both of them active...Example : Left click on mouse would bring New start menu, and Right click would bring us to Windows 8.1 start screen, and double-left click could bring (program and features,mobility center,

 on windows 8.1 start screen are really nice and modern feature and quite handy when using new-style apps, it works like separate menu for new-style apps which is clear and simple. Sorry for bad grammar !!</p>

            What's the exact error? Do you have lens apps on the phone? Once you tried to open one of these, is the behavior the same? Have you checked if an update is available for the device (Settings &gt; Phone Update)?

    <title>Skydrive and Office application integration problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helpdesktech1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skydrive and Office application integration problems</h2>
                    
<p>I posted this question in the skydrive forum and was directed here.</p>
<p>I will start off with the base information.&nbsp; We are using Windows XP 32 bit and Office 2007 Suite.&nbsp; The computers also have the latest&nbsp;silverlight installed.&nbsp; The problems listed below happen whether or not the Windows Live Sign-in Assistant is installed.<br />
<br />
We are trying to enable the ability for users to open documents from their skydrive on communal PC's.&nbsp; Currently the computers log into windows using a generic account.&nbsp; The user then logs in to skydrive using their personal account.&nbsp; They are able to&nbsp;drag
 and drop files into skydrive.&nbsp; They can also open the file and edit it in the browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem&nbsp;arrises when they try to open the document in one&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Office suite applications.&nbsp; For example, if I&nbsp;edit a word document&nbsp;in the browser&nbsp;I have no problems.&nbsp; When I click the "Open in Word" button&nbsp;is where the problems start.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, a window asking me to "Add a .NET Passport to your Windows XP user account" appears.&nbsp; These are locked communal machines that are logged on to by many users throughout the day.&nbsp; How can I keep this pop-up/request from happening?</li><li>Second, after I cancel the .NET Passport window twice Word finally opens but it is not opening the document.&nbsp; Instead I recieve this message/error "Windows Live ID requires JavaScript to sign in.&nbsp; This web browser either does not support JavaScipt, or scripts
 are being blocked".&nbsp; To solve this problem I close Word and delete the browsing history in IE.&nbsp; I have tried this on multiple machines and always receive this error the first time, even if I delete the browsing history prior to signing in to Skydrive.&nbsp; I'd
 like to know the work around for this problem as well, I can not instruct the users to open the document, receive the error, then delete browsing history, and try again.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I appreciate any help you may be able to provide.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer settings/cookies/etc. is not the problem.&nbsp; SkyDrive requires Live-ID (Passport)&nbsp;authentication to access documents, but when you signed in to the web app you only gave Internet Explorer your password.&nbsp;&nbsp;Word also needs that information which
 is why it's showing the .NET Passport Wizard.&nbsp; It is possible to disable this dialog as noted in<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384067(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this MSDN article</a>.&nbsp; Save the bolded text below as a ".reg" file and apply it to the machines:</p>
<p><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong></p>
<p><strong>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Passport]<br />
"NumRegistrationRuns"=dword:00000006</strong></p>
<p>That said, this only disables the wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you click "Open in Word", Word is still going to ask you for your Live-ID/Passport username and password - without it SkyDrive will not let Word access the document.&nbsp; So you'll need to enter your credentials
 again.&nbsp; Although the Sign-In Assistant is supposed to bridge this gap, I'm not sure it works with Office 2007.</p>
<p>Regardless, I don't think a public terminal with a generic Windows account is very reliable or secure.&nbsp; As soon as somebody (say, Bob) clicks the "remember me" checkbox when signing in to SkyDrive, that account is stuck there and it's tricky to get off.&nbsp;
 If somebody else tries to use that machine (say, Alice) she'll have access to Bob's files and difficulty getting to her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;A domain or workgroup with individual Windows accounts will be more reliable and secure: once Bob logs off the machine that will lock
 Alice out of his SkyDrive.</p>

<h2>            Not receiving emails for several days</h2>
                    I have a problem not receiving some emails (a few do get through). I know many other people had posted the same problem, but Ken_Rey_C in one answer said please start a personal question so that a moderator can reply by private message... Please can someone
 do that so that they can check my email address to try and resolve the issue?

<h2>            Microscoft Email Forgetten Used a code</h2>
                    I recently made a microsoft account to download the beta version of Minecraft for windows 10. I did download it but I had to upgrade to Windows 10 so I started. After that I tried to login and go to the Windows 10 store so it would start downloading my
 free copy of the beta. But I forgot the email and I do have an alternative email that I put in when i made the account and I also have the code. Will this information help me get the email back because I cant use the code again and I want the free beta.

<p>
</p><p>You will need to clear cache and browsing history before trying to log in to both of your Yammer user accounts.&nbsp;Try to use&nbsp;two (2)&nbsp;browsers (Chrome and IE, for example) per account&nbsp;or one account using a regular IE browser while InPrivate browsing for the
 2nd account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            How to automatically sort references &#40;Bibliography&#41; by order of appearance on the document</h2>
                    i have a long document with cross references in the middle of a text, the cross references are linked to their numbering in the last page (the bibliography), how can i automatically sort them by the order of appearance on the document, without going through
 each one and changing the cross reference in the text?

<p>yes&nbsp;<span>endnotes, is there a better method to do this then what i currently do?</span></p>
<p><span>but i need to do this in a way that the endnotes are not placed at the bottom of the page, they are at the top and they are sorted in this order (with square bracket)</span></p>

            Endnotes (as opposed to footnotes) are at the end of the document, not at the foot of the page. If what you want is just a numbered reference list, then see

<h2>            How to disable automatic hyperlinks - i.e. &#34;remove link&#34; doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Started a new thread because the other is locked, I cannot add my solution.</p>
<p>This is my work-around in OneNote 2010 because "Remove link" removes it but 30 seconds later it reappears.<br />
Please confirm here if it works for you in another version!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was inspired by the other thread's mention of zero-width space</p>
<p>Review-&gt;Spelling-&gt;AutoCorrect options<br />
or File-&gt;Options-&gt;Proofing-&gt;AuoCorrect options</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added http&nbsp; to correct to http://&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I added https to correct to https://&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In each case, type alt+8203 after the colon then type the 2 slashes</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now when I wish to type some code and not have it create a link, I type http and hit the spacebar
</p>
<p>(Hit the spacebar because it seems to only autocorrect what it determines is the end of the word)</p>
<p>It autocorrects but now I have a true space at the end</p>
<p>So, hit Backspace then continue typing as I intended</p>
<p>
</p><p>http spacebar backspace somedomain.tld&nbsp; </p>
<p>This becomes the proper "looking" URL without being a hyperlink; and it lasts! I can even print to pdf and not have links UNLESS I WANT THEM!</p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook.com contacts not syncing with iPhone 5c - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lupo6565  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com contacts not syncing with iPhone 5c</h2>
                    <p>Just set up new iPhone 5c to outlook.com account, my daughter's account, not this account.&nbsp; Everything works fine, except the contacts are not syncing.&nbsp; Tried deleting and re-installing account on iPhone to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen others with the similar issue and it seems Microsoft can do something to the account to make the syncing between the Outlook.com account and the iPhone work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can that account be fixed for the contact syncing to work?</p>

            <p>The iPhone 5c was set up with the standard process:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tap <span>Settings</span>, and then tap <span>
Mail</span>, <span>Contacts</span>, <span>Calendar</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap <span>Add Account</span> in the Accounts page.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span><span>Outlook.com</span></span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter your <span>Outlook.com</span> address and password.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the fields that you want to sync. Tap <span>
Save</span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; This is only affecting the contacts.&nbsp; Email and calendars are syncing almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same issues are happening with an iPad signed into the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have not tried signing into different outlook.com accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did some more experimenting after the accounts were deleted and reinstalled.&nbsp; It does seem that any new contacts will sync in either direction, from phone to Outlook.com, or from Outlook.com to phone.&nbsp; A new contact can be created and deleted
 properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that there are existing contacts on the iPhone that I would like to sync to the Outlook.com account and they are not.&nbsp; Is there something special in that situation that needs to be done?&nbsp; I even tried editing the contact on the
 phone and saving it to see if it would sync the edited contact to Outlook.com and it does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate you for getting back to&nbsp;us with additional details about your concern. Before I forward this to our support specialists, I still need you to answer the following questions as part of our investigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could you verify if the contacts (that don't sync) are still listed on your <a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
People</a> page?</li><li>Did you create the contacts from the&nbsp;<a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">People</a> page, or they are linked to another service? (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc)</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they are linked to another service, I advise that you unlink the service first to see if the affected contacts will sync to your device:</p>

            <p>I have to clarify a little more.&nbsp; After additional testing, any new contacts will sync in either direction, which is perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My base issue is I have existing contacts on the iPhone that I want to sync to Outlook.com.&nbsp; There is no issue with any contacts already existing on Outlook.com.&nbsp; Actually, I am going to clean out the People page to have no contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get the contacts that are on the iPhone to the People page of Outlook.com?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
