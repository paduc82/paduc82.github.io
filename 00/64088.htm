<h2>            Windows 10 File Backup for multiple users.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a monster desktop PC that has three users commonly use it. I have to rebuild it because the creators edition simply won’t install any other way (grr — but that’s another story).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the only tech savvy family member it falls to me to handle this. But I want to use file backup to backup everyone’s data, not just my own. Can this be done, assuming I can get permission to access the folders? I’ve struggled to find a good answer to this
 question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I am aware that File History has a focus for individual users. That’s fine but I’ve outlined my use case above; I need to get down and dirty with this machine and don’t want to have three seperate File History backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. The old fashioned pre-Windows 7 backup is back — great, but it takes ages and is very undynamic. File history will make it easier for me to just carry on where I left off. That would work, but I’m interested in what a modern approach might be.</p>

</p><p>Might read the above. &nbsp; Then consider a non windows System Image program.</p>
<p>Schedule it once per week or whatever you feel comfortable with.&nbsp; Most of them will allow you to browse the image if you need a backup file. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talk everybody into using their OneDrive accounts to save their important files. I keep all my Documents / Pictures in onedrive always. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use AOMEI backupper - seems simple.&nbsp; Minimal maintenance, Cortana reminds me when to.</p>
<p>Several others around, EaseUs ToDo &amp; Macrium seem popular.</p>

<p>Trouble is, System Image backup doesn't work for me either. Generally speaking, I use this type of thing as an excuse for a spring clean; System Image makes it hard to fish out the actual individual files I need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried EaseUS ToDo, and it's pretty good for a quick backup but not too great at specifying a target for restored files. You always end up restoring somewhere else then having to copy across later (although I suspect this might be a restriction of the
 FREE version -- not sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I just find it frustrating that this used to be easier; Microsoft have hamstrung backups in my view by making new tools but restricting how they can be used to a large degree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have a look at AOMEI anyway -- might be what I need. How is restoring from that?</p>

            whats wrong with windows 7 backup? it captures bare metal state if needed. All options would use volume shadow copy anyway and you can easily mount the vhd files if you need

<p>Last time I tried restoring an image with win7 system image it failed - believe that was less than 6 months ago.&nbsp; Microsoft announced they no longer support system image &amp; their BackUp now is kind of odd too.&nbsp; They are advising users to change to a different
 backup system.</p>

<p>The way Windows backs up files and folders works fine for most individual users. In that it backs them up using the "File History" program.&nbsp; Now, you have a choice of where to put those. You can store them in the Cloud (in, for example, OneDrive but you
 get only 5GB of storage space for free there. <span>But since you have three users all with their own backup files and folders there probably wouldn't be enough room and you'd have to start buying additional space.
</span>Another choice is an External Hard Drive (these are relatively inexpensive as I am sure you know) less than 50 bucks for a terabyte of storage in general. The price rises from there but this seems a better option.</p>

 If you click this picture twice you will be able to see it better.</p>
<p>Now, you'll notice I don't use any of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is because I put all my files in folders and back them up when the folder has all the materials or information or whatever I want in it. Then I either hook up an external drive and move it or copy it to the cloud until such time as I feel like digging
 out my storage drive to transfer it to. (Usually when OneDrive starts getting full).</p>

    <title>Xbox Enforcement Wrongfully Suspending and Having No Contacting At All - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Enforcement Wrongfully Suspending and Having No Contacting At All ISSUE</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I contacted Xbox Support over the telephone about it and they couldn’t help what so ever. So then I contacted the live support in desperation of help 2 times. Two times I tried with live chat support. I was still unable to receive help. The closest thing
 I received to help was the Xbox support person named “Kyle” he documented my issue and gave me a code:
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. Every person I encountered in support just told me that they looked over my account and saw my suspension. No one helped! &nbsp;I was wrongfully accused of hate speech etc... And wrongfully forced gamer-tag changed banned for my gamer-tag.
 Out of my 11 years of being a customer since the age of 5 I have never been this angered until now. I am being wrongfully accused for bad communication and my gamer-tag is now banned as well. I’ve had that last gamer-tag for over 3 years and never had a problem
 until now. I have had to tell my friends and everyone I know who plays Xbox now to report anyone who gives off the slightest threat and uses any profanity because of how ridiculous my suspension was. To add on to my suspension my gamer-tag was force changed
 and I can’t even change it to something different! I have to pay $9.99 to change it! This is ridiculous! I have got no help at all! I want to speak to a high end representative or boss of the employees because I am getting no help. I even applied for a case
 review but failed to get one because “Xbox Live Gold subscriber; you must have an active Xbox Live Gold subscription.” And “Enforcement; you must have an applicable active enforcement action.” I even tried the questionnaire but failed every time due to one
 very tricky question which would confuse any single Xbox user. This is outrageous and poor communication by Xbox and Xbox support. They are very vague on my suspension as well. They state the possibilities to as why I was suspended but don’t give an actual
 reason. I strongly believe they didn’t even attempt to investigate the suspension. This is wrong and everyone on the Xbox community is being notified of this poor help and wrong accusations. I haven’t been able to find help at all! Please help me for once.
 YES I HAVE TRIED TO FILE FOR A CASE REVIEW BUT I CANT SINCE ITS LESS THAN 24hrs. My issue now is that they do not have any contact info on the website from what i have seen. Whenever i look for support on their website they only redirect me to Xbox Support
 not to their enforcement team. &nbsp;But now in the future if i am to ever get suspended from false accusations again it will even be longer. They changed my old gamer tag and now i have to pay $9.99 to change it off of a Xbox generated name. They cant even give
 a sole reason why i was wrongfully suspended and why my gamer tag was changed. I want exact reasons not possibilities. There is a need for contact when my gamer tag is wrongfully and forcefully changed and now I HAVE TO PAY $9.99 to get it changed!!</p>
<p>My gamer-tag is: ScaryJoey552002</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>The support people you spoke with said/did all that they could about your suspension. The only ones that can give any response to your inquiry is the Enforcement Team. Unfortunately there is no way around that.</p>
<p>As for the forced name change, it doesn't matter how long a user has had their gamertag, if it violates the Code of Conduct or Terms of use (both of which users have to agree to when creating an account), gets reported and is found to be in violation, it
 will be changed. </p>
<p>All users who receive a forced name change have to pay to change it to something else. This has been the standing policy for a while now. One reason for this is too many users abused the old system and would change their name to something else that would
 still break the rules.</p>
<p>If you don't want to pay for a name change, you can try Xbox Live Rewards (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">rewards.xbox.com/myrewards</a>)or even Bing Rewards (<a href="https://www.bing.com/rewards/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.bing.com/.../dashboard</a>)
 if they are available in your area. Save up the credits to redeem them for money toward a name change.
</p>
<p>I know this isn't what you want to hear, but the enforcement.xbox.com &gt; case review is the only way to get further details about an enforcement action.</p>
<p>Wish I had more.</p>

<p>You are ranting to the wind here as no one can help. &nbsp;All of these situation are handled through the enforcement team thus no one in support or on the forums can assist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as what you did to get the ban you yourself said that you were accused of hate speech. &nbsp;That in my mind is pretty specific. &nbsp;They are not going to tell you exactly what was said or when. &nbsp;It could have happened months ago. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Same with the forced gamer tag change. &nbsp;I am sure if you would take a little time and do some searches on your tag you will find how it was against the CoC/ToU.</p>
<p>Being vindictive against other gamers because you were banned is being immature. All you will succeed in doing is turning the whole community against you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your frustrations are understood but many times it is best just to accept the consequences of your actions and move on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you take the time to search on your previous gamer tag to see what you could find? &nbsp;You should really give it a try it may help you to understand the situation.

<p>Just a suggestion. &nbsp;Take care and Happy Gaming!</p>

<br />Install them again, but before restarting or shutting down, disable Fast Boot:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Power options
<br />Click Additional power settings under Related settings
<br />Click Choose what the power button does
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable
<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended)
<br />
<br />Click Save changes.
<br />
<br />Click Restart now and see if it works.

            Hey Dottie,
<br />
<br />
<br />    Your login account should have write access to the C:\Windows\Fonts folder, this point you have done.
<br />    The registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts should be fully modifiable by your account
<br />    Make sure the font files are not encrypted.

            Hi Dottie 
<br />
<br />Sounds like your account does not have write access
<br />
<br />
<br />    Your login account should have write access to the C:\Windows\Fonts folder, this point you have done.
<br />    The registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts should be fully modifiable by your account
<br />    Make sure the font files are not encrypted.
<br />
<br />There is a documentation can give you some prompt, kindly check it for assistance.

<p>Thank you for your response Andre but that solution didn't work. However, in looking for some other solutions I came across the fact that the fonts are also stored in the Users directory. So I went to: Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts
 and every font is there and remains there after reboot. The font just disappears from the Windows\Fonts folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What now? Any other suggestions? I'm getting desperate and it looks like I'll be working on my klunky old machine for a lot longer than I wanted.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Nook app screen resolution</h2>
                    <p>On me new Surface Pro 4 the Nook app will only display about 1/3 size&nbsp;pages when reading Nook purchased magazine. Zooming in increases the font, but displays less of the magazine page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been told it is a Windows 10 issue. However, I've had no issues with the Nook app on my Dell Laptop,&nbsp;a Surface Pro3 or my Intel Compute stick, all running Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone recommend a fix or a work around?</p>

            <p>Hi Fredrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern be rest assured and I will certainly help you and guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Nook app has issues only with the surface Pro 4 this issue may no be subjected&nbsp;to Windows. I would suggest you&nbsp;to&nbsp;contact Nook support and check. Also check within the display settings of the Nook app.

            <p><span>No joy from Barnes and Noble. I am not the only Surface owner to have the same issue. Based on discussion with other Surface owners, I think Microsoft/Windows
 10 does not play well with others? Sorry guy this is not an attack. I have been a Windows cheerleader for years. I am also experiencing issues with the Amazon Kindle app on my Surface Pro 4. Fortunately Amazon has a Windows 7&nbsp;app/program I was able to install
 on my Surface Pro 4 as a work around. </span></p>

            I just uninstall and reinstalled the Nook app again with no improvement in the display. Is there a Windows 7 Nook program I can run on my Surface Pro 4 as a work around? I have a lot of Nook magazine subscriptions.

<p>Joy,</p>
<p>this is both a nook issue and surface Pro issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I recently bought the new surface pro 2017 and have had nothing but problems with the Nook App which appears to be isolated to the Surface Pro's.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm mostly an apple guy and this never happens with Apple
 App's.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft needs to get with the program.&nbsp; &nbsp; Apps shouldn't be in your Store unless they work on your devices!!!&nbsp; Please pass this along.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            What version of Windows do you have?

<br />**************************************************
<br />********** Version &amp; Build Numbers **********************
<br />**************************************************
<br />
<br />Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
<br />
<br />Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
<br />
<br />*******   PLEASE PROVIDE FULL Windows and Office VERSION AND BUILD NUMBERS   *******
<br />
<br />Report Windows Version and Build number
<br />This “copy and Paste” process will get the full Window Build and Version number information we need:
<br />
<br />.  *  In start menu, search for POWERSHELL
<br />.  *  Click on it to open a PowerShell window
<br />.  *  Copy the following lines, between the lines of ***, not including them

<br />I've got Version 1709 and that command still works. That is the "old" control panel dialog. MS is slowly 'improving' the control panel into settings. And dumbing them new settings down. So, if you have 1803 and can't access that dialog you are SOL. You will have to rely on the Settings "equivalent" (more like approximation) new one.
<br />
<br />BUT, the registry keys used by the old one are probably still there. So if you can find out what key you need to change you can use a registry hack to recreate what you did in the older version..

    <title>Xbox one controller issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dextur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one controller issue</h2>
                    Been having left stick issues, but not the standard one where it just gets stuck. When I push up as if to go one menu spot up, the controller goes up endlessly when released. When I push down the same way, it goes down endlessly after released. I turned
 the controller off, did a hard restart on the xbox, then used my other controller and had the exact same issue. This is happening after a possible failed update from microsoft last week. How do I fix this?

            Hi Reikolee 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Onedrive and install latest version -
<br /> 
<br />Let's try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />Copy the below line, paste into Powershell and Enter 
<br />taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe
<br />This will terminate any OneDrive processe 
<br />
<br />Copy the below, paste into Powershell and Enter  
<br />
<br />if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />
<br />(Note - It is recommended that you create a backup of your registry before modifying registry as suggested below so that if you commit some mistake, you will be able to restore - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a>)
<br />
<br />Now Windows Key+R &gt; Type Regedit and Enter
<br />Go to this path
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version (example - 18.172.0826.0010 folder)
<br />and from the Accounts folder, remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart computer and install One Drive latest version from this link: 
<br />

<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

                    <p>Every time i turn on my xbox it turns off immidiately after. I looked up how to fix it and some said that you could&nbsp;blow dry the vents of the xbox then wait a couple minutes and it would turn on. That obviously didnt work for me. Other people said that a new power brick would solve the issue and i went out to buy a new one but that didnt work either. Now im here looking to others to help solve my issue&nbsp;with my xbox one.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>TheRealZesty,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sorry you're having problems playing your 360 game on your One. I don't think all preview members have the update rolled out to them yet (I could be wrong). Check your preview app, and see if you have any quests for testing the backwards&nbsp;compatibility. If
 so, then follow the steps to run the backwards compatibility. Finally check <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/system-update-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
and see if there is an update you can apply.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/system-update-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check for updates</a></span></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey there! Good to know. This should probably be moved to the preview section, as it's really a preview feature. Please take all this information and repost it in the preview forum located below. Also include your current Xbox version number if you know
 where to find it.</p>

                    <p>Original title: NexStart Cx 3.5 (USB 2) with a 1 TB hard disk connected by a USB Connection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the Windows control panel it says both parts are working right.</p>
<p>But I have not been able to access the the drive to put things on it,</p>
<p>Windows explorer does not show it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I need to Format the new hard disk in the NexStart device.</p>
<p>If that is right, how to I format it?</p>

            <p>Hi Harrell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Have you checked if the drive is being detected on any other computer?</p>
<p>-&nbsp; What happens when you plug in the external drive to the computer? Does it install the drivers automatically?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason why the drive is not shown in the Windows Explorer is because a drive letter may not be assigned to it.&nbsp; Let's try to assign a drive letter to the external hard drive and check if it being shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Click on <strong>Start</strong> and type <strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong> and press enter.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; If the drive is being detected, right click on the drive and click on <span>
Change Drive Letter and Paths</span>.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; If there isn't a drive letter assigned, click on Add and click the letter that you want to use, and then click
<span>OK</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Restart the computer and then check if the External hard drive is detected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/change-add-or-remove-a-drive-letter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the drive isn't detected, then download and install&nbsp;the drivers from <a href="http://www.vantecusa.com/en/product/view_detail/274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vantecusa.com/en/product/view_detail/274</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Please <strong>do not </strong>format the hard drive until we make sure the drive isn't recognized on any computer.&nbsp; To format a hard drive, you need to right click on the drive and select Format.&nbsp; This link will give you a general idea about formatting

 it to be for the update and that didn't work I turned it off I remove the battery that still didn't work. I did not drop it it did not fall it did not get wet. &nbsp;And I updated the graphics drivers from the HP website. Model number g7-2215dx. I use google chrome.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error message/code related to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused by bad/corrupted display adapter driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are a few steps which you can follow:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Update the display drivers from device manager.<br />
<em>Steps:</em><br />
a. From desktop screen, press Windows key + X<br />
b. Select device manager.<br />
c. Double click Display adapters.<br />
d. Right click on the display adapter device shown.<br />
e. Select properties and click driver tab and select Update Driver.<br />
f. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If method 1 does not help, then you may <span>install the software from the device manufacturer. For example, if your device came with a disc, that disc might contain software that installs a driver for the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the link to install the display driver from the manufacturer’s website:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5322737&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5322737&amp;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Select Windows 8 Operating System and expand the Driver – Graphics section to find the latest drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, refer to the link and follow steps given in the Microsoft KB article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Get the best display on your monitor</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor</a></p>

<h2>            The Windows Sound Manager</h2>
                    <p>I and many others are annoyed that we need to buy dedicated Hardware and Software to amplify Windows Audio.</p>
<p>Why? well many would think that its reasonable to be able to in Windows 10 to have an unlimited option for Sound audio in the case that audio isn't loud enough. Obviously there would need to be safe guards to protect ports on the PC from being damaged.</p>
<p>In my case my Speakers that I have connected to my PC don't have volume nobs and are too Quiet. Windows is running at 100% audio and is still too quiet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe in a Windows update this small feature can be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>online video is not going to be as loud as internal sounds, usually because of low bitrate flash videos. Just depends!</p>

<p>If you install VLC Player and make it your default player for audio and video (freeware), while watching movies/videos, you can turn the volume up to 200% using the mouse wheel which makes watching/listening much better.<br />

<p>yes</p>
<p>The point is that Windows doesn't allow you to increase the volume further than what its currently at.</p>
<p>If I want to amplify the volume I cant just do this simple task on windows. I have to purchase additional Soft/hardware.</p>

<p>No, just buy the correct speakers with a volume control. The wattage makes a difference, and if listed as 10 watt, that may be total&nbsp;of 5 watt per speaker or 10 per speaker, always look at the specs before buying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>are they USB or 1/8 jack</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;USB speakers also are powered by the USB hub,&nbsp;5V </p>
<p>you are limited for more power needed&nbsp;for more wattage. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Jack speakers are powered by AC and can provide more power to sustain the usually 5V&nbsp;power for more wattage as you increase volume. And then you have the volume control to amplify or control wattage powered by AC.</p>

<h2>            Fallout new vegas help</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I am playing Fallout new vegas at the moment, I am in Primm at the moment and finding alot of trouble. I have really bad guns, I have guns which are 9mm Pistol, Laser pistol, varmint rifle and this is it and its all bad and I keep dying because
 of the powder gangers. At Goodsprings, I had a choice of helping Ringo or Power gangers, I helped Ringo. I hardly got gifted any good guns or any money. I am wondering If I helped Joe Cobb (Power gangers) maybe I would have had a better outcome in the game,
 can anyone helped me out here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worstedorphan</p>

<p>It seems this game's strategy guide is very essential. I have to start this game all over again. In Primm, I had many gunfights and I used up all my stimpaks, doctor bags and seems like I am screwed. Should I take the Powder Ganger's side this time?</p>

<p>A problem shared is a problem halved. Pick up a companion and share the load. Boone, the night time sniper of Novac is a good choice, or you can find the Eyebot, ED-E, in the Mojave Express in&nbsp;Primm itself.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is not comptible with Windows 7 and Sony does not provide Windows 7 drivers.&nbsp;Refer to&nbsp;the following link.</p>
<div><a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-home.pl?mdl=VGCRB54G&amp;template_id=1&amp;region_id=1&amp;tab=download#/downloadTab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-home.pl?mdl=VGCRB54G&amp;template_id=1&amp;region_id=1&amp;tab=download#/downloadTab</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>You may try and install the&nbsp;drivers in XP/Vista compatibility mode and check if that fixes the issue.<br />
See the following link for more information:<br />
<strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows. <br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
