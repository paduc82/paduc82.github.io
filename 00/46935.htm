    <title>Set up Homegroup with a dual band router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david-e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set up Homegroup with a dual band router</h2>
                    <p>Recently switched to my ISP's fibre service which installed a new modem and a new dual-band router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC desktop is hard-wired into the router and Surface 3 uses to 5G band. I created Homegroup using the Surface 3 (i.e. using the 5G wireless connection), but the PC does not see that Homegroup and is asking to also create a Homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get both to be part of the same Homegroup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are using the newly released Windows 10 Creators pre-release update.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
Your computer should be able to connect to the HomeGroup using 5GHz if it supports 802.11a and 802.11ac. To find out, the following are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on your wireless network adapter.</li><li>Select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>From here, if you see 802.11a or 802.11ac under <strong>Property</strong>, this means that your computer supports 5GHz.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you require further assistance.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update notification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crob1311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update notification</h2>
                    <p>It may be a coincidence, once, possibly twice but now for a third time, I have tried to use a previously working application or usb device, only to have problems.
</p>
<p>For example the latest, I have a Pinnacle USB TV stick, I opened the app to watch the TV, this failed, the app opened but would not display the tv picture. I tried to rescan the TV channels, this failed. I tried reinstalling the software using a repair option,
 failed. I tried removing the USB stick and uninstalling the driver, still failed. I then tried uninstalling the software and re installing it. No better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then uninstalled the whole app, and went to restart my computer, only to find that windows 10 had updates downloaded and waiting to be configured. This is he point at which I realised that this was the third time I have had problems wich essentially disappeared
 after I restarted Windows 10 with updates pending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not seem to receive any prominent notification that I have updates pending configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is the third time I have spent time trying to solve an apparent problem that disappears after an 'Update' restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this instance after he restart I had to reinstall my TV Centre App as I had uninstalled it, it now works again,&nbsp;all in all wasting over an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous times, the problems just disappeared after a restart and waiting for&nbsp;Windows to configure the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't I receive any notification that I have updates waiting for installation so I can avoid chasing phantom problems.</p>
<p>I get a notification that 'Updates&nbsp;were installed', but not that some are&nbsp;pending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Network Locations, Music Library, and Windows Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Locations, Music Library, and Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>I have found nothing on this on the Internet -- Windows Media Player, new with Windows 10 (worked in 7 and 8 for me) seems to be incapable of handling the Music Library being stored on a network share, at least if that network share is on a Windows Server
 (2012 R2 in my case). This applies whether it is a Redirected Folder or Public music (same network folder shared by everyone). (These are&nbsp;DFS folders, so synced between two servers for redundancy, but I wouldn't think that should be a factor.)&nbsp;This applies
 to all computers on our network. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Media Player. I have removed and recreated the Music Libraries on the local computers. I have tried assigning a drive letter so that it looks like L:\Music instead of \\domain_name\music.
 I tried changing the permissions so that all Users have Full Control. None of these changes had any discernable effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player finds no music and&nbsp;can't rip CD's (because it can't write to the share), etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I navigate to the folder directly through Windows Explorer, the files play fine. In that case, Windows Media Player does remember them and will play them in the future. But even after playing one song in a folder, all the rest remain hidden from
 it unless I play them by launching them from Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works fine if and only if, I remove all of the network shares from the Library and set up a local folder. Then everything works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas about this? Is this just a bug in Windows 10, or is there something I might have misconfigured on the server side?</p>

            <p>My assumption above appears to be part of the problem -- the DFS (Distributed File System)&nbsp;share did seem to be the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, I use a pathname for DFS shares of \\domainname\share. I've never known that to be a problem for anything. Apparently, Windows Media Player (and again, this is new in Windows 10), chokes on that. If I instead use \\servername\share it seems to
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at least for now, it looks like this may be the solution, but I'm still experimenting. I also view this as a poor solution. The whole point of DFS is that either server can fail or be taken down for maintenance and clients should just automatically redirect
 themselves to the other. That's why you use \\domainname and NOT \\servername to connect. And again this works for everything else, as far as I know, and worked for Windows Media Player in Windows 7 and 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for some reason, Microsoft seems to have done something different with WMP in Windows 10 that broke this. Any ideas, suggestions, or disagreements?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How to set time zone setting per user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james carnley  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set time zone setting per user</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to set the time zone information to be unique for each user? Like, a registry setting specific to that user.</p>
<p>For example, I want&nbsp;John to be CST and&nbsp;Mary to be PST. If John opens a program it says 5pm. If Mary opens a program it says 6pm.</p>
<p>Additional information: These users don't need to actually log in. I want to create two users, one for CST and one for PST, and use their credentials to run a program.&nbsp;The program will inherit their time zone settings and display the correct time.</p>
<p>More info: I plan on using these users in IIS for app pools so that different applications in the website can be run in different time zones and locales.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
James</p>

            Since you have replaced the wireless router, you will need to get every wifi connection to "join" the new wireless network wifi network.&nbsp; You need to follow the directions to get the device to re-connect / re-join the new wifi network.<br />

            It could be that your new router is using a different IP scheme and you would need to adjust it on the printer.<br />

                    Does anyone know if Windows 10 will let Office sync to iCloud? It does in 8.1.

            If it does in Windows 8.1, it will in Windows 10. Microsoft Office and iCloud work independently of the operating system version.

            I just figured out the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to uninstall icloud and then downloaded version 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting a while I logged into the icloud desktop app. and it synched all my mail and calendar entries.&nbsp;&nbsp; It works well now.<br />

            That is only one of several problems I have had since I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10. Big disappointment.&nbsp; Can't get settings to open nor it sync the cloud contacts or calendar.

            I too had the same problem updating from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 where the Microsoft Outlook&nbsp;2013 calendar and contacts&nbsp;were not synchronizing with iCloud. I signed out from iCloud, uninstalled the iCloud program on my PC, then reinstalled it from the
 Apple website. Voila ... it's working great now.

            <p>I did the same thing and after 30+ minutes the online Microsoft tech was able to get rid of the corrupted file and the "systems" icon would open. However, he said he could not fix the problem with Windows 10 not syncing with the cloud and that they were
 going to issue a patch or I could go back to Windows 8.1 and then reinstall Windows 10 when they have made the fixes. I went back to 8.1 (you have 30 days to go back) and will stay with it until they make an announcement that all is well.</p>

            <p>MI has the right solution.&nbsp; After talking to Microsoft Support, who "booted" this problem to Apple as "not an Microsoft problem"; and talking to Apple Support, who claimed Windows 10 was too new and Apple was still trying to figure-out where the disconnects
 were (really, that was Apple Level-2 support talking!)....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lenovo Tech Help was able to solve this problem of Outlook not being able to access my iCloud Contacts, Calendars, etc.&nbsp;under Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated by MI, &nbsp;the solution was to uninstall iCloud from my PC.&nbsp; Then re-install the latest iCloud release from Apple.&nbsp; And Voila, problem solved...!!&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Russ-M.</p>

<h2>            Mouse &#38; keyboard won&#39;t work during Windows 7 installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue of trying to install Windows 7 and the mouse &amp; keyboard won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backstory is that I purchased a Dell XPS 8930 that came pre-loaded with Windows 10 Home. I have a spare Windows 7 Professional license that I want to install via dual boot onto my new Dell XPS 8930. So I have my Windows 10 up &amp; running, set up a separate
 partition for my Windows 7, then configure the UEFI to <strong>disable </strong>
Secure Boot &amp; <strong>Enable </strong>boot Legacy ROMS, and set the boot to Legacy. I pop in my Windows 7 installation disc, restart the machine, it boots via the CD rom, and I land at the Windows 7 installation screen where I have to select the language. Except
 my mouse &amp; keyboard doesn't work (wired USB). They work in the Windows 10 and in BIOS. I have them plugged into USB 2.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read dozens of threads / forums about various solutions but none of them work for my particular case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to download Windows 7 in Google Chrome</h2>
                    attempting to download Windows 7 beta tonight using Google Chrome. &nbsp;Unable to start AutoWizard. &nbsp;Is this a known problem with chrome?
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I WILL NOT start iexplore to get this download. &nbsp;Sorry. &nbsp;If this is a chrome/microsoft issue please can someone confirm and I'll give up and go install another Linux version instead (or maybe even wait for Windows 7 retail price to fall to reasonable level).</div>
<div>

Thanks for any help</div>

<h2>            Voice but no video</h2>
                    We have used Skype for 5 years with no problems, but last week we could only hear the other party but could not see them.&nbsp; It was the same for them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just before that connection, we had a message to download the latest version of Skype which we did.&nbsp;
 Did that cause the problem?&nbsp; How do we fix this problem?

            Its possible the contact is using Skype for Web. Can you confirm which platform they are on (Windows 10, Windows 8/7, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS)? 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />Still not working...
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent Windows 10 from opening users' last activities, go to <strong>Windows Settings</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Accounts</strong> and<strong> Sign-in Options</strong>. In that category, scroll down to where it says&nbsp;<strong>Use my sign-in info to automatically
 finish setting up my device and reopen my apps after an update or restart</strong>. Turn that off and it should fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it does the trick. In case of any issues, I'm happy to help you more when needed. If it worked, please mark the answer as helpful.&nbsp;</p>

            You can’t disable that. 
<br />When someone logs in if they don’t actually sign out and just go into standby then windows will keep their account logged in. 
<br />It’s so they don’t lose their work by accident. 
<br />Even if they remotely access as well.

            You could set a policy that can log people off but that only works in a domain environment really.

                    Since updating to Windows 10 I've lost my homegroup. I've followed the advice on these forums. There's no place to "create a homegroup." It says, "join," which asks for a password. There's no place to view or print the password, so I don't know what to
 do. Any help you can offer is appreciated. &nbsp;

<p>Hi HendrikVan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more software programs that are open and running on your laptop, the less time you will get from the battery. When more programs are open, it requires more power for the laptop to keep the programs running. But we have here the tips for longer battery
 life:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Use battery saver. </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Start</strong>, and then select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>System</strong>, then select <strong>Battery</strong>. By default, battery saver turns itself on when your battery level goes below 20%, but you can adjust this in Battery settings.</li></ol>
<p><strong>2. Use Microsoft Edge for browsing.</strong> Tests show that when browsing with Microsoft Edge, your battery lasts 36-53% longer per charge than when browsing with Chrome, Firefox, or Opera on Windows 10.</p>
<p><strong>3. Run the Power troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Start</strong>, and then select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>, then select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Power</strong>, then click <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>

            Hi Ifti.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What makes you think this is due to IRST?  Are you receiving a specific error message and number?
<br />
<br />Is your D drive a separate hard drive, is it a data partition, or a Recovery partition?  
<br />
<br />You said you have an array.  Are you using RAID which only causes problems in Windows 10?  What type of RAID is it?  
<br />
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which I read like a doctor reads X-rays.  Follow the steps here so I can see everything needed to advise you:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            DM is correct.  
<br />
<br />I would remove the array and use the hard drive normally as storage and to offload User folders from the SSD with no speed loss.  
<br />
<br />In ten years in forums I've never seen anything good come of RAID, files often  lost even in a mirror.  There will be no speed advantage over the SSD and it may slow it.

            If this PC is within one year of purchase I'd contact the manufacturer's Support to help you remove the unncessary RAID array and use only the Optane Memory SSD with your hard drive separately as a data drive.  
<br />
<br />If not then follow the step here to enter UEFI firmware setup (BIOS) to delete the RAID volume and set to non-RAID.  
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough then follow the Intel agents suggestion to do a low level format on the SSD and then format it for use as a separate drive:

    <title>Recovery Drive D&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glorygal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Drive D&#58;</h2>
                    I had not backed up my system since I purchased Windows 8. But now I have a Windows 10 upgrade. I decided I needed to back up every thing, so I purchased USB with 64 GB on it. Went to System files where you backup and put the USB in the slot of my drive
 and thought it was backing up to it, but that's not what happened. It backed up to my recovery part known as D: recovery and ever since I have been getting messages that I don't have enough space to finish the backup. I think I may have wiped out my recovery.
 Are there any hopes of restoring D: back and if not how can I get whats on it off now? Would appreciate any help. Thanks. S.B.

<p>There are two methods of backing up. To backup either way, you'll need third-party software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A file-and-folder backup backs up individual files and folders. A file-and-folder backup is ideal for backing up your personal files - documents, pictures, music, etc. There are lots of great file-and-folder backup applications, like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.backup4all.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Backup4All</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An image backup backs up an entire drive letter. With an image backup program you can backup the entire C: drive in just minutes. This type of backup is perfect for backing up Windows and all your installed software. Here, too, there are many great choices,
 like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macrium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Macrium Reflect</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find backup programs on the internet, open your favorite search engine and use this as your search term:</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows backup software 2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your search results will include reviews by professional organizations (as well as a lot of junk that you can ignore.) Read the reviews, take advantage of the free trials, and pick the software that you like best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With third-party backup software, you can quickly and reliably backup your computer with features and convenience that don't exist in Windows 10. You should be backing up every day, and backup software makes that easy.</p>

<h2>            12&#43;ft HDMI Cable</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used the HDMI cable included in the consoles. However I have a new setup with a mounted TV and am now in need of a longer HDMI cable that will reach from my Xbox One to my TV. I will need something at least 12 feet as I have the wires run through
 my wall to stay hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a brand that absolutely works for the standard as well as Xbox One X that supports 4k. Preferably without breaking the bank. There are so many options on amazon but the reviews typically suggest they do not work great on devices that run 4k.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have tried all sorts of HDMI cables.</p>
<p>Amazon Specials / MonoPrice to Monster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6ft or less I do not see much degradation on comparable and highpriced cables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen the best cables not work on TV's with a computer and switched to a "special" for it to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is in-wall couplers.&nbsp; They degrade the information, especially if you are using two of them and 4k will not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are plenty of articles comparing all of the cables and it comes down to, if the cable works and doesn't show artifacts you are good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 4K TV and the TV Blanks out right in the middle of a 4K game and not during playback of Amazon UHD or other 4K.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Why? The TV overheats and it is not a cable issue.&nbsp; This is a known issue with a certain TV Brand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result get the&nbsp;<span>AmazonBasics Braided 4K HDMI to HDMI Cable - 15-Foot</span></p>
<p>As someone said before, don't short yourself, get more than you need.</p>

<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used the HDMI cable included in the consoles. However I have a new setup with a mounted TV and am now in need of a longer HDMI cable that will reach from my Xbox One to my TV. I will need something at least 12 feet as I have the wires run through
 my wall to stay hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a brand that absolutely works for the standard as well as Xbox One X that supports 4k. Preferably without breaking the bank. There are so many options on amazon but the reviews typically suggest they do not work great on devices that run 4k.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>as long as its hdmi 2.0 you should be fine dont go for a skinny cable you need the sheilding</p>

<p>I use my Xbox One X with a 1080p video projector, and intend to upgrade to a 4K projector eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For running a cable to the projector through half the room, I needed a 10 meter HDMI cable (roughly 30 feet). I'm using

that cable here</a>, which is certified to also work with 4K content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing with "not breaking the bank" is a bit complicated. You will not need to buy overpriced cables for hundreds of dollars. However, the longer a cable gets, the more&nbsp;susceptible it is for outside interference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the longer cable has to be shielded more compared to a shorter cable. Also, longer cables have trouble with high frequency signals, where the "new" signal being "pushed in the cable" while the "old" signal is still "in the cable" so to speak. This causes
 trouble with extremely cheap cables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So expect to pay more for longer cables compared to cheaper, shorter cables.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> blaketr  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Laptop powers off during sleeping</h2>
                    <p>My laptop will shut down completely while it is sleeping. I will put it in sleep mode, and then about 1 hour later, the fan will run, the power LED light will turn on, and then the computer will power off after 5 seconds. The screen does not light up. I
 have had this HP 15-194-od laptop for a few months now. I have noticed this issue begin to occur about a month ago when I updated my BIOS and updated version of Windows 10.&nbsp; I didn't change any settings in windows, nor would there be any reason for the computer
 to behave this way. This is driving me nuts! And HP customer service is useless. I am not certain this is caused by the BIOS update or Windows update, but it began around the time I did this.</p>

<h2>            Mass Effect Andromeda - Stuck at beginning loading screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after a longer time, I wanted to play Mass Effect Andromeda again.</p>
<p>My Xbox One wanted to install a update of about 3 GB, so I did that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I put my disk in and opened the game.</p>
<p>The game picture pops up and I see the Bioware logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the loading screen appears and loads until 80% when it does not go on.</p>
<p>I hear that the sounds out of the disk reader are different than it is before the freeze.<br />
</p>
<p>What I tried:<br />
- Close and start game again</p>
<p>- Login to different user</p>
<p>- Start without being logged in</p>
<p>- Press Xbox Button on console until shut down,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;pull the power cable off the console, wait 30 seconds</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;and plug in</p>
<p>- Clear Bluray permanent storage</p>
<p>- Delete alternative mac address</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing of that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a idea why it stucks on the loading screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be bad to reinstall the game completely, because my internet is not so good and it would take a long time to download all updates.</p>
<p>So that should be the last option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me.</p>
<p>

<p>Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; However, it does look as though you've tried all other options.&nbsp; You can first try deleting your gamertag then power cycle and redownload your gamertag.&nbsp; You could also try a factory reset on the console.&nbsp; There's an option to keep installed
 games and apps so you won't need to worry there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work then deleting and reinstalling is the next step.&nbsp; When reinstalling the game make sure that your console is set to offline so updates do not interfere with the install.</p>

<h2>            Win10 degradation - installing some fonts take over Arial in Microsoft Edge &#40;eg bing search&#41; and other applications</h2>
                    <p>This showed up on my upgrade to Windows 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make a restore point just to be safe, and then download and install the following linked font and restart Microsoft Edge and then do a bing search in Microsoft Edge, watch the font magically take over Arial and appear in all the search results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.fontsupply.com/fonts/Y/Y2k.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fontsupply.com/fonts/Y/Y2k.html</a> &nbsp;("Year 2000" font)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem does not happen in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, if you copy the text from Microsoft Edge and paste it into Microsoft Word, it comes across as Arial, not the "Year 2000" font.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same problem causes font-display issues in other applications given the difference in font size. &nbsp;For example I had trouble with the Australian Taxation Office E-Tax software due to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users are having similar troubles with other fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The page at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/35mhey/default_system_font_in_windows_10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/35mhey/default_system_font_in_windows_10/</a> shows that some users are
 having trouble with some fonts taking over Arial in Windows 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>One user has trouble with the "Iced Earth" font.</li><li>Another user has trouble with the "Metallica" font.</li><li>Another user has trouble with the "Linkin Park" font.</li><li>I had trouble with the "Year 2000" font.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Is this a Windows 10 font bug?</strong><br />

            <p>No you didnt. In my registry i have both "arial" with "arial" and the troublesome font "year 2000" with value "y2k.tff".</p>
<p>So your theory that in registry after installing windows other font (in this case "year 2000") would have "arial" value is just wrong. Hence link you posted doesnt help at all.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Some lame BF4 players</h2>
                    
<p>So i was playing some BF4 conquest last night and i was in a full squad with randoms, Two of the squad members were of a certain clan,</p>
<p>We were on siege of shanghai map and the first half the game was`nt going to well for the team, We were slowly losing but it was still a close game, By half way and last half of the game we were losing bad, The enemy team had us on lock down and it was very
 hard to capture any of the points, When we did they just take it right back,</p>
<p>But this point in the mid too last hafl of the game i noticed that the two clan members that were in the squad had left the squad and at the time i thought to myself maybe they switched squads or that maybe they rage quit or due to the issues of BF4 maybe
 they both crashed, So i carried on thinking nothing of it , To later come across and kill some of the enemy team to notice that the ones i had killed were the same two clan member that were just in the squad i was in, They had left and switched teams to join
 the winning team to my disbelief,</p>
<p>I know you cant switch teams when the game is close to ending but what to stop this from happering midway through the game when one team is losing by a huge margin and if there is free spaces on the opposite team to switch teams,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Dice should have a punishment system for something like this to stop this from happening, Maybe like having your kills / deaths and score just for that game played reset for switching team if having spent a certain amount of time playing on one team
 and then to go switch beceause that team happens to be losing.</p>

<p>I think an XP handicap for switching teams would do the trick. Just enough to make people consider seeing out the game on the same side they started on. In Battlefield 3 I had terrible problems with rented servers. Zuba Tower (Or whatever it was called)
 was a bad one. If I was holding down a cap point with much success, I was thrown onto the losing team with no option to switch back. Outrageous. One time I was thrown onto the losing team with minutes to go after 20 minutes invested into the match.</p>

<p>Yeah I don't think that's very fair and I can see people doing that to get the "W" and extra XP for winning, etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of their other clan members were on the other team and they were stuck waiting for the chance to switch teams? I know for a fact I often have to switch teams because when a party of me and my friends get in a game 90% of the time we are put
 on opposite teams.</p>

<p>I know this sucks but they can't implement anything. &nbsp;There are people like me that do this legit. &nbsp;If the game would put me and my buddies on the same team I wouldn't have to switch teams. &nbsp;I never pay attention to who is winning just wanna get on the same
 team with my buddies.</p>

<p>Their were the only clan members of there kind in the game and they switched teams just before the team tickets run below 100, after a team tickets hit 100 or less you cant switch teams, they switched just because the team was losing,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I`ve also noticed when playing with friends you can sometimes end up on the opposite teams and its understandable that you wan`t to be on the same team as your friends and you try to switch asap, but this was not the case, these players are switching teams
 just before the losing teams ticket count hit 100,</p>
<p>Instead of starting a new thread on the same subject i may as well add it here,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am noticing the there are more and more player doing this, i`ve seen this being on the &nbsp;winning and losing teams when the winning team is on around 500 - 400 tickets remaining and the losing team is about to hit 100 tickets, players will just switch to
 the winning &nbsp;teams if they can</p>
