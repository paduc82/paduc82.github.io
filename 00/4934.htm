                    I'd like advice re: keeping someone who stole my cell phone from infiltrating my 'life'.&nbsp;&nbsp; The police don't give a ****.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a trace on it, but he has 99.9% likely sold it already.&nbsp; I just paid a LOT of money for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am SICK.

            <p>I was thinking that it would be easier to include a link to the excel file within an outlook message. I would like to use outlook to control the list of users and track progress as each user completes his or her task. &nbsp;Another approach might be be to include
 a list of hyperlinked users in the body of the Email that would forward the email when clicked.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">My advice is do not uninstall/reinstall or revert to an older version.</span></strong><br />
I did not have any trouble with Coinmarketcap.com. Let's start with the basics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Excel menu and choose About Excel. You should have version 16.14.1 but if you don't it's easy to install the update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</span></strong><span>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes unless you also update your add-ins to the latest update. Install updates for these programs if you have them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't say what steps you took that failed to return the data you wanted. If you are still running into trouble after you install 16.14.1 then please reply with the steps you are taking and describe the result you would like to achieve. Thanks.</p>

            The 2008 virtual machine logging is disabled is refusing to enable logging. I changed services to automatic startup and rebooted. Still no logging. Someone else will haveta fix that for me.

<p>
</p><p>The ProcMon idea was just a simple way of discovering what the update was trying to do.&nbsp; An alternative would be using more primitive tools to find out what had changed.&nbsp; E.g. in a cmd window you could try&nbsp; dir/a/s&nbsp; |&nbsp; find&nbsp; "2017-01-03&nbsp; 13:"&nbsp; |&nbsp; sort&nbsp; and
 then find some file names that the update would have changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the find argument would be coded according to your circumstances.</p>

    <title>Rules Do Not Match - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john m schneider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rules Do Not Match</h2>
                    <p>Company just upgraded from Office 2010 to 2013.&nbsp; Every time I go to manage my rules and alerts, I get the message:</p>
<p>"The rules on this computer do not match the rules on Microsoft Exchange.&nbsp; Only one set of rules can be kept.&nbsp; You will usually want to keep the rules on the server.&nbsp; Which rules do you want to keep?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time I saw this message yesterday after the upgrade, I selected "Server".&nbsp; I then went to view the rules, and they were all in alphabetical order.&nbsp; This would completely ruin the way I use rules and the way I have them organized.&nbsp; I cancelled out
 of that window and went in again clicking on the "Client" button.&nbsp; This brought up all the rules I had previously, and in the correct order.&nbsp; Once I made a change, I got the progress bar showing that it was uploading the rules to the server.&nbsp; However, every
 time I go back to Manage Rules, I get the same client/server challenge prompt.&nbsp; FWIW, these are all client-side rules, that move messages from my Exchange Inbox to specific folders in my PST.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also noticed that when I view the rules from the server, my inactive rules are missing.&nbsp; I have some rules that are unchecked, but will activate them at certain times of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done some searches on this topic, and all I can find is the Knowledge Base article that talks about having two versions of Outlook accessing the same Exchange account.&nbsp; This is not my issue.&nbsp; I only have the one version of Outlook accessing my account
 on the Exchange server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to bypass the "Rules Do Not Match" prompt, and force Outlook to always use my client-side rules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    I cancelled a meeting I was the organizer on. &nbsp;In the rush of things I clicked do not send attendees update without thinking. &nbsp;Now quite a few people have the meeting notice on their calendar but I can not recover the original meeting to cancel it properly.
 &nbsp;Is this possible? &nbsp;I have located the original meeting on my sent box and tried dragging it to my calendar but I get an error message stating that the organizer does not need to respond.

            <p>Hi Mohan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already cancelled the meeting without sending the update. &nbsp;Now the meeting notice in on everyone's calendar but I do not have it on my calendar. &nbsp;I would like to be able to put it back on my calendar so that I can properly cancel the meeting but I have
 not figured out how to. &nbsp;I tried adding it from the sent folder and delete folder but it would not allow me to because I am the organizer. &nbsp;Is it possible to recover this meeting notice on my calendar?</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately when I open it there it does not give me the option to cancel. &nbsp;It is acting as if I am just an attendee. &nbsp;I tried to added it to my calendar again and it said the organizer does not need to accept the meeting notice. &nbsp;It is quite a conundrum.
 &nbsp;I am not sure if there is a fix.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Display name not showing correctly</h2>
                    <p>I recently setup a new account for work. I accidentally set my Display Name to iTek instead of iTEK. I changed this, but when I sent emails, the name still shows as iTek. I have signed out of my account and back in and it shows as iTEK, but still does not
 show this way when I sent emails. It has been about 1 hour, since I changed it to the correct format, so I don't think that it is something that just needs to be synced. Also, I just changed the Display Name to Jason and sent a test email and it still showed
 iTek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas of why my emails are not showing the new display name?</p>

            Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
We know that when using the Heading style in Word, an arrow appears beside the Heading text. It is used as an indication that the text beside it expandable. Currently, we don't have a way to remove this arrow because it was set up by design. However, it is
 good to have an option wherein you can remove this arrow or at least able to change it to another one. We would appreciate if you can send this as a feedback to our Office Word Team using our
<strong><a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-for-windows-desktop-application/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word Suggestion Box</a></strong> so that they could add it in the future updates.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<p>You do not stop this behavior in Word 2013 or 2016.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought compatibility mode for a prior version would do it. Nope, not even saving in .doc format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could use headings that really are not headings but bold body text. That is shooting yourself in the foot, though.

</p><p>Protecting the document for no changes or filling in forms does not stop collapsing headings.</p>

<p>Hi dugashby,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, could you please share with us the following information?</p>
<ol>
<li>When did the issue occur? Did it work well before? </li><li>Let us know differences between these problematic users and the others. </li><li>If you just tick one option, does the issue still persist? </li><li>Are these problematic user pure online users or on-premise users? </li><li>How many users are effected by the issue? </li></ol>
<p>I notice in the link thread, after assigning a new <b>user role</b> to the mailbox, the issue disappeared. So we suggest you create a new
<b>user role</b> with all options ticked and then assign it to problematic uses to see whether the issue can be resolved. Here’re my detailed steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a> with admin credentials.
</li><li>Navigate to <b>permissions</b> &gt; <b>user roles</b>, create a new user role with all options ticked.
</li><li>Navigate to <b>recipients</b> &gt; <b>mailboxes</b> &gt; <b>mailbox features</b> &gt; <b>
Role assignment policy</b>, choose the new user role. </li></ol>
<p>Any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>1.)I don't know when it stopped/started</p>
<p>2.)There seems to be no logic between the users - one has a purely Exchnage Online plan, and another has small business premium</p>
<p>3.)Just ticking first option allows the wizard to complete.</p>
<p>4.)One user purely uses online/mobile, another uses Office Suite locally</p>
<p>5.)Unknown</p>
<p>6.) I cannot add a new user role - I assume this is because I am using Office 365 Small Business Premium?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi dugashby,</p>
<p>Are there only two users affected by the issue? What about other users?</p>
<p>About #3, if you just tick the second option, does the issue persist?</p>
<p>User role is a basic feature of Office 365, so it doesn’t matter which plan you are using. Did you refer to the steps above to create a new user role? And is there any error information? If so, please share with us a screenshot. To upload the
 screenshot in the forum, please click&nbsp;<b>Use rich formatting</b> and then the<b> Insert/Edit Media</b> icon.</p>
<p>If available, we appreciate it if you could use another admin account to access

Exchange admin center</a> (eac) for a test.</p>
<p>Note: before create a new user role, you need to assign the admin permission. In EAC &gt; permissions &gt; admin roles &gt; Organization Management, add the admin as a member of it.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to get the file creation date from within XLS file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I have an Excel file that was supposedly created on 2011.</p>
<p>I'm sure it was manipulated so to show this specific date.</p>
<p>With VBA procedures, third-party&nbsp;software utilities&nbsp;and so on, it is possible to change MS-DOS dates and even document statistics&nbsp;and Information dates&nbsp;inside Excel (File &gt;Document Properties, Statistics tab).</p>
<p>Besides that, is there a way to show the real creation date inside the XLS file?</p>
<p>By opening an XLS with Notepad, one can see plenty of information in plain text and in machine code. Would there by this information located in the file anywhere?</p>
<p>I very appreciated your help.</p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>

I get the following error message:<br />

 the bottom half of the "Add-on Type" text and a horizontal scrollbar covers the category text in the right pane. My guess is this issue is somehow linked to the McAfee SiteAdvisor browser add-on which I've removed from IE and reinstalled without adding it.
 No change. Thanks in advance for any assistance.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Troubleshooting a problem like this would involve (among other steps) disabling add-ons and third-party programs to see if one of them is causing the problem. Disabling Site Advisor would be a good place to start.</p>
<p>The Smartscreen Filter (IE Command Bar&gt; Safety...) is comparable to the Site Advisor if you can't resolve the issue without disabling Site Advisor.</p>
<p>1. See if a browser add-on is causing the problem. <br />
Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
If the problem goes away,&nbsp;an add-on is causing it.&nbsp;</p>

                    Using the "Columns" settings under the Advanced View Settings for my To-Do list, I have selected 3 columns to display in the Tasklist on my To-Do Bar: (1) Subject; (2) Due Date; and (3) Complete.&nbsp; Under the Columns settings, I have set the maximum number
 of lines to display in compact mode as 2.&nbsp; What I would like to see when I look at my task list in the To-Do bar is the subject, due date, and check-box (for completing tasks).&nbsp; All that displays is the subject and check box.&nbsp; If I click on an entry, such
 that it highlights in purple, then the due date does display, underneath the subject.&nbsp; I would like for the due date to display for all entries without having to click on them.&nbsp; Is this possible?&nbsp; In the previous version of Outlook that I used, you could select
 as many columns as you wanted, and they would all display, up to the width of the To-Do bar, but I can't seem to recreate this in Outlook 2010.

 problem still existed. It did: same behavior, same stuck at boot logo screen. On a guess, I went into BIOS and changed the boot settings from UEFI to Legacy and restarted. The Yoga 2 Pro now now booted up and proceeded to load Windows 10 , however the 18298
 build did not take. It reverted to the 1809 release version that I had used to get the laptop at least functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that at least on this forum, others are having similar problems. This may be of help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reported this 2 days ago on the feedback forum. I have yet to see and acknowledgement from MS of the problem which
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">does</span> produce an unusable computer.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t download Visio 2013 -- Microsoft Account problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bornabruin1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t download Visio 2013 -- Microsoft Account problem</h2>
                    <p>We purchased a license for Visio 2013 Standard last Friday. &nbsp;My user and I are trying to get to the download the software on her PC but are having problems with Microsoft Accounts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She already has and uses Office 365 uses on a daily basis. We don't use Microsoft Accounts for Office 365, so the user logs to Office 365 using an Office 365 account. That part works fine. &nbsp;So we go to the http://www.office.com/setup site to download Visio
 2013. &nbsp;It asks for the user to enter her Microsoft Account. &nbsp;She enters her email address which she thought was her Microsoft Account name. &nbsp;It tells her:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;"That Microsoft account doesn't exist, enter a new account or get a new one.": &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/983c79f1-f8f0-4ea2-9b18-b4460473b53b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/983c79f1-f8f0-4ea2-9b18-b4460473b53b" /></a></p>
<p>Assuming that her Microsoft account doesn't exist we follow the link to create a new account. &nbsp;On the Create Microsoft page, she enters her Email address, and receives an the error: "It looks like there's already an account with &lt;email goes here&gt;. &nbsp;If it
 you, go back and sign in. Otherwise chose another user name.": &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/480c54e9-28e6-4855-b52e-621f9ce4c397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/480c54e9-28e6-4855-b52e-621f9ce4c397" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the Microsoft Account Sign In page says she doesn't have a Microsoft Account that is associated with her Email address, but the Create Microsoft Account page she can't create a new account because she already has a Microsoft Account associated with her
 Email address. &nbsp;Aside from the Douglas Adams-like conundrum here, this is a bit distressing -- you can't download Visio because you don't have a Microsoft Account but you can't sign up for a Microsoft account because you already have one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ever seen the Microsoft Account Sign In and Create Account pages contradict each other like this? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening here and how can we get the her Microsoft ID going and Visio 2013 downloaded? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can lend,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eric&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to confirm if this user have two accounts with the same email address (one in Azure AD &amp; one Microsoft account). For example:</p>

<p>Then&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(65, 66, 78, 1)">if you try to sign up for a Microsoft app&nbsp;</span><em>that
 supports personal and work/school accounts</em><span style="color: rgba(65, 66, 78, 1)">, you should see the message below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf73066d-d020-4868-8d24-88b918fba153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf73066d-d020-4868-8d24-88b918fba153" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(65, 66, 78, 1)">I suggest this user to create a new Microsoft account with new email address. Then confirm if she can download Visio or not.</span></p>
<p>

<p>The user only has one account -- a Office 365 account. &nbsp;When she tried to log in with her email (the Office 365 Email) she got the error that the Microsoft account did not exist and to try creating account. &nbsp;When she then tried to create a Microsoft account
 and this triggered an error saying that that account was already in use. &nbsp;So she could never create the Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The important part is that we want to have the Visio 2013 license associated with the company not with a user's personal Microsoft Account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We resolved the problem by creating a company Microsoft Account and using the company Microsoft Account using that account to download and install the software. &nbsp;I don't know if this is a good long term solution if I add more software licenses to that Microsoft
 Account, but it is working for now.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>PC Suite mode not available on Nokia N73 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djgeorgie  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Suite mode not available on Nokia N73</h2>
                    Hello folks,<br />
Recently I bought Nokia N73 from eBay. The problem came when I tryed to connect the device to my PC. I installed the software from the original Nokia software cd, and then plugged the USB cable into the phone and into the USB port of my computer. The dialog
 popped up asking me to select the mode of the phone, but for my big surprise, among the modes there was no option "PC Suite". The available options are "Mass storage", "Webcam" and "Com Port".<br />
Is there a way to solve this problem in order to use my phone with PC Suite for transfering files/music/data from my computer to the Nokia device? I tryed with all available modes, but none of them worked with PC Suite software.<br />
<br />
P.S. I reset the phone to its factory default settings, but this did not solve the problem.

Are you sure your N73 is real and not one of the many fakes that are now on ebay?

            Hi,<br />
Thank you for the information, may you tell me is there any way to recognise the fake phone by other things, not only by the software?<br />
When i type the following commands I get:<br />
*#0000#:<br />
v2.0628.0.0.1<br />
06-27-2007<br />
rm-133<br />
Nokia N73 (11)<br />
<br />

            That firmware version and date looks wrong. Personally I think you have a fake N73.<br />
<br />
Check the N73's product and support pages on this site to see if it looks exactly like your phone.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway you can take a picture of your phone (with it's display lit), upload it to a site like
<a href="http://www.tinypic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.tinypic.com</a> and paste a link to it here?

            I think there is something suspicious going on.<br />
<br />
Psycho's right about the date but might not be 100% fake.<br />
<br />
I think you have a fake (my observation), but i think a picture will prove everything.<br />
<br />
Your IMEI is identified as fake aswell.<br />

I know this is an old thread (just bumped up by someone else adding to it) but that date
<i>does</i> look 100% fake.<br />
<br />
Nokia is a European firm and the date that appears when you use *#0000# is always in European notation. "06-27-2007" is in American notation, which is a dead giveaway.<br />
<br />
There is no doubt about it, this is yet another fake sold on eBay. They're becoming the rule rather than the exception now.
