<h2>            Screen Flickering</h2>
                    I'm not sure how to describe it, or even if there is a problem: Build14905_prerelease160811. Sometimes, when loading the OS, the screen "blinks" a few times before it settles down. It's not a flicker, and it happens every now and then, not always. Does
 it have anything to do with automatic updating?

            I am running my test system with an old Nvidia GT 520 card and every once in awhile screen goes blank then it starts working. I am not going to invest any money for a new card for the test computer right now. As long as it works I am satisfied.

            Hello. My name is Eric Farmer, and I am an Independent Microsoft Adviser. I can answer your question about emails.
<br />
<br />The sad truth is email scammers have a lot of ways to spoof emails and try to make them appear more authentic. The best thing to do is to send these emails to spam and continue on with your day.
<br />
<br />This support article from Microsoft goes over some things you can do about this issue.

<br />There are several security procedures that mail systems have that filter a large amount of this type of mail misinformed, but many evade security.
<br />As a final client, you can prevent this from happening by adding email addresses and domains to the list of blocked senders, or inbox rules, in your own mail, thus creating more security where you can prevent them from coming to you. messages.

            Scammers have their intentions, whether to advertise something or get you to visit some website. Try to avoid them. 
<br />They have your email in their list and probably you will keep receiving them.

            Hi saroli ,  
<br />My name is Victor. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for letting us your issue.
<br />
<br />I just suggest to you to do the following:
<br />
<br />Block a mail sender:
<br />
<br />Outlook for Office 365 Outlook 2019 Outlook 2016 Outlook 2013 Outlook 2010
<br />
<br />The Outlook Junk Email Filter checks message senders against lists of email addresses and Internet domains designated either as safe or to be blocked. You can customize the filter to block or allow senders or different message types.
<br />
<br />a message from the sender you want to block, and then click Junk &gt; Block Sender.
<br />
<br />Block Sender command in the message list
<br />
<br />The blocked person can still send you mail, but if anything from his or her email address makes it to your email account, it’s immediately moved to the Junk Email folder.
<br />
<br />You can also:
<br />
<br />Add unwanted names to the Blocked Senders List
<br />Add trusted names to the Safe Senders or Safe Recipients Lists
<br />Block messages from particular country/region codes
<br />Block messages in unfamiliar alphabets
<br />
<br />Check:

            Hi saroli,, how are you?
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community! My name is Alessandro. I am an independent consultant and I am here to help you!
<br />
<br />When reporting the sending of the odd subscription mail I advise you not to reply any strange email and do not click on any link. This would be an attempt by someone to want to hack into your account and then recommend that you report to the Microsoft account research industry for verification and analysis.
<br />
<br />For this I suggest that you use the Phishing Attempt tool. The true sender will be registered as Scammer and Microsoft will block it and other necessary steps within their policies to protect their clients' account.
<br />
<br />We remind you that phishing is not cause for major concerns, but caution and prudence on your part as long as you do not click on the links or provide personal information to the sender.
<br />
<br />If you have questions about how to protect your account, please review this article "Learn how to deal with abuse, phishing, or spam in the
<br />Outlook.com ". Link:<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-Outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deal-w...</a>
<br />
<br />So you should send all the information you have in the hands of the address and domain of the suspicious email to: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
<br />
<br />After this procedure, change your password using the steps on this page. We also suggest that you change your access password and set up a postpaid mobile number to ensure your security or enable 2FA code to increase your security.
<br />
<br />I hope that I have helped you with this information, it was a pleasure to attend to you and request that if you enjoyed the service leave your positive feedback on the button below.

<h3> karyn4319  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sort and filter by the first 5 numbers&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying sort and filter column A using part #'s and letters.. problem when I sort and&nbsp;filter&nbsp;it shows the parts with letters last.&nbsp; I need to sort and filter by the first 5 numbers of the 8 numbers..&nbsp; for example part # 12345xx1 and 56788999.. the sort
 and the filter are showing the 56788999 first instead of the 12345xx1..&nbsp; I put a helper in column B&nbsp;to pull the first 5 numbers, and I can sort by that, but then because I'm hiding this column from others.. I really need to be able to filter and sort column
 A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to sort and filter column A by the first 5 numbers?&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions we be
<font>appreciated.</font>.. Thank you for the help..

            You could use VBA to force a <i>text-to-text</i>&nbsp;comparison, leaving <i>12345A</i>&nbsp;below
<i>123456</i>&nbsp;but before <i>234567</i>. Since you've offered no sorting criteria beyond the first 5 characters, it would seem that there is no preferred order beyond that criteria.
<div><br />
<div>Tap <i>Alt+F11</i>&nbsp;and when the VBE opens, immediately use the pull-down menus to
<i>Insert, Module</i>&nbsp;(aka <i>Alt+I, M</i>). Paste the following into the new pane titled something like
<i>Book1 - Module1 (Code)</i>,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub mcr_Custom_Sort()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim x As Long, y As Long, lr As Long, lc As Long</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim bAsc As Boolean, tmp As Variant</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; bAsc = True</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActiveSheet.Cells(1, 1).CurrentRegion</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lc = .Columns.Count</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lr = .Rows.Count</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For x = 2 To lr - 1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For y = x + 1 To lr</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If (Cells(x, 1).Text &gt; Cells(y, 1).Text And bAsc) Or _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Cells(x, 1).Text &lt; Cells(y, 1).Text And Not bAsc) Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tmp = .Cells(x, 1).Resize(1, lc)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Cells(x, 1).Resize(1, lc) = .Cells(y, 1).Resize(1, lc).Value</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Cells(y, 1).Resize(1, lc) = tmp</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next y</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next x</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Modify the third line if you prefer a descending sort (e.g. <i>bAsc = False</i>).&nbsp;Tap
<i>Alt+Q</i>&nbsp;to return to your worksheet. Tap <i>Alt+F8</i>&nbsp;to open the <i>Macros</i>&nbsp;dialog and
<i><u>R</u>un</i>&nbsp;the macro.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A quick pseudo-button to run the macro could be double-clicking on A1. Right-click the worksheet's name tab and chose
<i>View Code</i>. When the VBE reopens, paste the following into the pane titled something like
<i>Book1 - Sheet1 (Code)</i>,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Private Sub Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick(ByVal Target As Range, Cancel As Boolean)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If Target.Address = "$A$1" Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cancel = True</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Call mcr_Custom_Sort</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End If</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again tap <i>Alt+Q</i>&nbsp;to return to your worksheet. Double-click A1 to run the macro.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I have a similar question.&nbsp; In our company we use Excel extensively to create macro enabled workbooks that connect to multiple backend databases like MS SQL, Oracle and MySQL.&nbsp; I have notice some of my clients write maco enabled workbooks that will expire
 and not let them be used after a typical cycle of 90 days when a new release of the Excel template releases.&nbsp; Do you know how one can set an expiration date on a Microsoft Excel template that has macros and database connections into it?&nbsp;
</p>

            If you don't know how to search for updated drivers and install them, You would be better off finding someone who can, I can give you one tip Power down the laptop, remove the battery and unplug the power adapter, when you have that done hold the power
 button down for 10-15 sec's, now plug in the power adapter and turn the laptop on, when it has finish booting, check to see if the WiFi is working also look for a WiFi switch, &nbsp;if you post the model I can give you more info, if after booting you can reinstall
 the battery, let us know.

            Are you using Account Right? Did you check with MYOB to see if that software is compatible with Outlook 2016 before you upgraded? I checked the MYOB website and it indicates MYOB released AccountRight V19.11.2 at the end of February and that it is compatible
 with Outlook 2016. So, if you're not using the latest version, it's no wonder you're having trouble. It's always prudent to check the compatibility of add-ins before upgrading Office software so you do't get bitten.

</p><p>However if I now go in to outlook 2016 for Mac on my laptop or outlook on my iPhone send an email the signature does not attach to the email.</p>

            voicemail is a divert so when you miss a call its diverted to voicemail

<p>I guess it also depends on phone operator and model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I live in Brazil and I had to deactivate my operator's voicemail. My C6-01 displayed the "call diverted" message for every call I made (I mean calls to standard phone numbers, not to the voicemail number). The only way to stop my C6-01 from flashing the
 "call diverted" message was to deactivate the voicemail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My last phone was a 5530XM and it also displayed the "call diverted" message if the operator's voicemail was activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I know from previous searches, among the four operators available on Brazil, my operator, Claro, is the only one that causes the "call diverted" message to be displayed for any type of call made, if the voicemail is activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife has a Nokia 3710 fold, a S40 device, and it doesn't display "call diverted", even with the voicemail activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, from my experience, S60 and Symbian^3 phones both have the "call diverted" problem, at least on my operator. And S40 phones don't have this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh it displays that whenever i make a call - very annoying. I guess it is just telling me that I have a divert set up - to my answerphone. Well, I don't need it to tell me that every time I make a call so how do I switch it off?</p>

            It does not mean your calls are getting diverted. You get this message when you have set up divert options. It just indicates that your divert options have been set up.

            <p><span>Hello Bennet,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are working to make Windows 10 available for devices with compressed operating systems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this current stage of Technical Preview, however, there is still more work left for our teams to deliver a great experience for users with compressed operating systems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is why we are currently blocking upgrades.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This block only occurs if you try to upgrade on a compressed operating system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This block is not related to how much disk space you have.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>This means that if you’re brave enough, you can still install the latest build of Tech Preview by performing a clean install using media created from the ISO file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you do, please make sure that all the drivers your device needs are available for reinstall afterwards.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You should also be aware that after performing the clean install, your new OS will no longer be a compressed operating system, so you will lose significant disk space.</span>

Which operating system are you using?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The iexplore.exe file for internet explorer is stored in c: drive. You may try clicking the exe file and check if
 you are able to launch internet explorer. You may check for the exe file at the below mentioned path–</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If the explorer works using the exe file then y<span>ou may also right click the same file listed
 above and create a shortcut on the desktop for the ease of accessing the Internet Explorer and check if that works.</span></span></strong></p>

<h2>            X2-02&#58; How to adjust the volume of the alarm clock&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>There are + and - buttons on the right side of Nokia X2-02 which you can use for adjusting the volume. Using these buttons you can adjust every application, accept the alarm clock. There isn't also an extra option in the advanced menu of Alarm clock
 for volume adjusting. While ringing the alarm cannot be adjust using the + and - buttons because when you press them, the alarm just snoozes. The + and - buttons while you are in the alarm menu don't adjust the volume too. But when you set the radio as alarm
 clock then it works - the volume is so loud as the phone ringing settings. There is also no extra option in the Settings menu for the alarm clock.</span></p>

<p><span>Is this a Nokia bug or just software imperfection? My old Nokia 5220, which has older software, has more functions than this Nokia.</span></p>

<h2>            How to set if condition in excel VBA by using Range method&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have column A and B. I specifically want to use the Range method (instead of cells method) to set a condition - if figures in column A&nbsp;&nbsp;does not equal to&nbsp;0, then column B equal to column A, &nbsp;but the below VBA code does not work. Does anyone have any advices?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub test()<br />
A = Range("A2").End(xlDown).Row<br />
B = Range("B2").End(xlDown).Row</p>
<p>If Cells(2, A) &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
Cells(2, B) = Cells(2, A)<br />
End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>

<h2>            Append Query - Data type Mismatch</h2>
                    <br />
Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have an append query that has just been working perfectly fine until I had to alter two fields data type as these two fields are now the many side of a one table.<br />
&nbsp;I have my tblDocuments - PK is docProjectNo (Text) and also PK docDocNo (Text)&nbsp; <br />
the field names that are causing the problem are;<br />
field name 1; tblDocuments.docType and this is the many side from another table called tblType<br />
field name 2: tblDocuments.docDiscipline and this is also the many side from another table called tblDiscipline.<br />
<br />
I had to change these fields to Number (Field Size "Long Interger")&nbsp; to match the data type in the one side of the linking tables. But now my Append Query wont' append to my table tblDocuments.&nbsp; I changed the data type in the Append query to "Long" to match
 the data type but I keep getting the following error.<br />
<br />
<b>"Data type mismatch in criteria expression"</b><br />
<br />
I don't know where I am going wrong here, can someone give me a fresh pair of eyes please.&nbsp; I am using an unbound form for the append query to read the data from to be added to the tblDocuments.<br />
<br />
SQL below;<br />
<br />

            Hi Tom<br />
<br />
well I don't know what happened, but it must have had a bug as it now works fine today when I tested it.... I knew I couldn't see anything wrong with the code.&nbsp; But thanks for offering to help.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that sometimes when we change code in already up and running Append queries and forms etc , that sometimes they don't like it and it takes a while for them to accept the change or you have to redo the form that it relates to. so anyhow, it fixed itself
 and is all up and running smoothly today.<br />
<br />
thanks your offer of help was much appreciated.<br />
<br />

            I had this error in my Append Query, turns out it was not criteria but actually an attempt to insert an 'X' into a Boolean (bit) column.&nbsp; Target table was an SQL Server linked table.&nbsp; I fixed the error by using a VBA 'clean' procedure to clean-up the raw
 data before import.

                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 without difficulty. Everything worked. Now when I use my email software, Office Outlook 2007, some strange things happen.</p>
<p>I have a distribution list but when I try to send to that list, I get the error message "an unexpected error has occurred." There is nothing I can do except click on "OK" and try again but I get the same message. Thinking that I must have a bogus email address
 within the distribution list, I sent individual messages to each to confirm the email address and all said it was correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this worked initially but now not at all. What went wrong? Should I change to another email software program? and if so, which one will allow me to keep all the existing emails and addresses without completely starting over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dan</p>

                    I would like to view/create a resource utilization chart for projects. The Resource Graph only show one resource at a time and uses so much screen real state. I would like to see resource utilization througout the project; from day 1 until the end of the

<h2>            How to close my skype account of 5 different devices&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm Julian from Costa Rica<br />
<br />
I pay the Skype calling service, I had previously shared my Skype password with 3 work colleagues, I changed the password so that no one could use my profile but he told me that if they do not leave the application they can continue using the service. How do
 I close the assignment of all devices?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your answers

    <title>Silent mode in Nokia 2730 Classic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin9x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Silent mode in Nokia 2730 Classic</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 2730 Classic. Two doubts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I put the phone in silent mode with virbration is turned off, no sound is heard. (But with vibration turned "on") The sound is still somewhat audible when I get an incoming call or SMS. Is this normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is there any way to set a timer for switching between "general" profile and "silent" profile. E.g I want the phone to switch to the "Silent" profile at 10 A.M daily and switch back to the "General" profile at 4 P.M?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Is it the ringing tone that sounds or the sound created by the vibrating feature (like a drone..) which may be normal&nbsp;?</p>
<p>2. There are 3rd party applications for sceduling the profiles but unfortunately none are compatible with your device with series 40 platform..</p>

<p>1. Yes I mean the vibrating feature. (the ring tone is already switched off). Only when this vibrating feature is off, then the phone does not make a slight sound. The sound is audible even when it is in my pocket or in my hand or on a hard surface like
 a table.</p>
<p>Any solution to this? I want it to vibrate, but without the slightest sound. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Well, ok thanks.</p>

            I've new 2730 classic. . . This cell makes me annoyed every time when a msg appears in the bottom of inbox without MSG ICON and SUBJECT LINE (only the name of sender appears) and I can't delete it because every time I delete it, MEG CORRUPTED, COULDN'T
 BE DELETED pop up windows appears. I've reset it many times but it does not work (restart works but it does not feel good to restart this cell 4 to 5 times in a week:-P) and the 2nd problem I've with this cell, whenever I open internet related features like
 Opera mini, the size of Images folder on Local drive starts increasing from 0KB to 2KB and from 2KB to 5KB and so on without showing any contents in folder:-/... Here also Master reset works to bring the folder size 0KB. . .<br />
Is there any solution for this cell or do I need to just ignor

            It may simply be because the vibration is stronger than on your old phones, or due to the materials used. Lower vibration levels.

<p>@al_haq - Since when you are facing the problem (Since you bought the phone or recently?) If there are many messages in the Inbox (Received/Sent/ Draft) delete as many as possible..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and some suggessions since you are new to the forum.. First search for posts of similar problem by entering keywords in the box (next to Nokia Support Discussion) and if you do not find suitable post then 'Start&nbsp; new topic'... In the existing case you have
 posted an altogether different problem under the Subject : Silent mode in Nokia 2730 Classic..</p>

<p>Well, then I guess I have to keep the vibration "off" also in silent mode whenever I want the phone to be completely silent, It's unfortunate though to have the disadvantage of missing incoming calls or messages. Thanks for the replies anyway.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Office 2016 with Visio Standard 2013?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if your Office 2016 is click-to-Run version which is part of an Office 365 subscription or purchased as a suite of applications such as Office Professional 2016, Office Home and Student 2016, or Office Home and Business 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, please upgrade your Visio Standard 2013 to Visio 2016 app to work with Office 2016. Because&nbsp;the click-to-run version Office 2016&nbsp;<strong>cannot coexist</strong> on the same computer as standalone Office 2013 applications. For detailed
 information about it, please refer to:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-Stop-you-should-wait-to-install-Office-2016-We-ll-have-to-remove-the-following-if-you-continue-a225347f-e102-4ea6-9796-5d1ac5220c3b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-Stop-you-should-wait-to-install-Office-2016-We-ll-have-to-remove-the-following-if-you-continue-a225347f-e102-4ea6-9796-5d1ac5220c3b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this issue, you'll need to upgrade your standalone applications to the Office 2016 version of the products. Please contact
