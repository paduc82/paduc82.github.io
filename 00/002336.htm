<h2>            Recent Install Office 2016 for Mac now won&#39;t open documents. Application stalls, not responding.</h2>
                    <p>I installed Office 2016 for Mac on my new MacBook last week. It's worked fine until this morning. It won't open any documents in Word and Excel. It also has no record of recent documents open despite my daily use of Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to open the document after launching the application. I have also tried to open the document by directly clicking on it. The wheel comes up and spins and eventually I get a message that there is an error and asks if I want to report it. It shows
 up as not responding if I look at it under Force Quit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this problem? I am wondering if I need to reinstall it but have no idea what happened to it since last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 my first smartphone ever</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there, this is my first smartphone ever (after being technically without a phone for over three years using a friend's basic phone, nokia x1) and I'm really excited to get the gorgeous Lumia 920.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any tips, dos and don'ts on first time getting it? Sorry if it appears dumb, I'm a technical PC guy but totally stone age when it comes to phones :smileytongue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've heard from some that these have usually lot of bloatware pre-installed which can't be removed unless the phone is formatted and wiped clean to facotry settings, is that any true and recommeneded to do it? any other advice for a first timer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seems rather extreme, you can "<em><strong>unpin</strong></em>" anything you don't want to see and "<em><strong>longpress</strong></em>" to remove applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However once all your contact data is in the "Cloud" it is remarkably easy to replace all data upon reset device or any other Windows Phone for that matter.</p>

<p>Hi, and welcome..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would start off by going to outlook.com and creating a Microsoft account if you do not have one yet. A Windows Phone will sync all contacts and calendar entries to and from this account and you can actually set up everything here before you even have the
 phone. Link your Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIN accounts to this account and when you have all this set up all you need to do is register the phone with this account when first starting it and all your contacts will sync to the phone ready to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read up on Skydrive and have whatever you need access to on a more or less regular basis, including Office documents there. Again as soon as you register your phone with your Microsoft account all these files will instantly become available to you on the
 phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Phone is a very Internet centric phone, having a constant data connection is a pre and will maximise the usability of the phone. Sign in to any Wi-Fi connection you encounter ona regular basis to automatically use it when you are in range. This will
 generally not apply to 'open' free WiFi hotspots which require singing in. Unsecured/open connections will not auto connect..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you get the basic setup right, changing this afterwards will usually require a device reset. If at all possible select a carrier who will provide internet settings on the SIM as this will allow you to restore data written to your account using
 the in built backup function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, look before you leap and ask questions. You'll find a lot of people here more that willing to help you out if you have any questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's really only a problem on Android smartphones. Barring the built-in apps like Calculator, Calendar or Phone, you can uninstall apps from the phone's manufacturer or your carrier. See the page "<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-CA/how-to/wp8/apps/delete-or-reinstall-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Deleting
 or reinstalling apps</a>" for more details. And if you ever want these apps back, you'll find them in a special section of the Store on your phone. For example, if you uninstalled HERE Drive+, you would open the Store app, go to the Nokia Collection section
 and download the app again. You can also download paid apps for free once they're bought.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
You can browse the app store from your computer and send apps to your phone that way. Simply visit
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/store." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.windowsphone.com/store.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that modern smartphones are very powerful compared to the phones of yesteryear, so they do need to be charged more often. I have to charge my Lumia 920 every night, especially due to the fact I live and work in areas with weak network signals.</p>
<p>Once you sign into the phone with a Microsoft account, that account will be used to automatically back up contacts and calendars so you never lose them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to start using your smartphone as a navigation device, you'll want to download maps of your region to save on data if you have a cellular data limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any more questions, ask them here for more Nokia/Lumia hardware-related questions or
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8?tab=all">
Microsoft Community</a> for questions more focused on Windows Phone itself. There's also a Help app preinstalled on your phone and finally, the
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Phone help website</a> has a lot of good info to get started and answers common questions about the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll end this post with some cool free apps that you might want to check out. If you come to this forum on your phone and tap these links, you'll be taken straight to the Store, which is the only way to get the apps I've marked as "(phone only)"</p>

<h3> ruslan abyshov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring 10572</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone! Want to tell you about my expirience installing and restoring WM 10 10572.</p>
<p>I had Lumia 830 with previous Insiders build. After 10572 was released I restored my phone to stock WP 8.1.</p>
<p>After that I've updated to&nbsp;Insiders&nbsp;10572. </p>
<p>Then I wanted to make Hard reset to stock settings of new system. After first phone&nbsp;reboot there were no signs of live - black blank screen with low level of backlit only. I wait for 10-15 minutes. No result. I thought&nbsp;phone became a 'brick'. I restored
 to WP 8.1 again and then to 10572 and Hard reset again! Yes it took long time. And again black screen without live. But I wait longer and finally saw first installing steps with acoount info etc.</p>
<p>New problem - have no cellular data! SIM-profile didn't installed properly. Only after installing a phone with&nbsp;Wi-Fi&nbsp;and rebooting it I could apply new SIM profile and 4G finally works.</p>
<p>After all everything is OK and this story is my&nbsp;personal report only!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why there we could not restore our backups fom OneDrive without applying Hard reset?</p>

<p>Though there is a way of Downloading the applications from OVI onto your PC..as its not a method recommended by Nokia, we can not discuss here. In fact there were a no. of threads on this Forum mentioning this method.. but slowly, the Mods are removing the

    <title>Table cells and ThreeD property&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mel turco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table cells and ThreeD property&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How can I apply a 3D effect to a table cell, such as Bevel?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It CAN be done manually using native commands, but I can't figure out the code to do it. I wrote code below, but I get the object doesn't support it...</p>
<p>Sub CellBevel()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oSh As Shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oSh = ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With oSh.Table.Cell(9, 1).Shape.ThreeD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .BevelTopType = msoBevelCircle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .BevelTopInset = 6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .BevelTopDepth = 6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Mel,</p>
<p>Your basic problem is that you're trying to treat the table cells as shapes, which they're not. Try something based on:</p>
<p>Sub CellBevel()<br />
If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) = True Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Selection.Tables(1).Cell(9, 1).Borders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .OutsideLineStyle = wdLineStyleEngrave3D ' or wdLineStyleEmboss3D<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .OutsideLineWidth = wdLineWidth150pt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Your basic problem is that you're trying to treat the table cells as shapes, which they're not.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays, Thursdays and alternate Sundays, true.&nbsp; The rest of the time, when they feel like behaving, they are.&nbsp; Or rather each cell has a .Shape property.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the object model for tables still has a few parts they never connected up back
 at the code factory.&nbsp; You can set the shape (ie, the cell) fill and some other properties but not all of the properties a shape&nbsp;would ordinarily have.</p>
<p>Mel's&nbsp; on the right track.&nbsp; It just doesn't lead where you'd expect it to. &lt;g&gt;</p>

<p>I have a workaround path I'll take if so, but I have to be sure I exhausted the most obvious method first.</p>

Thanks Paul. Unfortunately, PowerPoint sometimes throws makes-no-sense oddities our way when coding. &lt;g&gt; Your method makes sense, especially for Word, but PowerPoint can't use it. I have to believe Steve that a VBA disconnect exists with this object because
 it SHOULD work with my code but doesn't. It compiles correctly and follows the object model syntax. Time for a workaround now, I guess.<br />

            I'd be interested to see a workaround if you find one Mel. As Steve says your code is "correct"-&nbsp; it just doesn't work! I've not been able to find any way to do this in 2007 / 10.

<p>Hi, John.</p>
<p>My workaround is nothing to write home about. 'Only a command to create a formatted bevel rectangle over the row selected in the table. It looks good, but the caveats are it's not part of the table and cannot be grouped with it, so the user has to be careful
 manipulating the size/position of the rows or table.</p>
<p>Other than that, I've got bruises on my forehead trying to make the actual cell do this with VBA. &lt;g&gt;</p>

<p>If I say yes, you'll take it as a challenge and quite likely come up with a wildly creative solution.&nbsp; So yes.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>Or at least I don't know of any way to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's a known issue, yep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple other things like this that simply aren't hooked up properly (in 2010 either ... no improvements there as far as I know).</p>
<p>For example, try walking back up the .Parent.Parent. ... tree from selected text in order to get a reference to the shape containing the text.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way the table hands back null and there you are.&nbsp; Null-where.</p>

<p>No, I'm done. &lt;g&gt; The juice just isn't worth the squeeze, and my hands are tired from pounding on that lemon. &lt;g&gt;</p>

<h2>            Several data sources to build a single document</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I'm really enjoying the stabilty of Word:Mac 2011in my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.5.8 while accessing several data sources types to create nice catalogs!<br />
<br />
But what I do need to do is to call several datasources, namely and currently, several Excel worksheets to build a single document. Let's say scientific production has its own structure and there is an specific Excel file holding this information and, for instance,
 group membership is held in a different Excel file. Both sources of information are required to build a nice report with a coherent layout.<br />
<br />
Thus, please, is it possible to call several datasources from a single Word document?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div>I don't know which methods you are using at the moment, but&nbsp;there are 5 main ways you can get data in an external Excel sheet into a Word 2011 document:</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. using LINKs (e.g., Edit-&gt;Copy a range of cells in Excel and Edit-&gt;Paste Special into Word)</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. using Mailmerge - set up the Excel sheet as the data source for a Mailmerge and use { MERGEFIELD } fields to insert values from the sheet</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. using a { DATABASE } field to insert a table of data from a Sheet</div>
<div>&nbsp;d. Using VBA (or Applescript) to retrieve data from Excel and insert it into your Word document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;e. Do as much data manipulation as possible in Excel first, creating "the data source that you need"</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would guess from the fact that you are talking about Data Sources that you are probably using (b). If so, and if what you need is a multi-part report where each part of the report uses a different data source, then you can consider</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. setting up each part as a separate document</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. perform a separate merge for each part</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. combine the documents. You could, for example, set up a "main" document that included the results of all the merges using { INCLUDETEXT } fields.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are going to do that, a good way to proceed would be to create the entire Mail Merge Main document as a single document in the first instance to avoid introducing formatting and style clashes. Then split it when you're ready.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, from your description I would guess that you may want to do some "one-many" reporting, e.g. perhaps to list a variable number of members per group.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Word "out of the box" is not very good at that kind of thing. You may be far better off using tools that are designed for reporting from databases (FileMaker is a possibility, although I do not know how good it is for that purpose.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>But even in Word you can</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. use one Excel table as the data source for a merge, and use { DATABASE } fields to insert related data from other data sources. The main problems with that approach are that</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- the data sources all need to be tabular</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Word 2011 may ask a "security" question every time it needs to get data from a sheet (not sure)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- the layout options are limited - you may need to reformat the resulting tables manually or using VBA</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;b. use the "one-many" approach described in&nbsp;<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=294686 . <br />
<br />
<div>Word MVP "macropod" has produced a much more complete description of this approach - there's a version on Graham Mayor's site at<br />

<div>However, both those approaches depend on a single MailMerge data source, i.e. one that has already combined all the data you need in the sequence required by the document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But if you can spell out esxactly what you need to achieve, it may be a little easier to make useful suggestions.</div>

About the second part of your message on "one-many" reporting, I do need to read the proposed material again and think about it. Our take now is to do this kind of analysis out of Word, by using a number o different tools, get the tabulation done and read it
 with the same { INCLUDETEXT } approach you proposed.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure if could it be worth to rely on Word to accomplish this kind of reporting work. We started to approach to LyX, LaTeX and literate programming to deal with these problems, but it is by no means easy to introduce new tools in a big organization
 having Word as a kind of SwissKnife!<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<div><br />
<div>To me, the key question when discussing Word-based reporting is "who's doing it?" Is it end users, who can do all the layouts, may struggle a bit with fields but can probably work through that, but may not have the time to plunge into VBA, and may not
 be allowed to do so. Or is it "IT people" who may have access to a much more flexible toolkit. Or is it end users who have also been provided with a 3rd-party reporting capability?</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as report production using Word is concerned, the fact is that there's considerably more flexibility on the Windows platform. The main reasons are:</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. out-of-the-box, data connectivity is significantly more flexible. On Windows, you can connect to Excel and even plain text files using OLEDB and most of the features of Jet/ACE SQL. Unicode support is better (unless Mac Word's Excel converter has improved).&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. it is possible to use MailMerge Events (even though they seem to be rather shaky at times).</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. beyond that, if you also have VS.NET etc., it's possible to do a <i>lot</i> more using VSTO and/or the Open XML SDK (nice if it worked on Mac with Mono, but I have never managed to achieve that).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If (c) is an option for you, it is probably worth having a look at Eric White's blog at</div>

<h2>            How do I transfer Skype account from one Microsoft account to another&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">To give you a bit of a background, years ago I created a Skype account using former email addresses and the phone number I still own. Since then, however, I created a new email address (a more professional one) and changed it on
 Skype, too. I also created a Microsoft account with the new email, for my Office documents and stuff. Still, the former email addresses are always brought up when needing to check my identity in order to modify the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Now I've purchased a new PC and when trying to set up the Microsoft account for it, I foolishly typed the Skype address first (and somehow linked it with my phone), then added what seems to be a second account with my current email
 (which also has my phone number there). Since removing the first (Skype related, logging via phone number) account wasn't possible, I wanted to delete this account and keep my main one, using the email. But it seems that deleting my (phone number) Microsoft
 account also deletes my Skype account (<em>which I clearly don't want</em>). In addition, the main (email) Microsoft account generates a new Skype account, which I frankly don't need as 1. I don't have any contacts there and 2. I can't even change/see what
 my username is...</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">So, my question is: <strong>Can I transfer my original Skype account</strong>
<em>(that is liked to a Microsoft account I also don't need</em>) <strong>to my main Microsoft account</strong> (the one with the email)? The Skype account has my email address as the primarily (and only) one, but I just can't figure the whole thing out...</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Sorry for the long post, I tried to explain the problem as accurately as I could.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Thanks for your help!</p>

            Hi Gabriela!<br />Merging two Skype accounts isn’t possible. However you can transfer contacts and credits (if you have any) from one account to another one.<br /><br />To transfer contacts go to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12158/how-do-i-transfer-contacts-from-one-skype-account-to-another" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12158/how-do...</a><br /><br />To transfer credit go to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12197/how-can-i-give-skype-credit-as-a-gift-to-my-friends-and-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12197/how-ca...</a><br /><br />With regard to your username try the following:<br /><br />Go to skype.com&gt; my account. Scroll down to ACCOUNT SETTINGS you’ll see your Skype name (username/id).<br /><br />I hooe this helps you!

 should paste directly as a table with all of the data in the correct columns, but now it pastes all jumbled up with some of the data broken out in columns and some of it not.&nbsp; Am I the only one who is experiencing this issue?&nbsp; I have just upgraded to Windows

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If the files are in csv format, then there is no need to copy and paste.<br />
Clicking on the file to open it in Excel, will read all of the data it to the correct columns.</p>
<p>If it is saved as a txt file, then again, if you try to Open the file in Excel, the Data&gt;Text to columns wizard will be invoked, and you can parse the data as you wish.</p>

<p><br />
Sounds like your History is corrupt.&nbsp; Then you could delete the whole History directory (e.g. using another admin account) and let it be regenerated the next time it is needed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you would like to check if that is the case first, see what you get when you open:&nbsp; shell:History</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
"<b>Shell:History</b>" is the command that you need to use using Run window. This would show the browser history for Internet Explorer in a folder view.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps to remove or clear Shell:History:<br />
<ul>
<li>Press <b>Windows+R </b>keys and type "<b>Shell:History</b>".</li><li>Delete the <b>History </b>by removing the folder. For example: If it's for today, you would find a folder saying "<b>Today</b>", you can delete the folder.
</li><li>Restart Internet Explorer. Open certain websites and check if they show up in the browsing history.
</li></ul>
Do let us know about the status of this issue. <br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the History folder must be a "S"ystem folder why not have&nbsp;an ie&nbsp;developer add&nbsp;5 &nbsp;lines &nbsp;of code in c++ (6 in c#) on the app load event:</p>

<p>String^ path = <span style="color: rgba(163, 21, 21, 1)">"</span>C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\History<span style="color: rgba(163, 21, 21, 1)">"</span>;</p>
<p>if ( (File::GetAttributes( path ) &amp; FileAttributes::System)&nbsp; != FileAttributes::System )</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>File::SetAttributes( path, static_cast&lt;FileAttributes&gt;(File::GetAttributes( path ) | FileAttributes::System));</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>
</p><p>In c#:</p>
<p>string path = <span style="color: rgba(163, 21, 21, 1)">"</span>C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\History<span style="color: rgba(163, 21, 21, 1)">"</span>;</p>
<p>FileAttributes attributes = File.GetAttributes(path);</p>
<p>if ((attributes &amp; FileAttributes.System) == FileAttributes.System)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>File.SetAttributes(path, File.GetAttributes(path) | FileAttributes.System);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unlink some tasks between master project and subproject</h2>
                    I have a master project file and a subproject file, my question is: is there any way to break the link between a few certain tasks in master project file and the subproject? In other words, i would like to have two project files linked, but what i want
 to see is that when i update some tasks in subproject i don't want them to be shown any change in master project because&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;see difference between two project files. &nbsp;Is that possible in Project 2010? Can you please help me out? Thank you!

Sorry, no can do. When you insert a subproject into a master, it is all or nothing.<br />
<br />
However, it sounds like you have only one subproject in the master so I have to ask, why create the master? If you want to see changes between a Project file and an updated version of that same file, use the Compare Project versions utility. It can be found
 under the Project tab/Reports group.<br />

            <p>Hi Vinoth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Hotmail.com interface been changed to a newer version and is now called Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access your calendar by logging into <a href="http://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://calendar.live.com</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way of accessing your calendar is to login to <a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://outlook.com</a> and selecting the Calendar option from the menu grid towards the top left hand corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional information on how to use Calendar in Outlook.com, refer the link below.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the recovering deleted e-mail folders, I suggest you to follow the steps given in the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand how important your calendars are. I regret to inform you that there is no option in recovering deleted calendars in Outlook.com Calendar. But if you had the deleted Calendar items synched on an e-mail client like Office and Outlook or Windows
 Live Mail, then possibly we can check if the calendar items are there and can be restored.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a workbook where a cell is referencing another workbook's full file path (including sheet).&nbsp; I would like to write a formula referencing the other workbook using my cell file reference.&nbsp; So far I am using the indirect formula and it works, just that
 it doesn't work when the workbook closes.&nbsp; Any recommendations?&nbsp; Below is my current formula:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A1 = Z:\Folder\Folder2\Folder3\Folder4\Folder5\[Filename.xlsm]_File Tap</p>
<p>A2 = =INDIRECT("'"&amp;$A$1&amp;"'!"&amp;ADDRESS(ROW()+2,COLUMN()))/1000</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>if you use INDIRECT() because the value in cell A1 can change, or because you want a formula that you can easily copy down, so it refers to A2, A3, A4, etc, &nbsp;then the INDEX function suggested by Tom-S will not work, because the workbook reference is hard-coded.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In this case, INDIRECT() goes in the right direction, but it will not work with closed workbooks.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can download and install a free add-in called morefunc.xll, which has a custom function called INDIRECT.EXT that will work with closed workbooks, too. The add-in can be downloaded here:</div>

<div><br />
<div>if you cannot download the file at work, maybe you can download it at home and email to your work email. Or save it on a USB stick.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or let the IT folks download it for you. It's a tried and trusted tool and won't cause any harm.</div>

<p>I have seen <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officeprog/thread/e015a516-ba55-4d00-8d0b-4f787120ffef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this posting</a> that provides a code-based approach to bringing content into a PowerPoint presentation from a SharePoint column to which the PowerPoint document is bound in a document library.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there is a more straightforward approach in PowerPoint 2010, along the same lines of the Word QuickParts where the fields can be added and referenced in the normal UI?</p>

<p>Sure Steve, the scenario is to take a template associated with a SharePoint library and dynamically populate certain values in the slide deck, for example, the Client name in a predefined field in the slide deck or on its template. The values would come
 from the SharePoint columns that the document is associate with.</p>
<p>In Word, this takes a couple of mouse clicks through its QuickParts feature. I am aware that one could use OpenXML to do this in PowerPoint, but surprised that a similar capability does not exist for what I would imagine to be a fairly common use case.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your taking the time to look at this, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barton</p>

<p>I don't have access to anything SharePointish, unfortunately, so can't be of much help.</p>
<p>I'm hoping Glenna Shaw sees this though ... she's our go-to for SharePoint stuff.</p>
<p>I'll try and point her this way.</p>

<p>Hi Barton,</p>
<p>So sorry for the late answer.&nbsp; You're best bet is this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598083</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately coding is going to be your only choice.&nbsp; About the only data&nbsp;interconnectivity offered in PowerPoint is by way of Excel.</p>

            <p>Hello again, Barton.</p>
<p>I did want to let you know of one other (fairly) simple approach. You can update PowerPoint from SharePoint columns by way of Excel.</p>
<p>Follow these instructions to create a spreadsheet that will automatically update from the SharePoint list:
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/export-a-sharepoint-list-to-a-spreadsheet-HA001119639.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/export-a-sharepoint-list-to-a-spreadsheet-HA001119639.aspx</a></p>
<p>Save the resultant spreadsheet to your document library.&nbsp;Open the spreadsheet in Excel and open your PowerPoint file.&nbsp; Copy and paste link the elements that you want into your PowerPoint. Save both files.</p>
<p>To update, open the Excel file first and update it using the Refresh All button under the data tab. Close the Excel file.</p>
<p>Open the PowerPoint, select the linked Excel item and update all using the same Refresh All button.</p>
<p>I realize it's a PITA and a two step process as opposed to one, but it's better than a bunch of coding.</p>

<a href="https://sharepointdocumentmerge.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sharepointdocumentmerge.com</a>. Use Place holders of the SharePoint Internal column name&lt;&lt;Title&gt;&gt; for PowerPoint and Excel or Merge field for Word.

<p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.What is the detailed version of the Outlook client?</p>
<p>2.Do the Gmail Web services work fine?</p>
<p>3.How did you configure your account in Outlook, via IMAP or POP3?</p>
<p>4.Does the issue persist if you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new Outlook profile</a>?</p>
<p>5.Did you get any error message? If yes, please upload a screenshot about this. To upload screenshots, select Use rich formatting, and then click insert /Edit.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to close a Word document, I receive the message, "Microsoft Word is not responding" and I end up forcing it closed every time via the task manager. I have disabled the Add-ins, but to no avail.</p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.
