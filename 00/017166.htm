<h2>            Question mark in a box in word 2007</h2>
                    I'm confused! Some time during creating a large word document (150+ pages) a question mark inside a box appeared in&nbsp;the index. When I remove the marking for the index entry, the symbol disappears. What is this and how do I get rid of it?

            Changing the font to Arial only changes how the weird character looks; in my case it changes from a question mark in a box (as a&nbsp;calibri font) to a "box" with no top or bottom (as an arial font), but it still shouldn't be there. Deleting the paragraph
 with the marked entry makes the weird character disappear, but retyping it in makes it appear again. I'm starting to wonder if this is a Word bug.

            I'm wondering if what you're seeing is just the paragraph marks. Inserting an index entry (XE field) causes Word to display Hidden text (since XE fields are formatted as Hidden); along with this, it also displays other nonprinting characters (formatting
 marks), such as paragraph marks, dots for spaces, arrows for tab characters, etc. See

            <p>I'm well aware of the paragraph and other hidden formatting symbols and how to show or hide them. That's not the problem. It looks to me like yet another bug in Word. After I expanded my manuscript in other areas, not related to this problem area, the weird
 question mark in a box symbol disappeared. Wow, isn't that great? No, because it goes unexplained and is not reproduceable!</p>
<p>Another issue that I ran into is marking an entry within a bold section of text, when I un-bold the text within the XE field; sometimes such a marked entry shows up in the index as bold, and most of the time as not-bold. It's consistently inconsistent! The
 only solution that seems to work is to move the XE field to the next line. @#$(%)(#^% Can't they write a piece of software that WORKS? I mean, Word has been around for decades.</p>

            If the bold formatting is part of the style definition rather than direct font formatting, then leave it alone, as Word will see it as Default Paragraph Font. By removing the bold, you're actually toggling the Bold flag, which results in bold in the index.

<p>The bold formatting was defined in the Heading used for the problem text. However the&nbsp;related entries&nbsp;in the index were inconsistent: about half of them appeared in bold, the others appeared not bold.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 asks if I want to save Personal.xlsb any time I use PowerPivot</h2>
                    <p>I have Excel 2016, currently build 16.0.7070.2022, but this has been happening for month. (Cannot speak to before January as I didn't use PowerPivot before then.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any time I do work in PowerPivot or with the DAX engine, Excel always asks if I want to save my Personal.xlsb file. It isn't a particular Excel file causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exported my macros, deleted the personal.xlsb file, and recreated it thinking it was corrupted somehow, but it persists after doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, my file grew from 37,381 bytes to 37,483 bytes. when I answered "YES" to saving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a bug. There are no changes to the macros being done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on Windows 10, the latest consumer release - no fast ring on Win10 on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seeing this?</p>

            <p>Thanks for reporting this.&nbsp; There is a known issue that launching Power Pivot will mark every workbook that is open as dirty (including any personal macro workbook.)&nbsp; We have a bug filed in our database, and plan to fix this along with a number of other
 product issues.&nbsp; I don't have a date as to when we'll get this done, but it is definitely on our radar.

                    I recently switched from hotmail.com to outlook.com.&nbsp; I am still using my hotmail.com address.&nbsp; I see that the messages I had in my Inbox and Sent folders did get transfered over but I had created a Save folder that had messages in it that did not get
 transfered.&nbsp; I can no longer access hotmail so how do i get these "lost" messages?

Hi,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You can use the recover deleted / lost email feature in Hotmail to bring back your lost emails. However, when Hotmail recovers missing / deleted emails, our system restores as many emails as it could regardless of its dates.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We do not have the option to choose the range of dates of the messages. And there is no guarantee that the messages that you are looking for will all be recovered. You can refer to the solution article below for the steps:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How do I recover deleted email messages?</span></a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To prevent this issue from happening again, please refer to the article below for more information:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/emails-missing-from-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What should I do if email messages are missing from my Hotmail account?</a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note: Recovered messages will be presented in your Deleted folder.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To prevent this from happening again in the future, I highly suggest that you back-up your emails into your computer’s hard drive.&nbsp; You can follow the steps I have provided below:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
1. Sign in your account and go to your Inbox</p>
<p>
2. Click the <span style="font-weight: bold">radial button</span> beside your emails that you wish to back up</p>
<p>
3. Click the <span style="font-weight: bold">Printer icon</span> on top of the page it is just beside Categories, Move to.</p>
<p>
4. A new window will appear, On the <span style="font-weight: bold">Destination
</span>option change it to <span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft XPS Document Writer.</span></p>
<p>
5. Click <span style="font-weight: bold">Print</span></p>
<p>
6. You will then be taken to another window that will let you choose on where you can save your emails then click
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

            The problem is that after converting from hotmail.com to outlook.com I can't get back into hotmail.&nbsp; The files were not deleted, or at least I hope they weren't, they just were not transfered from jotmail to outlook.

<div>Is there a fix for the <i><b>unending spinning ball</b></i> that lasts for almost 30 seconds on every save of an Excel document ? It has been this way since a upgraded to v14. &nbsp;It's the same thing with either Lion or Mountain Lion. &nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>I've found the solution to my own case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to clear the Recently opened files list in Excel and Word. After cleared the list, the office is working fine again. You can Disable the recent opened files trace function in the excel/word preference as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it. Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 insider preview build 17666.rs_prerelease.180504 zmu service</h2>
                    <p>Any one else having problem with zmu service. did the upgrade - no problems. thought I needed a new microscope camera so purchased one and&nbsp; installed the drivers from enclosed cd. When I&nbsp; plugged in webcam windows crashed with an easy diagnostic notice.
 "Windows cannot continue we will build a file of events and restart your pc. Sure enough windows restarted but crashed again with same message ,started again so I whipped out the camera and what do you know - normal boot into windows .after a few uninstalls
 / reinstalls gave up and contacted Microsoft. after about 40 minutes and a screen takeover suddenly said sorry you are using an insider version so you need to contact a different department. Trying again but at 6.30 GMT on a Sunday no joy so waiting until
 tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime has anyone else had this problem, Tried it on a laptop with the old windows 10 works fine and Yes the Camera SHOULD be compatible as it is a Microsoft one ( did I say should LOL )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards to all</p>

            Hi kaybee328,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you are in an<strong> Insider build</strong>, it is expected that you might encounter issues on your computer. If you do want to use the microscope camera you purchased on that specific computer, I suggest that you use a public release for your operating
 system as it's more stable. I also highly suggest that you create a feedback through the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback Hub</a></strong> regarding this issue so that the developers can have visibility on this
 concern.<br />
<br />

    <title>Why can&#39;t I drag-and-drop within OneDrive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael litty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I drag-and-drop within OneDrive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Situation:</p>
<p>I use OneDrive for my job. My employer provides Office365 to all employees. I have more files in OneDrive than my local SSD can hold, and more files on my external drive than I want to sync in OneDrive,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">so I don't sync all of my files</span>. It isn't possible for me to do all of my file and folder management on my computer and sync to OneDrive.&nbsp; Some management must be done in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: </p>
<p>I can drag from my computer <strong>into</strong> OneDrive in the browser to upload.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I can't drag files and folders <strong>within</strong> OneDrive to organize.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Description:</p>
<p>Using OneDrive in Firefox(64.0) in OSX(10.12.6) I can't drag and drop files and folders within OneDrive to another folder within OneDrive.&nbsp; Instead, I have to select them, click
<em>Move to...</em> and then navigate from OneDrive root folder through to the destination folder.&nbsp; This gets tedious when organizing multiple folders and files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: </p>
<p>In a folder <span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><em>OneDrive&gt;Department Docs&gt;Photos&gt;Events&gt;2018</em></span> there are folders called
<em><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">volleyball</span></em><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">,
<em>football</em>, </span><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><em>soccer</em></span></span>. I create a new folder,
<span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><em>OneDrive&gt;Department Docs&gt;Photos&gt;Events&gt;2018</em></span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><em>&gt;</em></span><em><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Campus</span></em></span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><em>Recreation</em></span>,
 I want to be able to select <em><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">volleyball</span></em><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">,
<em>football</em>, </span><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><em>soccer</em></span></span>, and drag them into
<em><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">...Campus Recreation</span></em>. Instead, I have to select the sports folders and then click
<em>Move to</em> and navigate through the entire folder structure to the destination folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one of the basic features I sorely miss from my years on Google Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>First, is this a problem specific to my platform or is this feature missing from OneDrive on every platform?</p>
<p>Second, is this feature planned for implementation and, if so, when?</p>
<p>Thirdly, I have the same issue with SharePoint and the same questions.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per my test in different browsers, I find only Firefox cannot support the feature<strong> drag and drop
</strong>in OneDrive web client. If we change another browser like Chrome or Safari, the feature will be available for us. So please check if you could do this in other browsers on your end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beside, if you need to organize lots of files in OneDrive, we would also suggest you try using OneDrive sync client which is easier for us to make files' sequence locally. Here is&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-files-with-the-onedrive-sync-client-on-mac-os-x-d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sync

<h2>            No sound from uploaded videos</h2>
                    <p>I posted a video to Yammer last night and when I viewed it, it had sound and the video played fine.&nbsp; This morning it did the same thing.&nbsp; However, when I viewed the video this afternoon, the video played but it had no sound.&nbsp; The volume was turned up fine
 on the computer and from the video screen but still nothing.&nbsp; I deleted the video and uploaded it to Yammer again and it will play but still has no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas as to why it has no sound now and no matter how many time the video is uploaded on Yammer, the sound will not play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>

I also noticed when I first start Skype it puts up a message that Skype home is currently unavailable. It says more, but the message only appears for ONE SECOND! Not very useful. eventually the main Skype window also becomes inaccessible. It just plays the
 Windows error "ping". This happens with the older Skype that was installed and it also happens with the latest version that I installed today. This was the status yesterday as well. Skype must be broken.<br /></p>

<h2>            Proofing tools in another language for free&#63; - Office 2010</h2>
                    I volunteer at a small non-profit organization. We use the Spanish version of Office 2010 and regularly produce publications in Spanish, English, and German. Hyphenation works fine in Spanish and English, but not in German. I looked into downloading proofing
 tools, and found them for free <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/office-language-interface-pack-lip-downloads-HA001113350.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA010354264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>in many languages, but not German. The <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/pd/German-Language-Pack-for-Office-2010/productID.219758400/parentCategoryID.37286600/categoryID.54807000/list.true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
German Language Pack</a> would do what I want, but it costs $25, and, if I understand this correctly, that's $25
<i>per computer</i>. I don't want to change the Office user interface to German; I just want hyphenation. I found exactly what I'm looking for free
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=35400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">for Office 2013</a>, but not for Office 2010. Can I get German hyphenation (and spell check would be nice) in Office 2010 for free?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Hello Sam, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
As you have already discovered, proofing tool in German language is not available free for Office 2010.
<br />
<br />
To have spell check and hyphenation function in German, you need have to German Language Pack installed on your computer.
<br />
<br />
<span>If you have any other questions related to Office products, reply and I’ll be glad to assist you.
<br />
<br />
Thank You.</span><br />

<h2>            Antimalware Service Executable &#40;Windows Defender&#41;</h2>
                    I am running an industrial DAQ program (Data Acquisition Program) on a Windows 10 industrial PC. The PC does not get used for emails, internet&nbsp;browsing, it is just a stand-alone&nbsp;PC collecting data from field&nbsp;sensors via serial communications. The DAQ program
 runs perfectly until&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Antimalware Service Executable (Windows Defender)
</span></strong>kicks in and everything&nbsp;on the PC slows down to a virtual standstill. For example, on Friday night (approx. 10:30 pm) it was noticed that the DAQ program was in a virtually stopped state, the collection of serial data was random with gaps of
 approx. 10 mins between polling (instead of the usual seconds). On checking Windows Task Manager it showed that&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(53, 60, 65, 1)"><strong>Antimalware</strong><strong> Service
</strong><strong>Executable</strong> was<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> using approx 250mb of RAM and 10% of CPU. After 12 hours the DAQ program was still in&nbsp;a virtually stopped state and NOT operating as required with&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Antimalware</strong><strong>&nbsp;Service&nbsp;</strong><strong>Executable</strong><span style="color: rgba(53, 60, 65, 1)">&nbsp;still
 was</span>&nbsp;using approx 250mb of RAM and 10% of CPU.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(53, 60, 65, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I then went to the Windows Defender settings and switched OFF&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Real Time</strong><strong> Protection
</strong>and hey presto the DAQ program instantly starting working perfectly again. Unfortunately, Windows 10 after a period of time switches Real Time Protection back ON and after a few days, the problem described above occurs again.
<strong>Is there something wrong&nbsp;with the way Windows 10 Defender operates?</strong> This problem has been observed on 4 different Windows 10 PC's (with freshly&nbsp;installed operating systems). I can solve it by adding a Defender
<strong>EXCLUSION</strong> of the whole C:\ drive but this isn't really&nbsp;a solution is it?</span></span>

            Hi  CH2014 
<br />
<br />It depends on the version of Windows 10 you are also running. Subsequent releases might have resolved this issue, but in your particular version, the issue might be specific.
<br />
<br />You could try disabling Windows Defender completely and use another Antivirus utility.
<br />
<br />You can instead use these instructions to minimize the impact of the Windows Defender service.

<p>Though you've been sent in the correct direction with TechNet, the best answer to your issue would likely have been to initially buy an industrial PC using the Windows&nbsp;IoT Enterprise operating system or possibly even Windows IoT Core, though that usually
 must come directly from the application's provider as part of a package.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-iot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Internet of Things&nbsp; IOT Devices&nbsp; Microsoft</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to do these types of specialized data acquisition and industrial applications on a normal Windows 10 platform&nbsp;can result in such issues, since the software they use often doesn't fit the same profile as that used in general purpose home or small
 business use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything you find to resolve this on the Windows 10 platform will inherently be a workaround and typically include using exclusions or manually disabling Windows Defender entirely, either of which has a tendency of being difficult to maintain, since Windows
 updates have a tendency to re-enable or change such settings at inopportune times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not saying the workarounds won't work, just that you need to be aware they are precisely that and not the best solution, which is a device and operating system designed specifically for the purpose you yourself defined above.</p>

</p><p>To be honest, I'm not that familiar with Windows 10 IoT. Is it&nbsp;similar to Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB? Why do you think IoT would be more suitable? Does Windows&nbsp;Defender work differently on IoT? The DAQ program in&nbsp;question worked without a problem with Windows
 Defender on Windows 7 (Professional and Home).</p>

<p>Actually, the Windows IoT Enterprise naming appears to have replaced that of Windows 10 Enterprise in that online reference I provided above, though I'm not certain those are truly the same product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down on that web page to about the middle where the "How to get started" title shows those 2 IoT versions and gives short descriptions, as well as offers to "See Comparison Datasheet", which gives a good quick synopsis of the features for each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only referenced these versions since the problem that always exists with any desktop version is they were intended to be used that way, with a person sitting in front of the PC to deal with any issues that come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IoT (previously embedded) versions of Windows have always been designed for the type of operations you're using these dedicated devices for, since they expect to be operated either remotely or without keyboard/display.&nbsp; They also allow the removal of
 unnecessary Windows components like the browser or others that may not be required in your application, reducing the risk these create and the overhead as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Home or Pro versions for these purposes, but problems exactly like those you're having typically occur because the usage profile for these operating systems is different, so random issues with false positive detections or significant overhead
 due to the malware protection engines going into overdrive are more likely than with the stripped down, dedicated&nbsp;versions like IoT.</p>

            Exactly what do you want to with the registry entries?<br />
<br />
Because Starter is not actually "installed" on your computer there are very few registry entries associated with it. Starter is actually installed on Microsoft servers, and it is running on a Virtual machine in your computer, the Client Virtualization Handler.&nbsp;
 The virtual machine is running in that "mystery" Q: drive you see in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; The virtualization is also known by the alias "Click 2 Run".<br />
<br />
The main registry entries are for file types being assigned to use Starter to open them.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><span>In the case of Office 2010, installed with Click to Run technology, there is no conventional file structure relating to Office on the C: drive (as shown in the illustrations below). The installation uses instead

<b>I want to Get Rid of Starter, I want Normal Word</b>
<p>MS was just trying to do you a "favour" by giving you Starter, you could at least be a tiny bit appreciative ... &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p>Starter, as you've figured out is basically crapware, but it does have one redeeming feature,
<em><span>"Office on a USB"</span></em>... You get rid of starter by buying a license for a "full" copy of Office then uninstalling&nbsp;Starter and installing the full Office.</p>
<p>Like much crapware, Starter can't be re-installed, so before you get rid of it, take advantage and load portable Starter on a couple or three USB drives.</p>
<p>You have a several decisions to make. First, what type of license you want to buy, a "Full" media license (Yea!) or a medialess Product Key Card (Boo!) (Guess which type I suggest). Second you have to decide which version of Office you
 want. By version we mean which applications you want to have included in your Office bundle:

<p>If you are in an education institution then you will be able to take advantage of the Academic versions of office, lots of apps for little money. Or if you are in a corporate environment, talk to your IT &amp;/or HR guys about the HUP, Home
 Use Program <a href="http://news.office-watch.com/t/n.aspx?a=1530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://news.office-watch.com/t/n.aspx?a=1530</span></a>. The HUP allows you to "take home" a copy of your
 work Office license, at no cost to your employer (but most employers are unnecessarily shy about it) and little or no cost to you (between free and $30 at your employers discression).</p>

<b>CTR Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</b>
<p><b>When you try to install a product of Office 2010 by using Office Click-to-Run, the user encounters the following error:
</b></p>
<p><b>"This product must be installed to Q:. Ensure that Q: is unused and try again"
</b></p>
<p>This error means that the <b>Q:</b> drive letter is already being used by something else on your computer. However, the installation of Office Click-to-Run requires this drive letter for Office 2010.
</p>
<p><b>How to resolve this error in Office Starter 2010</b></p>
<p>If the <b>Q:</b> drive letter is not available, the installation does not install Office Starter2010.
</p>
<p>To resolve this error, determine which application or which hardware uses the
<b>Q:</b> drive letter, and then move it off the <b>Q: </b>drive by referring to the documentation from the manufacturer or to a support channel of the manufacturer for help. After the
<b>Q:</b> drive is made available, the installation does not display the error. </p>
<p><b>How to resolve this error in Office Home and Student 2010 or in Office Home and Business 2010</b></p>
<p>In order to successfully use the Office Click-to-Run version of Office Home and Business 2010 or of Office Home and Student 2010, use one of the following methods:</p>

<li>Download a version of Office 2010 that is not an Office Click-to-Run product. To do this, visit the site where you purchased Office 2010, and sign in by using your Live ID. Then, click
<strong><span>My Account</span></strong> at the top of the home page to access your Office 2010 downloads. Click

<strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong> under
<strong><span>Download Now</span></strong>. A version of Office 2010 is listed that is not an Office Click-to-Run product and that does not require the
<b>Q:</b> drive to be available.</li></ul>
<p><b>Why do I receive the "This product must be installed to Q:. Ensure that Q: is unused and try again" error when I try to use Office Starter To-Go on my computer?</b></p>
<p>This error means that the <b>Q:</b>&nbsp;drive letter is already being used by something else on your computer. However, the installation of Office Click-to-Run requires this drive letter for Office 2010. If the&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> drive letter cannot
 be made available, you cannot use Office Starter To-Go on your computer.</p>
<p><b>Why do I have a "Q:" drive when I use Office Starter To-Go?</b></p>
<p>Office Starter To-Go uses the Office Click-to-Run technology that must use a virtual application drive. This virtual application drive is why you have the
<b>Q:</b> drive.</p>
<p><b>What is the "Q:" drive?</b></p>
<p>Office 2010 Click-to-Run suite such as Office Starter 2010, Office Starter To-Go, Office Home and Student 2010,&nbsp;and Office Home and Business 2010 are based on some application virtualization technology. The&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> drive is the virtual
 file system drive where virtualized applications are located in the file system namespace. This
<b>Q: </b>drive is not a typical drive. The <b>Q:</b>&nbsp;drive has no space that the user can access directly and is inaccessible from Windows Explorer or
<b>My Computer</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Are my Office documents also stored in this "Q:" drive?</b></p>
<p>By default, Office saves your documents in the <strong><span>My Documents</span></strong> folder.
</p>
<p><b>Caution</b> We strongly recommend that you do not save any Office documents on the
<b>Q: </b>drive for the following reasons:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The <b>Q: </b>drive cannot be accessed from Windows Explorer directly.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Office installation files have to be repaired, the
<b>Q:</b> drive may be removed and recreated. Therefore, any Office documents that are stored on the
<b>Q:</b>&nbsp;drive&nbsp;are lost.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><b>Can I hide or delete the "Q:" drive?</b></p>
<p>No. Any access to hide or to delete the Q: drive is removed.</p>
<p><b>Can I rename the "Q:" drive?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Right-click the drive,&nbsp;click <b>Rename</b>, and then type the new name for the drive.</p>
<p><b>Why is my backup program giving me errors when it tries to access the "Q:" drive?</b></p>
<p>The <b>Q: </b>drive is inaccessible. This limited access protects the integrity of the installation files for Office 2010. For Help in resolving the errors from your backup program, see the documentation from the manufacturer or to the
 support channel of the manufacturer.</p>
<p><b>I cannot access the "Q:" drive in My Computer, but I can access it from the "Save" dialog box inside my Office applications. Why?</b></p>
<p>When you run an Office Click-to-Run application, the application requires access to the virtual file system. This required access by the application is why you can access the
<b>Q:</b> drive from the <b>Save</b> dialog box.</p>
<p><b>Caution</b> We strongly recommend that you do not save any Office documents on the
<b>Q: </b>drive for the following reasons:</p>

<h2>            Multiple Macros on One worksheet</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Greetings, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to run these two macros on the same worksheet.&nbsp; I have been all over the forums and on other sites and cannot for the life of me get it work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I am trying to do.&nbsp; I have one column where I need to have multiple items selected on a drop down list.&nbsp; This one works even with the other macro pasted in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second thing I am trying to do is to make dependent drop down lists.&nbsp; One column labled "Outcomes"&nbsp; and then Outcome reasons, so I want to be able to select one type of outcome and then the outcome reason specific to that outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, I need to be able to run the macro in several lines, as I am tracking information.&nbsp; The first macro looks great on the first line, but when I go down to complete the second line in the spreadsheet the multiple items no longer work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello jelac07,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot have multiple subs with the same name within the same module because you will get an ambiguous name error. The following example might help you to achieve your aims by using the Select Case to determine what column or cell has been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have used variables to save the row and column because I believe it is easier than constantly writing Target.Row or Target.Column. Also you can sometimes combine code by using this method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that you have used the range from row 2 to row 1000 because row 1000 will always be below your range of data so I have simply tested for the change in row 1 (the column header row) and exit if that is where the change is made and then can simply
 test for the entire column for the rest of the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The case statements simply return True of False. Similar to If/Then but you do not use the If and Then; it is simply a statement that returns a True or False falue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to me if any questions on this method.</p>

</p><p>It&nbsp;appears there's no option on the Skype app to disable sound while on a screen sharing. What you can do is to disable your audio/sound for the meantime.

    <title>Split paragraph into segments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonalymac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Split paragraph into segments</h2>
                    
<p>I'm creating a slide-show that will have a link to a separate history show which will be a long text document, designed to be read - ie not full of graphics etc, it simply consists of&nbsp;a lot of plain text. The intention is that only those intereseted in the
 detailed history would go to this show, and read at&nbsp;their own speed.</p>
<p>For the font I'm using, I've disciovered that I want an average of 25 characters (inc spaces) per line.</p>
<p>Is there a way in Excel to take a&nbsp;paragraph, and break it down into shorter segments containing "words", with approx 25 chars. I could accept a few more, but if its easier, then I would just leave it as a max of 25 chars.</p>
<p>For simplicity I would have to accept that a space character would define the end of a word. Tis may not be strictly accurate, but I can manually deal with any errors when entering them into the show software.</p>
<p>The amount of manual cutting/pasting I will have to do otherwise is not something I look forward to.</p>

<p>Following up on my macro modification to output the split text into separate rows, here is a modification to my UDF that will do the same thing. However, to implement this modified UDF will require you to enter it as an array. The way this works is you first
 select as many rows as you think the text will be split out into. Yes, I know, how are you supposed to know how many rows that is. Well, you probably don't, but the UDF allows you to select more (way more if you want) than is required and it will still work
 correctly. Okay, once you have selected your cells, then type this into the FormulaBar (here I am assuming A1 holds your text)...</p>
<p>=SplitText(A1)</p>
<p>and then commit the formula using CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER, <strong>not</strong> just Enter by itself. The text will flow correctly from row to row. Okay, with that said, here is the UDF code...</p>
<p>Function SplitText(CellText As String) As Variant<br />
&nbsp; Dim Space As Long, Text As String, Text25 As String, TempText As String, Output As Variant<br />
&nbsp; Const MaxChars As Long = 25<br />
&nbsp; Text = CellText<br />
&nbsp; Do While Len(Text) &gt; MaxChars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text25 = Left(Text, MaxChars + 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Right(Text25, 1) = " " Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempText = TempText &amp; RTrim(Text25) &amp; vbLf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text = Mid(Text, MaxChars + 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Space = InStrRev(Text25, " ")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempText = TempText &amp; Left(Text25, Space - 1) &amp; vbLf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text = Mid(Text, Space + 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp; TempText = TempText &amp; Text<br />
&nbsp; Output = Split(TempText, vbLf)<br />
&nbsp; If Application.Caller.Count &gt; UBound(Output) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempText = TempText &amp; String(Application.Caller.Count - UBound(Output), vbLf)<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; SplitText = WorksheetFunction.Transpose(Split(TempText, vbLf))<br />
End Function</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Mac - How do I see more than 1 month of calendar events in List view&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click the Calendar icon, select the Organize tab and choose the List icon from the menu bar, it shows me all the my calendar events. &nbsp;I can pick from the menu bar Day, Work Week, Week and Month, but what if I want more than 1 month of calendar events?
 &nbsp;What if I want to see every calendar event in the entire history of the calendar? &nbsp;Is there an option to see this? &nbsp;When I switch back to Grid view and go back in time I can see years and years worth of calendar events, one month at a time. &nbsp;I want to see
 my entire calendar history but in the List view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi MiSoBe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. Based on my test and experience, the feature viewing the entire calendar history in the list view in calendar in Outlook for Mac is not available. We can just change the view as Day, Week and Month in the read pane.
 If you want to view the details of the recurring meetings. I suggest that just double-click the meeting to get the detailed information of it as the following picture shows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41efeace-a0a6-4591-b962-39827eebde09?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41efeace-a0a6-4591-b962-39827eebde09?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viewing the calendar history in list view is really good idea, this will make more convenient for us when using Calendar. I suggest that post the idea and leave a comment to submit your feedback in the user voice for Outlook for Mac via
 the following link:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team is actively monitoring this forum. Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on feedback from users. Thanks for your time and efforts to make Outlook for Mac better. Your time
 and understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jason, thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp; Whenever I try to open the documents, I am connected to the internet.&nbsp; I even logged into my OneDrive account on another device, but still I get the empty folder message.&nbsp; Do I have to do something special to connect

            Are you saving the photos to memory card or the phone memory ? If you are saving to SD card try saving to phone memory instead and check if you still get the same problem.

</p><p>No, it will not. I had the same problem on a 640, 830 and 1520 - hard reset did not solve the problem. Changing the storage destination for photos did.</p>

<p>Hi, 93tid</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This type of phone (640) only has 7,28 GB internal memory and took 5,62 GB for system. This memory is also used by apps and games which cannot be moved to SD card for 1,37 GB (in here only default apps and games which cannot be uninstall). This means only
 have 290 MB free space on internal memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I save camera results in internal memory, the memory will be ..... for only saving 80-90 pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question might be, how to integrate SD card becomes internal memory? :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Zaky</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not possible. Please try saving to internal memory even only 10-20 photos. If this works, you can move the photos afterwards to your SD card from the phone's file manager. I know, this is not an ideal solution but it is a workaround to get proper photos
 saved without errors.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Hotmail on a laptop with Windows 7 and IE10. When I write an email in English the text is autocorrected to make the first letter of certain Words Capital. For instance 'Words' and 'Capital' in the previous sentence of this post. There are many
 other examples. 'Works', 'Money', and 'Honey' to give a few, and I really need to be able to turn this feature off, if I am to continue using Hotmail. The question is where? Please help.</p>

    <title>Word 2007 master document changes file names when saving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ward de witt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 master document changes file names when saving</h2>
                    <p>I have done a lot of research on this question, but without success. I have learned how to add multiple files at one step by using Insert/object [down arrow]/text from file, and then selecting the file(s) that you want to include. All works swimmingly until
 I save the master file. It saves the file OK, but when I open it the previous file names are truncated to: "Chapter 1.docx", instead of "Chapter 01 - Introduction.docx"; "Chapter 2.docx", instead of "Chapter 02 - A Sunny Day in May.docx", etc. I wouldn't mind
 that so much, except that the original files have all been renamed as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use file names when composing a long document to help me remember something about the content of the particular chapter, so the loss of the descriptive information is very irritating, especially since it affects the original.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that perhaps the inclusion of spaces in my file name might be the problem, but I tried eliminating them and the outcome was identical</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sharing the files and I am the only one working on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the chapters might be using different templates, but my "novel" template and my "normal" template are virtually identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also considered whether the file name might be too long, but word generated single and double digit chapter numbers (e.g., Chapter 1, Chapter 21, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help regarding this problem would be appreciated.</p>
