    <title>OneNote cache files didn&#39;t backup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote cache files didn&#39;t backup</h2>
                    <p>I've just replaced my laptop. I have access to my old laptop hard drive through a portable drive. When I launched OneNote on my new laptop I found I had lost an entire year of entries. I have looked in every OneNote notebook, in the backups, on One Drive
 and even SharePoint, no luck. I did find in the cache folder of my old hard drive a set of cache files with dates that indicate these are my missing entries. I opened one of the binary cache files in NotePad and saw enough plain text to know that this is probably
 the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my new OneNote to see these cache files on the old drive? My new drive has a new cache folder with new cache files that begin with the set up of my new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            You could try copying the old cache file to replace the new cache file. I’m not sure if it will work, but you could try it. Just make a backup of your OneNote notes and the new cache first, just in case.

 to deactivate all my details on Monday 6th. &nbsp;Why cant I just talk to some one and put it right. &nbsp;I am just going around in circles.

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>I wanted to know if the 2013 version automatically backs up my project files, in case I make a mistake.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Project 2013 unlike some earlier versions, does not have an automatic backup option. There is an automatic save available in File &gt; Options, Save but it is not a separate copy of the file.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>If it doesn't do this automatically, I would like to know how I can set this up manually.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You don't note what operating system you are using, but Windows 7 has an automatic backup that you can schedule automatic backups - usually to another location - external drive.&nbsp; The alternative is manually performing a File &gt; Save As and saving a copy of
 the file to another location.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Is there any form of version control and if there is, where can these versions be accessed?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, not built in to Project.&nbsp; You can compare files that you have renamed through a Save As command using Compare Projects (Report tab).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps.<br />
</p>

            No there's nothing to increase the sensitivity of hey Cortana but you can try to reset your phone and see if that helps turn it on then press and hold the volume down and the power buttons until it vibrates then release them and it will restart

                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I had a lumia 620 , ran build 10586.164 on it , somehow the phone itself created a backup of the content/settings/app data etc. Had performance issues (obvious) so I rolled back to
 wp8.1 via the windows recovery tool. Restored from the same backup file made on .164 , and my 8.1 had performance issues too. Battery drain was there. If I would just restart my phone , the battery percentage dropped by 5-6%. Scrolling was a mess , earlier
 these were not a problem in 8.1. I thought it was my device's issue.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So I switched to lumia 1020(on 8.1) to make sure. Again logged in with the same microsoft account , restored from the same backup file , but the problem is still there. Did a hard reset
 , this time didn't restore from any backup file , and the problem still persists. There are serious performance issues , same battery drain , flickery scrolling on my 1020 too. Is my backup file corrupted or my devices are corrupted ?&nbsp;</span><br />

<h2>            Lumia 950 text message freeze and reboot</h2>
                    <p>I've just bought my new lumia 950 and experiencing a really weird issue. Almost every time (!) when I write a short text message the phone is freezing or restarting. I think it's a kind of unexpected error what the phone "would like to solve" this way. The
 problem is coming right after sending. Sometimes it is associated with unstoppable vibe. In this case only the soft reset can help without any error code. I've installed the update (OS build: 10.0.10586.29).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you also have a phone sold in Hungary? (Just because your name looks like a Hungarian one;) I have another interesting bug, when using the HUN keyboard I can't type '@', when push this button it does a Copy-paste instead typing a @ mark. With US or GB

<p>I am able to confirm that software bug, here with my Lumia 950, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/12/04/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-10586-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">latest OS</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/f3d9276c-b547-4fba-944c-afbdd9f6e9cc">latest
 firmware</a>, and the Hungarian keyboard (Edit: Croatian, Czech, and Slovakian keyboards as well). When nothing is on the clipboard, the button works correctly. When something is on the clipboard, the button @ does not write @ but pastes the content of the
 clipboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers for bug reporting. Why ever. Microsoft wants you to use the app Windows Feedback, which is included since Windows 10 Mobile. That app changes its language
 depending on the currently selected keyboard. Therefore, I recommend to go for All Apps » Settings » Time &amp; language » Keyboard » long tap all keyboards except ‘Hungarian’ for the context menu » remove. Then, Windows Feedback should be in Hungarian. File your
 problem there, please, Then, add the keyboard for English (United States) and remove all other keyboards. Now, restart your phone, and use Windows Feedback again.</span></p>

 input service: and especially I think the Hungarian keyboard (because yes Andras and Abi99 I’m Hungarian</span><span>J</span><span>).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After every crash and reboot, I’ve immediately checked the app. In the pending reports I’ve discovered almost every time the following rows:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Crash: svchost.exe_InputService</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Crash: dwm.exe</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes it shows other crashes also (with the above mentioned):</span></p>
<p><span>Crash: TaskHost.exe</span></p>
<p><span>Crash: Skyphost.exe</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I experienced the Field Medic App sends these reports to the Microsoft but interestingly there is a difference between the pending and uploaded reports. After
 uploading I haven’t seen the mentioned crashes but found other reports such as:</span></p>
<p><span><span>OS Crash 000000EF (most common)</span></span></p>
<p><span>OS Crash 0000003B
</span></p>
<p><span>OS Crash 00000141</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also found other non-crash-related reports such as:</span></p>
<p><span>Lost: PID:7900 Error: 0x800705b4</span></p>
<p><span>Lost: PID:1196 Error: 0x800705b4</span></p>
<p><span>Lost: PID:5832 Error: 0x800705b4</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I could isolate and detect the problem but it’s a nightmare. I give up the text sending to stay live without any crash but I think it’s nonsense. It would
 be great to use a Lumia 950 like a phone. Even in Hungary… </span></p>

</p><p>For example viber cannot open pictures in threads...no matter what I try or how many times I delete it and reinstall it again...viber cannot see any pictures on my phone other apps can...reinstall does not help (what a surprise)...othe apps can see and do
 the above (whatsapp, line, messenger etc.). Strange...</p>

<p>Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers for bug reporting. Why ever. Instead, please, create a new thread, for each issue one thread. That way, you are able to create a concise subject/headline which might attract more specialized enthusiasts. Here
 in this thread, with that keyboard issue, those issues are going to drown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in that other threads somebody else is able to double-check you issue – by the way, in which app do you click on that Twitter links – whether more than one Windows 10 Mobile phone is affected. That way, you know whether this is a general issue (and
 a workaround exists) or whether this is a particular issue (and no workaround might exit).</p>

            Have you noticed that in the product shots it's silvery/white but in the shots that show it with people it's black?<br />
<br />
I hope they release it in two colours at the same time and the black isn't just a prototype.<br />
<br />
Unless something else comes along I will be getting this phone!

            If people at such respected technical sites have no clue about Nokia 9xxx segment (and E90) and they compare such a "E90 met with ordinary user and UIQ" micro laptop with iPhone, Nokia has a serious publicity problem in USA.<br />
<br />
The last thing to compare that device is iPhone. Also I don't think it even claims to race with iPhone.

            That's what most apple fan reacts when Nokia released the music phone. They are mum, when audiophiles said that the N91 sounds lots &amp; lots better than the iPod.! Besides having a smartphone that not only play audio/video but does more.<br />
<br />
I was amazed when the iPhone was released &amp; fans were boasting that the phone can play video! Blimey!<br />

            I still think its still premature to comment that the N97 will not be on par, if not better than the iPod. I got subscriptions of lots of tech mags, I always looks of what company have the most ads, by then I read their reviews of new products. The one,
 that have the most ads gets better review than those that don't or no ads at all. Its business! We just wait &amp; let the consumers decide.<br />

            I am glad that I passed on N96, and waited a little bit more. :)<br />
<br />
I knew the TRUE successor of N95 was not N96.<br />
<br />
There will also be an 8 MP phone soon to be announced from Nokia, too.<br />
<br />
Both N97 &amp; the 8MP NXX are worth waiting for. I will be getting one for sure!!!!<br />

            I envy the people that did not buy the N96....I would love to get rid of my N96 for a N97 :) I just wished I had known earlier about it...:(

            I'm glad I didn't pass on the N96. The wait until the N97 comes out would have driven me mad. It probably still will do as it's a long time to May/June! :)<br />
<br />
At the moment i'm against more megapixels. We need better optics, true optical zoom and xenon as standard before upping the MP count.<br />
<br />
Many people who demand more megapixels often don't even realise why. The masses tend to think that more MP = better camera which is rarely true.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of people that use phone cams often only view the images on the screen or print them out at 6x4" or 5x7". These are often the same people that look at the megapixel count as the phones main feature.

    <title>upgrading tech preview clean install to win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stewie1991  say:</h3>
<h2>            upgrading tech preview clean install to win 10</h2>
                    <p>I signed up to the insider program months ago, I installed the tech preview on a separate partition on my hdd to dual boot it with win7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunatly the hdd in question died a month or two ago and i replaced it with a new ssd that i installed the tech preview onto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer have a win7 install on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what ive read online, i have to have win7 installed so i can verify its validity in order to recieve win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that Microsoft wants me to uninstall tech prev, install win 7, reinstall tech prev then upgrade to win 10. This seems very tedious as I'd have to completely reset all my programs/features/and settings. Can I not just type my win 7 product key in
 to validate win 10? Or is there and easier way? I hear they deactivated tech preview keys now anyway, so I can't reinstall it if I do roll back to win7.</p>

            <p>Win10&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be using the motherboard serial and probably its profile or something from the motherboard&nbsp;as the key - apparently no longer keeps track of hdd/cpu/video cards etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't really need a written key so far, exception maybe an install may ask for an install key on a clean install&nbsp;but apparently there is a skip this step button.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've done clean installs of win10tp, I don't recall ever being asked to input a key - but
 I try to always first do the upgrade install when offered... but usually too many&nbsp;things need fixing and easier to just clean install or upgrade over itself lately seems to fix things quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I find it annoying that the mouse/touch option choice is common across all Office applications (as is so many other options). Having the toolbar on the side of outlook takes up space, yet I like the large icons in Excel. Just another compromise one has to
 make in working with this product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general the pre 2013 applications had a much better repertoire of visual options, the least of which is the colour scheme.</p>

<div>I am having this same problem. If I save and close a message and then open it again to change, the changes are not saved. I can type the whole message and save and/or send. It will go through spell check and act normally but then when I save, I see the
 changes were not incorporated. And/or if I open again before sending, I see the changes were not made. I am forced to copy and paste text into a new message. Very frustrating as I am sending out incorrect emails. Does anyone have a clue as to why this is happening?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried opening/closing Outlook and I have rebooted, but to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have not taken notice about whether it is a problem in non-html mail and/or safe mode but I can only assume it would be similar to Logan's problem. &nbsp;Also, in case it is important, I am using Outlook 2003.&nbsp;</div>

            Absolutely the same problem as above in my Outlook 2003. I tried shut down/restart, detect and repair, uninstalled and reinstalled, rebooted the system, but to no avail.<br />

Could it be a virus? Microsoft, are you listening?

            <p>Have you found the fix?</p>
<p>I just discovered that I have been sending unedited, garbage, first draft, emails since installing Windows 7. Turning off auto save helped with some of the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick test is to open an email you have sent, hit "resend", edit it and send it. If the edits are gone, the problem still exists.</p>

            I had also read about Internet 11 being the problem but haven't had the time to deal with it on that end. Did more searching and found a quick work-around that seems to work, using "Word 2003 to edit e-mail messages". I prefer using Outlook but have found
 that with Word, I am not having this problem so at least for now, until they fix this, using Word for emails has solved my problem.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The only decent way I have found is to turn off the auto save. Once I finish typing the whole message, I press F7 to spell check and once done, I save the message. After this I send the mail and it goes fine with all the edits intact. I also keep open a
 notepad text file for 'Outlook Message Draft' and keep copying and pasting my messages every few minutes and saving that file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very cumbersome method with many drawbacks such as I can't save a draft to edit them later in outlook, sometimes Outlook and its ilk (read: MS Excel) decides that they have encountered a problem and shutting down, making me lose messages; I can
 not have multiple messages being drafted at the same time etc etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me see how the IE-11 problem solver works on this.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm living for the third time in 2 years the nightmare of having my account ***email address removed for privacy*** seized by MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing me irreparable professional and personnal losses. For no apparent reason MS blocked my account. I suspect it was because I access my account from different countries in a relatively short period of time. I'm an airline pilot. So the security
 "intelligence" concludes that my account has been hacked and then block it.</p>
<p>However, on all the previous times I submitted the usual forms 3, 4 times and then got my account back. This time it isn't working!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's absolutely unnaceptable that MS proceed on such an irresponsible way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me have my account back. This has been my primary email address for over 15 years! I filled up the standard form 7 times, with no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I badly need it back.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook saved view keeps changing</h2>
                    <p>I create a view with certain parameters and I save it. When I go to that that view, I may then want go to the menu and change some of the view settings temporarily. For example. When archiving emails I like grouping in "from" in collapsed view which is a
 saved view. When I am actually in the view, I may expand some items. I may even revert to sorting by a different column. This is temporary however but it seems to automatically change the view folder settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for a saved view to stay fixed. That is it does not change dynamically whilst you are using it?</p>
<p>

            &gt;&gt;Whether I create it for 'current folder' or 'All IMAP folders', 
<br />Oh… this is part of the problem. Views are not as persistent in IMAP accounts. Editing the default views doesn't last long. New views do better, but as you've discovered, they are easily changed. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />Just to confirm, there is no way to create a 'Master View' like the existing ones that came with Outlook so that the view can be reset to original?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Correct. There is no master copy of the view. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />I'd like to give Microsoft feedback to incorporate this feature (don't know how to do that).
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />If you use the insider build of office, you may be able to report it as a bug - file, support, contact support. (Not all insiders have the option all the time.)

<h2>            X2-01 keeps turning off when receive messages, calls.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, my phone Nokia X2-01 keeps turning off when the ringtones activated i.e. during receiving messages, calls and even during alarm clock ringing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any solutions that I can do to get my phone back to normal?</p>

            Visio would be a much better program for creating such drawings.<br />
<br />
How did you create your drawing in Word (which features did you use)?<br />
<br />
You can add text boxes and you may be able to link them to other boxes using the group feature. The new text boxes can be formatted to not have a border and so appear as annotating text.<br />

            I used the organization chart in word. I don't have Visio and do not want to have to buy it.

Your last paragraph, can that be done in word and how?<br />

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>After upgrade to Win 10 (from Win 8.1) i noticed that Outlook stopped properly encoding outgoing emails.</p>
<p>I use plain text in all my messages.<br />
</p>
<p>Options&gt;Advanced&gt;International options</p>
<p>Dropbox "Preferred encoding for outgoing messages" is empty. I can't select anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook ver: 14.0.7153.5000 (32bit)</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home (64bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>Outlook just does not include charset field in header into outgoing messages.</p>
<p>When I get reply to my message with correct encoding in header I can see my text correctly.</p>
<p>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I restore encoding options?</p>

<p>After Outlook stopped sending out messages I found "sfc /scannow" solution for that problem.</p>
<p>Also sfc fixed encoding options. Shouldn't this run by default after windows upgrade if it is an universal cure for most problems?...</p>

<h2>            Latest Software Update V 20.0.012 makes the display behave in a wierd way, when unlocking the phone.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently updated my Nokia 5800 XpressMusic with the latest software version. The version now is&nbsp; V 20.0.012 and the Custom Version is 20.0.012.C01.01. The type is RM-356. The software and custom version dates are 26-01-2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, whenever I unlock my phone, my display becomes blurr showing some vibrating lines of many colours for 3-6 seconds. This happens only when I unlock my phone. I never had such problem when using the previous software version factory installed with the
 phone.</p>
<p><br />
Kindy help me out in this matter.</p>

<p>hi there...as you said...it is a HW problem..they could not rectify the display issue. They are going to send the phone to Delhi it seems. Did they send your phone there too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Care says they will replace the faulty parts...but not replace the phone</p>
<p>Anyway if the problem is not solved by doing so..then they will give me a new piece..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you push them to get a new piece...or they just gave you one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The waiting time is 15 days as you said...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm creating a lots of Word templates with date picker. When inserted to template the view is current month and year. After a while customers would like the view to be current month and year instead of the month and year the control was created. I know it
 has today button in it, but for some it is too difficult. So how to keep the view in current month. I can't use insert &gt; date and time for default text of the control for that I has guidetext in that.</p>
