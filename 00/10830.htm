            <p>If you have a Considerable amount of Fonts. You will have to hold button down and wait until List is generated. &nbsp;Font Cache files get slower and slower and slower, as the amount of free space on your computer gets less. &nbsp;Also on occasion The Font cache for
 office 2011 can Corrupt. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On 2016 I am unsure even if it has a Font Cache. If not, it has to take time to hunt every time in three Font folders locations on computer for usable fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&lt;opinion&gt;</strong> I honestly believe that 2016 actually needs more than 8 GB Ram to run efficiently, and if you have just 8GB you are pushing hard against the outer limits of decent operation.

            <p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the reply. But I am afraid this is not the issue I am experiencing. I have 32 GB of internal memory.</p>
<p>I gave only the standard fonts installed. The drop doc menu does not drop down. The size drop down does work perfectly. Can it be a problem of office hen communicating with the fonts on my mac. I have the same problem in word, excel and powerpoint,</p>
<p>many thanks</p>

            <p>Have you tried simply <em>restarting</em> your Mac? If that doesn't resolve it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is you installation of Office fully up to date? Version 15.15 (151008) is current. Once the update is applied run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions (if using OS X 10.10.5) followed by a restart. If running OS X 10.11.1, just restart after installing
 any updates.<br />

            <p>I'd like to chime in with the exact same issue. &nbsp;I just downloaded Office 2016 today (11/13). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, here is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-When I click the down arrow next to the font to see the full display of fonts, nothing happens. &nbsp;No spinning beachball...no spinning pizza...nothing. &nbsp;It's as if that button does not work.</p>
<p>-If I click on the font name it allows me to type in the name of the font I want to use.</p>
<p>-If I click on the down arrow next to the font size, all of the font sizes appear.</p>
<p>-This happens on Word, Powerpoint and Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Office 2016 on a iMac 24-inch Early 2009</p>
<p>OS X Yosemite</p>
<p>Version 10.10.5</p>
<p>8 GB Memory</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Office Version 15.16 (151105)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see if fonts were working elsewhere, I launched Pages and the fonts pop up instantly in that program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other function within Word seems to work without a problem.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the disk permissions first aid.</p>
<p>I have not tried to clear the font cache as that doesn't seem to be working for others.</p>
<p>I ran "console" -- one interesting thing I see is "Cocoa Scriptin error for '0x02bb0008': four character codes must be four character long. &nbsp;(though the numerical code changes in the many lines this appears). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I see nothing about fonts in the console log</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the fact that this is happening across multiple Macs it's not likely a hardware issue...but something in the software itself.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile TP Build 10536 - Collective BUGS and Feedback Thread</h2>
                    <p>So, here's my full list of bugs and feedback for improving Windows 10 Mobile starting from Build 10536 (I'm testing it on a Lumia 920):</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Windows 10 Mobile Build 10536 - BUGS AND FEEDBACK LIST:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>UPGRADE NIGHTMARE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading from WP8.1 takes very long time, almost 2 hours before I logged in W10M Start Screen on my Lumia 920;</li><li>Upgrading from WP8.1 generates a Start Screen bug where it took very long time for it to load-up. "Resuming..." took an average of 20-30 seconds before Start Screen to load, even after quitting a simple app by pressing Home or Back button;</li><li>Lag, slowdowns, crashes and many bugs stayed even after 24 hours of the phone let alone doing its things, and settling down;</li><li>SO: Upgrading as a whole was a very painful process and the only solution for the problems above (and many other quirks and oddness) was in the end an HARD-RESET of the device, WITHOUT restoring an old Backup, but starting new. Very annoying and
 time consuming;</li><li>PLEASE IMPROVE UPGRADE EXPERIENCE: Both from WP8.1 -&gt; W10M, and from Old W10M build -&gt; to new W10M. Always doing Hard Reset after an upgrade is&nbsp;<span>NOT</span>&nbsp;acceptable.</li></ul>
<p>HARD RESET + NO BACKUP = PERSISTENT PROBLEMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alarms sound stop working, and do not ring. Got late at work :(&nbsp;</li><li>Data Sense settings crashes or do not apply;</li><li>Groove Music stops playing music when other media content is loaded in the player (like it should be)...but then loses last playlist playing, and can't be resumed if not relaunched again from the beginning...</li><li>Camera App: swipe from left to right to smoothly load Camera Roll photos is missing. A downgrade compared to stock 8.1 Camera App;</li><li>Many animations are missing: for example opening Edge "Hubs" button, Edge "Tabs" button does not trigger any animation, and the next menu just appears like Windows 95. It happens many times with many OS menus, very ugly and a regression compared
 to WP8.1;</li><li>PIN Screen is visually very ugly and slow compared to both Android/iOS, and should be totally re-done and polished;</li><li>Many apps trigger "Loading" or "Resuming" black screen, while they never did on WP8.1 (for example: Facebook, Tubecast, Twitter, Mail, Calendar and even SMS, Dialer, Contacts);</li><li>Action Center needs transparency like Windows 10 Desktop (or iOS7-8-9);</li><li>Edge renders slowly and crashes on some webpages (example: www.winbeta.org or www.wmpoweruser.com or www.windowscentral.com);</li><li><span>Edge ABSOLUTELY needs an AdBlocker or TPLs (Tracking Protection Lists) support</span>. See new iOS9 Beta native ad-blocking features. It's night and day browsing after that;</li><li>Edge doesn't have "Google" search engine option instead of Bing;</li><li>Glance is not present in the "Extras" section. It can be opened from Store only;</li><li>Glance shows time only, and partial date or notifications even if enabled fully;</li><li>When clicking the Power button to wake the 
<p class="contentHeader1">PLEASE, now SHARE this list inside your W10M "Feedback App" (adding all your personal issues too).</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">

<p class="contentStandard">Thanks! :)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, they desperately need to dramatically improve performance on older phones (still "ex-Flagships" phones anyway, like 920/1020. It is not acceptable right now).</p>
<p>They only have 1 month left to RTM.</p>

            <p>Hold on a second ! RTM is planned for end of October ?!? I cannot see how the system can get ready by then.
</p>
<p>For me the latest build (10536) is a step back from 10512. Yes, some apps (like photos and mail) have been improved. But the list of bugs is long. When browsing through the feedback app I'm wondering how they can filter the important comments. How do I know
 as tester that my experiences are taken seriously ? Why should I write a long feedback if I don't even know that it reaches somebody ? They don't know me and cannot judge if my tests are real valid.&nbsp; I think that I'm a power user and as I'm working in IT I
 do have a good knowledge and understanding. But the feedback should be handled differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are a couple of bugs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* when entering the SIM PIN: pressing backspace once too often kicks you out of the application without the possibility to re-enter the PIN. Only a reboot can solve that !</p>
<p>* When taking photos, the "adding finishing touches" hangs sometimes making the photo and camera app unusable</p>
<p>* live tiles for mail not updating</p>
<p>* quick status on the lock screen unusable</p>
<p>* notifications not working properly. When a calendar appointment is still shown as banner, the corresponding sound will be played every time a new mail arrives.</p>
<p>* there need to be different notification sounds per mailbox</p>
<p>* custom ringtones do not work anymore (have in previous builds)</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The peoples tile need to have an option to turn off the animation of photos. Especially as only a subset of the people with photos is shown</p>
<p>* Photo live tile should get an option to show pictures from a specific folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Phone app and camera app takes too long to load. Those basic applications have to be kept in memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I live close to a border and the phone tends to use the foreign carrier (which causes roaming) although my home network is already available. I had to manually force it to use my carrier to avoid costs for roaming and to be able to use data connection.

</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, yes. That's the schedule.</p>
<p>On October 6 MS will officially announce Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL, among other devices (Microsoft Band 2 and, almost confirmed, Surface Pro 4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then they are going to ship those by the end of October, so, yes, Windows 10 Mobile must be RTM'ed before that date.</p>
<p>They could easily have even less than 1 month to fix all those issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems almost impossible for me too...</p>

            <p>I certainly agree. My&nbsp;outlook is tempered by my experience with PC version. Build 10166 was horrible and unusable, Build 10240 arrived 14 days before rollout and updates 3 days before RTM date caused removal of software to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They repaired all of these things in record time and maintained their rollout dates and Build 10240 became a stable and successful RTM rollout. I was amazed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully there is a build like that coming to Mobile soon, very soon.</p>

            <p>Hopefully Windows 10 Mobile TH2 will RTM very shortly, and Insiders will all get it first compared to all consumers, just in time for new Lumias (950/950XL) launch (and avoiding all Carriers crawling testing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After we get W10M TH2 RTM, we should opt-out Insider Program, and Hard Reset our phones (with No backup), and hopefully most of the problems will get fixed.</p>

            <p>Anyway: Samsung Galaxy Edge Plus is here, iPhone 6S is here, new Nexus and Android M is here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only Microsoft missing.</p>
<p>They cannot afford to launch on November, they need to launch 950/950 XL with Windows 10 Mobile
<strong>NOW</strong>, so (if they're smart enough), they could release it worldwide shortly after October 6 New York event, with Windows 10 Mobile 10240 TH1 + Patches, and upgrade them to TH2 on November.</p>

            <p>I fully agree with you. On my Lumia 640 4G I have rolled back to 8.1 two times being annoyed by many bugs and lack of functionalities. Now I'm running 10536. Few days after the installation was working well, but with time passing it becomes slower. It is
 strange that few days ago I was able to open and use apps like What's up or Microsoft Edge and now are closing by themselves after few seconds. All the menus are running very slow. Yesterday was disconnecting the SD card. After reboot I was not able to initiate
 any phone call till I was rebooting once more. It's like having its own personality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like nobody from MS is testing the builds before are released, but they are depending on our feedback solving the problems as are reported, repairing holes into a dam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately is the best way that MS is loosing its hardcore supporters. This Insider Preview program should be like a prize for them (us) to a painfull experience. Obviously some lags and bugs could occured and should be documented and reported, but from
 this to what we are experiencing with this WP10 upgrade session is non-sense. I was running from Android because of the lags and confusing menus, but I will be back if WP10 is just another copy of it.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Action Required&#93; Reconnect Outlook 2016&#47;2013 to Outlook.com for uninterrupted email access</h2>
                    <p>If I do as Outlook requests, and "Reconnect Outlook," I know I will lose my old, saved emails. &nbsp;I also know that it is possible to save these emails to a separate folder on my laptop. Is there a practical way to save them to an easily accessible, and searchable

            <p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's safe to remove, and re-add your Outlook email in Outlook 2013/2016. You won't lose any emails for as long as this email account is using the Exchange ActiveSync (Default), or IMAP server. If you're using the POP3 as your server, then the Outlook .pst
 files (Folders, and Emails) is saved in your Documents folder by default, and you can store this anytime in your Outlook 2013/2016.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have more questions.</p>

<h2>            Group Policy - Disable Auto Detect setting in IE 11</h2>
                    <p>We have a need to force clients to disable the Auto Detect setting in IE 11, for which there's no direct Group Policy setting which can be applied.
</p>
<p>There is the registry key to set this as in: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/askie/2014/12/17/how-to-use-gpp-registry-to-uncheck-automatically-detect-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>We have found a script to modify byte 8 to hex 05 which does seem to work, and we added this to a GPO to run every time on logon.</p>
<p>There is also a very obsure registry key as in <a href="http://blog.raido.be/?p=426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://blog.raido.be/?p=426</span></a>, but the key seems to be deleted once added, and this does not seem to be publicly recognised by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Are there any future plans to officially introduce a separate registry key to enable and disable the 'Automatically Detect' setting?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>We are attempting to develop a nice institutional reference notebook for all employees with tabbed resources and side menus. This view
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is great when viewing with the OneNote app</span></em> (see "far better" image)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when folks view the same OneNote Notebook through the online app (browser) it eliminates the top tabs and pushes everything into a small menu icon on the top left (collapsable) and when selected changes the entire structure of the notebook to a
 side-by-side horizontal menu system (<em>which is highly undesirable</em>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>#1 - What type of email account is involved with this (POP, IMap, Mapi etc) on your O'2010 system? To confirm, in Outlook go to menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Account type for each mail account involved will be listed on the Email tab</p>

            Thanks, Karl, but before I wrestle further with this or work my way through the 6-page Slipstick instructions, I should explain that I don't use Outlook as a mail client&nbsp;-- I use Windows Live Mil configured for POP3.&nbsp; Although I know Outlook has many useful
 features, the one that's most useful to me is Contacts, which serves as my "Rolodex".&nbsp; I have more than 200 entries there that I want to copy from Outlook 2010 (on a Win-7 desktop) to Outlook 2013 (on a new Win-7 laptop).&nbsp; I've done this in prior years with
 computers running Win-98 and Win-XP using simple export/import commands that are apparently no longer available.

            <p>Question comes down to where your contacts are actually being stored - in the WLM account configured in Outlook or in a PST file. Bottomline, contacts are being stored in a folder somewhere so either you have the WLM account configured in Outlook (whether
 or not you use it as your email client) OR you have created a PST file for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, your contact folder is contained in some kind of data store (either the WLM account configured as a MAPI account in Outlook - no pst file would exist in this case OR in a PST file). Either case, highly unlikely there is any need to export anything
 and equally likely that it would be the wrong approach to pursue. You'll need to be a bit clearer on what exactly exists in your current O'2010 profile</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From O'2010 menu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email tab will identify what type of email account (if any) is associated with the profile</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Files tab will identify the file(s) associated with profile</p>

&lt;sigh&gt; - that's exporting FROM a pst file TO a pst file.</p>
<p>All you needed to do is to COPY the pst file as I posted originally.</p>
<p>Outlook does NOT use any file other than a pst file to store your contacts in...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here's what usually happens if you IMPORT a pst file:</p>
<p>(Courtesy of Russ Valentine [MVP-Outlook])</p>
<p>Importing an entire PST may well corrupt your profile and may create a ghost <br />
PST that you can't close. Importing PST's will lose:<br />
1.&nbsp; Custom Forms<br />
2.&nbsp; Custom Views<br />
3.&nbsp; Connections between contacts and activities<br />
4.&nbsp; Received dates on mail<br />
5.&nbsp; Birthdays and anniversaries in calendar<br />
6.&nbsp; Journal connections<br />
7.&nbsp; Distribution Lists</p>
<p>Opening a PST file will preserve all of these. That is why we do not advise <br />
people to import a native file into Outlook. </p>

            I have outlook 2010 and was using an exchange server. I changed jobs and now lave lost contacts on the computers I deleted the company exchange password from. I still have all the contacts and calendar info on an I-pad and&nbsp;another laptop. Is there a way
 to save/import them to my personal contacts? Under suggested contacts (personal e-mail)&nbsp;I have 242, under contacts (exchange)&nbsp;I have 1176, under contacts(Outlook) I have 1185 and under suggested contacts (outlook) I have 51 items. I would also like to import
 the calendar events as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Outlook data &nbsp;in an Exchange account is one of the few times you DO use the export to a PST file function!</p>
<p>Open the exchange account and do file&gt; import and export&gt; export to a PST file.</p>
<p>Then copy the file to your new computer and open it.</p>
<p>Copy the other PST files and do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one caveat - do you have permission from your old employer to access and copy the data created on their exchange server?</p>

            Even when you try to export to excel rather than copy&nbsp;it gives the same error: that the clip board is full at 65000 records. (using excel 2010 and access 2010).

            No, I have not. A few people have replied with possible soultions but nothing has worked so far. So for now I am stuck with trying to use more critria to break my information into smaller chunks of information. Easier said than done sometimes.

            I had the same problem this was my solution and it worked! Open Excel 2007 and then link to the Access Database... follow the steps and then it'll take you to open the link to the table in the database. Then yo ucan save it down to your PC. let me know
 if that helps.

            In Access, export your data as a text file without formatting, and you&nbsp;can set it to comma seperated with headers ,and export as a flat file and then open the data in excel. It should work and bypass the clipboard

            Thank you for your suggestion ITGeek19! I am using Access 2010 and Excel 2010 and it is very frustrating since I cannot copy more than 65,000 records. I do management reports and need to consolidate data from different reports into one single spreadsheet,
 which I copy and paste from Access Queries. I resorted to selecting smaller sets of data, but then I need to change the query every time and copy and paste multiple times, each time scrolling down in Excel and pasting the next set of data.
<div><br />
<div>I have also used the export function, but then it exports to a new Excel sheet or text file, which you need to open and copy and paste from anyway. Fortunately, once the data is in Excel you can easily copy more than 65,000 records at a time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>65,000 lines may seem like a lot, but when you run historic reports on more than 15 million lines of data, then the 65,000 line limit is exceeded very quickly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Although the linking function works great, it means that I either need to copy the database together with the spreadsheet when I give it to management (not only is it huge, but this database also refers to several others - so the connection string in Excel
 will become invalid when they save the database to their local drive), or I need to create the link within Excel, copy the data to a new sheet, and delete the page with the link afterwards.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would have been so much easier if Access 2010 could simply allow me to copy more than 65,000 records to the clipboard. Excel and even Notepad can do this, so why not Access?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am running the 64bit version of Office 2010 Professional, and have 64GB RAM and a 65GB Swapfile using an i7-3960X, so it would have been nice if it was possible to use all these resources.<br />
<div>
<div><br />
<div>It used to be an Office 2003 limit of not being able to export more than 64,000 lines to a text file using Excel, so I am guessing that this limit is still lurking somewhere within Access....</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems Access 2010 may still be mostly 32-bit, since it uses only one CPU when running complex queries (on&nbsp;data sets&nbsp;exceeding 10 million records) while the other&nbsp;CPU's&nbsp;show almost no activity in Task Manager.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is any way to overcome the 65,000 record clipboard limit within Access, please post an answer.</div>

            Having said all this...
<div><br />
<div>(And I still think Access should be able to allow copying more than 65,000 records.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I see value in using the Link function in Excel, provided the Connection String within the spreadsheet can be&nbsp;standardized&nbsp;so that when you send the spreadsheet to another user, the links will still work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Using a shared drive is not ideal, since the Drive Mapping may not exist on the other user's PC, but it can work if both the Spreadsheet with the links and the database are in the same shared folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then you just need to map a shared drive using the same letter on the other user's PC and everything will work. Or if you want to have them in&nbsp;separate&nbsp;folders, map multiple drives, just using the same drive letter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The solution I am rather considering now is to create a SQL database for the management reports, and link a spreadsheet to that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will eliminate the need for a shared drive, and it will also mean that the summarized management report will automatically update every month (since it refers to Queries) and totally eliminate the furious copying and pasting every month.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am now really looking forward to this option!</div>

<h2>            Exclude an email address from an automatic reply</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a way to exclude one email address from an automatic reply. &nbsp;I have tried the following, however it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span> File</span><span></span><span>Automatic Replies</span><span></span><span>Rules</span></p>

    <title>Excel VBA Worksheet_Change replicating data - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel VBA Worksheet_Change replicating data</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; Novice learner here with a puzzling predicament.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table (formatted as table) that I've protected (to limit data entry to the table only).&nbsp; To add another row, I'm using the follow code (which works).&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; Table is cols A-F,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub AddRow()</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Unprotect Password:="***"</p>
<p>Dim WS As Worksheet<br />
Dim Tbl As ListObject<br />
Dim TblRow As ListRow</p>
<p>Set WS = Sheets("Chk Log")<br />
Set Tbl = WS.ListObjects(1)<br />
Set TblRow = Tbl.ListRows.Add</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Protect Password:="***"</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When a new row is added, cols H-N auto fill with Username (col H) and date (cols I-N).&nbsp; I think the cols are auto filling based on the code below but I want to execute the Worksheet_Change when data is entered in col A.&nbsp; Based on what I'm seeing , I think
 Excel is assuming the new row generates a requirement to add the user name and dates immediately.&nbsp; I want to add the row and then only populate the username and date when actual data is populated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
'<br />
' Captures last known data entry by name and date of entry<br />
'</p>
<p>If Target.Column = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Offset(0, 7) = Application.UserName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Offset(0, 8) = Now<br />
End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Both macros work fine without the other, I just can't seem to use them both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>

            <p>Hi Scott, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Excel has an Auto Fill feature that fill cells with data or information that you already provided. If you want to change how it automatically fills a certain data, we recommend following the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Filter-for-unique-values-or-remove-duplicate-values-ccf664b0-81d6-449b-bbe1-8daaec1e83c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> that will guide you on how to filter values or remove duplicate
 values on Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further information, here is another <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Fill-data-automatically-in-worksheet-cells-74e31bdd-d993-45da-aa82-35a236c5b5db?CorrelationId=f0e04c30-bcc9-4f14-bce6-25159ac361fe#ID0EAAEAAA=2016-2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>

            <p>Mayra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I probably wasn't clear enough.&nbsp; When I use the code to add another row (for example a 5th row), the code adds a 5th row.&nbsp; However, when it adds a 5th row, it then places the user's name in cell H5 and the date in I5, J5, K5,
 L5, M5, and N5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am looking to do, is execute code that adds a 5th row and stops there.&nbsp; Then, when I add data to cell A5, cell H5 will add the username and cell I5 will add the date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I am getting the immediate adds because of the first code (adding a row), where Excel assumes that adding a row is a Worksheet_Change (which admittedly it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something different I need to do with the second set of code that you can suggest?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if it possible to goalseek or solve for the first value that will make a formula return a positive value?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example if you have the price of a product and then all the costs involved, how many products would you have to sell to make a profit? Note - not maximum profit, but the smallest possible profit.

<p>
</p><p>I've tried having a TRUE if &gt;0 solution, but that just returns the first value GoalSeek finds that gives a positive value, not the smallest possible value.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Duncan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, your target is if the minimum profit is larger than zero, then the cell will return TRUE. You may refer to the following example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Here I create a simple table. In <strong>I2</strong>, I will use Solver to get a minimum profit. To add Solver, you can go to
<strong>File &gt; Options</strong>, in <strong>Add-ins</strong> tab, choose <strong>
Excel Add-ins</strong> in <strong>Manage</strong> dropdown menu then click <strong>
Go</strong>. Check the <strong>Solver Add-in</strong> checkbox then click <strong>
OK</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0653191b-f46d-47da-b6b6-73cdac77ab3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0653191b-f46d-47da-b6b6-73cdac77ab3d" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d873aa4-a9f8-47ea-b42d-1b4515765e1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d873aa4-a9f8-47ea-b42d-1b4515765e1c" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60890d96-abf7-4cc2-ae2b-baf4bd1d93e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60890d96-abf7-4cc2-ae2b-baf4bd1d93e0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Back to the table we created. In I2, insert the formula like: <strong>=IF((F2-G2)*H2&gt;0,TRUE,FALSE)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>I2</strong> then click <strong>Solver</strong> in <strong>Analyze</strong> group under
<strong>Data</strong> tab. In the <strong>Solver parameters</strong> dialog box. Choose
<strong>Min</strong> in <strong>To</strong>, and <strong>H2</strong> in <strong>By Changing Variable Cells</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84266d5a-3061-4ba3-8700-ce2ff5925a60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84266d5a-3061-4ba3-8700-ce2ff5925a60" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Then if the minimum profit is larger than zero, the result will be <strong>
TRUE</strong>, if the Profit is below zero, then it will be <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a39d22f3-6e61-435b-8445-b6808bae2a9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a39d22f3-6e61-435b-8445-b6808bae2a9d" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ad98d79-cb4c-4391-ac56-d56a1afaa3c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ad98d79-cb4c-4391-ac56-d56a1afaa3c7" /></a></p>

<h2>            Lumia 710 and earphone ISSUE</h2>
                    
<p><span>I got the Lumia 710 about a month ago when I lost my HTC HD7. My issue with it which just happen now is that my headphones (I try 4 different earphones and got the same issue) that the audio sound is lower and I can't hear the voice but the background
 only. It works fine when connecting to my car AUX but besides that I get that issue with any earphone and can't fix. Does anyone have this issue and know how to fix it?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If I put it on the speaker then it works fine too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also did a hard reset (Power, Down Volume and Camera button) and it didn't fix the problem.</span></p>

<p>Hi feinburgrl.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums.</p>
<p><br />
Have you made sure that the headphone jack is fully inserted? Also are you using some sort of protective case? as this maybe blocking the headphone jack from fully being inserted. If you can confirm that the headphone jack is inserted correctly if you can find
 some sort of plastic pin you can clean the headphone jack out as there maybe some dust so the jack may need cleaning. Give this a go and let me know if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also what model of headphones are you using? Have you tried an alternative pair and see if your getting the same issue? Are the headphones you are using come with a handsfree mic? If so try using a pair with no remote control or mic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</p>

            For me, a soft reset fixed my wired headset problems (partial sound in one ear, none in the other, and loud crackles when initiating calls).

<p>I just got a very similar problem with my 800.&nbsp; noticed that the phone jack cant be inserted fully into the socket.&nbsp; Remembered that a piece of tissue fell there a few weeks ago. got a paper clip, straightened it, removed a few pieces of tissue and "belly-button
 fluff" and the problem got resolved.&nbsp; Unusual and against Murphy's law, but true...</p>

<p>Ive had the same problem for about 3 months now, i can play music off the phone speaker, but when i use any kind of earbuds or plug in my external speakers, only parts of the music come out, and same as you with no voice. Heres how to fix it, if you have
 some technical skill, get a philips screwdriver and a tiny sharp pointed metal object, like a needle. Pull the battery out of your phone, and locate the screws to and remeove them. Just google a dissably video. once you get the back off put the rest of the
 phone aside, and deal with the back that you just took off. You will see the headphoen jack, you can remove it and once you have it, use the pin to first locate the copper connectors that are inside (not the outside ones) use the pin to push them down. Use
 a pair of earbuds to slowly insert them into the jack, make sure you see all of the pins inside move as you insert the earbud. Re-assemble and your will be done.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Header Margin Can&#8217;t Be Reduced Below 0.5 Inches In Excel Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin geithmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Header Margin Can&#8217;t Be Reduced Below 0.5 Inches In Excel Mac 16.21</h2>
                    <p>Over the last few days Ive been working on some spreadsheet templates that have to include our company logo in the header. However, I noticed that my 0.5-inch graphic would butt up against the main document body at a 1.0-inch margin, even though the header
 margin was set to 0.3 inches (which should give me 0.2 inches of gap minimum). However, recent versions of Excel on Mac seem to always use a minimum of 0.5 inches for the header margin, regardless of the setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using a clean document, tried using just text without graphics, and tried a different (older) laptop that I have that also has the same version of Office on it, and got the same result. However, Excel 2011 on Mac as well as Office 2016 on Windows
 show the smaller margin when the <em>same</em> document is opened on those platforms. Can anyone else reproduce this, and if so, is there a fix for the issue?</p>

</p><p>I did report the behavior, and someone actually did get back to me, which is the first time thats happened after quite a few submissions (although most of those were not real bug reports). Hopefully theyre putting some time into chasing down those annoying

<p><span>Hello Bullwinkle59,</span></p>
<p><span>Which site are you referring to?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to optimize Internet Explorer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps mentioned in the below article:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If this doesnt help, try<strong><span>resetting Internet Explorer</span></strong> (IE) &amp;
 register files which would delete all your browsing history.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, please type "inetcpl.cpl" (without quotation marks) in the Start Search bar and press Enter to open the Internet options window.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Switch to the Advanced tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the Reset Internet Explorer Settings button.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Reset to confirm the operation.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click Close when the resetting process finished.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Uncheck Enable third-party browser extensions option in the Settings box.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Click Apply, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Restart IE.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To reset Internet Explorer automatically, click the Fix this problem link in the below article:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Reset IE disclaimer:</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those
 set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</span></p>

    <title>How to change field Sensitivity in Conctacts &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricardo m afonso  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change field Sensitivity in Conctacts &#63;</h2>
                    <p>About half of my contacts in Outlook 2010 were not transferred to Outlook.com (windows live)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After some search I found out that all the contacts not transferred had the field Sensitivity marked as Normal, while the other ones were blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can see this field doing following steps:</p>
<p>1. Contacts</p>
<p>2. In Current View it's better to select List (this way you see all the fields)</p>
<p>3. Over the fields title, right click, field chooser, all tasks fields and select Sensitivity field</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if we go over the drop box of sensitivity field we see that this field has 4 options (Normal, personal, private and confidential). However there is no blank option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a contact is sensitivity empty and we chose any of those options, we cannot go back to empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the contacts not empty (blank) in this field are not transferred to windows live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how can we force that field Sensitivity to be blank ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            This could be simple, or not.

If the "different" country is in the same "region", there is no problem. If it is not, there is (a problem).

MS has split the world into several sales regions. You cannot use a key from a different region.

<h2>            How to make default OneDrive web view to classic</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>i have a user whose onedrive web portal keeps switching to the new view of onedrive instead of the classic view.&nbsp; the new view does not contain all the settings we need for our current workflows.&nbsp; i know we can select the return to classic onedrive link
 in the lower left corner of the window to revert back to classic view, but i am hoping to find a permanent solution to keep the classic view until we are ready to switch it back manually.&nbsp; can someone please help me?</p>

<p>basically i want the show ribbon option to be available in the new view.&nbsp;we need it so that we can expose the library tab. once we have the library tab, we select the open with explorer view button to see the folder view of our onedrive folders.<br />

<p>I cannot access my Microsoft Outlook account. It takes an extremely long time to load, and when it does it tells me "there was an issue looking up your account", which I cannot get past. This has been happening for 3 days.&nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>

            Had same problem.&nbsp; There is an issue with your URL.&nbsp; Remove all the junk after the login/ and try going to that URL. You should be able to sign in then and then view your inbox from there.

            Dear Kerry,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Please try to login to your account In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization and cause problems. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>
<br />
<br />It is better to avoid Safari, Firefox and Chrome for this as there are lots of problems with browsers recently <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> That is why please test this in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer in Private (CTRL+SHIFT+P)
<br />
<br />Please make sure to test at least in 2 browsers in Private mode. I have noticed that after recent browser updates, some of the extensions are blocking Outlook.com functionality.

            I am having the same issue since this afternoon 5/16. &nbsp;Was able to view normally this morning, now, blank area where messages for INbox, Junk, Deleted messages would normallly be. &nbsp;If I change the read pane in Outlook settings, to "bottom" I can view messages
 on the top 1/4 of my screen. &nbsp;When I click to open them, I get another blank window. &nbsp;Cannot read or reply to them. &nbsp;Another user said that an update was made 5/14 that affected users running on older platforms, which is the case for me (XP/Chrome). &nbsp;Have
 not found solution yet......
