<h2>            Uninstalled Latest Build</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I WAS looking forward to the latest build after trying the initial Windows 10 offer; I really LIKED! the new start menu and all that; but NOW ??? the latest build (99** ) is unworkable!! &nbsp;There seems to have been a lot of changes for the worse. &nbsp; I can no
 longer control the display size or location of programs and apps that display on the screen; etc. etc. &nbsp; If this is where it goes from here... it's worthless to me.. &nbsp; I am really disappointed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Am I the only one having this problem? &nbsp;Maybe I did something wrong??</p>

<h2>            error while getting preview builds</h2>
                    PC Toshiba laptop, AMD 2.0 GHz 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, touch enabled, Win10 Home (build 1511 10586.104). Still having trouble getting preview builds because of security errors in Windows, but I don’t know where the problem is. I had no problem setting up my
 older Toshiba laptop to Windows 10 Home (build 1511 12467 upgraded from Windows 7 Home), 1.5 GHz, 500GB HDD. I did chat yesterday with Cris C, but shortly after starting the chat, I had to go for tea, then when I returned, he terminated the chat.

<h2>            Problem ordering Microsoft Office HUP - ORDER placed but not completed as payment didn&#39;t go through and now system won&#39;t let me try to reorder</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone tried to order the HUP and placed the order but the payment hasn't gone through?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now down on the HUP website and order history as having ordered a product, so I can 't try and reorder it but never actually got the download as when I tried to sign into paypal for some reason I couldn't get in so the payment didn't go through?&nbsp; When
 I click on the link in my order history it says my order could not be completed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried ringing the customer services but although I have an order number - they can't find it on their system - they suggested I contact my work's benefit administrator but we currently don't have one so work can't help me.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Call saying it was from microsoft after 5 years offering to help with windows 7</h2>
                    A friend of mine just got a call from someone saying he could send a local tech out to help with her computer, which she bought 5 years ago and never used.&nbsp; I am concerned, as she is now setting up an appointment with him.&nbsp; Does microsoft set up these
 kinds of appointments for their services on a computer after so long a time?&nbsp; I feel this is a scam.

            <p>The question was answered off-site, by a friend of mine who verified that microsoft does not support in this way.&nbsp; I knew that but my friend who got the call, and has been receiving calls of this type for years, had to find out for herself.&nbsp; For the benefit
 of those who want to know: this was a company that did identify itself as microsoft, but had people with East Indian type accents, with boiler room background noises and high pressure sales men.&nbsp; They say that they are concerned about the security back up
 system going down, but not why they might have this concern&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such as microsoft not supporting windows 7 any more.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After some effort she got to someone saying they were a supervisor, and that they would send someone to the house if she would pay them 30.00.&nbsp; She did that, over the phone.&nbsp; Before she talked to me.&nbsp; After she talked to some other people who said the same
 thing, she went to the bank, which immediately voided the charge, which had not been enacted yet, and this had been several days by this point.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not believe these people.&nbsp; This is a scam of the lowest order.&nbsp; They prey on those who are in fear of windows 7 non support.&nbsp; Which is not true, as you can get malware bytes, or many other security systems that work even better than those patched up messes
 microsoft has now.&nbsp; Most of them are free.&nbsp; Stay safe, people.&nbsp; Be smart.</p>

                    <p>I am trying to set a validation rule for a table's primary key.&nbsp; the field is a 9 digit id and the field format is text.&nbsp; I have tried Like "000000000" as well as Like "#########", neither of these work as access keeps saying there is an operator missing.</p>
<p>I have simply removed the Like and input "000000000" but then access will not let me add a new record with any 9 digit number or edit an existing number even when the edit is to retype the existing id.</p>

    <title>Certain unicode characters in Word automatically getting changed to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffrey scottnuttall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certain unicode characters in Word automatically getting changed to Arial font &#40;which doesn&#39;t include those characters&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, this is my first time posting here, but I'm running into a problem that's driving me up the wall, and I've searched online and haven't found any answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Microsoft Office 365 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Word document in which I want to insert some Linear B characters. &nbsp;I found a free, open source Linear B font provided by Google (Noto Sans Linear B, available at&nbsp;https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-linb). &nbsp;I downloaded and installed the font.
 &nbsp;So far so good. &nbsp;The problem arises when I try to insert Linear B characters in a Word document. &nbsp;No matter what I do, Word converts the characters to Arial. &nbsp;(Or sometimes Calibri, the font associated with the Normal style in this document, which is equally
 unhelpful.) &nbsp;And since Arial (or Calibri) doesn't include the Linear B characters, they just show up as empty rectangles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried and what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to Insert -&gt; Symbol -&gt; More Symbols, and I choose the Noto Sans Linear B font. &nbsp;The Linear B characters show up properly in the Symbol popup! &nbsp;They look great! &nbsp;But when I insert them into the document, they get converted to Arial, and bam! &nbsp;Empty rectangles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select the characters that are showing up in the document as empty rectangles and try to change them to Noto Sans Linear B with the Font dropdown in the Home tab. &nbsp;No dice; Word's not having any of it. &nbsp;They stay Arial, and they stay empty rectangles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I change a bunch of regular text to Noto Sans Linear B, put the cursor somewhere in that text, and insert a Linear B character by typing in its Unicode number and Alt-X. &nbsp;Despite all the surrounding text being in Noto Sans Linear B, it gets changed to Arial,
 and shows up as a white rectangle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I define a new style based on Default, but with Noto Sans Linear B as the font. &nbsp;I select a block of text containing one of the aforementioned white rectangles and change the whole block of text to that style using the Style Gallery. &nbsp;All the text changes
 to Noto Sans Linear B, except the white rectangles, which stay in Arial, and stay white rectangles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be worth noting that the font works perfectly well in Excel! &nbsp;I can insert a Linear B symbol using the Insert -&gt; Symbol -&gt; More Symbols in Excel, and there it is in the spreadsheet, just like it should be. &nbsp;I can even copy one of those abhorrent
 white rectangles from the Word Document into Excel, change its font to Noto Sans Linear B, and there it is, looking just like it should. &nbsp;Excel works with the Noto Sans Linear B font just fine. &nbsp;But then if I try copying and pasting that Linear B character
 that's looking so pretty and perfect in Excel back to Word, in Word it changes back to Arial, and bam! &nbsp;White rectangle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I did search for answers, and I found some questions that seemed to be somewhat related:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_other-mso_2007/how-can-i-set-up-word-2007-to-not-change-font-to/c01fa801-d708-423c-88fd-e631e8146f8c</p>

<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_winother/font-changes-on-insertion-of-symbol/65445269-63b0-409b-a4c8-fd2a142e216d</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gather from these that how it's supposed to work is that if Word detects that the current font doesn't include particular Unicode characters, it automatically switches them to a font that does. &nbsp;The problem is that in this case for some reason it's doing
 the exact opposite—the font I'm trying to use&nbsp;<em>does</em> include these characters, and Word is switching automatically to a font that
<em>doesn't</em>! &nbsp;Is there any way at all to override this switch? &nbsp;I have tried closing and reopening Word. &nbsp;I have tried reinstalling the font. &nbsp;I have pored over the Options menu and the style manager for anything that might seem relevant, and have come
 up empty-handed. &nbsp;I'm not sure what else I can try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I did a little more searching and finally did find some reports on this specific issue, though made to Google rather than Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/issues/1046</p>
<p>https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/issues/902</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears the main issue is with the fonts rather than with Word itself -- the fonts have a field set incorrectly. &nbsp;(Odd that they work fine in Excel, though.) &nbsp;It looks like it may be fixable with some manual tampering with the fonts, though I haven't
 had time to try that yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still would be very nice if there were a way to manually override Word's font fallback, though.</p>
        </p>

<p>Okay, for what it's worth, in case anyone else runs into this problem I managed to get the font working with Windows by just opening the .ttf file in a font editor (I used Birdfont, but I'm sure other programs would work) and re-exporting it. &nbsp;Apparently
 that fixed the fields, because Word no longer forces the re-exported font into Arial; it works just fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, still would be nice if there were a way to manually override the font fallback in Word, but at least I got my specific problem fixed.</p>

    <title>Blank Email Body for POP3 Mailboxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pete thiringer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank Email Body for POP3 Mailboxes</h2>
                    <p>I am having a baffling issue with Outlook 2013. &nbsp;I am trying to set it up to receive email from my main email address, which is a POP3 account. &nbsp;After adding the account, the email messages download from the server just fine, but most of them are missing
 the body of the message. &nbsp;All I can see through Outlook is the sender and the subject -- the email body is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further inspection, however, I find that emails formatted in plain text ARE coming through. &nbsp;It is only emails in HTML format (the vast majority of emails in my inbox) that are erased. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Note:</p>
<p>1. The same thing happens with other POP3 inboxes. &nbsp;I added another one provided by my ISP, with the same effect.</p>
<p>2. I have disabled all add-ins, and have read about the issue with virus software, so have turned that off. &nbsp;No effect.</p>
<p>3. I added my Gmail account, which is an IMAP account, to Outlook and this works fine. &nbsp;So it seems to be limited to POP3.</p>
<p>4. I have tried creating new profiles, with no effect.</p>
<p>5. I have run the inbox repair tool, with no effect.</p>
<p>6. I have verified through various means that the email messages themselves are fine. &nbsp;I can receive and view them through older versions of Outlook (which I have been doing for years, as well as my phone, my Mac, and a web browser interface. &nbsp;The problem
 seems to be limited to Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this strange issue?</p>

</p><p>The build I see for Outlook is 15.0.4815.1000 I believe.</p>

<h2>            Problems Connecting to Toshiba Wireless Printer</h2>
                    I have updated my computer to Windows 10. &nbsp;We have a Toshiba Studio 3555 Printer. &nbsp;All was well until I refreshed my computer and it locked me out. &nbsp;The IT guy had to wipe my computer and install a fresh Windows 10. &nbsp;Now I am not connecting to the printer.
 We have pass codes on the printer. When I send a document to print, I have to go to the printer and search for "Invalid", and then print my document. &nbsp;I used to have a place on the settings where I could enter my password, but I don't see it anymore. &nbsp;Can
 anyone help me with this? &nbsp;Oh, I'm running a Lenovo Laptop.

<h2>            Conditional formatting not letting me copy right with conditional fomatting based on formula.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In old Excel (2003), I could copy right and paste a conditional format in other cells, with a conditional format based on a format. Excel 2007 won't let me. Here's the details:</p>
<p>I have a rows of data (A1 to BZ200).</p>
<p>On&nbsp;another row, say, row 235, I have added conditional formatting like this:</p>
<p>in cell G235:&nbsp;=IF(G$197&lt;&gt;"RR")&nbsp;. I've formatted the cell to highlight Red if G197 does not equal "RR".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't working at all. PLUS -&nbsp;another issue&nbsp;is that&nbsp;when I copy right, the conditional format formula still shows "G197" even though I removed the '$' from the G.
</p>
<p>Arghh!!&nbsp; I miss Excel 2003!! </p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated! </p>

            First, your formula should be written a little simpler as,<br />
<br />
=H$197&lt;&gt;"RR"
<div>... or,</div>
<div>=IF(H$197&lt;&gt;"RR",TRUE,FALSE)</div>
<div>... if you prefer the longhand or,</div>
<div>=AND(G$197&lt;&gt;"RR",G$197&lt;&gt;"")</div>
<div>... if you wish to disregard blanks (helpful when applying to the entire row).<br />
<div><br />
<div>The <i>copy &amp; paste</i> or <i>fill right</i> should be working for you but this creates multiple rules. With Excel 2007 you are best served by using
<i>Conditional Formatting, Manage Rules</i>&nbsp;and changing the cell reference in the&nbsp;<i>Applies to</i>&nbsp;text box. This can be typed manually or selected through dragging a range of cells.</div>

<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>

<p>I understand that you want to keep a track of your data usage in your phone. You can use Data Sense for that. You will find it on your phone when you go to Settings &gt; Data Sense. You can set a data limit or restrict data usage in the background. For further
 information, please see the following article:</p>

    <title>Removing horizontal lines in online version of Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jammiebebout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing horizontal lines in online version of Word</h2>
                    I am really hoping someone can help me. I am using the Office 365 online version of Word on my ipad. I wanted to create a horizontal line using dashes in my word document, but once I hit enter, it became a solid line across the width of the document that
 I have been unable to delete. Everything I have found online says that I have inadvertantly created a border, but the instructions for deleting it are not applicable to the online version of Word, as far as I can see. All the instructions say to remove the
 line by deleting the border in borders and shading. However, in the online version of Word, this does not seem to be possible as I have been unable to find borders and shading at all. Can someone please help me? I am trying to finish a novel, and this has
 totally screwed up the looks of it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>Hi <strong>Jammie</strong>,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have tried to replicate the same process of using dashes to create a horizontal line in

</p><p>The only difference I see between what you did in your attempt to replicate my issue and what I did was that my line using dashes/hyphens was much longer. Mine was nearly the width of the text before I hit enter and the line turned solid. I don’t know if
 that makes any difference, but that is the only thing I can see that differs between what I did and your screenshot. I still haven’t figured out how to delete the line. I can’t even select it. Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;JammieBebout,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried replicating your concern here on my end. Just to verify, can you check the screenshot below if this is what you're trying to achieve?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c1e64f3-20a2-4343-8ba5-16dc5b8e5726?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c1e64f3-20a2-4343-8ba5-16dc5b8e5726?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, here are the steps that I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to the <strong>Review </strong>tab.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Spelling &amp; Grammar</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click <strong>AutoCorrect Options...</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aaa7065b-a117-4849-afdf-9fc77663283d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aaa7065b-a117-4849-afdf-9fc77663283d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Uncheck the option beside<strong> Replace hyphens (--) with dash (-).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e6acb12-d02b-4147-adfb-379fcbc788b1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e6acb12-d02b-4147-adfb-379fcbc788b1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try performing these steps and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.<br />

<p>Spelling and grammar is not actually an option for me to select. All I have available to me under the icon for spelling and grammar on the review tab is the choice of proofing language and a select button for spelling. That’s it. Here is a screen shot showing
 what I’ve just described. You can also see the horizontal line on my document that I need to delete in the background. Hope this helps. Also, I tried to find something identifying the version of Word I am using or something of the like, but the Help available
 simply identifies it as Word for iPad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As i tried to explain in my last post, apparently unsuccessfully, I can’t use the workaround you described because the options you are talking about are not available to me. They literally do not exist on my toolbar. What you see in my screenshot is everything
 that is available to me on the Review tab. There is nothing more. Actually, there are a few more icons on the right side of the toolbar that are not visible in the screenshot, but they are all related to the track changes function, not spelling and grammar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to the questions in your post, I am using an iPad Air2, and the ios version I’m using is the latest available for the iPad, which is 12.1.4. I don’t know what you mean by build, so I can’t answer that. The version of Word is 2.22, according to
 the information in Settings. I hope this helps. Thanks for working to find a resolution for me. I really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Thanks for the information, Jammie. Since it's now verified that you're using Word app for iOS, I'd recommend performing the workaround that
<strong>Kris</strong> <strong>Ver</strong> provided while we are coordinating with our Internal Support to verify if this is a feature limitation in Word app for iOS.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To do the workaround, you have to use your <strong>Safari</strong> browser for now to access
<strong>Word</strong> <strong>Online</strong> or you may click on this <strong><a href="https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Word Online">link</a></strong>. Once you were able to log in your account online, you can
 now follow the steps that Kris Ver provided about going to <strong>Review tab &gt; AutoCorrect Options</strong> that was posted last Feb. 14, 2019.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should you have further questions, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get informed and reply back to you as soon as I can.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Autofit option in Format Data labels is greyed out - why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autofit option in Format Data labels is greyed out - why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a scatter plot graph and added the data labels and then typed text over the data points in the labels.&nbsp; THe problem is when I have a long label name, the text wraps and I would like it to auto fit.&nbsp; When I right click and choose Format Data Labels,
 the option to auto fit is greyed out.&nbsp; Can I change this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't have the ability to "stretch out" the label box manually which would be another option.&nbsp; Can I change this?</p>
<p>The text is set at 8pt.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately, data labels are the step-children of chart formatting and are severely limited in their formatting options. This is not new; it has been that way for many versions of Excel. Many formatting options simply are not available for data labels
 in a chard, and this includes sizing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't shoot the messenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After getting it, we will check the logs and contact the engineer, then give you some updates.</p>

<p>hi tobias,</p>
<p>thanks for the update in pm.</p>
<p>i checked the sr and found it still is in open state. you may consider waiting for some time to let that engineer contact you or posting the question here in detail so we can assist you.</p>
<p>i notice the question you asked in sr is not in english. so, if you prefer to use that language to clarify the question, you can consider choosing a correct language forum on the upper-right corner since this forum is a english forum.</p>

<p>Hi Iris, </p>
<p>thanks for the fast Response. I just wanted you o check the Status of the SR because it is open since the 14. January and I did not yet get any email or call...</p>
<p>The Problem in Detail: </p>
<p>When I try to get some data for Usage Reports I created, the PowerShell Commandlet Get-SPOActiveUserReport does not give me back complete results. There are always some days, weeks or even months missing... When I use the PowerShell Scripts in other tenants,
 it's the same problem there... Any thoughts? </p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            Saving a PDF with Searchable Text from PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>When I use the Save As function and then select PDF as the file type, the PDF that is created does not have searchable text. I can neither select nor search the text. (The text is not being converted to an image because when I use the Edit PDF function in
 Acrobat, I am able to copy/edit the text.) My co-worker does not seem to have this issue when she uses the Save As function in PowerPoint and then selects PDF as the file type. She has no problem selecting/searching the text in the PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing all the settings in PowerPoint related to fonts and text, and I have not been able to fix the issue. Has anyone else experienced this and/or found a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>Hello Sophiaan,<br />
<br />
There is no such similar settings in Skype for Business admin center to add a domain and set specific privacy relationship for all users from that domain.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, you can choose the default online presence setting for everyone in your organization. Go to the Skype for Business Online admin center &gt; Organization &gt; General.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Infact individual users can later change this setting themselves using Skype for Business Options dialog box.<br />
