<p><strong>hi to all, i have a very small problem thats bothering me with windows 7, i recently installed windows 7 ultimate 64 on mi acer 5929g and it runs perfectly, no complains, but after i made the installation a Windows.old folder was created on mi C:
 drive, i know it was from the old OS, so since i&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;need it anymore i deleted it, everything went smooth&nbsp;until&nbsp;a message appeared about 2 files, it says "could not find this item" "this is no longer located in (filepath)" . these two files have very strange
 unreadable names, they belonged to secuROM,&nbsp;Ive&nbsp;tried almost&nbsp;everything, deleting them from command prompt, from safe mode, with the explorer off, the filepath is the following : Windows.old/Users/(Username)/AppData/Roaming/SecuROM/UserData/(the two files
 i mentioned)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ive been into forums and did many google searches but nobody seems to know the right way, any help will&nbsp;surely&nbsp;be appreciated.</strong></p>

    <title>Connecting to Xbox Live on startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zuawg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to Xbox Live on startup</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I turn on my Xbox One, it signs me in and then on the home screen, it says that I am not connected to Xbox Live. So I go to Network Settings, and it says everything is fine. I can usually even go to my friends list and it loads no problem. This
 occurs on the home screen for about a minute and then it will load everything like normal. This is not a major issue, as I am not having trouble actually connecting to Xbox Live, but I find it strange that the home screen thinks that I am not connected to
 Live. This is more of a mild annoyance, and I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing anything similar, or if there is a fix.</p>

            <p>Hey there Foniax!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue, I'm happy to hear it is not affecting game play but we would like to figure this out with you! :) If you haven't already, let's start with a power cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Unplug the power from your Xbox One console and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Plug in and power on the Xbox One console.</li>
<li>Verify if the issue persists.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the issue does persist after performing the steps above, visit our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page and&nbsp;give our phone support a call. Feel free to post back and let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>Alright, I powered down my Xbox and unplugged it for 5 minutes and then powered it back on. Everything on the home screen loaded as normal, so it seems to have worked for now. If it helps, my Xbox is on Energy-Saving mode, so perhaps that has something to
 do with it. Either way, I will keep you updated if the problem persists, but so far, it seems to have worked.</p>

<p>So, when I turned on my Xbox today, it happened again, so that solution did not work. I will try setting my Xbox to Instant On, and see if it happens again.</p>

<h2>            Constantly given error messages that make the game unplayable</h2>
                    
<p>I am constantly getting error messages such as&nbsp;<span>" certain features require a connection to xbox live. &nbsp;Please check your network connection and configuration." when my connection is fine. I cannot even edit my&nbsp;my player without&nbsp;</span>being kicked to
 the main menu, losing all progress. Has anyone figured out how to fix this? I've reinstalled the game twice and even used a different disc for one of the installs (Best Buy wouldn't let me return the game).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated!!</p>

<p>It will be a problem on 2K's end with their servers. I haven't played in a few days and jumped on before for some MyCareer action only to get disconnected with 1:40 to go in the 4th. I was having a great game too, despite getting thrashed. This has happened
 a fair bit and is very annoying, especially when it happens in the 4th as about an hour has been played only to be lost.</p>
<p>I don't know why they didn't add a auto save feature for when this type of thing happens, because they have removed the save and quit feature which is pretty poor. I used to like being able to save whenever I had to leave the game for something then return
 to where I left off.</p>
<p>2K needs to get there biz sorted. Until the issue is fixed I don't think I will bother playing for now.</p>

            Hi eJudz
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            My pc fails to enter into the recovery environment. Just keeps taking me to same place. Even after the hardshut down. When i hit safe mode - it shutdowns and restarts with the same issue before it could even make it to the safe mode

            Hi eJudz
<br />
<br />Do you have a backup of your data?
<br />
<br />When you say you created a Recovery Disk, is that Windows 10 installation media created with the Media Creation Tool?

            Hi eJudz
<br />
<br />There should be no need to purchase Windows . . .
<br />
<br />Have you tried booting from that recovery drive by changing the boot order in BIOS
<br />
<br />If so, what exactly happens when you try that?

 Bios settings dont come up, not even during load screen. Which i found odd, i created a repair disk from my other computer, but it always loops back to that blue screen. I guess the restart after a failure is active and it keeps bringing me back to the blue
 screen. I havent found an option to allow me to boot from a different usb or disk. Ive done it before to other computers but this ones rare for me. It goes to “

            Hi eJudz
<br />
<br />Before that blue screen appears, do you see the Manufacturers logo screen?
<br />
<br />On the manufacturers logo screen you need to repeatedly press the appropriate key to get into BIOS
<br />
<br />Generally that key is F2, on HP systems the key is F10 - what is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now that you have me with you let me take care of this.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide us additional information to assist you better with this issue: </p>
<ol>
<li>What is the complete error message/ error code of this issue?</li><li>Are you referring to the Windows Mail app/ Windows Live Mail/ Mail client version of Office Outlook when you say: "Microsoft Outlook not responding"?</li><li>Are you able to boot the operating system to desktop with this error message?</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span>This Stop error message usually occurs during installation when there was an attempt in kernel mode to touch pageable memory at too high a process
<strong>internal request level</strong> (IRQL). Typically, this error occurs when a driver uses an incorrect memory address. Other possible causes of this error include an incompatible device driver, a general hardware problem, or incompatible software.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to boot the device to desktop, try the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I suggest you to boot the system to Safe mode wherein the computer starts with basic drivers and no third party programs. Check if you are still receiving the error message.</p>

<p><span>I have some problems with BitLocker</span>
</p>
<p><span>I use this soft on my PC, on partition D:</span></p>
<p><span>This partition was encrypted succesfull</span></p>
<p><span>After locking the partition, it just disappeared and when I was able to see it again, I saw the messages:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>" You need to format the disk in drive D: before you can use it. Do you want to format it ? "</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I press Cancel and the answer is:<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>" D: is not accessible</p>
<p>The volume does not contain a recognized file system.</p>
<p>Please make sure that all required file system drivers are loaded and that the volume is not corrupted. "</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I want to use BitLocker Repair Tool, but is not compatible with my W7.</span></p>
<p><span>Please help me, because all my life is on D: (pictures and movies of me and my wife and children).</span></p>

<h2>            Screen recording with voice and live streaming to YouTube</h2>
                    <p>Hi, is Xbox ever going to add real screen recording (with voice) because it's really hard for YouTubers with Xbox to make gaming videos. Basically all that is needed in the update is, up to 1 hour of game DVR with voice and live streaming to YouTube. Kind regard</p>

<h2>            When will banned GTs become available&#63;</h2>
                    So there's a gamertag I've been wanting to get my hands on, and it's been banned for a little over 10 months. When is Microsoft going to clean these off the list and allow others to use them?

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>As far as I know, banned account do not get deleted.</p>
<p>They remain in the Xbox Servers.</p>
<p>Deleting the banned account will be kinda dumb in a way.</p>
<p>Because the banned account still actually belongs to a person, and surely that person wouldn't want to get his account deleted.</p>
<p>So, I really don't think it will get removed/deleted.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>Looks like this is going to turn into a flame fest. Alright, total clarification incoming. The rights to the gamertag expire after approximately 7 years of being inactive. The gamertag is then released to the public for us, whereas the banned account remains
 disabled, the gamertag (which is ONLY the name of the profile, not the profile itself) is simply disassociated. Can I get a support agent working in this forum to verify this for me please?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Defender - no other antivirus</h2>
                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently moved on to Windows 10 from 7. I previously used the Windows 7 antivirus software, so I had no other antivirus installed. The only thing I have is Spybot search and destroy, the free version without antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sporadically getting messages telling me that Windows Defender is off, if I try to turn it back on it says it cannot. It suggests I have another antivirus running, but I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a home built machine, so no pre packaged things here. Does anyone have any ideas? As it stands I am having to install another option, but I was happy with Windows Defender and would like to get to the bottoms of it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let</span><span> me help
 you to fix the issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to make the “Windows defender Service” startup type to “Automatic”.<br />
<br />
<strong>Follow these steps:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>a. Press “Windows key + R” from keyboard.<br />
<br />
b. Type “services.msc” without quotes in the “Run” Window and hit enter.<br />
<br />
c. Search for “Windows Defender Service”.<br />
<br />
d. Make “Startup Type” to “Automatic”.<br />
<br />
e. Restart the computer and then check how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If issue didn't get resolve try method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> <strong>Disable&nbsp;the security software temporarily.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If issue still persists try method 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:System File Checker.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>You may run the system file checker tool and check if it helps. SFC scan will scan for the corrupted system files on the computer. You may refer to the following article in order to use System File Checker tool appropriately.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.

    <title>mi consola se tarda demasiado en prender - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yiyock  say:</h3>
<h2>            mi consola se tarda demasiado en prender</h2>
                    
<p>hola otra vez molestando, quisiera saber si alguien puede ayudarme con mi problema. Mi xbox 360 es la edición limitada de COD MW2 con Disco Duro de 250 gbs de los cuales me quedan 199, el caso es que tarda demasiado en prender desde que la compre pero pense
 que era normal, todos los días le borro la cache del sistema y aun así se tarda demasiado en prender casi casi como 5 minutos y no se como solucionarlo. Un amigo tiene una consola normal y le quedan 8 gbs libres y prende mucho mas rápido que la mía y no se
 por que. Les agradecería que me respondieran. Saludos...</p>

<p>ahi pueden ser un par de cosas </p>
<p>no creo que sea el cache de la misma pues al hacer eso cada vez que metas un juego lo va a actualizar o no????</p>
<p>mas bien lo que deberias de hacer es llamar a soporte 001-866 745 83 12 &nbsp;y cometarles a mi punto de vista puede ser tu HDD (disco duro) que esta tardando mucho en leer la informacion que tienes guardada, por eso se tarda tanto en prender, la consola puede
 tardar un poco dependiendo del la info que contenga el HDD pero no casi 5 minutos es mucho</p>
<p>llama no te preocupes por el numero es gratuito</p>

<h2>            error installing virtual pc on W7&#58; 0x80096002 The certificate for the signer of the message is invalid</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded my PC from W7 to W8
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to install Virtual PC because I have some important software which worked on W7 but will not work W8 (I mistakenly thought there were few underlying technical differences between W7 and W8)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I run the&nbsp;Windows6.1-KB958559-x86-RefreshPkg MSU I get this error:</div>
<div>
<div>windows update standalone installer&nbsp;</div>
<div>error: 0x80096002 The certificate for the signer of the message is invalid</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really need to get virtual pc working soon otherwise I am going to have to give up on W8 which I don't want to do (if only because I shall have to spend 2 more days slowly re-installing software!)</div>

            <p>Hi Richard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtual PC is not compatible with Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 includes The Hyper-V virtualization component that you can use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have questions about this component, please ask on the following forum. This is where the Hyper-V experts answer questions.</p>

<h2>            BSOD with message SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</h2>
                    <p>I've been having on and off BSOD issues for the past couple weeks while playing video games such as Heroes of the Storm and Final Fantasy XIV and using Discord, with error messages going between SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED and MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.

<p>
</p><p>I'm having a hard time finding the issue on my Event Viewer, but these are the details under the System event that happened near the time of the latest crash:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if this isn't very helpful, I'm not very good at reading crash reports - this is the first computer I've built and it has run fine since I built it about five-six months ago and suddenly I'm getting blue screen issues. This is very frustrating.
 My Windows is up to date as well as my graphics driver through GeForce Experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me if you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: as of 4/20/18 I have uninstalled Bitdefender and have not had any crashes since. I am not certain if it 100% fixed the issue but I will mark the issue as resolved until another problem arises.</p>

            Two things:
<br />1. Nvidia Driver
<br />2. BitDefender.
<br /> *** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for atc.sys
<br />atc (DPC @ ffff908acb041210)+ce0d0 
<br />Please uninstall BitDefender, at least temporarily to see if this is the actual cause-ATM it does look like.
<br />Use WD as it is as good as any other:

<br />
<br />I would try the top update first and see if the issue is resolved after a reboot!
<br />
<br />Though, if your system is up to date, you should already have these updates, but I think it would be worth a try . . .

    <title>Resetting PC followed by power outage equals disaster - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daverob11h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resetting PC followed by power outage equals disaster</h2>
                    <p>Hoping I can explain this so it makes sense...here goes.&nbsp; I previously had Windows 7 Home edition and when Windows 10 came along I took advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10 Home Basic.&nbsp; In November I was automatically updated to the new build (updated
 from build 10240).&nbsp; Everything was going great until I utilized Ashampoo Disk Defragmenter which gave me some problems and I ended up deleting the program; however, Windows 10 didn't bounce back from that so I did the "Reset PC" option.&nbsp; It went through the
 resetting process, finished that, and was beginning to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; It was in the approximate 5% complete range when the power went out (for about 15 minutes - this was on Christmas day).&nbsp; When powering back up after the power came on, I was presented
 with a system which wouldn't boot, giving me a message that it was shut down unexpectedly and couldn't continue with the installation, so "click OK" to restart computer and then it would continue with the installation.&nbsp; I did that and it just kept going to
 the same message and never continuing the installation.&nbsp; I thought I had made a system image of the Windows 10 Home Basic and put it on one of my external hard drives, so I took the external hard drives to work with the intention of burning it to a DVD and
 saving my system.&nbsp; It turns out that I didn't have one (it turned out to be a system image of the Windows 7 instead).&nbsp; So I did some research online and found a site offering "Download Windows 10 RTM Build 10240 ISO."&nbsp; So I downloaded it, burned it to a DVD
 and brought it home.&nbsp; I installed it on my computer and it turns out to be Windows 10 Pro instead of Home (the aforementioned site also gave the Key # to use during the installation).&nbsp; Also, during the installation I had to use the "customize install" versus
 "upgrade" as I was presented with other tasks which I wasn't able to complete, so I guess this is considered a "clean install" (but not really sure if that is correct or not - just throwing it out there).&nbsp; I have attempted to Activate Windows but it is unable
 to do it, probably because of the above information.&nbsp; Now I need to know what to do next in order to get back to the Windows 10 Home edition (is the ISO available somewhere online).&nbsp; Luckily I had printed out the Key # to the Windows 10 Home edition, so I
 have that available, if that will speed things along any.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this situation will be very much appreciated.&nbsp; It was bad enough that I lost all my bookmarks on three different browsers and most of my recently installed applications, so I don't look forward to any more bad news.&nbsp; I'm hoping for an "easy
 fix" to this situation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that you had Windows 10 on your system long enough that it was activated.&nbsp; Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So I did some research online and found a site offering "Download Windows 10 RTM Build 10240 ISO."&nbsp; So I downloaded it, burned it to a DVD and brought it home.&nbsp; I installed it on my computer and it turns out to be Windows 10 Pro instead of Home (the
 aforementioned site also gave the Key # to use during the installation).&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why didn't you just go to the Microsoft website?&nbsp; This scenario doesn't quite sound like it's legal.&nbsp; You get a copy of Windows 10 Pro, with a product key to boot?&nbsp; Because you had Windows 7 Home and upgraded to Windows 10 Home, the pro version is not going
 to activate on your system.&nbsp; Your hardware is now only entitled to the Home version as that "product key" is already embedded onto your motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home&nbsp;should install with no problems.&nbsp; I hope you had your personal files backed up.&nbsp; If you don't, that might be reason to use your Windows 7 image first, then running the upgrade again.</p>

            <p>Brenda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply.&nbsp; Yes, I had the Windows 10 Home on my pc long enough so that it was activated.&nbsp; I appreciate your link to the Windows 10 Home ISO.&nbsp; I think I'm going to take your suggestion and use the Windows 7 image first and then upgrade
 again so that possibly I'll be able to get my bookmarks and applications back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I'm a novice at this I have a couple of questions.&nbsp; I found the image files on my external hard drive and am now "copying and pasting" to my desktop (to make it easier - hopefully).&nbsp; Here's a picture so you can see file names, etc.:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d1a845d-fd6f-4c98-8211-49d663bff2d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d1a845d-fd6f-4c98-8211-49d663bff2d7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>They both have the same file name with the exception of the 8th character (c on the first and d on the second).&nbsp; The first is 9.20 GB (dated 7/28/15 at 9:53 AM) and the second is 289 GB (dated 7/28/15 at 12:54 PM).&nbsp; I'm now at a loss as to how to execute
 this.&nbsp; I thought it was going to be simple (like burning it to a DVD and going from there) but that seems unfeasible due to the size of the files.&nbsp; When I "right click" on each of the files I have the following choices:&nbsp; Mount, Open With..., Restore Previous
 Versions, and then the usual choices.&nbsp; Do I use any of those options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can give is more than appreciated...I look forward to your reply.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a link for you to look at.&nbsp; It&nbsp;pertains to Windows 8.1, but it will also work with the Windows 10 Pro operating system you currently have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/167984/how-to-create-and-restore-system-image-backups-on-windows-8.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/167984/how-to-create-and-restore-system-image-backups-on-windows-8.1/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll to the section, "Restore a System Image Backup."&nbsp; You can get to the Advanced Startup Options in the settings.&nbsp;
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Recovery &gt; Advanced Startup &gt; Restart Now</strong>.&nbsp; You didn't need to copy the files to the PC.&nbsp; You can just connect your external drive, then navigate to the Advanced Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what's up with you having two image files.&nbsp; Obviously you want to use the 289 GB image file.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Brenda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy New Year!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your continued help.&nbsp; I'll give that a try later after I get a little sleep.&nbsp; I deleted the smaller image file from my desktop so will see if I can successfully do this.&nbsp; I had the external drives attached the last time but I couldn't navigate
 to them so that's why I copied it to the desktop.&nbsp; Perhaps since it's there, the system will find it automatically and I won't have to try to navigate there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank you for your help and if you have any further tips before I attempt this, please respond.&nbsp; I'll check in here before I attempt this in case you have any more helpful tips.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here's an update.&nbsp; I attempted to run the Windows 7 image file (the bigger one) and it said it couldn't be used as there were no hardware files on it.&nbsp; I tried with the smaller one and got the same message.&nbsp; After that, Windows Update installed the new build
 (Version 1511, OS Build 10586.36) of Windows 10 Pro, which I'm still unable to activate.&nbsp; I checked out the first site you told me about (the official Windows ISO file) and according to that you have to have a qualified Windows 7 machine but my machine is
 recognized as Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; Should I attempt to use that ISO file to "downgrade" to Windows 10 Home (if that's even possible) or should I use my Windows 7 installation CD to set it back to Windows 7 (knowing full well that I will lose all programs) and
 then upgrade to Windows 10 Home?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Shoot Dave, I was hoping you could get back some programs and personal files with those Windows 7&nbsp;system image files.&nbsp; Do you have backups other than the system images?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use the Windows 10 .iso file, the process will reinstall what ever version that the computer is entitled to use.&nbsp; The process will see that you have a Windows 10 Home&nbsp;entitlement already embedded onto the motherboard and the process will then install
 Windows 10 Home. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not pay any regard to Windows Update installing updates for Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a home version of Windows 7.&nbsp; You upgraded to Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; That information is still embedded on your motherboard.&nbsp; Doing a clean install of Windows 10 Pro
 did not remove the entitlement that was already there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it said it couldn't be used as there were no hardware files on it&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any error codes?&nbsp; Did it say driver files?&nbsp; The Windows 7 system image should be complete, backing up everything needed to run the operating system.&nbsp; I'm sure there are programs that you can use to manipulate the .VHD files, but they cost.&nbsp; If you get an
 option to mount the files, you can try to save&nbsp;your personal files.&nbsp; Is your external HDD formatted in NTFS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need to reinstall Windows 7 with your disc.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Brenda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, the sage continues.&nbsp; I took your advice and went to the site you gave me on your first reply.&nbsp; I clicked Upgrade Now and it went through the process.&nbsp; I thought it was going great until I got to the last screen before installing which said that it
 would be installing Windows 10 Pro (not Home) and I had chosen to keep my files and applications.&nbsp; Against my better judgment I clicked install and, you guess it, it installed Windows 10 Pro again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm trying to figure out what to do next.&nbsp; In reading that page carefully, I notice the following important message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We recommend using the media creation tool on a PC running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. If you run this tool on a PC running Windows 10, it can overwrite temporary files that are needed if you ever want to go back to your previous operating system.</strong></p>
</strong>Here is a cut and paste of that section as I have questions about particular sections:&nbsp;
</p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Follow these instructions to perform a clean installation of Windows 10. If you want to upgrade to Windows 10 for free, follow the instructions in the
<strong>Upgrade to Windows 10 using the tool</strong> section. If you haven’t upgraded to Windows 10 yet and perform a clean installation, you’ll need to enter a qualifying product key for Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 or buy a license in order to activate
 Windows 10. Click <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/Windows-10-specifications#upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for information on qualified editions.</p>
<div>
Warning
<div>If you format a drive partition during installation, any data on the partition will be erased. Be sure to back up any data you want to keep before you begin.</div>
<ol>
<li>Run the media creation tool.</li><li>Select <strong>Create installation media for another PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows 10.</li><li>Follow the steps to create the installation media, and then select <strong>Finish</strong> when it’s done.</li><li>When you’re ready to perform a clean installation, turn on your PC, insert the DVD or USB flash drive you created, and then shut down your PC.</li><li>
<p>Restart your PC, and then press any key to boot from the DVD or USB flash drive.</p>
<p>If you restart your PC and your current version of Windows starts, you might have to open a boot menu or change the boot order in your PC's BIOS or UEFI settings so that your PC boots from the media. To open a boot menu or change the boot order, you'll typically
 need to press a combination of keys (such as F2, F12, Delete, or Esc) immediately after you turn on your PC. For instructions on changing the boot order for your PC, check the documentation that came with your PC or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>If changing the boot menu or order doesn't work, try again by signing in to Windows, shutting down, and then starting your PC.</p>
</li><li>On the <strong>Install Windows</strong> page, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Install Windows</strong>.</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Enter the product key to activate Windows</strong> page, enter your product key. The product key should be in a purchase confirmation email if you bought Windows&nbsp;10. It looks like this: PRODUCT KEY: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX.</p>
<div>
Note
<div>If you’ve already successful activated Windows 10 on this PC, including if you upgraded by taking advantage of the free upgrade offer you won't need to enter a Windows&nbsp;10 product key. You can skip the product key page by selecting the
<strong>Skip</strong> button. Your PC will automatically activate later.</div>
</li><li>On the <strong>License terms</strong> page, if you accept the license terms, select
<strong>I accept the license terms</strong>, and then select <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Which type of installation do you want?</strong> page, select <strong>
Custom</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Where do you want to install Windows?</strong> page, select the partition that you want, select the formatting option you want to perform (if needed), and then follow the instructions.</li><li>When you've finished formatting, select <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Follow the rest of the setup instructions to finish installing Windows.</li></ol>
<p>On Item #9, do I enter the product key from the Windows 10 Home edition that was initially installed on my computer (the one that was the original free upgrade from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Home)?&nbsp; I guess that's it.&nbsp; Please let me know how you think
 I should proceed.&nbsp; Once again, thank you for your help on this.</p>

            <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On Item #9, do I enter the product key from the Windows 10 Home edition that was initially installed on my computer (the one that was the original free upgrade from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Home)?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgrade a computer&nbsp;with Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Home, there is no product key.&nbsp; If you used a third party program to see a product key, it comes back with a generic key that all upgraders get.&nbsp; Your computer&nbsp;gets an entitlement to use Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your computer was running Windows 7 Home.&nbsp; You upgrade to Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; When you upgrade, the system sees whether or not you are upgrading a genuine copy of Windows 7 Home.&nbsp; The system then gives your computer an entitlement to&nbsp;use Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade process&nbsp;embeds information&nbsp;onto your hardware (motherboard?), that your computer had a genuine Windows 7 Home&nbsp;operating system, and then embeds the entitlement to Windows 10 Home&nbsp;onto your hardware.&nbsp; Microsoft's activation servers reads the embedded
 information and activates your&nbsp;operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;System builders who purchase OEM versions and folks who buy retail versions get product keys.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They both have the same file name with the exception of the 8th character (c on the first and d on the second).&nbsp; The first is 9.20 GB (dated 7/28/15 at 9:53 AM) and the second is 289 GB (dated 7/28/15 at 12:54 PM).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to your Windows 7 image files.&nbsp; The "c" would be your (C:) drive and the "d" your (D:) drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a fresh system image of Windows 10 Pro on my desktop.&nbsp; I ended up with 5 folders and 18 files.&nbsp; 774 GB in size, altogether.&nbsp; You're missing some
 information somewhere with your image files.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 2 .vhdx files, one small and one large,&nbsp;and the rest are mostly .XML files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you mount either one to see if you can save your personal files from them?&nbsp;

</p><p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ashampoo Disk Defragmenter&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly happened with Ashampoo Disk Defragmenter that messed things up to the point where you needed to reset anyway? &nbsp;Why did you think you needed to have a third party defragmenter in the first place?&nbsp; Disk defragmentation is done for you by Windows,
 automatically and on a schedule with Windows 10.&nbsp; Do you use other Ashampoo products besides the defragmenter?&nbsp; WinOptimizer or AntiSpy?&nbsp; &nbsp;If you've made changes with a registry cleaner, this could account for the computer malfunctioning to the point that
 you had to reset Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the media that came with your computer and reinstall&nbsp;Windows 7 Home.&nbsp; Now that would be a version where you will have a product key.&nbsp; I thought with you already having upgraded successfully&nbsp;to Windows 10 Home, you would have no problems installing Windows
 10 Home with the .iso file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a Windows 7 disc, you can use your Windows 7 product key and download it from here.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you for your help.&nbsp; Last night I spent about four hours online with a Microsoft Answer Tech working on solving the problem.&nbsp; He ended up creating an ISO file which was supposed to be Windows 10 Home, but it turned out to once again be the
 Pro edition, so I didn't install it.&nbsp; I chatted with another tech today and, after chatting with her for awhile, I decided to dig out the Windows 7 Home Premium reinstallation DVD and have gone back to Windows 7, with the intention of working my way back up
 to Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; So, for now, that issue is handled.&nbsp; Right now my system is installing 214 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to check into mounting the image files as I presently don't know anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for your help on all of this - I think it's under control for now.&nbsp; Am looking forward to moving back up to Windows 10 Home again in the near future.</p>

CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound driver often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the version you<br />
installed is there, if not repeat - reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it<br />
does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
