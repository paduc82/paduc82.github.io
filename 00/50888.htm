<p>When you reset your PC, the drive will be completely reset, and all your apps and files will be removed from it. Windows 8 will be reinstalled, and you'll need to change any settings and reinstall any apps that you want to get back after resetting. If you
 know if any files that you don't want to lose, then you should back those files up before starting the reset.</p>

    <title>Update not applying to console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tgd insanity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update not applying to console</h2>
                    
<p>I am assisting a friend with his 4GB Xbox("slim") that he got free with the computer he ordered, and since the latest update has been released, it prompts to download and install. Clicked "yes" and it started the download. The download time varied on how
 long it took, but each time gave the same result: Console completes download, restarts, and prompts again. We(my roommates) have tried clearing memory cache, deleting system data(thinking it was corrupt) and restarting the console. To clarify I will type out
 step by step of what happens and the info requested for assistance in the issue, as posted in previous stickies.</p>
<p>1st: Regular attempt at operating xbox360</p>
<p>&gt;Console power button pushed to turn on console</p>
<p>&gt;Console loads xbox 360 logo</p>
<p>&gt;prompts for system update download</p>
<p>&gt;click yes</p>
<p>&gt;update downloads to 100%</p>
<p>&gt;console restarts</p>
<p>&gt;repeats all of the above, with occasional freezing at xbox 360 logo.</p>
<p>2nd method of attempts: clear cache</p>
<p>&gt;Console power button pushed to turn on console</p>
<p>&gt;Console loads xbox 360 logo</p>
<p>&gt;prompts for system update download</p>
<p>&gt;click no</p>
<p>&gt;//(depending on if download was attempted will either:1. go to the 'dashboard' or 2.require the console to restart)</p>
<p>&gt;sitting at dashboard signed into gold xbox live account, no online connection, Avatar shows generic outlining of it(no detals of face, clothes or anything specific).</p>
<p>&gt;system settings</p>
<p>&gt;memory</p>
<p>&gt;hard drive</p>
<p>&gt;other options(Y)</p>
<p>&gt;clear system cache</p>
<p>&gt;press (B) until returned to system settings</p>
<p>&gt;network settings</p>
<p>&gt;select wireless network</p>
<p>&gt;test Xbox LIVE Connection</p>
<p>&gt;test starts: xbox&gt;network = GOOD</p>
<p>&gt;test: Network&gt; Internet = GOOD</p>
<p>&gt;test: Internet&gt; XBOX LIVE = interrupted by another prompt for the system update</p>
<p>&gt; YES: repeat of 1st(seen above) NO: Test: Internet&gt;Xbox LIVE = FAILED</p>
<p>&gt;More info: "Your console is connected to the internet but can't contact Xbox LIVE.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Turn your router or modem off and back on, then wait 30 seconds.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have you restarted you router or modem?"</p>
<p>&gt;Above step not performed, select (B) and shut down console(after giving up)</p>
<p>3rd method: Delete system data(that we believed might have been corrupt)</p>
<p>&gt;Console power button pushed to turn on console</p>
<p>&gt;Console loads xbox 360 logo</p>
<p>&gt;prompts for system update download</p>
<p>&gt;click no</p>
<p>&gt;Dashboard</p>
<p>&gt;system settings</p>
<p>&gt;memory</p>
<p>&gt;internal 4GB</p>
<p>&gt;system items</p>
<p>&gt;deleted only file in there</p>
<p>&gt; reattempted 1st method with same result.</p>


<p>Like I said: It WORKED WIRED but after I shut off the xbox and unplugged the Ethernet Cable, it continued to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Only other thing that I got from the FAQ was to try and apply the update via USB/CD/DVD.</p>
<p>I followed instructions to download, unzip update folder to USB in the root folder. Plug into xbox, restart xbox, click yes when prompted. The update did show "extracting" so I know that it was getting the files from the USB. Still same result.</p>


<p>Reason for not restarting the router/modem: We have currently 3 Xboxs' that are fully functional, and one other xbox that was connected wirelessly. MAC address and IP for all xbox360's have been cataloged and added to the router security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do not own this xbox but if this will require physical repair of the xbox Please contact in direct message/ email. I will check on this post for 48 hours for replies/ solutions.</p>

<p>Hey there! Try this before manually updating again: open System Settings &gt; Memory and highlight the HDD. Press "Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X, Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X" and accept the prompts. Your console should restart and re-install the update. Does
 this help with the constant prompts issue?</p>

<h2>            Questions about 3D Builder application on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Okay so I have three questions, maybe more I'm not sure yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a way to make objects hollow? Like the cylinder. I was curious of how to make that hollow.</p>
<p>2. Is there a place where I can download new shapes or objects approved by Microsoft?</p>
<p>3. Is there any way to give objects a textured appearance rather than solid brown or solid gray or whatever?</p>

            You can do it by making, for example two cilinders one inside the other (the one inside is a smaller one)<br />
<br />
After that you need to select the smaller one, then go into edit mode and click&nbsp;subtract.<br />
It subtracts the small cilinder from the bigger one leaving you a hollow cilinder.&nbsp;

<p>You should never upgrade to correct problems with the current system - chances are good you will&nbsp;just move the problems to the new system or the process will fail or you may even cause even more and bigger problems.&nbsp; You need to fix these problems.&nbsp; Then
 once it is working fine, you can consider an upgrade if your system is compatible (not just the compatibility but the upgrade advisor as well which has a link on that page):<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>As far as stopping chkdsk st every startup, try the solution proposed in the folowing article:<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/vista-general/151290-need-stop-chkdsk-boot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/vista-general/151290-need-stop-chkdsk-boot.html</a>.</p>
<p>Boot into safe mode and disable any security software you have running and try to run System Restore from there - this often works when it doesn't in normal mode (but it's no guarantee).</p>
<p>Considering what you've already tried and the many problems you are having (including corruption), I would recommend a system repair/upgrade<span>using the genuine Windows
 Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>How much space do you have available on C:?&nbsp; Before you try anything else, let's see if we can clean it up a bit.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions:</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans
 will tell you you have thousands of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;</span>Most do nothing
 of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;</span>Vista keeps the registry clean
 on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed and&nbsp;space, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></span></a><span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files.&nbsp; If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box
 Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></span></a><span>.
 Do all of the options.</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced.&nbsp; It's a trade-off.&nbsp; The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points
 you will be able to retain - but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<span>&nbsp;</span>When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects
 – to the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, reponse times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Better still, download Autoruns<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>
 which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you can’t delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which MUST not
 be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system).<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying
 marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I
 would also suggest downloading </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Print Spooler problems and cannot install printer driver after Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mac366  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Spooler problems and cannot install printer driver after Windows 7 upgrade &#40;80070706&#41;</h2>
                    I just upgraded from Vista to Win 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; After the install finished, I tried to update drivers and install latest updates.&nbsp; Everything worked except for HP LaserJet 4L driver.&nbsp; At first, whenever the driver tried to install, the Print Spooler service
 would stop working, and the driver install failed with error code 800F0246.&nbsp; I then removed everything from the spool directory, rebooted, and tried again.&nbsp; This time, the Print Spooler service did not stop working, but the driver still fails with error code
 80070706.<br />
<br />
I cannot find information for this error (80070706)&nbsp;anywhere on the web.&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
More information:&nbsp; The HP LaserJet 4L is connected via a parallel cable into a Prolific USB docking station.&nbsp; Windows recognizes the printer as IEEE-1284 device, but says it needs driver to work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update:&nbsp; I was able to manually add the 4L driver by using the Print Server Properties dialog, HOWEVER if I try to Add Printer after that, I get "The Print Processor does not exist".&nbsp; If I try to Add Printer without the driver installed, I get ERROR 0x00000002.<br />
<br />
Everything is run as admin.&nbsp; This worked perfect in Vista.

            Thank you for those links, but those suggestions did not help, nor did the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
After a long and painful journey through the registry, I determined that this workstation had previously installed 3rd party software called "Pharos".&nbsp; This software apparently&nbsp;was redirecting the default print processors, and was clearly not compatible with
 Windows 7, although the installation of Win 7 never mentioned a compatibility issue.&nbsp; Once this software was removed, and all remnants cleared from the registry, there are now no issues with the print spooler or printers.<br />
<br />
In the future, it would be helpful if Microsoft actually provided some type of useful information when these crashes occur.&nbsp; Cryptic error numbers and unhelpful event log entries did not provide any useful leads.

    <title>Intel 6&#47;C200 Chip set USB Enhanced Host Issue in WIndows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tazinor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel 6&#47;C200 Chip set USB Enhanced Host Issue in WIndows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS G74Sx that originally came with Windows 7 Home Premium. I upgraded to Windows 10 Professional and since doing so have issues with the Intel 6 / C200 chipset USB enhanced host controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read here and other posts that reinstalling the driver should work, and it does for one or two reboots then needs to be installed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting, the system has four USB ports, one 3.0 and the rest 2.0. However, it is only the 2.0 ports that have the issue, the 3.0 port remains working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a wireless Logitech USB mouse with my system, which I could use in the USB 3.0 port but I use that for updating smart phones and such where the download speed is better. I would prefer to use the USB 2.0 port for the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one of the other posts here, I found links to Intel's website but that leads to their Chipset Identification Utility. However, this utility does not seem to run under Windows 10, and they have a disclaimer stating there is no support for 64 bit Windows,
 which is of course what I am using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is the really weird part. I installed windows 10 Pro about two months ago and have only run into this issue in the past few weeks. I think it started shortly after one of the recent updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>If you can, go to the BIOS and disable Legacy USB support for USB 2.0 and 3.0. This is what did it for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000 keyboard initial keystroke delay</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000.&nbsp; When I move the mouse, it responds instantly.&nbsp; When I start typing on the keyboard, it takes a couple of seconds before acknowledging that I'm typing so if I am not paying attention I will miss the first

            The batteries are new and I did set the speed to maximum.&nbsp;&nbsp; The keyboard works fine once it wakes up.&nbsp; It is just when I start typing that there is a delay, or if I stop for a few seconds.

 but the problem still persist. Did you find out how to stop the delay? It must be a setting on the keyboard or computer somewhere but I can't figure it out... please let me know if you found a solution or anything.</p>

            <p>I may have figured this out, but I can't guarantee it yet. I have a client who was complaining about this, and I assume it has to do with the keyboard going to sleep. After hunting for 30 minutes, I came across a setting in the Device Manager under Human
 Interface Devices that allows Windows to power down the device. <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Device Manager -&gt; &lt;Computername&gt; -&gt; Human Interface Device -&gt; Microsoft Hardware USB Keyboard</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right click and choose properties </li><li>Choose the 'Power Management' tab</li><li>Uncheck 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power'</li></ul>
<p>I hope this works for my sake as well as yours! I just flipped the switch, so no way to tell yet. I just hope my client doesn't ring me about this one again.</p>

            <p>By ansi text I mean text or carters produced by a DOS program that uses ANSI.sys to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program is a EPOS system running in a window on freshly upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; The program was running great in Window 7. &nbsp;I have a second upgraded Window 10 machine that had been upgrade a few weeks previously and is running the program
 well with functioning menus etc.&nbsp; Displaying correctly without the ANSI.SYS installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;did tried installing&nbsp;ANSI.SYS in both machine but is clearly not compatible with Window 10 and causes errors&nbsp; mostly "Mendold NTUDM encountered a system error.&nbsp; A attached device is not functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DOS program is running correctly except it displays random code not text in the window.&nbsp; Can I change something in the shortcut or .bat files used to run the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Older unbranded Pentium PC.&nbsp; Both machine the same with NVIDIA Ge Force 8500GT on one displaying correctly and 9500GT on the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this give you a idea.</p>

<p>Ok I bought this game a week ago for the xbox 1. It still will not update to be able to play the game. I have returned the first disk for another and still have the same issue.</p>

<p>I had the same issue with AC4. Clean reboot did not help.</p>
<p>The solution is to Uninstall the game, press the select button when highlighting the game in Games and Apps and choose uninstall, then reinstall it.
</p>
<p>I did this for AC4 and it worked fine afterwards much to my huge relief. Also, hella jelly you've got Marvel Lego Heroes, its not even out in Australia yet.</p>

<p>Hi Make IT,<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¯<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Why
 are you trying to register MSDART.DLL?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¯<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How
 are you trying to register it?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¯<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 is the command that you typed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This error can occur if the entrypoints are not properly exported from the module or if the module is not a .DLL or .OCX file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For now, replace the Msdart.dll file in your %windir%\System32 with the one in %windir%\System32\Dllcache folder. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start and type cmd.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-Click
 on cmd and select “Run as administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 the following command at the command prompt without the quotes, and then press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><span>“copy %windir%\system32\dllcache\msdart.dll %windir%\system32”</span></p>
<p><span>Note Type y (yes) when you are prompted to overwrite the file.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 regsvr32 to register the replaced files.</span></p>
<p><span>Type the following command at the command prompt without the quotes, and then press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><span>regsvr32 %WINDIR%\System32\Msdart.dll</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 exit and then press ENTER to close the command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this is what you’re looking for.</span></p>

<p>Thank, you Shinmila for your quick response.</p>
<p>The reason I want to register the msdart.dll is because I have a VB6 program that requires the dll to be registered. When running the installation package if fails at the point of msdart.dll registration.</p>
<p>The program runs well on windows xp without any errors. I am using compatibility mode to run the installation.</p>
<p>I tried what you suggested but it looks like my windows 7 doesnt have DLLCACHE folder in "Windows\system32". Could the be a reason why the folder isn't there?</p>
<p>regards,</p>

<p>No matter what i do changes do not hold. &nbsp;I think it is a Microsoft issue. &nbsp;First they told me months ago you cannot change the dates and now you have to try and change multiple times. &nbsp;I looked at dates created in files and they are right. &nbsp;I think they
 are pointing at date modified, which is wrong!</p>

I have and so far they have not been able to figure it out except I noticed that with other devices, the date of taking the picture is in a different field and called something different.&nbsp; The cell phone cameras have solved all of that, but I have 20 years
 of photos that all jumbled up and have to manually find them and change the dates taken!&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for trying. I have turned off my account charges and will not try again. &nbsp;I think it is related to a digital camera that we never used a date on as all pix now are from Iphone and no more issues with current data. Shutterfly and Google are the best
 right now for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>i am using a dell optiplex 755.</p>
<p>i can see the yellow triangle on the connection status at bottom of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have contacted virgin media &nbsp;regarding this problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>and they think it is a problem with my wireless adapter.</p>
<p>i have used the neighbours rouer code and that is still bringing up ltd access too.</p>
<p>i have a laptop connected too and although hard drive is gone that is connecting fine.</p>
<p>i do not get any error messages &nbsp;when network out</p>
<p>thankyou for your advice.</p>
<p>i cannot remember all the things I've done trying to correct this problem. &nbsp;Sorry</p>
<p>regards</p>

            <p>I'm going to assume you are using an Intel HD4000/2500 GPU. This something I've experienced on numerous installations among numerous computers. The only way I've been able to solve it is to revert to Microsoft's WDDM 1.2 Intel driver instead of the ones
 directly from Intel. The unfortunate side affect is that OpenGL won't work with Microsoft's drivers, so some games will give you an error.</p>
<p>To do this:</p>
<p>Win + R</p>
<p>devmgmt.msc</p>
<p>Expand Display Adapters</p>
<p>Right click on the Intel listing and click update drivers</p>
<p>Click on Browse my computer</p>
<p>Click on let me pick</p>
<p>Look for Intel Microsoft Corporation WDDM 1.2 (not exact text)</p>
<p>Click next</p>

<h3> cobraul2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reset Windows 10 settings to default&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If I go to 'Settings' I have 'System', 'Devices' and so on, and in them other categories. If I enter in them, I can make some changes. But after that how can I reset them to default? There is no button in&nbsp;'System', 'Device' and so on, and in their categories,
 to reset the setting to default. Just in some categories. ( And I don't need to restore the entire 'Windows 10' to the first installation stage! ) I just need a 'Default' button in every category.</p>
<p>Why is this important? And why I can't check all of them and reset them manually? Because one day a virus changed my 'Windows 10' settings and I don't know exactly what it changed. Some security settings too. So after I removed the virus, the changes remain
 the same. And sorry for not remembering all the 'Windows 10' default settings and resetting my entire 'Windows 10' settings! And with 'Sync your settings', the virus settings were sent to other devices.</p>

            This is not useful at all. I think I made myself clear. Read again '<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If I go to 'Settings' I have 'System', 'Devices' and so on, and in them other categories. If I enter in them, I can make some changes.
 But after that how can I reset them to default? There is no button in&nbsp;'System', 'Device' and so on, and in their categories, to reset the setting to default. JUST IN SOME CATEGORIES.'! I need, we need, reset to default in all categories.</span>

    <title>I need a replacement Windows 8 disc. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam jay  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need a replacement Windows 8 disc.</h2>
                    Hey there,<br />
<br />
I got a computer made for me a few months ago with a retail copy of Windows 8 installed for me on it and a product key stuck on the side of the comp. The people I bought it off didn't provide me with the Windows 8 installation disc even though they claim it
 was in the package. Now I'm using Windows 8 evaluation edition because installing it was the only way for me to scrub Windows 8.1, being without the aforementioned set up disc. Now I can't upgrade back to full Windows 8 because this retail code won't work
 digitally, it says I need the physical disc that came with it. Does anyone know how I can get a replacement disc for my Windows 8 set up?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

Well, if they are professional system builders, they should provide some means of replacement media since its the only means of reinstalling the OS if necessary.</p>

<h2>            Strange disc drive malfunction&#59; what is happening here&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Some of my games are running louder than others. These 'loud' ones will eventually freeze and get scratched by the disc drive. There's this horrible noise, and when I open the disc tray, the disc is hanging out of the console ABOVE the tray, with a bunch
 of circular scratches on it. This happens with Destiny, and Halo ODST among others.</p>
<p>Other games, I can play for hours with no problems whatsoever. (Halo 4, Wartech. . .)</p>
<p>Its an older 20GB model. The console isn't being moved, it's laying flat on the ground, there's no strong vibrations, no one's jumping around it, etc. . .</p>
<p>I've searched for hours and I haven't seen this problem anywhere. What is happening here? Is there any fix that can be tried (its out of warranty. . .) ? Or at least, is there a way to identify which games will work on this system?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry but circle scratches only happen when the console is moved while turned on. &nbsp;Perhaps there is a large vehicle going by that is shaking the house or some other thing is happening. &nbsp;As for the repair of the console. &nbsp;If you believe that you should send it in then you would need to either pay for repairs or purchase a new console.</p>

<p>Umm, this has happened to me for months. One disc works, the other doesn't. Nothing is moving, and the console still switches to garbage disposal mode inexplicably.
</p>
<p>I guess if it's a rare problem I'll have to try another repair. Or stick to digital games, I don't know.</p>

<p>When you told me that this "couldn't happen", I got irritated enough to sit down and record it:</p>
<p>[View:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csjSx2Jg3KE:550:550]</p>
<p>This actually happened when I was exiting the game to the dashboard. When it happens during play, its louder and lasts for about five seconds. The disc:</p>
<p>[View:http://i.imgur.com/qodoaeU.jpg:550:550]</p>
<p>The very outer rim is most damaged on this one. It blends in with the lighter color, so its hard to tell:</p>
<p>[View:http://i.imgur.com/avECM9R.jpg:550:550]</p>
<p>This console has scratched up about half a dozen discs (there's no way to tell which it will do this to. . .) and its been frustrating me for months, so I hit the roof when you said I was lying. I hope I've broken ground in verifying a rare problem :(</p>

<p>However, it does seem as though you need to get the console repaired or replaced.<br /><br />* One final afterthought.&nbsp; Considering the tray didn't open properly the first time you pushed the eject button it is also possible that it is loose and any bump could make the tray move which also can cause the circle scratches.</p>

<p>I reread that post, and no you didn't, I am sorry. I was frustrated and I guess I read malice into it. And thanks for replying, by the way. But as I said before, nothing is disturbing the console at all. Some games get scratched, others don't, same environment.</p>
<p>Two consoles have malfunctioned on me already, so its hard to swallow the idea of sinking another $80 into a DVD drive. I'll do some more searching, thanks again.</p>

<p>No, it was repaired for video distortion. And a console had red-ringed, although I can't remember if they sent the same one back (making it this one), or if they gave me one with a different serial number.</p>

            <p>What I meant was that the touchscreen works completely fine. It's calibrated, it's not being slow or anything. The OSK just doesn't respond to touch. Like I can touch on the screen anywhere expect the OSK when it's up on the screen. When it isn't, the touch
 screen still works fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>The troubleshooter didn't ask anything about the OSK not responding. But if I use the mouse to open up the OSK manually, (because the OSK only opens if the laptop is in Stand, Tent, or Tablet mode) it works when I use the mouse. But the touch screen works
<em>completely</em> fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet another edit:</p>
<p>I have smart notebook installed on my laptop, and a while ago I uninstalled the smartboard drivers because the drivers were making the OSK extremely tiny, but it worked then. But now with it uninstalled, the keyboard got its normal shape back, but the OSK
 stopped working. Do you think I should uninstall Smart Notebook also? I don't really even use it anyway...</p>

            <p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Smart Notebook must be a built-in feature from the manufacturer. If yes, as long as it is not affecting or conflicting with other drivers/devices, you can let it be in the machine. If it is affecting or conflicting with other drivers/devices, you may uninstall
 it and check whether issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly keep us posted.</p>

<p>Looks like there is no stylus so I guess it would only support a so-called capacitive pen.&nbsp; Then you might have to resize the OSK to be big enough to let one of those devices&nbsp;tap on the keys (e.g. better than a finger tip but not by much).</p>

            I want one that is 100% safe and 100% free. I don't want one that will put a water mark on this video. I tried using "VLC" and it won't rip the whole DVD and I don't know how it works.
