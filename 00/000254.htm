<h2>            PST Corrupted office 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have several email accounts. one of the pst files apparently is corrupted.&nbsp; have used scanpst to try and repair the file.&nbsp; scanpst just hangs and never really starts working on file.&nbsp; usually I have to reboot system to get rid of the scanpst box.&nbsp; I have
 an older pst file for that account but donot know if I can simply replace the corrupted file with older file.</p>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - What exactly led up (error messages etc - completely and exactly as encountered) that caused you to arrive at "apparently is corrupted" with emphasis on the word "apparently". Does that mean you can't open the PST file on its own or..........?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - How big is this PST file - extremely large PST files can take a really, really long time to process in ScanPST so the question is whether ScanPST is actually hung or "appears" to be hung. As an aside, it's not uncommon for programs to show as "not responding"
 in the Task Manager while being busy doing something.</p>

            <p>i noticed it several weeks ago.&nbsp; was emptying the deleted files folder and about 1/2 done got message"must run repair tool scanpst".&nbsp; so as i had time i would try to run scanpst on the pst file in question.&nbsp; it would never complete nor did it look like it
 even started.&nbsp; each time the process basically hung the system.&nbsp; occasionally i got get rid of it thru task manager.&nbsp; other times had to reboot system system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of this took place at the time i noticed when i went to this second outlook account office, would kind of freeze for about a minute or so but would eventually allow me to look at emails in that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the size of the "pst" is 98,225 kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>today i started deleting the files one at a time.&nbsp; got the folder empty with the exception of 3 files.&nbsp; if i try and delete either of these 3 i get the "run repair tool".&nbsp; i notice when i highlight either one of those files it says "cannot display contents
 in pane".</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just to make things easier for everyone to follow - always a good plan to use common terminology to avoid any kind of confusion. Not mentioning this as a negative criticism - just a suggestion since various words have different meanings when used in different
 contexts and can make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Suspect you are referring to an individual "item" within an Outlook folder when using the word "file" (The word file typically denotes an external file you would access via the Windows File Explorer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Outlook data files are those that are shown under the data files tab (goto File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - An Outlook folder is one contained inside of an Outlook data store (data file) whereas the common reference to "folder" refers to the folders on your hard drive managed via Windows File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that said, from your description, it sounds like you have 3 seriously corrupted items in your Deleted Items folder. The message "Can't" display items........." also can get caused by an item coming from a place that originally had a seriously contorted
 &lt;view&gt;. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this involves deleted items, and ScanPST appears to be choking on something (which indicates that there is something really flaky going on which is outside the norm), suggest you try the following - (set Outlook to work in offline mode for the duration)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process (A)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Simply do a PST2PST export of the PST file containing the problematic items<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Export to an Outlook PST File<br />
<a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/how-to-export-outlook-pst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contactgenie.info/how-to-export-outlook-pst</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#2 - Open the newly exported PST file in Outlook (File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Open Outlook Data File) and check to see if the original issue still exists for the items left in the Deleted Items folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - If there are no issues with the new PST file - change any references to the old to the new&nbsp;</p>
<p>If using POP account(s) - go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Email tab and change the reference for any POP3 file referring to the old PST file via the &lt;Change Folder&gt; button on the bottom to the &lt;Inbox&gt; in the newly exported PST file. When that's done,
 go to the Data Files tab and if the old PST file was set to be the default data file for the profile, set the new PST file as the profile default. Then remove the old PST file (you may get a message about stuff being moved etc - just close Outlook and re-open
 it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process (B)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same items from the old PST file still result in problems in the new PST file then</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Create a &lt;NEW&gt; pst file (from the Home tab on any ribbon --&gt; click &lt;New Items&gt; --&gt; &lt;More Items&gt; --&gt; Outlook Data File</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Once the new PST file has been created go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data FIles tab and make this new PST file the default for the profile which will create all the standard Outlook folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - After #2 - copy all the items from each of the folders in the old PST file to the corresponding folders in the newly created PST file - excluding the &lt;Deleted Items&gt; folder</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#4 - When #3 is done, make sure that any POP accounts referencing the old PST file now reference the new PST file as described earlier and when that's done, remove the old PST file from the profile</p>

<h2>            Formula</h2>
                    <p>I have a simple spreadsheet with 3 pages. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The First page references data from the other two which are linked to websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data referenced in the first page from the other two is placed in a cell. My final column multiplies the data by a fixed cell in page 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The results column just shows #value. The problem appears to be that it thinks the imported data is in the wrong format. I have simply used the = function to get the referenced data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The data is being referenced from a website, using a referenced table. I only need a small portion of the data and I have therefore just selected that which I want from the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I refresh the data, the order in which it appears can change and therefore the cells in sheet 1 reference the wrong data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What can I do to resolve the error with the calculations cells</p>
<p>2. How do I make the referenced data stay in the same cell always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated</p>

                    <p>As above my PC did a massive update to Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703 (wiohtout asking me and locked up my PC for almost an hour) on Tuesday. Since then spell check is no longer working in IE11. I have downloaded the language pack for the PC
 I am using but that made no difference. I have looked at other solutions but there is no add in and the slider switches under change PC settings are not availbale under my settings screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I also checked this article and there are no spelling settings under typing. Only typing and touch keyboard:</p>

<p>Hi Milzee,<br />
<br />
Though the default language of your PC is set to UK English, there's a possibility that the recent update has set other language settings to US English.
<br />
<br />
To help us sort out the problem, please check the add-ons on your Internet Explorer and see if Spelling Correction language is set to the
<em>English (United Kingdom)</em>. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<strong> Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Tools</strong> (gear icon), then select <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong>.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>Spelling Correction</strong>, then select the
<strong>English (United Kingdom)</strong>.</li><li>Click Close.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, relaunch IE and see if the spell checker language is changed to UK English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please verify as well if the keyboard layout you're using is set in English (United Kingdom).</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<strong> Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li><li>Under the <em>General</em> tab, look for <em>Appearance</em>, and click <strong>
Languages</strong>.</li><li>Click the button <strong>Set Language Preferences</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Change your language preferences,</em> click <em>English (United Kingdom)</em>, then
<strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Check if you have the United Kingdom under Input method. </li><li>If it's not on the list, click <strong>Add an input method</strong>, then add the
<strong>United Kingdom Touch Keyboard layout</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on how it goes so we can further assist you.</p>
<p><br />
Regards.</p>

<h2>            Outlook --&#62;  SCANPST.EXE</h2>
                    
<p>Why is SCANPST no longer implemented in Vista as it was in W2k and WinXP.<br />
I dont know about the situation for that in Win7.</p>
<p>I copyed <strong>SCNPST32.DLL</strong> and <strong>SCNPST64.DLL</strong> and <strong>
MSMAPI32.DLL</strong> and <strong>SCANPST.EXE</strong> &nbsp; from my XP-computer to&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><strong>OS(C)\Windows\System32\</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; in my Vista computer.
<span><strong>OS(C)\Windows\System32\</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; in my Vista computer.
<br />
So now Scanpst also runs on this computer and repairs faults.... but why do you not include Scanpst&nbsp; in new deliveries?</span></p>

<p>I have this same&nbsp;problem since the 12 Aug when new updates were installed the culprit would appear&nbsp;to be update KB3175443. I uninstalled this update and the pop up was gone.</p>
<p>However my triumph was short lived as the pop up was back next morning, on&nbsp;checking the list of updates KB3175443 was alive and well.&nbsp; I have since uninstalled this update 3 times and the pop up goes but returns when KB3175443 is installed automatically.</p>

            I have had this same problem since Aug. 18.&nbsp; Have come back to this site several times and there seems to be no permanent help.&nbsp; Why can't Microsoft do something about this sooner than this?&nbsp; I loved IE but have changed to Firefox in desperation.&nbsp; I didn't
 ask for the updates (if that's what did this) so I think it should be solved by whomever is responsible.<br />

<h2>            Troubleshooting update</h2>
                    <p>Build 10162, troubleshooting windows update always finds the same thing to fix - "repair windows update components"</p>
<p>Repeating this troubleshooting immediately after it had completed, is finding problem again, and "repairing" it.</p>

<h2>            Unexpected shutdown of Technology Preview</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed the latest Version of the TP build 9926 64-bit on my Lenovo G505s. The installation went fine but Windows 10 keeps unexpectedly shutting down after 10-15 minutes. Just as if I would have pressed the power button for 5 seconds. I don't
 have any issues in Windows 8.1 64-bit so I suppose it is a driver issue in the current build.
</p>
<p>Any idea what I could do? Please let me know if you need additional Information that helps to further pinpoint the Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi Kumar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your support!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;Do you see </span>
</span></span><span>any error message while it turns off automatically?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>No there is no error message at all. At least none that I could see.&nbsp;My system Switches off instantly. It also does not try to reboot. It is just powered off.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>It also happens when I work with the machine so it is not realted to the machine being idle.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes in the power settings of the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>No. I did not change anything. The Problems occur with a vanilla installation of TP 9926. I have not installed a single program yet. However, I connected the machine to my Microsoft account so I suppose some settings may&nbsp;have
 been synced.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;D</span></span></span><span>oes it happen when you work with a particular program?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>It is not specfic to aprogram in general.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5. </span></span>Do you have any pending optional Windows updates?</p>
<p>Before I had since it was a vanilla install of the TP. I have now installed all the pending updates including Drivers. However, it took me 3 interations since my system was always shutting down in between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the suspicion that it might be related to the AMD (Display) Drivers though. Windows Update was also&nbsp;trying to install new drivers for my &nbsp;Radeon 8650 G graphics card. The screen was flickering twice so&nbsp;the Installation seemed to have been in the Hardware
 detection step. After the second flicker the&nbsp;screen&nbsp;went black.&nbsp;So the Installation of the new Display Drivers did not finish successfully and I am also getting an error message realted to that now every time I start up the machine.</p>
<p>To resolve this I tried to install the latest official AMD Drivers for Windows 8.1 64Bit that also Support my card. Since AMD claims that should also work in 10 TP.
<a href="http://www.amd.com/en-us/solutions/software-partners/microsoft/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.amd.com/en-us/solutions/software-partners/microsoft/windows</a> </p>
<p>However, also at the installation step where the hardware is detected the system shuts down. This behaviours is in fact reproducible since I tried 3 times. So I am pretty sure it must at least in parts related to the AMD Driver.</p>
<p>Any idea what I should do? Should I contact AMD directly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had "High Performance" set for the power plan, as I never wanted the system to go into sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had both Display and sleep set to Never. I have just set Display to 10 minutes. We'll see how that goes.</p>

</blockquote>
I suspect you can't... unless you get lucky enough to either take Outlook offline (Outlook menu) or disconnect from the internet... or possibly quit Outlook... before it finishes sending.
<div><br />
<div>This update has been atrocious, at least as far as Outlook is concerned. The performance of sending mail has gotten virtually unusable, let alone this "known issue" (and how it's not a "bug," rather than a "known issue," I will never know).&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Why is word so slow, beachball, to load, to close&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Word has always been slow to open and often wonder why it isn't a priority to improve it instead of updating until we have to buy something new. Argggh</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, now my Word is really slow and I'm using Yosemite. It takes longer than anything else to open even after it's already been opened, or switching programs, the truly hated beach ball spins mercilessly, and even very slow closing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone having this experience and know how to make it work like other applications?</p>

            <p>Morning Rich. Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>My amateur understanding of powering down is shutting down and rebooting. Yes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do that regularly, sometimes Restart but with Word it doesn't change anything. In fact, it interferes with other things when the ball starts spinning everything else is stuck. Otherwise, other applications are better to work with than Word (although a
 business rate of speed would be a nice change). I do a Utility Disc check now and then but even that doesn't' seem to help.</p>

<h2>            C2R 2013 auto upgrade to 2016&#63; Yes &#47; No&#63; When&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I see lots of questions on here about getting Office 2016 and there seems to be two flavors of answers. One is you will get it automatically (someday, was Feb 2016) with no real user intervention other than click yes to upgrade. Two is you need to uninstall
 2013, download 2016 installer and basically do it all yourself.</p>
<p>Which one is it? Are my users going to get upgrade to 2016 without intervention or not? If so when?</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like this question should be so hard.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>You may want to take a look at this article. Refer to the table "Key dates for Office 365 ProPlus upgrades"</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7198c31f-2d68-44b4-bc63-e3630cf0c936#BKMK_Key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">technet.microsoft.com/.../7198c31f-2d68-44b4-bc63-e3630cf0c936</a></p>
<p>"In late February 2016, we began the upgrade process for a small percentage of Office 365 ProPlus installations. This limited upgrade identified an issue with the upgrade experience for users who aren’t local administrators on their computer. Because of
 this issue, we paused further upgrades while we work on a mitigation for the issue. Once this issue is mitigated, we'll resume the upgrade process and the date information listed in the table above will be updated."</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chee Loon</p>

    <title>Categorizing content for search - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Categorizing content for search</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We need some way of categorizing content in SharePoint Online to be able to do targeted searches.</p>
<p>We have a site collection provisioning engine that's used to create a new SharePoint site in office 365. At the time of creation we know that this site belongs to "CategoryX". CategoryX can have 1 or many site collections associated with it.</p>
<p>What options are there to be able to do: search all content that belong to "CategoryX"?</p>
<p>I'm thinking that we need to have a CategorizedItem content type (it would inherit the Item content type)&nbsp;that everything uses and in that&nbsp;CategorizedItem we&nbsp;have a site column Category.</p>
<p>The question is how&nbsp;do we set the default value for this site column on a per site collections basis (so that any new lists created under that site collection automatically sets this site collection specific value for any items added to the list). Do we
 use a lookup column that gets the value from a root site list or use a term set?</p>
<p>Are the better ways of solving this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>To set the default value for the site column, go to <strong>site settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>web designer galleries</strong> &gt; <strong>site columns</strong> &gt; find the site column and click it &gt;
<strong>additional column settings</strong> &gt;<strong> default value</strong> &gt; input the default value. For this way, it is very simple given that you only need to set the site column default value and searching the site column default value will return all
 content. Community members are welcome to share your ideas.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, or anything is misunderstood, please feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<p>Hi NickEdwards1802,</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to set up a Shared mailbox only on a BlackBerry 10 smartphone. However, there is a workaround: You can assign a license to the shared mailbox in Office 365 admin center, then you are able to login to it with a username and password. After
 that, you can configure it as a common mailbox on your smartphone.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Larry</p>
