<h2>            Cameras working intermittently</h2>
                    A few days back the latest version of Skype 12.8.487.0 was automatically uploaded to my PC using windows 10. Since then when talking to friends they keep telling me my picture has frozen, This applies to both cameras I have. I can restart picture again
 by stopping and switching it on again.&nbsp; Any fix I can do or will Microsoft have to fix the glitch and do a new version?

JerinV C</a>. Aside from the date &amp; time, check also&nbsp;if the time zone is already correct by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On Start, flick left to the App list, and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Tap <strong>Date+time </strong>and slide <strong>Set automatically </strong>to
<strong>Off</strong>.<br />
3. Check that your time zone, time, and date are accurate and correct where it is required.</p>

JerinV C</a>. If you have&nbsp;already set the correct date, time &amp; timezone, we advise rebooting your phone by pressing &amp; holding the volume down &amp; power keys&nbsp;simultaneously for 10 to 15 seconds. Release and&nbsp;your phone will restart. Once done, check for the updates
 again. Make sure that all of the date &amp; time settings are set correctly. If the issue persists, we recommend performing a reset by going to
<strong>Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone</strong>. Create a backup first to avoid data loss. Let us know the outcome.

            <p>I have been having this same issue with the error code. When the Denim update originally tried to download to my Nokia Lumia 630 windows phone, I didn't have enough memory. Afterwards, I noticed that my apps weren't working or non existent. I have uninstalled
 most of them but the ones that wouldn't are either installing, require attention, or are unavailable. I've tried to install the update again after freeing up plenty of phone memory but the error code is all I get. If I need to do a reset, how do I save my
 contacts? I don't want to take hours writing them all down. Help!</p>
<p>Thank you!!!</p>

            <p>There is always the option to use the recovery tool. Instructions are found via:<br />
<a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/phones-and-hardware/recover-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/phones-and-hardware/recover-my-phone</a>
</p>
<p>Synchronize and backup everything first as instructed in the links on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;phone with apps crashing may have other trouble, like a defective SD memory card, a defective or worn-out SIM card, or internal damage. You can try use the phone without SIM and without SD memory card inserted, while connected to a stable Wi-Fi, to verify
 proper functionality of the phone itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the phone itself is failing after recovery, and if still in warranty, take it to the retailer and claim your warranty. Notice that any mechanical damage and liquid damage voids the warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get it sorted out.</p>

<h2>            OneNote crashes or slows way down when inserting and working with photos</h2>
                    I'm trying to use OneNote as a simple daily journal with photos, but as soon as I add even one photo it acts as though ive increased the file size by about 1000! The app slows way down in responding to touch screen input, and eventually crashes. I've tried
 inserting multiple pictures at once and that seems to make things much worse faster, but even adding a single photo at a time makes the note slow down. Other notes within the app work fine, as long as there are no pictures in it. I would really love to have
 a journal page that eventually holds a years worth of entries, potentially hundreds of photos. Is this possible?&nbsp;

<p>I've tried just shutting down the ipad by holding the home button and the on/off button. &nbsp;I've also tried inserting only one photo at a time instead of trying to add multipe photos. I've also truedmgoing to my photo gallery and selecting a photo and clicking
 on "copy" and then going back to OneNote and selecting "paste". This works with one photo but not with multiple. &nbsp;It also seems to tax the system's memory or respurces just as much as using the menu to Insert images, because the app will run very slowly afterwards
 and eventually it will crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this many times and have the same problems. I have used OneNote for several years prior to this with no problems. Its just happening when i work with photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an ipad mini model A1432 which is on the back of the ipad. &nbsp;In my settings it shows model MD528LL/A and version 9.3.5. I also use a full size ipad (i think 4th generation?) and an iphone 6 with OneNote, and pulling up the note with the photos
 on these devices is very slow as well. I dont usually edit on anything except the ipad mini though.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>If anyone has had issues running WOT after updating to Win 10 I'd like to know about it. &nbsp;If it causes you to have to run around the web, downloading drivers and mod packs again, just to keep playing with no real boost to game play or anything, I may delay
 the update until everything is going along swimmingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Win 10 is certainly looking like a great new, and maybe finally completely "BSOD"-free update to a greatly flawed, patched up and served as - is OS, im still leery of any promises made by MS. We've all been burned too many times to simply take then
 at their word. &nbsp;I've &nbsp;paid for official updates from Windows 98 SE, Millennium Edition, 2000, XP, &nbsp;WIN 7, and am really &nbsp;pretty much happy with the final version of &nbsp;it. Unless I do some serious hardware updating there doesn't seem to be any reason to get
 the first day update. I don't have a touch screen on my main computer, and every program on it is exactly what is needed without wasting disk space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless there's a bunch of new exploits to my existing software, there's no updates that would make me think that I couldn't live without them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even Cortana doesn't thrill me. I've &nbsp;bought several voice control programs in the past, and found them all lacking even though the price tags weren't :-/&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please weigh in on this thread and post any problems with running World of Tanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            how to verify a domain alias</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question is :</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have my domain email MX records redirected to outlook.com, therfore anything sent to my domain gets directed to outlook.com</div>
<div>I have setup an alias for my domain account. e.g *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It wants me to verify I own the email address. I cannot do this because I have no access to the alias. i.e. - &nbsp;It is not a pop account, there is no means to check it.</div>
<div>Are my domain DNS records not sufficient to verify I can use the alias ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is a catch 22.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I add a full email address for the alias in the domains.live.com, it then prevents me from using it as an alias stating email address already exists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to verify an alias for your own domain addresses ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards</div>
<div>BM</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Wella_R,
<div><br />
<div>I am not sure I understand your point, but if you are referring to using</div>
<div><br />
<div>https://domains.live.com/</div>
<div><br />
<div>to first add an account for the alias then I tried this and it does not work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I create two accounts within doamins.live.com</div>
<div><br />
<div>e.g &nbsp; &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>If I now log into outlook.com as *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and go to settings and try to add an alias.</div>
<div>I am now prevented from adding *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as an alias for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will get an error similar to "alias name is being used by another account and is not available"</div>
<div><br />
<div>So a catch 22 arises!&nbsp;</div>
<div>I cannot create the alias because I have no email account to receive the verify email to.</div>
<div>If I create the account &nbsp;it will prevent me from using it as an alias.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My only option is to create the account in live.domains.com and check each email account individually.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope I am being clear.&nbsp;</div>
<div>In summary.</div>
<div>It is not possible to use an existing account as an alias.</div>
<div>An alias cannot be verified unless you can first receive a verify email to the account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only other way I can think of, is to re-point my mx records temporarily back to an ISP/POP account until such time as I can receive a verify email for the alias. then re-point the mx records back to outlook.com.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, in summary, it appears if you have pointed the mx records for your domain to outlook.com then you cut of your means to verify an alias for that domain.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi BMDC_ML,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. If I have understood your issue correctly, I suggest that you delete the account as an alias first. After the 30 days waiting period prior to deleting the alias, register the account in Windows Live Admin Center as a stand
 alone account. This will allow your account to have a mailbox of its own&nbsp;that will&nbsp;enable you to receive the verification email once you create it as an alias. After setting up the account&nbsp;in Admin Center, you can again try to create the account as an alias.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have any clarifications regarding this, please post back. We would be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Cherry</p>

            <p>Hi BMDC_ML,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you remove an alias, the address will become available to anyone in 30 days. You can register the address as a standalone account as what was mentioned by Cherry. However, if you verify and configure the MX records on your domain,
 it will only validate your ownership on the domain but not the alias on the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<div>I am only getting a chance to decipher &nbsp;the various replies I have gotten on this question now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will quote Cherry response here;</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>register the account in Windows Live Admin Center as a stand alone account. This will allow your account to have a mailbox of its own&nbsp;that will&nbsp;enable you to receive the verification email once you create it as an alias. After setting up the account&nbsp;in
 Admin Center, you can again try to create the account as an alias.</i></div>
<div><br />
<div>I believe this response to be inaccurate. I have tried this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you try to setup an existing standalone account as an alias on another mailbox, the system goes crazy and you loose access to the account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you try this and verify what I am saying is correct.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am pretty confident at this stage that outlook.com has no mechanism to handle what I want. I will summarize once more.</div>
<div><br />
<div>MX records for mydomain.com pointed to outllook.com.</div>
<div>Main email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div>I try to add an alias *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I am asked to refer to verify email.</div>
<div>info@mydomain is only an alias so I cannot receive the verify email.</div>
<div>I try to trick the system by adding *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as a full mailbox in windows live admin center.</div>
<div>I first of all ensure *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is deleted as an alias from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</div>
<div>I can now &nbsp;create the full mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in admin center. great!</div>
<div>my intention is to receive the alias verify email to this mailbox.</div>
<div>I now try to recreate the alias info@ on the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account.</div>
<div>BOMB! - the system goes crazy and behaves strangely, I can no longer log into *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to get my verify email.</div>
<div>It appears a mailbox and an alias cannot co-exist for the same domain.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Better Solution</div>
<div>I would propose that once a domain is verified via DNS records. Then live admin center should allow the user to tick a box to nominate a main account for the domain then all verify emails should be sent to this main account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My only option now is as follows;</div>
<div>repoint my mx records back to a POP3 account.</div>
<div>create pop mailboxes for all the aliases I want to create.</div>
<div>log into outlook.com and add the aliases.</div>
<div>The verify emails should now hit my POP accounts.</div>
<div>Do the verify process.</div>
<div>Re-point my MX records back to outlook.com.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What a lot of messing just to achieve a simple result.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest the next responder to this question attempt to create an alias as I have described above, I think you will find my findings are correct. Unless I am missing something big.</div>
<div><br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I outlined the steps taken in my previous post, perhaps you have not read the full thread ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a full mailbox for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also have my main mailbox which is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
<div>Both of these are setup within the Domain Admin Center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The point I have been trying to convince the community of is as follows;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I try to &nbsp;add *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as an alias for *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;- the system blows a fuse.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need a mailbox for the alias in order to receive the verify email. however it appears a mailbox and an alias cannot coexist, the system gets confused and access to the info@ mailbox is lost.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please feel free to try this yourself. Please read my previous post, it has more details.</div>
<div>I also proposed a better solution for this issue in my previous post.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

            Hi Walter:<br />
<br />
You will not be able to open old files through the Finder, Finder doesn't know what to do with them, and Word won't be able to figure it out.&nbsp; However, you will often find that they will open straight up if you start Word and use File_Open from within Word.&nbsp;
 In your case, I do not think that's going to work.<br />
<br />
One Phillip forgot to mention is PC Word (the older the better).<br />
<br />
Most versions of PC Word will make an attempt to open Word 5.1.a, especially if they have the free "Supplementary Converter Pack" installed.<br />
<br />
You will find some fairly intense solutions here which will all work:<a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20111230095628470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20111230095628470</a><br />
<br />
Finally, don't lose sight of "Recover Text from Any File".&nbsp; Use File&gt;Open in Mac Word and choose "Recover Text from Any File" in the Enable box.&nbsp; That will at least get the text out for you.&nbsp; As will forcing it to open in TextEdit or TextWrangler: those applications
 can read the text and may cope better with the old Mac character set.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

            <p>Mac OS 9 can be loaded using SheepShaver and will, of course, run Word 5.1a nicely. &nbsp;It does not convert to later file versions, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I sorted through my various copies of MacLink and thought Version 13 would do the conversion for me. &nbsp;Nope, it crashed SheepShaver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight, I loaded MacLinkPlus Deluxe 11, and it worked fine. &nbsp;I converted a sample Word 5.1a file to Word 98, and it read nicely in Word 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have MacLink Plus Deluxe 16 (PPC Software) running under OS 10.6.8 with Rosetta and can now upgrade. &nbsp;It does the conversion nicely in case readers can find a copy and willing to stay with 10.6.8.</p>
<p>

            Actually My only option is to wait until ISO is released for slow builds. I have a slow internet connection of 256 kbps and as you know the Updates cannot be paused. I think the ability to pause the updates is vital for people with slow internet.

<h2>            Cisco Webex Meeting Add-In Failing in Outlook 365</h2>
                    I have Cisco WebEx Meetings installed (desktop app and Office 365 addin). When I attempt to "Add WebEx Meeting" from the ribbon in an Outlook calendar invite, a Cisco Webex Meetings Scheduler log-in box opens requiring me to choose my WebEx site and then
 to enter my Microsoft Account sign-in information.&nbsp;Upon doing so, an error is returned that states "The site you have selected is not authorized. Please contact your administrator to authorize the site". I am using a personal Outlook email address associated
 with the WebEx account.&nbsp;

I work for a large corp working in several countries on several hardware&nbsp;operating systems, the plug-in stopped working for all devices last week for all users after the latest Microsoft Office Update. It is a compatibility issue between Cisco and Microsoft
 and one of them needs to release an update or hotfix that solves the problem. I use the web version of the WebEx to generate the meeting credentials and paste it in a regular meeting invite for now. Any workaround is welcome!

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that one user did not receive any accept meeting email, even the invitee clicking the accept button.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the current situation, we suggest you check the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.If you have added a Delegate and selected&nbsp;'Send meeting requests and responses only to my delegates, not to me'.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To verify this, please follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a></span></p>
<p><span>b.Run this command: Get-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity
user@domain.com:\Calendar</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. If you set&nbsp;'Author'&nbsp;permissions on your calendar. This allows a person to open your calendar by choosing&nbsp;'Open a Shared Calendar'&nbsp;and schedule a meeting directly on your calendar. Therefore, no email notification is sent.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Check if the invitation emails are in the junk folder.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Run a message trace</a> about the meeting. Choose one invitee which has accepted the meeting as the recipient
 and the problematic user as the sender.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please share the PowerShell output and the Message trace result via Private message, you can access it by clicking the link below:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I found that you‘ve typed in the room meeting address when you performed the PowerShell commands. To check whether a Delegate is added, please type in the problematic user email address instead of the room meeting address.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, may I confirm whether you have tried my suggestion 2 &amp; 3? If yes, please share the result with us; if not, please give them a try and provide the result for us.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>About the message trace, please do not specify the recipient. I noted that you have typed in the problematic user as the recipients.&nbsp;</span><span>Now please just let this option blank or just search for subject and run the trace again so that we can

<p>If the user untick the <strong>Request Responses</strong> option, even the invitee respond the meeting, the organizer cannot receive any accepted emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please let another good user be the organizer and send a meeting request to the problematic user. If the user accepts and respond, will the good user receive that email?</p>

<p>Hi Srinivasan,</p>
<p>Regarding “<strong>to cancel the Annual Committed Office 365 Subscription, in between of the subscription period</strong>”, do you mean you want to cancel your Office 365 annual subscription although the plan has not been ended yet? If so, please send us
 your tenant information via private message so that we can involve our relevant team to check this and help you to cancel the subscription. I have sent you a PM to request this information. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message.<br />

<h3> twinnedsum12728  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 refuses to connect your device, This advice may or may not help.</h2>
                    <p>A lot of people are having problems connecting Ipod/Ipad/Iphone and other devices to their Windows 10 PC/Laptop. This could be due to no drivers installed or an outdated driver. When Troubleshooter fails to fix it, Or searching forums and other other discussions
 just simply won't fix. This may or may not help. It has helped me connect my wife's Samsung Tab, and her Ipod. So here it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Start Menu, click on Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Scroll down on the page that opens, and search for "Related Settings". Click on "Devices and Printers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. This will bring up another screen, It will have all devices connected to your PC. Search for Unknown Device, or I-pod (Unknown), or Samsung Unknown Device. Anything along these lines... Now Right click this icon, and select "Properties".</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. At the top of this screen, choose "Hardware". In the list on Hardware screen, Double click the device.&nbsp; This will bring up another screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Now Under the "General" Tab, click "Change Settings", Click on the "Driver" Tab. Click "Update Driver".</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Now 2 options, Search Internet or computer for drivers. I would choose Search Internet option here. This will take a moment or so depending on your internet speed. IT should start downloading, then installing this driver on its own.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Once Driver is installed, click close, Go to "This PC", On the left hand column you should now see your device here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, hope this helps, its helped me connect all kind of stubborn devices that refuse to install or show up.</p>

    <title>Text message indicator application for N73... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snags---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text message indicator application for N73...</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking for an application that will show me when I have received/missed a text or call 'without' having to turn on my N73 when it is in sleep mode... i.e. by periodically flashing the screen or keypad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found 'SMS Blink' as a free download on the web, but it won't install due to a certificate error, even though I have ''online certif. check'' turned off in the application Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got round the cert. error with other applications by changing the date on my phone 'backwards' to the date of the application file but this doesn't work with SMS Blink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? or recommendations of similar applications for the N73?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Change the bold part:</p>

<p>
</p><p>to:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EOMONTH(I1188;1</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>will give 30 for the months with 30 days and 31 for the others. (Feb will be also correct).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[EDIT] I didn't answer your question. This because I just added 30 days and didn't take the real last day in the month.<br />

<h2>            Powerpoint Organization Chart add-in not installed properly</h2>
                    <p>I have WIndows 7 64bit. I installed (upgraded from 2007) Office 2010 64bit, but found this was not properly recognized when trying to open documents on our company sharepoint site so I uninstalled Office and installed Office 2010 32bit edition (professional
 plus).</p>
<p>I made sure the Organization Chart add-in was included, but when I try to open a chart from a powerpoint it says the add-in is not found. I double checked that it was installed, tried repairing office, uninstalled and re-installed the addin, to no avail.</p>
<p>I tried manually adding it via options, but cannot find any Powerpoint add-ins to add.</p>

            It happens in either case. When I had the 64 bit version of office installed I could open the charts. Now I cannot and the suggestion you gave above, about inserting a chart also gave me the same problem as trying to open the existing charts. I do not
 believe they are older chart versions.

<p>Are you just looking for the degree symbol (°)? If so, you can insert it in Word by pressing
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+@, Spacebar</strong> (or of course you can insert it from the <strong>
Symbol</strong> dialog, where it is U00B0). You can insert it in any Windows application by pressing the
<strong>Alt</strong> key and typing 0176 on the numeric keypad (with NumLock enabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are looking for a symbol that combines that symbol with the letter F (<span>℉)</span>, then it is Unicode character 2109. You will not find this character in most fonts (though
 you can look in the <strong>Symbol</strong> dialog), but in Word&nbsp;if you type 2109 and then immediately press
<strong>Alt+X</strong>, you will get the symbol in some font or other. Here it is Cambria Math in Word 2013.</p>
