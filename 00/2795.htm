            Hi Chris,
<div><br />
<div>It can be done but not quite as easy as just putting a custom macro in your Normal template and assigning it a custom keystroke shortcut. See this link for the macro:</div>

<h3> scotte fontay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use of OneDrive for AutoCAD files</h2>
                    <p>I own a small engineering company and need a solution to share files, specifically AutoCAD.&nbsp; I have one employee that I wish to share the file project directory with, we both have valid (personal) Office 365 subscriptions.&nbsp; I do not wish to purchase and
 maintain a server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that the AutoCAD uses absolute reference paths to files (e.g. aerial images, logos, blocks) associated with the project.&nbsp; However, because the files stored on a cloud server are not physically on the computer all of the paths have to be remapped
 when the file is opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The main question is this - if I share the folder "Projects"&nbsp; is that folder going to physically exist on each hardrive, as well as the cloud?&nbsp; If this shared folder is then mapped to be the same
 absolute path on each machine "X:Projects..." I have my solution, but the files must be on the harddrive (as I understand it).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have been looking at Sharesync which has this capability, since I have OneDrive I was hoping it might work.</span></p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use OneDrive sync client to sync the project file to your local location, but you need to move it to your "X:Projects" manually. Thought it is feasible to change your OneDrive sync folder
 location but your still need to move the file out of the sync folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>About changing the OneDrive folder location, you can refer to this article:

<h2>            email change primary alias - what happens to old primary&#63;</h2>
                    I posted this issue a few days ago. I got some replies, but they did not directly answer my question/issue. Then a site moderator locked the discussion and stated s/he would email me directly the answer within 24 hours. That did not happen. So I am asking
 again. I have read the help pages. So please do not merely repeat info from help pages. I have a Hotmail address (which MS has now converted to an Outlook account, although I still sign-in with my Hotmail address). Several months ago, I wanted to make a new
 primary alias and delete my original primary alias (the log-in, sign-in, email address I made when I opened the account, back in the years before aliases were available). A few months ago, it was not possible to delete the primary alias (or at least not the
 original email address that the account began with). Now the help pages seem to imply that we can change the primary alias and then even delete the former primary alias. If so, does that totally disassociate the deleted former pr

<h2>            Why does Word automatically insert a tab at -57.79 cm and is there any way to stop it&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Word 2003 Professional Edition (SP3).&nbsp; I'm trying to modify a heading format - I was first of all trying to change the line spacing to a non-standard format (i.e. not 1, 1.5 or 2).</p>
<p>I go to &gt;&gt;&gt; Modify Style &gt;&gt;&gt; Format &gt;&gt;&gt; Paragraph and change the line spacing, but then get the following error message: "The measurement must be between 0 cm and 55.87 cm."&nbsp; There are no measurements in the paragraph window outside of this range.</p>
<p>I then go to Modify Style &gt;&gt;&gt; Format &gt;&gt;&gt; Tabs and discover there is a tab set at -57.79 cm and suspect that this may be the route of the problem.&nbsp; I delete all tabs and close the 'Tabs' dialogue, only to discover that I get the same error as before.&nbsp; Opening
 the 'Tabs' dialogue again reveals that the tab at -57.79 cm has reappeared of it's own accord (the other tabs that were set have not).</p>
<p>Is there any way to stop this phantom tab from re-appearing or another way around this problem (i.e. to set line spacing despite there being a measurement outside of Word's acceptable range)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ally</p>

<h3> cyclobiker_000  say:</h3>
<h2>            For Canadians&#58; How to use the New Bell Email at Bell.net on your Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>Bell Canada introduced a new email service last month.&nbsp; You want to continue to access your email via your Windows Phone.&nbsp; Your email address and password are the same as before when your bell email account was provided by Microsoft and was actually a Hotmail
 and later Outlook or Live account.&nbsp; The email service has been moved from Microsoft servers to Bell's.&nbsp; When you log in for the first time your email, contacts, calendar and tasks are ported over to the new server but you need to keep your Microsoft account
 for two reasons: you need access to the MS store via you Windows Phone and you want to keep OneDrive.&nbsp; Bell will not tell you how to do this because they do not support Windows Phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to access Bell Email on your Windows Phone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Add a new email address: input the details you use to login at Bell.net then change the name to so you can tell it from your MS account.&nbsp; You can use either POP or IMAP.&nbsp; If you want o access your email from a&nbsp;desktop running Outlook.exe and your windows
 phone (but no other devices) POP is good enough.&nbsp; If you want access from more than that use IMAP.&nbsp; Look on Bell.ca or your Outlook.exe installation for requirements such as&nbsp;incoming/outgoing server names, security, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Link the new email address to the inbox of your Microsoft account.&nbsp; You won't be getting any email from that account so you have effectively only one email service.&nbsp; The MS account is the primary one and it cannot be deleted anyway so this is a reasonable
 solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;works for me anyway.</p>

<p>Hello Parmi, thanks. IO can't see any option to attach the screenshots.When I click on import in Outlook 2016 the import box asks what do I want to import, so I click on Outlook 2011 then continue, then the next box says import from here, the main identity
 file, then it gives the error msg 'you can import data to a new profile only' So when I create a new profile I get the same msg.</p>
<p>So my Outlook 2016 is working in that I can send and receive emails but I can't import all my 2011 data.</p>
<p>regards</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<h2>            recover from imap pst file.</h2>
                    
<p>My genius server guys messed with the mail server and I lost all of my email. I was connect with outlook as IMAP and have most of the emails in that PST file. I tried to import from that file to another PST but outlook only shows the current emails that
 came after the deletion. the PST file is huge, so the emails may be still there but not visible. Is there a way to get the emails back from older IMAP pst file?</p>

<p>They are not locked - but you might only have the headers or didn't sync all folders. THe IMAP pst works as a normal pst when its not associated with an imap account so open the pst in your profile using File, open, outlook data file and browse. What you
 see using the method is all that you have.</p>
<p>If you opened the account after the server troubles, outlook may have synced it to the new server and erased everything&nbsp;not on the *new* server.&nbsp;(This is one of the few times a backup of an imap pst comes in handy.)&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is what happened, see
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/problems/scanpst.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/problems/scanpst.asp</a>&nbsp;for ways you can try to recover the messages if you don't have a backup - if you have a backup of that pst, open it in outlook.</p>

    <title>Design Ideas option disabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rajeshkaushal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Design Ideas option disabled</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Powerpoint "Design Ideas"&nbsp; options on my Laptop earlier. Harddisk of my Laptop got corrupted. So, got new HD for my Laptop. OS and Microsoft office 2016 was reinstalled on new HD.</p>
<p>Powerpoint is working fine. But, "Design Ideas" option is disabled after re-installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried following things to debug and rectify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i)&nbsp; &nbsp;Added "Design Ideas" from File-&gt;PowerPoint Options-&gt;Customize Ribbon-&gt;All Tabs.</p>
<p>ii)&nbsp; Enabled "Enable Services"&nbsp; at File-&gt;Options-&gt;General-&gt;Office Intelligent Services</p>
<p>iii) Added registry key</p>
<p>&nbsp;[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\PowerPoint\Options]</p>
<p>"enablesuggestionservicegrouppolicy"=dword:00000001</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I see the "Design Ideas" icon. But its disabled. On mouse hover, that icon gives the hint about the icon but we can't use it.</p>
<p>I looked at many forums and searched for threads if anyone else has faced this problem.&nbsp; I found that, many others have faced this same problem. I tried all the solutions mentioned there. But, nothing worked for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Rajesh&nbsp;</p>

<p>That isn't a subscription version and should not include designer AFAIK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were reports that non subscription versions were sometimes wrongly updated to include subscription features and then the update later removed. If you need designer then you probably need to take out a subscription.<br />

            Hi Rajesh, I am a program manager on the PowerPoint Designer team. I am really sorry for all the troubles you went through for trying to use the Designer feature. As John said earlier, Designer is only included if you have the Office 365 subscription:&nbsp;https://products.office.com/en-US/home?&amp;OCID=AID717974_SEM_GDeyd4zB&amp;lnkd=Bing_O365SMB_NI&amp;msclkid=e7f95118bfad104d41ff0a6e5b3eaf88

<p>Hello Angelo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two MS Office licenses (2013 and 2016). I used Desion Idea option with 2016 and I really liked it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to use this again. But I don't want to take Office 365 subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to use this option with my existing Office 2016 subscription only.&nbsp; I am ready to pay for license of only this option, Design Ideas. How much I have to pay for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Lots of people? - you are probably reading the same story that has been replicated across various boards</p>
<p>You need to state what add-ins are shown, whether active or not.</p>
<p>I would start off by uninstalling McAfee, and using their completely remove utility.</p>
<p>A reinstall will do nothing that a repair wont do, any reinstall uses the original Profile &amp; Settings</p>

<p><span>Hi TomS2002,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your issue, please disable the antivirus software McAfee, then adjust MS Surface Pro 4 resolution to 1280 or 2000 via Settings-&gt; System -&gt; Display to see if issue can be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, if you still have this question after tried the method above, about your issue, could you please provide me with a video about how Outlook flickering so that we can further checking? To protect
 your privacy, you can send the video via Private Messages: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox/">

<p>This is not the same issue replicated across many message boards, I've seen this as far back as 2013.&nbsp; This is the same issue Outlook has had since 2013.I have one user that has it real bad.&nbsp; I have 25-30 of these machines in service and hers is the only
 one this bad.&nbsp; Many of them are bad but tolerable.</p>
<p>I'm tom, but not the OP.</p>

            <p>If it's always the same image, that suggests it is actually in the file you're using for the mailmerge. The image may simply have been shifted off the visible portion of the page.</p>
<p>You can get such shapes back onto the visible page with a macro like:</p>
<p>Sub RelocateShapes()<br />
Dim Shp As Shape<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp; For Each Shp In .Shapes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Shp.Left &lt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shp.Left = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shp.ZOrder msoBringToFront<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Shp.Top &lt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shp.Top = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shp.ZOrder msoBringToFront<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>To use the macro:<br />
• open your document<br />
• copy the code from the listing<br />
• switch to your document<br />
• press Alt-F11<br />
• paste the code into the large window<br />
• press F5<br />
• press Alt-F11 to switch back to your document<br />
• find the page that now shows the picture and do whatever you want with it.</p>

    <title>MS Access 2007 Regional settings and decimal separators - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rutger2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2007 Regional settings and decimal separators</h2>
                    <p><span>I am working on an MS Access based application that is to be used both within North America and internationally. Within the many code modules comprising the front end, we use SQL statements in ADO methods to programmatically
 open tables, select data records, open forms, etc. Since my local regional settings are set to use the '.' character as the decimal separator, I've never had a problem. &nbsp;However, in countries where the ',' character is used, a commands like the following won't
 work if the field values contain decimals:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>adoRst.Open "Select * From [SomeTable] WHERE " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "someField = " &amp; someValue &amp; " And someOtherField = " &amp; someOtherValue, , adOpenDynamic, adLockOptimistic</p>
<p>
</p><p>DoCmd.OpenForm "SomeTable", , , "[someField] = " &amp; Me.Form1!field1, , , Me.Parent!field1
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be fixed by wrapping any of the string arguments above in a custom function that strips out the local decimal separator and replaces it with the '.' character. &nbsp;However, the project contains thousands of commands like these (and many variations
 thereof), so replacing them manually isn't realistic, and writing a script to do so may not be possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there a way to force Access to run with a specific decimal separator, or some other option? Forcing the international clients to use the '.' decimal separator isn't an option.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>Like all Office products, Access uses the regional settings of the machine, and AFAIK you cannot override them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately when "international-izing" an application you must often do a LOT of work. I had a similar situation years back, when an app I wrote was to be used in the UK and other non-US countries. I ended up with quite a lot of work to make my app compliant
 with the international formatting of currency and other items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Rick Fisher's Find and Replace to do the bulk of the work, and then discovered the rest through extensive testing. However, from what I've read, Rick Fisher is not responding to requests for new licensing on his product. There are some other F&amp;R utilities
 out there, I believe, but none as good as Fisher's.</p>

            <p>"International-izing" as Scott puts it is more generally known as "localizing" or "localization".&nbsp; It is the process of creating applications that can be used transparently in different geographic locations because the programmer has dealt with location
 specific issues.&nbsp; Localization does not have to cover the entire globe. You can do it for specific locals only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is link to doing localization in Visual Studio. While it does not directly apply to Access, at least it will help you identify things to look for and may give you ideas you can adapt to Access (like populating descriptive text from a lookup table, based
 on language/location code). </p>

<h3> markusb_83  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i open files which are located on a network drive in office 2011&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a NAS (Synology DS211+) on which all files are located because of three clients on the network which all are accessing this files.</div>
<div>The NAS is configured with afp and the share is mounted (with finder).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My system is running os x lion with office 2011 service pack 1 (14.1.3).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If i try to open a document which is located on this nas or any other network drive i will get an error that says the file is corrupt or have invalid signs in the name like \ or /.&nbsp;The file itself does only have valid ascii characters.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If i copy the file to my local disk, i can open it without any warning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So i think the problem exists in the path like&nbsp;afp://nas._afpovertcp._tcp.local/home/Other Stuff/Inhaltsverzeichnis.doc</div>
<div>But how can i change this without moving all data to my local drive?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>An on the local disk i have / sign too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div>Markus</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW: With pages i can open the file from the network drive without any error/warning... Therefore i think it is not a security issue.</div>
                </div>

            Thanks Jim. I think you hit the nail on the head with the "knows nothing at all about Office for Mac" comment. I know it wasn't a misunderstanding, because I was so shocked that we went over it many times.
<div>And now I need to report that I no longer have a problem after rebooting. I had rebooted after the initial installation, but had neglected to do so after installing the updates. I should have known better. Now I can proceed with the upgrades on my other
 clients.</div>

    <title>Runtime error 1004 - select method or range class failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> utherpendragon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime error 1004 - select method or range class failed &#40;repost&#41;</h2>
                    I am reposting a question as I now have new information.<br />
<br />
I have an Excel workbook with 3 sheets, Orders, Plan, Budget.&nbsp; On the plan sheet, I have a named range called lastytd (scope Workbook).&nbsp; I have verified that the range definition in the name manager is correct and points to the correct range on the plan sheet.&nbsp;
 When I reach the following line of code in my moldule1, I get <b>Runtime error 1004 - select method or range class failed<br />
</b><br />
Worksheets("plan").Range("lastytd").Select<br />
<br />
After playing with the code, I found the following two lines earlier in the code:<br />
<br />
Worksheets("Order Report").Range("ytdactual").copy<br />
Worksheets("plan").Range("lastytd").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues<br />
<br />
Thinking this code somehow affected the other line, I moved the .select code before the copy/paste lines.
<br />
<br />
Now when the .select code executes, it does not fail.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the copy/paste must occur before the select.&nbsp; I have devised a workaround that seems to work, but my question is - why does the copy/paste code cause the .select code to fail?<br />
<br />

            <p>That's the way it is.&nbsp; <br />
You must first select or activate a sheet before you can select anything on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
So this works...<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Worksheets("plan").Activate<br />
&nbsp; Worksheets("plan").Range("lastytd").Select<br />

Try to reproduce the problem in a new file, means just create 2 sheets with the named ranges, write some values into the cells and write a short macro,
<b>save the file</b> and run the macro.<br />

If you can reproduce the issue, then upload the file on an online file hoster like www.dropbox.com and post the download link here.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 is kidding during synchronization.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, today morning I added contact in&nbsp; Outlook 2016 to my outlook.com account.</p>
<p>New contact appeared in my phone (android 7).</p>
<p>I also added some contact pictures to current contacts I had from the past in this moment.</p>
<p>These pictures are not synchronized with phone, neither with web contacts (people) on outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes helped to add picture on web outlook.com via people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried the same with Outlook 2016, but no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please do you have any ideas to improve the behavior of this?</p>

<div>I did what you instructed me and Outlook opened itself and by itself was prompting some reminders with noise included until today's reminder dialog with three this "51 week overdue" contacts remained.</div>
<div>Later I close Outlook and restarted and the problem remains... please advise. Thanks!</div>

            <p>I found that removing events that had no duration fixed the issue. (Outlook 2013)</p>
<p>I.e. starting at finishing at same time in Google calendar.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 won&#39;t add an imap account</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem to add a new Imap account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already one account installed on the same server, and it works just fine. All data: ports, user, and password are right, checked several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outlook always gives the same error - something went wrong if the error persists contact your email administrator. ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if may be something wrong with the account, I set up&nbsp;this account on my iPhone - and everything works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Also: with every attempt to connect to the server outlook created the copy of the same data file (.ost) with the addition of the copy number in the naming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to delete those data files and make the new attempt - still doesn't work.</p>
<p>I tried "quick repair" the outlook&nbsp;- still doesn't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried "full repair" the outlook - and this didn't help either.</p>
<p>What can I do? Any ideas?</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            A. Try following and let us know whether it works -
<br />1. Type command in your Windows Search Box
<br />2. Right click on Command Prompt &gt; Run As Administrator
<br />3. Type "sfc /scannow" without quotes
<br />4. Run it and when it completes, configure Outlook again.
<br />
<br />B. Create a new profile in Outlook and use that. (This will remove possibility of corrupted profile)

    <title>Unlocking Lumia 640 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynewagstaff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unlocking Lumia 640</h2>
                    <p>I am confused.&nbsp; I purchased a AT&amp;T Microsoft Lumia 640 locked phone 2 months ago in the USA and AT&amp;T unlocked it for me, as I live in Canada.&nbsp; I just picked up the same phone but from Cricket for my brother in Canada, and they will not unlock it.&nbsp; I have
 contacted 6 unlock companies all asking for the IMEI number, model and service company, they then say they can do it, I send money and wait, and wait, then I get a message they cannot unlock it!&nbsp; Why are so many advertising something they cannot do?&nbsp; Cricket
 wants us to purchase a plan for 6 months, that we can only use half time in Canada and because of health issues, neither my brother or I can visit the USA and use the phone full time there.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a Windows 10 instructor that told me about the Lumia 640
 and how great they were and how easy to get them unlocked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is my brother and I are retired, and only want the phone for emergency and picking up grandchild, which means we do not use the phone 7 times in a month.&nbsp;

<h2>            installing access 2010 on new computer&#47; transferring Microsoft Digital Image Suite to new computer</h2>
                    We are upgrading our desktop PC and I'm not sure how to install Access 2010 on the new computer. I have the product ID -- is that enough or do I need something else to download Access 2010 from the MS website and install it on the new computer.
<br />
<br />
Also we are reinstalling Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006 to the new computer -- is there a data file with the photo library indexing information that we can transfer as well? Will it work on Windows 7 from Windows XP?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            <p>In order to install Access 2010 onto a new computer, you will need the media and the product key to do so.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Don’t post your product key here, but is your product key for a standalone copy of Access 2010 or an Office 2010 suite?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it is for Access 2010 standalone, you should be able to go back to the site you purchased it from and download it again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can also go to the site below and based upon the Office product key you have, it will provide you with the proper media to download.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as your Microsoft Digital Suite 2006 question, you will most likely need to find a forum that supports that specific product.</p>
