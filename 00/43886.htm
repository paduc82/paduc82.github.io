<p>It appears that the issue may not be&nbsp;with Skype. You might want to check with your device manufacturer on how they can assist you with your concern.

            This is absolute rubbish, I'm running Win 7 X64 ultimate SP1 complete with all updates and functioning perfectly. i last week purchased a new Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse assuming that the hardware and accompanying software would be fully functional
 with my OS.<br />
<br />
Sadly this is not the case, Win 7 will install the basic drivers but try installing the Intellipoint and Intellitype software and your major problems begin. We can go from the 1603 error, incompatible OS errors, to the complete BSOD if you can actually get
 the software to install at all.<br />
<br />
I'm no noob when it comes to computers and software and have tried every possible solution posted by M$ and others to rectify the problem and believe me I've tried everything, still without any success.<br />
<br />
It is blatantly obvious there are coding issues relating to the installer for this software as the problems do not just relate to the latest version 8.1 but go back for over 12 months covering a variety of versions and yet, despite the web being literally teeming
 with posts about this critical error, todate M$ have done absolutely nothing but provide lame and totally useless suggestions, none of which work.<br />
<br />
Even your support centre was totally useless as the operator simply didn't understand or comprehend the issue and after 45 minutes, his final suggested solution was to reinstall the OS and "see if that works" Now that's quality technical support and great customer
 service.<br />
<br />
I outlayed over $150 for a Microsoft product which i stupidly&nbsp; assumed would be compatible with my OS. Now I'm left with a basic wireless keyboard and mouse for which the software simply doesn't work in any way, shape or form.
<br />
<br />
If this is the best M$ can offer, its time to look for alternatives as i certainly will never again purchase any M$ hardware product as you are obviously aware of the issues but are not prepared to do anything about them<br />

            <p>I agree with what Billy said.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I have had the same problem that started when the computer was new from Dell preloaded with 7 x64.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Intellipoint stopped working after the windows update and never worked since.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have a separate post on this forum that has gone unanswered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that Logitech’s Setpoint 6.30 works fine, the only problem is some of the features of my MS mouse do not work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I really like my MS mouse and would like to keep it, but since MS can’t make their own products work on their own OS, I think I am going to buy a Logitech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Dell Precision M6500 and Norton antivirus, just in case someone wants to reply to this before a purchase a new mouse.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this point I think it is highly unlikely since moths has gone by without any support.</p>

Hey Chris,</p>
<p>It has been over a year since you asked Danny a couple questions, are you stuck?&nbsp; Does it take more than a year to figure out how to make a mouse work with your own OS?&nbsp; I don't own an Apple PC, but you never here that their mouse won't work with their OS!</p>

    <title>Windows 8 User now gets signed in with a TEMP profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djmoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 User now gets signed in with a TEMP profile</h2>
                    <p>Came back from a vacation and was updating several programs when my computer crashed.</p>
<p>Now when I turn on my computer I put in my password and get "Preparing windows" which takes several minutes. Finally the Start screen appears but only 7 Apps/Programs appear.</p>
<p>I also get the message "you've been signed in with a temporary profile. You can't access your files. Try signing out and back in."</p>
<p>Tried this to no avail as I get the same message every time.</p>
<p>By right clicking on the opened WIN 8 screen, I can see all the programs I have previously installed. I can pin what I want to the Task Bar and run them from there still but everything I save gets saved to office temp files which of course disappear as soon
 as I log off.</p>
<p>I am getting around that by saving everything manually to an external drive but that is not the ideal solution obviously.</p>
<p>As I said, I'm using WIN 8 and see that other users encountered my particular problem back in 2013...and I can't find any where that anyone was successful in fixing this.</p>
<p>Surely by now someone has figured this out. Any help would be much appreciated as I'm just about fed up with Windows and am ready to give up. After years of using WIN XP, WIN 7 and now WIN 8 and being reasonably happy, I'm even contemplating switching over
 to Apple.</p>

<p><span>Hi Diannebwilson,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I verified the model in Windows 7 compatibility center and HP website to check if it’s compatible with Windows7 and was unable to find
 any information in Windows 7 compatibility center. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to check the compatibility with Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><br />
&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Even in the HP website I was able to find drivers for Windows Vista and not for Windows 7. Access the link below to find drivers in
 HP website.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=391312&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodTypeId=15179&amp;prodSeriesId=391310&amp;taskId=135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DriverDownload.jsp?prodNameId=391312&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodTypeId=15179&amp;prodSeriesId=391310&amp;taskId=135</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to contact HP support in the first place to check if the device is compatible with Windows 7 and if it works on
 it.</span></p>
<p><span>Link to contact HP support.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/contact_us.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/contact_us.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>If you already Have Windows 7 installed on your computer, you may try to download Windows Vista drivers and try to install it in Windows
 Vista compatibility mode and check if it helps. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about how to make older programs run in this version of Windows:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-&nbsp; Also let us know what happens when you try to scan in Windows Vista?
</span></p>
<p><span>-&nbsp; Is&nbsp;the device is detected (recognized) in Windows Vista?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.

<h2>            Win 10 Calendar Sync to Google Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I have just started tinkering with Win 10 Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a google calendar that I set up and it synced very nicely into the win 10 calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I entered a test entry into the win 10 calendar and so far nothing has shown up in my google calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is only a one way sync then win 10 calendar is useless to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me that this will sync both ways. If it does then I need to know what settings I need to change to get it to do this.</p>

<h2>            Is the Pen covered under warranty&#63;</h2>
                    I began writing with my surface pro 4 pen today, and the grey nib in the tip fell out of the black casing while I was writing. Does anyone know if this is covered under support, or if I will have to just order their tip kit just to replace it? I've had
 this pen for about 1 month, after I had my surface replaced.

            it SHOULD be covered. if you are in the US, go to the nearest physical retail Microsoft Store - otherwise, contact support.

            <p>ok&nbsp; I tried the "repair all Windows Essentials programs."&nbsp; It didn't work.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; I was working on a home video project, so relieved to finally have the equipment and software I needed to be able to do this.&nbsp; I am so frustrated.&nbsp; I have some .avi files
 that will still play with sound in movie maker.&nbsp; I have about 100 .mpg files that will not play with sound in MM.&nbsp; I have tried converting them to .wmv and .avi and they still don't work.&nbsp; I have also tried restarting the computer several times.&nbsp; It still
 does not work. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does ANYone have any suggestions on software that will ACTUALLY WORK???</p>

            <p>I love how the very first option moderators offer is reinstall; because <em>that
</em>fixes everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it wasn't mentioned, what was the source VIDEO format you are/were working with?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your problem could be attributed to several things [video drivers, DirectX, codecs or system patches], but…&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows Movie Maker technically supports many formats; but what's not provided to the public [regular users] is that Windows Movie Maker doesn't recognize those various formats unless the CODEC for that format is installed in the operating system; it's not
 built-in to Windows Movie Maker. And Windows Movie Maker doesn't make any attempts to identify, collect or load those codecs for you; Microsoft leaves that to you to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation of the K-Lite Codec pack isn't complicated. Here's a link to the illustrated [screenshots] process of the installation for K-Lite, with the download link.</p>
<p>Link:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/1gcOesl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/1gcOesl</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, convert the SOURCE video.</p>
If you haven't tried already, try converting the video to WMV before using it in Windows Movie Maker.<br />
WMV is Microsoft's video format, Windows Movie Maker should handle the WMV just fine. Finding a proper codec is optimal because you don't have to do any conversion before using video clips in Windows Movie Maker; saving time— but converting video before using
 it in Windows Movie Maker usually is a logical and stable option.<br />
&nbsp;
<p>Freemake Video Converter is one of the most recommended video converters for assisting users converting their SOURCE videos to WMV. Freemake Video Converter is extremely easy to use, but there's some 'opt-out' software bundled with the installer that makes
 user nervous. I've created a post to illustrate the process of the download of the application, the installation step-by-step, explaining which options are optional. I have also provided some screenshots on just how easy it is to convert your video(s) to WMV.</p>
<p>Link:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Removed by FM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think this is better than trying to reinstall Windows Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you're having issues in Movie Maker when you're adding audio or the audio is not working within a video file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the information provided by member&nbsp;Larry Henry Jr for information about codecs and converting your files.&nbsp;<span>Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files – audio and video require codecs to play the file and
 it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>- Try running the Microsoft FixIt tool for codecs: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>FixIT</span></strong></a></p>

            <p>Hi Mellisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How exactly are you connected to Internet (Wired/ Wireless)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you are not able to connect to Windows Store as well as Internet Explorer, it could be possible that the network is failing to connect. To detect any failure with the Network connection, I would recommend that you run the Network
 troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Network troubleshooter first and then test your Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer Step 3 in the link provided below.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab4&amp;v2h=win7tab4&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab4&amp;v2h=win7tab4&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the results.</p>

</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>

</p><p>I suggest you to run the Windows&nbsp;Store reset command and check if the issue persists. To do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;press Windows + letter R, type the command WSreset and hit OK. Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>very many thanks for your prompt response.&nbsp; The game I was enquiring about is called ibridgeplus (available from iTunes) which was recommended by a friend who is a good bridge player.&nbsp; I don't think Bridge Card Game/Bridge Card Game Pro cover the same range
 of options for both learning and practising against other players.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

</p><ul>
<li>Where did you compose the information?

<p>&nbsp;When I say I am not connected, I am quoting the message that appears on my screen.</p>
<p>I know that it means that I cannot send an email from where I am, on the computer, mainly because I am useing software that I bought and added to the PC.&nbsp; But I am never disconnected from the internet, unless there is a powercut, so it the software, that
 I cant connect to my email, and I am at a loss to know how.</p>
<p>Any information that I have found on the interent does not appear to be up to date, as the wording suits a much older computer, I am using windows 10,&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I want to be able to do is to email some photos directly from the site I am working on to a friend, or colleague.</p>
<p>One of the software is from Serif, and another is from Ashampoo, both very reliable places.</p>

            I assume you can still brose the internet. If this is the case, there must be a conflicting software. What is your email provider?<br />
<br />
"One of the software is from Serif, and another is from Ashampoo," do the error message comes from these softwares?

            A .ctx file is a Visual Basic Control Binary File. It can be opened with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.<br />
<br />
There may be other type of .ctx files. Try and see if you can open in notepad or wordpad.

<br />
<br />Are you connecting to Exchange Online or an On-Premise Exchange?
<br />
<br />In the meantime please give a try to this and see if the issue persist.
<br />
<br />Create another Outlook profile, add the account and try again (This won't erase anything).
<br />
<br />Go to Windows Control Panel &gt; Mail &gt; Show Profiles &gt; Add.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work perform an Office repair.

I TRIED DOING THIS SEVERAL TIMES PRIOR TO RECEIVING YOU MESSAGE.&nbsp; IT WOULD NEVER WORK AS WINDOWS KEPT SAYING IT COULD NOT FIND AN ENCRYPTED SERVER.&nbsp; HOWEVER, SEE NOTE BELOW<br />
Go to Windows Control Panel &gt; Mail &gt; Show Profiles &gt; Add. <br />

I DID THIS BY GOING TO THE ARTICLE AND THEN DRILLING DOWN AN FINALLY FINDING A TAP INDICATING A REPAIR OF OFFICE.&nbsp; I EXECUTED IT AND THEN IMMEDIATELY WENT TO ADD ANOTHER PROFILE.&nbsp; AND, LO AND BEHOLD, IT WORKED PERFECTLY.&nbsp; AND IN FACT, IT SEEMS THAT BOTH PROFILES
 ARE WORKING FINE.&nbsp; THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, I NOTICED THAT BEFORE I CREATED THE NEW PROFILE, AFTER A REBOOT, OUTLOOK CLIENT 2016 WORKED FINE BUT THEN, AFTER A FEW HOURS, LOST THE CONNECTION, PERHAPS DUE TO INACTIVITY.&nbsp; SO I WILL WAIT TO SEE IF THIS HAPPENS TO
 THE NEW PROFILE.&nbsp; USUALLY I LEAVE OUTLOOK RUNNING 24/7<br />

<h2>            Game will not start</h2>
                    
<p>Why won't Tekken Tag 2 start on my console. I was playing it earlier today with no problems (after I got some DLC for it). Come back to it now and it loads, gets to the first loading screen and crashes. The only thing I can do is a hard reboot. It does this
 every time. Tried another game that's not installed, it booted first time with no problems. With Tekken it takes ages to start (since getting DLC). It sits on a black screen for ages, then actually starts and then crashes after the drive spins down (the drive
 used to spin down inappropriately before). The game fails to install, it says unreadable. Why? It's a 1 1/2 year old Slim with pretty much all the games I play installed.</p>

<p>I checked for corrupted Tekken Tag 2 data and there is none, game just won't start</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>And they want me to buy a One after 1 Red ring console (11 months old) which wsa repaired, had drive failure and the Slim is messing up too. Good luck with getting me to buy a One MS. I guess they would say Deal With It</p>

<p>The problem could still be with the disc. I have installed some games before (i.e. FONV, FO3,etc.) and they stopped working and my console is only a year old. The reason my FO3 stopped working is because they had laser burn. My FONV was having the same problem
 as you. It turned out that FONV only had partial laser burn and every time I loaded my latest save and completed the &nbsp;little quest... It would crash. It didn't show on the disc at all for FONV, but I knew it had happened. The only way to get around it is...A.)Buy
 a new disc, or B.)Don't ever play it again because it's not going to work. Some tips on getting around getting laser burn... A.)Don't ever move your Xbox with a disc in it, B.)Never tip it so its going up and down (it should be lying down all times), or C.)Don't
 mess with the Xbox while the game is reading.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 volume buttons when sleeping - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 volume buttons when sleeping</h2>
                    <p>I have found that the volume buttons on my Surface 3 are still active, even when the device is asleep and the keyboard cover closed.&nbsp; This is annoying - I will often turn the volume all the way down, throw my Surface in my bag, run to a meeting, and when
 I turn the Surface on, the volume is at 100%.&nbsp; Then all my notification sounds, etc. rudely interrupt the meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to disable the volume controls while the device is asleep?</p>

<h2>            Game Pass only showing 32 of 100 games</h2>
                    <p>For some reason today, my Game Pass subscription is only showing 32 of the 100 games that are supposed to be out there.</p><p><br /></p><p>I checked my restrictions, which are all still set to unrestricted. I even deleted my daughter's account off the Xbox (even though it wasn't signed in when I checked).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>This just started today. I am in the Insider program but I've not gotten an update since May 16, I'm a pretty new member of that program.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi ethascar,</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. What happens if you try to boot in safe mode?<br />
2. Were there any changes made prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
Step 1:<br />
<br />
Use the option "Disable automatic restart on system failure “on the Advance boot options<span>&nbsp;</span>and check if any error message is displayed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>However, if you have any external devices connected to the computer, you may unplug them and check for the issue.<br />
<strong><span><br />
Step 3: <br />
<br />
Check for the issue in Safe mode.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>In Safe Mode, you will have access to basic drivers and system files.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP:</span></strong><span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 4: <br />
<br />
</strong>If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, then clean boot to narrow down the issue.<br />
<span>a. Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
b. Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in XP:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state?</span></strong></span><span><span><br />
</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></span></a><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span><span><span>
 After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned&nbsp;under the section 'Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state'&nbsp;in the above KB article.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Regards,<br />
