    <title>Microsoft Word timestamp on comments - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Word timestamp on comments</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; &nbsp;Can anyone tell me how to access the timestamp on comments in MS Word. I found a thread on it where someone cleverly said "aaahh, this is easy, just go to preferences --&gt; view --&gt; and check the "comments on rollover" checkbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I am not aware of any "preferences" in ms word. There's options, and I couldn't find options on View and "comments on rollover" checkbox, nor was it in &lt;commands not in the ribbon&gt; in options or "all commands".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am staggered that there is not displayed date time stamps&nbsp; in Word and other Windows products as default anymore. Seems everyone is trying to become cool and hipster and say it was on e.g.&nbsp; "friday".&nbsp; &nbsp;Hmmm, as far as I'm aware, friday lasted for 24 hours,
 and it is very important for me to know <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
when </span>in that 24 hours someone made a comment on a document they were reviewing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts please ?</p>

    <title>Guest Users Viewing Calendar WebPart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crystallund  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guest Users Viewing Calendar WebPart</h2>
                    <p>Our Executive Assistant has created an O365 Group for our board of directors.&nbsp; All of the users are external/guest users who do NOT have our company email address.&nbsp; She has added the group calendar webpart to her group homepage, but the board members cannot
 see it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you make the calendar webpart viewable to ALL members of the group, even if they're external/guest users?&nbsp; They don't necessarily need to get to the "Email Conversations" in Outlook, although that would be ideal.&nbsp; But being able to see the next few
 meetings on the group home site is very important!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems counterproductive to have an O365 group to collaborate with external partners if everyone cannot see the meetings, events, and deadlines.</p>

<p>Hi CrystalLund,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query here. We are here to assist you about this requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First of all, could you please help confirm by "She has added the group calendar webpart to her group homepage, but the board members cannot see it", do you mean she published the below Group calendar in the group's modern page? If no, please clarify the
 situation with detailed steps and related screenshots about how she created it, and also some related screenshots about the symptoms on external user's side.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/624760da-087d-46a2-8a92-836fe640f162?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/624760da-087d-46a2-8a92-836fe640f162?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it is the case, assuming you have already added external users's accounts in Members list, please go to the group calendar by clicking the group name's hyperlink in the group calendar webpart &gt; copy and share the link to the external users and let them
 log in with work or school account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance with related information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Yes, she published the Group calendar in your image in the group's modern page.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external users were added as members with read-only permissions.&nbsp; To add a member that is not part of the organization, admins must go through Outlook and add them as guests.&nbsp; There's no other option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users have already signed in with their work/school account, and can see everything else on the group page, access the documents, send/receive emails and calendar invites in their personal accounts (Gmail, yahoo, etc.).&nbsp; They just cannot actually access
 the group calendar or inbox through the group, including viewing it on the group home page with the webpart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand from reading other articles that guests cannot go to Outlook and view the calendar/email.&nbsp; However, I am confused about the purpose of being able to share the webpart if no one in the group can see it. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Still nothing back from Microsoft.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that the app will only let you set up no more than 3 accounts.&nbsp; Which I have now done and its working OK.&nbsp; I do have a fourth account which I now access via the web site.</p>

            As far as I know, this problem is usualy caused by the contents of the file's tags that are created when the music is ripped.
<br />
<br />
You wont be able to copy directly from the real player on your PC - only through PC Suite.

            You will need to set up the caller ID. The caller ID can be your normal landline / mobile number (or even Skype number). When you call somebody, the number displayed to called party would be this caller ID number. Hence, the person can call you back on the same number which is configured in caller ID.
<br />
<br />What is caller identification and how do I set it up? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get the error message, "SERVICE REGISTRATION IS MISSING OR CORRUPT" with the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then please try to run the SFC scan and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows key + X key.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select command prompt (admin).</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type the below command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>print preview macro in access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bcvmiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            print preview macro in access</h2>
                    I have been trying to create a print preview macro in Access that I then attach to a button. &nbsp; I can get the report print preview screen to come up when I click the button, but the screen freezes and I can't close the print preview without pressing ALT-CTRL-DELETE
 and then clicking cancel.<br />
<br />
By the way -- I've been trying to place the button in the header section of the report.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks - bcvmiller<br />

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I tried changing mouse speed with no change. The format painter icon does work it just goes off when I scroll to the next page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weird thing is that I used the keyboard shortcuts your shared (thanks again) and I notice that when I double click on the format painter icon and scroll to another page the icon goes dead but if I use the Ctrl+Shift+V it will paste the format I copied
 using the icon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel certain that I have messed up a setting somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem with my yahoo account. Outlook is receiving emails from my other emails (gmail, etc.), but not from this yahoo account on this specific PC. It does send emails. This forum thread does not explain how to fix it (everything seemed to
 have been solved by private message). Could you please let me know. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a hard time finding the answer to this one . &nbsp;The solution for me was to add a wild card for ALL yahoo emails to my safe senders list in outlook's email settings. &nbsp;It is specified like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>then press "add to list" ...worked for me! &nbsp;</p>

            I can send a contact card from Outlook, but not from Skype? From what I can see, there are three bits of info Lise Quinn (of which there are several, two are me) my email address, and the name you pointed out which is neither. Seems less than straightforward

<h2>            System Maintenance in progress - where&#39;s the notification&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since the little flag has been eliminated from the notification are due to the addition of the new Notifications, I never see anything showing if/when maintenance is in progress, like the little clock that would appear under the flag.&nbsp; I'm I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Feedback app to suggest adding back some sort of notification to indicate when any Windows maintenance is under way.</p>

            LOL, that's what I'm afraid of.&nbsp; When I see my HDD light on constantly, I want to know what's going on.&nbsp; If I see the little clock below the flag, I leave it alone so it can complete the maintenance and not need to retry every time I leave the computer
 alone for a few minutes.

            You best bet is to reinstall you original OS that being Win7sp1 or Win 8.1 and then do the upgrade, If the version of preview that you have installed was installed on a systems that didn't have an active Win7/8 then it will have to remain as a Preview,
 but look on this site and you will find many workarounds to install the RTM version, I haven't tried any of them as I just used&nbsp;the media with the restore that I made before install the Preview, the "free" is only for active 7 or 8 systems, as for the updates
 with the previews builds the only ones we see are for Defender and any Apps or programs that you installed, when MS wants to do an "update" to the Preview it becomes a new build.

<h2>            Open one database from another</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 2007 db and want to add a button to a form to open another database.&nbsp; I tried using a macro and using the runapp command, but only got it to open Access, not the actual database.&nbsp; So I went to code and have the following:</p>
<p>Private Sub Command27_Click()<br />
OpenDatabase "c:\Documents and Settings\Operations\Desktop\archived controlled docs.accdb"</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>When I click on the command button in the form, nothing happens.&nbsp; Nothing opens, no error, nothing.&nbsp; I was sure this used to be fairly easy and don't know what I'm missing here.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You normally need to open the programme (access) 1st then the (application) database - like this</p>
<p>Private Sub Command27_Click()<br />
Call Shell("""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\MSACCESS.EXE""&nbsp;&nbsp; ""c:\Documents and Settings\Operations\Desktop\archived controlled docs.accdb", 1)<br />
DoCmd.Quit&nbsp; ' this will close your orginal DB - you can delete it if you don't need it '<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>If you don't know the path - you can cheat ;-)<br />
To get the 1st bit of the code some thing like "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\MSACCESS.EXE"<br />
It may be different on your machine<br />
in Acc 2007 it is sometimes here<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Office<br />
Click Run <br />
Navigate to your access programme and then click Run - then just copy the path from the run box (big cheat I know ;-)<br />
<br />
To get the path the database<br />
Click Run - browse<br />
Select all file types (in the file type dropdown)<br />
Navigate to your DB</p>
<p>Note - the number of commas that I have used in the code above and make sure you do the same. Also note there is a space between the 2 sections of the path</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>
</p><p>This problem is driving me nuts !</p>
<p>I have had it since i installed Office 365 Business &nbsp;2016 on my new laptop back in Nov 2016.</p>
<p>the 'fix' mentioned above - removing and recreating a profile works - for a couple of minutes ! &nbsp;then back to the same 3 error messages.</p>
<p>The only way out of it I &nbsp; can find is deleting Autodiscover.xml &nbsp;error files every time I log on/off and even when changing from Inbox to Sent. &nbsp;This is tedious in the extreme and v annoying when I paid Microsoft &nbsp;GBP229 for the new Outlook and it has never
 yet worked properly .</p>
<p>I have wasted hours and many £ on the phone to the Microsoft 'helpline' in Manilla . They haven't a clue and refuse to acknowledge there is any problem. I am [ reluctantly] considering instructing lawyers as under English law MS has sold me a product that
 is not fit for purpose and should be refunfed or replaced. i would rathe rhave something that works however.</p>
<p>Any [constructive !] ideas welcome.</p>
<p>NB , I am a simple self employed &nbsp;business user not a techie or IT wonk.</p>

            Hi DenCC,<br />
<br />
Besides re-creating a new profile, I’d like to know whether you have tried re-paring the Outlook data file or SARA tool. If no, you may try them to give it a shot.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please run the Outlook Connectivity Test via <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a> (Click Office 365&gt; Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Tests&gt; Outlook Autodiscover&gt; Type the Office 365 account email address and password&gt; Test). After you get the result, you can provide the whole information
 in the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">
private message</a> for checking.<br />
<br />

    <title>Gridlines don&#39;t show anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> strawbale09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gridlines don&#39;t show anymore</h2>
                    I've got Word (for Mac 2011) set up (in Lay Out tab, Grid tab, Options: Display grid lines on screen.<br />
It used to work (all the time), but I recently discovered it doesn't work any more.<br />
Strangely though, when I use a menu options (for instance the Grid options or any other that comes up as a pop up window overlaying your doc, on the outside border line of that window it shows a small band of the grid (i.e. the 0,1 x 0,1 cm grid I've set it
 at as I use Word occasionally for some 1 mm precise drawings) ???<br />
Does any one have an explanation for this and a solution?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!<br />

            I Set up exact as you did after I found where to turn on grids on.<br />
After set I was able to see the grid lines on screen both in Publisher or Print Preview mode.
<br />
A possibility that may help:<br />
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp; Apple menu<br />
</li><li>System Preferences</li><li>Accessibility</li><li>Display</li><li>Adjust contrast up one or two tick marks. Or if turned turn down a mark or two.<br />

<h2>            can&#39;t drag tabs beween browsers IE 10</h2>
                    After a recent Windows Update about a week ago, I can no longer drag tabs between separate IE 10 windows. I can drag tabs around within a window. I can drag a tab off a window to create a new window.

<p><br />
Back to the same window or a different one?&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW&nbsp;I just tested with </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome&nbsp; -extoff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it worked with that case.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do occasionally get tabs unexpectedly opening&nbsp;in new windows, so I wouldn't be surprised if cases like those could account for your observation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case you would have to analyze what the differences were,
 e.g. bitness of tasks could be a factor, etc.</p>

            I still have the problem (even using -nohome -noext). As I said, I can move tabs within one window but can't move them to a different window. This just started happening a week ago, from I assume Windows Update. No other software has been installed since
 then

<p>
</p><p>I have a Nokia Lumia 920 running version 8.10.12393.0.&nbsp; I was able to install and play Candy Crush Saga before.&nbsp; One day it stopped connecting to Facebook and syncing my progress, and I couldn't do anything to fix it.&nbsp; I uninstalled the app, hoping to reinstall
 it.&nbsp; However, I am now unable to install.&nbsp; I have tried multiple times.&nbsp; At best, it downloads part of the file then times out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the hassle of resetting my phone entirely, and I still cannot install Candy Crush Saga.</p>
<p>I have plenty of storage space, 24.61 GB</p>
<p>I am connected to wi-fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code I was getting before is 80070057.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Setting control values in an Access 2007 macro. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rwsinpa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting control values in an Access 2007 macro.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a large database originally created in Access 2003, migrated to Access 2007 a year ago.&nbsp; With appropriate settings in&nbsp;the Trusted Locations, all old macros work as expected.&nbsp; I have a number of forms where specific table values are entered into form
 controls using a button which runs a macro.&nbsp; I have two questions.</p>
<p>First, since my VBA skills are truely rudimentary, I use the macro builder capabilities.&nbsp; SetValue action was available in Access 2003, but not as an action choice in the Access 2007 macro builder.&nbsp; I need to add several SetValue actions to the existing
 database.&nbsp; Is there a choice in the macro builder action set that will accomplish the same thing?</p>
<p>Second, the old macros written under Access 2003 using the SetValue action work as expected.&nbsp; There are yellow triangles (i) next to the SetValue action steps in the macro builder.&nbsp; I have tried copying an old macro with the SetValue action, then changing
 macro name and other elements to accomplish the new SetValue tasks, but get the following error:</p>
<p><span><em>The object doesn’t contain the Automation Object ‘XXXXX’.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>You tried to run a Visual Basic procedure to set a property or method for an object.<span>&nbsp;</span>However, the component doesn’t make the property or method available
 for Automation Operations.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Check the component’s documentation for information on the properties and methods it makes available for Automation Operations.</em></span></p>
<p>The (XXXXX) above is the form name or table name that houses the control or field that is the target for the SetValue action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong, and how can I do it right?&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Stop automatic date updates&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stop automatic date updates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Microsoft word 2010, and every time I open a document the date is automatically changed. I know that pressing ALT-F9 opens the field code, and I have to change it from DATE, to CREATEDATE. But using that, I have to individually change the field
 code for each document I open. </p>
<p>So, how could I set it up to where each time I open a&nbsp;document,&nbsp;it doesn't update at all and I don't have to go through each one individually&nbsp;setting the date back? Is this possible?</p>

            <p>To edit the template, you'd have to open it the way you opened the document file (for example via File tab | Open), replace DATE with CREATEDATE, save and close.</p>
