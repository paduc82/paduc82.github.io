    <title>I have a Dell Dimension 3100 with Windows XP OEM version installed and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I have a Dell Dimension 3100 with Windows XP OEM version installed and am getting a request to insert Disc 2 which I don&#39;t have as its OEM software</h2>
                    I have been getting a pop-up message saying some files have been replaced by other unrecognised versions, which may cause Windows not to operate properly. It then asks me to insert Disc 2 but I don't have the discs as this is an OEM installation. When
 I then went to Windows Explorer, the colour of the text for some folders and files had changed from black to blue. Nothing else seems to be a problem at the moment but I obviously need to fix this before it gets worse. Does anybody recognise this problem and
 how is it fixed.

            When you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection<br />
Files that are required for Windows to run properly have been replaced by unrecognized versions.&nbsp; To maintain system stability, Windows must restore the original versions of these files.<br />
<br />
or maybe something like this:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection.<br />
Files that are required for Windows to run properly must be copied to the DLL Cache<br />
Insert your Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3 CD now.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you are curious to know what the file is and when you know that, you can decide what to do about it.&nbsp; Until you know what the file is, you can't really decide what to do about it or how it happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You should click Cancel, then click Yes to keep the file, then you will have an event to look at that will tell you what the problem file is.<br />
<br />
There may be more than one file missing, so you will have to just fix them one at a time as you discover what they are.<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer System log to see what the file name is, then decide what to do.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Check your Event Viewer System log and look for an event sourced by Windows File Protection.<br />
<br />
When in the Event Viewer System log, click or double click the 'Source' column heading to sort the events alphabetically by the Source name.&nbsp; The 'Windows File Protection' events should be near the bottom (or the top) of the list (since they start with 'W').<br />
<br />
The event you are interested is will look something like this example:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64005<br />
Description:<br />
The protected system file taskmgr.exe was not restored to its original, valid version because the Windows File Protection restoration process was cancelled by user interaction, user name is Jose.&nbsp; The file version of the bad file is unknown.<br />
<br />
or this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64021<br />
Description:<br />
The system file c:\windows\system32\taskmgr.exe could not be copied into the DLL cache.&nbsp; The specific error code is 0x000004c7 [The operation was canceled by the user.&nbsp; This file is necessary to maintain system stability.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you know what the file is, you can decide what to do about it.&nbsp; There may already be other copies of the file(s) on your system or you can get the file(s) from another trusted source - some nice person can upload the file(s) you need to their SkyDrive
 and you can download them (Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" don't seem to know how to use SkyDrive) and replace the file(s) one at a time
<i>if there are not too many</i>.&nbsp; First you must figure out what the file is that XP thinks it needs.<br />
<br />
You can also copy and paste the Event back here if you don't know how to interpret it.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.&nbsp;
 Remove any personal information from your information after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
Then you need to tell us more about your system:<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?

<h2>            I want to pay you for a Minecraft windows 10 beta realm&#33; Please let me....</h2>
                    
<p>I Just spent 3 hours on the phone with support to be hung up on after getting transferred to a different support team for the 4th time.</p>
<p>I cant put my credit card info into the Realms subscription on minecraft windows 10 beta because the drop down for country is greyed out, as the united states and I live in Canada&nbsp;so&nbsp;I&nbsp;have a canadian credit card. So it will not accept my payment option
 because of not being able to select my country.</p>
<p>I tried to change my region as per a xbox support rep on the phone and ended up changing it to Congo which they said they would fix but never did(you can only "move" once every 90 days)</p>
<p>I have updated credit card info on my Microsoft account with my current active credit card.</p>
<p>I just want to pay you a monthly fee to have access to the realm that I started with your free month.</p>
<p>Please let my give you money to access my realm on my minecraft windows 10 beta!</p>
<p>I don't know why I have to go through this frustrating support process just to give you money for a advertised service.</p>
<p>Can I pay you for a minecraft windows 10 beta realm with my Canadian credit card? I could access the realm for a month with my friends with a Canadian account. I would like to Pay you to continue doing this with my friends.

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 continues to run in the background - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 continues to run in the background &#40;Win7&#41;</h2>
                    It seems that whenever I close down Windows Media Player 12, it continues to run in the background with the song loaded. I then have to go into processes and kill it that way. I used to use it on Windows XP and had no issues, but it seems since using the
 RC of Win7 and the full version now it refuses to close properly.<br />
<br />
It's not a massive problem admittedly, it's just an annoyance when using a play/pause button and you're running Spotify as well.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows anything about this, thanks.

<p><span><span><span>Hi Nerbil,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In order to troubleshoot the issue better, please provide more information.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How long have you been experiencing this problem?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you recently installed or uninstalled any software or hardware?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall
</span><span><span>windows media player from windows features and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>To turn Windows features on or off, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>
Programs</strong>, and then click <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>.&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To turn a Windows feature on, select the check box next to the feature. To turn a Windows feature off, clear the check box. Click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Some
<span>Windows</span> features are grouped together in folders, and some folders contain subfolders with additional features. If a check box is partially checked or is dimmed, then some of the items inside the folder are turned on and some are turned off. To
 view the contents of a folder, double-click it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If the issue still persist then I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue
 persist.</span></span></p>

Any and all help is greatly appreciated!!!&nbsp; This is going to be a production server and I need it up and running as soon as possible.</p>

I am sorry we were not able to resolve your issue for you at this time.&nbsp; However, if your operating system needs to be re-installed and you do not have a copy of Windows, you will need to contact the manufacturer of your computer for assistance.&nbsp; Normally OEM's
 place the Windows OS in a recovery partition with instructions on how to mke a CD or DVD from those files.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

                    <p>I purchased a Skype number about a year ago for my local area Cardiff but when I try to purchase one for Bridgend it's not coming up with the option? Are there Ltd area codes available or is this a clitch?</p>

<h2>            changing administrator password reverts back after system restart</h2>
                    <p>Sir in one of the windows 8.1 system if we change "administrator" password, after restarting the system it reverts back to previous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried so many things but can't solve the problem. Also someone has created account named "admin" even though we blocked administrator rights. We don't have domain only workgroup. So please kindly help me in this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to fully understand why this happens on your computer, please answer some things:</p>
<ul>
<li>What troubleshooting have you tried?</li><li>Has someone set up a script in Group Policy to reset the administrator password?</li></ul>
<p>We suggest you check the settings in Group Policy to determine the cause of the problem. There may be a script that resets the administrator password to a certain password. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/816100/how-to-prevent-domain-group-policies-from-applying-to-certain-user-or-computer-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a> to learn more about configuring Group Policy for user accounts on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

            <p>Follow these steps to check if there is a script in Local Group Policy that automatically changes the password for the administrator account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start </strong>on your home screen.</li><li>Type <strong>mmc </strong>then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>if you get a prompt window.</li><li>On the <strong>File </strong>menu, click <strong>Add/Remove Snap-in...</strong>.<strong><br />

<h2>            Critical Battery level malfunctions</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Build 10586 for past few weeks. I need my laptop to be hibernate once the battery goes below 5% so I changed the critical battery level to 5%. But the thing is the laptop hibernates once the battery level goes below 10% independent
 of what ever critical battery level is set. Note that I have been facing this problem from the date I purchased my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help me out with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Dhinesh, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand that you are facing issues with the
<span>Critical Battery level notifications. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sign out from the current user account, restart the pc and login to the Admin account or the MSA to test if that helps with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also suggest you to install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may also run the SFC scannow tool if the issue persists. SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the
 tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary. Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press
<strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, select <strong><em>Command prompt (Admin)</em></strong> to bring up elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) In the command prompt type the following command:
<strong><em>sfc<span>&nbsp; </span>/scannow</em></strong> and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>c) After the scan, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

<div>I can't tell you what's creating the tmp files, but here's some</div>
<div>general info on the subject: The temp folder provides workspace for</div>
<div>programs. Programs can create temporary files there for their own</div>
<div>temporary use. Each program should delete all its temporary files when</div>
<div>it closes, but for various reasons it doesn't always happen (for</div>
<div>example, if the program crashes, it never gets to do this). That's why</div>
<div>it's a good idea to periodically clean out anything left there.</div>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello, part of <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, is a new way to sign in to your devices, apps, online services, and networks. Windows Hello works with a credential technology called Microsoft Passport that’s easier, more convenient,
 and more secure than using a password, because it uses "biometric authentication"—you sign in with your face, iris, or fingerprint (or a PIN). Devices with face sensors or fingerprint readers running
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> will work with Windows Hello now, and iris sensors will be available soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Go to <span>Start</span>, then </strong><span><strong>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in</strong> options</span> to set up Windows Hello. In addition to selecting a sign-in method, you’ll also set up a PIN as a
 backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further info on Windows hello, you may refer the Microsoft article below.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-hello-privacy-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Hello and privacy: FAQ
</a>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to write us back for any further assistance with Windows. </p>

            Yeah, I have the same screen as above, without "Windows Hello" option.&nbsp; If I type "Windows Hello" in "Find a Setting" search (top right) WIndows Hello shows up but links back to the above screen? Is this likely to mean I need to reinstall?&nbsp; Hope not as
 I was very happy with Windows 8.1 and starting to regret updating at all.&nbsp; Also unhappy with lack of online user guide,&nbsp; I can work out the basic stuff&nbsp;but want to make use of OS but need guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Manohar,</p>
<p>I have checked many details for Windows Hello. But stil can't find it anywhere in my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise (Updated till this moment). Now the facts, which I came across, are 3 types of devices, RealSense 3D Depth Camera (by Intel), Iris camera, and
 a Fingerprint reader. The 'Windows HELLO' will provide login support via all 3 types of devices.</p>
<p>If the above things are true with Win Hello, why I can't find it in my PC. I'm using X1Carbon provided with an integrated FingerPrint reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you help?</p>
        </p>

            most devices do not support windows hello. Does your laptop have either a fingerprint scanner or high resolution camera with facial recognition?

<p>By kernel, I think you may be referring to the BIOS.</p>
<p>I believe you need to update the BIOS in order to get a 64 bit operating system installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would contact the computer manufacturer for support for this issue as the BIOS is part of the hardware not Windows.</p>

            No, there is no way to change the "bitness" of any version of Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit, or vice-versa. The only way to get there is by doing a clean installation.

            That is what I am trying to do but it tells me my device doesn't support 64 bit. According to the vendor the device processors is 64 bit but the kernel no. I don't know what kernel is but I ask if it can be changed to 64 bit and if so how. Is the kernel
 the BIOS.

            <p>No, the kernel isn't the BIOS; the kernel is the main part of the operating system you are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly how are you trying to do a clean installation? If you are trying to install it from within Windows, that's why you are getting the message.&nbsp; You need to boot from the installation DVD and follow the prompts for a clean installation.<br />

<h2>            Xbox Colors Messed Up&#40;Orange&#47;pink tint&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Today my xbox360 started having color issues- everything is orange/pink. I have tried switching the plugs around and that is clearly not the problem. Only thing I can think of is my xbox av cable went bad- I attached a picture of what my screen looks like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox worked fine until I moved it to a different TV for a couple days- the colors were slightly off on that TV and when I moved the xbox back to my usual TV- the colors were completely screwed up. I'm guessing its just a coincidence- but worth noting</p>

<h2>            Windows eating up my Bandwidth &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a windows 8 laptop (Pre Installed windows)</p>
<p>there are some windows programs which continuously keeps eating my Internet Bandwidth automatically in Idle mode even when I have not kept any application running. I have figured out which programs these are, I am listing them here,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>BITS</li><li>Explorer</li><li>LiveComm.exe</li></ol>
<p>I cannot turn them of since they can automatically gets turned on.</p>
<p>I am on a very slow Internet connection and due to this I cannot use Internet whenever I need they eats up all my hard earned money and in vain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did perform some actions like</p>
<ol>
<li>Turned automatic updates off</li><li>Turned off every live tile</li><li>Switched to a local account</li></ol>
<p>But none of them helped. I am still without Internet (though I have a Internet connection)</p>
<p>Please microsoft help me !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows is made to help people but not to offend them.</p>
<p />
