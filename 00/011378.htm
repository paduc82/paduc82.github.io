<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Word Has Stopped Working&#34; when I select Outlook contacts folder in mail merge.</h2>
                    "Microsoft Word Has Stopped Working" when I select Outlook contacts folder in mail merge.&nbsp; I have Office 2010 so same version of Word and Outlook.&nbsp; I would export contacts from outlook but I have user defined fields that I have been unable to&nbsp;export.&nbsp;
 Any ideas?

            <div>OK, I do not know what is happening there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to describe what <i>should</i> be happening:</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. Outlook&nbsp;starts Word (if necessary)</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. Outlook exports the data - typically to a file with a .doc extension in a Temp folder. It's actually a Unicode-encoded, comma-separated plain text file</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. Outlook opens the .doc(x) file you specified, or creates a new one, depending on the choices you made in the Outlook Mail merge dialog box</div>
<div>&nbsp;d. Outlook connects the document to the text file data source it just created. Here, I don't see the file conversion dialog even when I have specified the option in Word Options.</div>
<div>&nbsp;e. At that point, you should be able to go into the Mailings tab in Word, see that "Edit Recipients" is ungreyed, and start working with the rest of the merge features.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So at this point I have to guess that either&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;1. you got to point (e) and "Edit Recipients" was greyed, so you had to try to connect to the source, and you prefer to use the old Mail merge Helper - if so, you would need to find the temp. file created by Outlook, not try to connect to an Address Book.
 Or</div>
<div>&nbsp;2. Outlook has failed to complete its process and initiated the Mail Merge Helper (which would surprise me, as the Mail Merge Helper was in effect deprecated in Word 2007), leaving you in the dialog.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I'm not sure Outlook's code would actually attempt (2) so I'm guessing&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. it's 1, in which case, as I say, you could try to locate the export file, which will have a name something like&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. that might happen if Outlook was unable to create the export file in a temp folder or unable to get Word to connect to it (in which case you might be able to get further by specifying your own file in a different folder where you have more control
 over access).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that may get you a bit further.</div>

                    It seems that you give the impression that windows media player 12 is available for windows 10, but I have found nowhere on line to download a copy for free.&nbsp; what's up with that?

            Hi eddietackett.

<br />WMP 12 is included in Windows 10. Try the following:
<br />Click on start and type Windows Media Player.

            Hi Eddie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Windows Media Player 12 is included in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17615/windows-media-player-12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17615/...</a>
<br />
<br />If you cannot find it after typing it into Search box, then go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Programs &amp; Features, choose Turn Windows Features On and Off, expand Media Features, tick the box for Windows Media Player, Save and restart PC.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sounds like something is corrupted. I would suggest that you hard reset your phone (Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone). Just make sure backup is turned on under Settings first so that everything is restored afterwards.

<h2>            Editing an imported field from excel to access</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Really new to Access.&nbsp; Taken some tutorials which have helped and consider myself pretty strong in Excel.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>We have a large&nbsp;excel spreadsheet with all employees within our branch (over 1200 rows/records).&nbsp; I had created a very good working "database" on excel for the lady who manages it.&nbsp; The boss now wants to move onto Access.&nbsp; So, like I said, did the beginner
 level tutorials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imported our&nbsp;"original&nbsp;excel database".&nbsp; Problem is one of the columns &nbsp;(fields) is named "Participant" and the data transferred reads last name, first name.&nbsp; We now want this field to split into two separate columns.&nbsp; Can I do this after
 I've transferred into Access or should I split (text to column in excel before importing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>MM </p>

            <p>Of course you can do it in Access...&nbsp; Once the table is in Access, you create two new fields for the split data.&nbsp; You then create an update query to divide the contents of the original field into the two separate fields.&nbsp;

</p><p>
</p><p><span>UPDATE [TableName] SET [TableName].FirstName = Left([Participant],InStr(1,[Participant]," ")), [TableName].LastName = Mid([Participant],InStr(1,[Participant]," "));</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you have run your update query and verified everything was updated correctly, delete the original field and your done.</p>

<p>I'm just thrilled that&nbsp;this can be done.&nbsp; However, like I said, I'm very new at Access.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I imported the excel sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I added&nbsp;2&nbsp;new columns (LastName) (FirstName) but that's where you lost me with update query.&nbsp; Are you able to give me step by step instruction?</p>

            <p>ok, it partially worked (took me numerous tries cause I'm not familiar with access at all).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My participant column has a name displayed as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smith, John</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added 2&nbsp;fields to the left of participant column: &nbsp;LastName and FirstName.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I copied the above command, it transferred the following into LastName field:</p>
<p>Smith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smith,&nbsp;(with the comma) went into the LastName column and&nbsp;the FirstName column is blank.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>ciao JBJ15,</p>
<p>one more solution.</p>
<p>since you are good Excel friend but for sure soon you will be also with Access.... :-), maybe it should be easier split into two colums into Excel worksheet and then importing into access in a new table, applying wizard importation from Excel to Access.</p>
<p>After importing Excel&nbsp;file you could simply delete&nbsp;field partecipant, as you got surName and Employee Names already splitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so....</p>
<p>
</p><p>if your scenario is like that&nbsp; ( this is just an example):</p>
<p>
<table>

<td><span>ID impiegato</span></td>
<td><span>Partecipant</span></td>

</p><p>
</p><p>you could easily split into surName field and EmployeesName applying to Partecipant these following formulas :</p>
<p>
</p><p>for surname, supposing partecipant fullname is stored in column&nbsp;B and cell&nbsp;2 this formula :</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SINISTRA(B2;TROVA(",";B2)-1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is for italian Excel version, but "sinistra"&nbsp; is traslated in "Left" in English and "Trova" is translated in "Find"</p>
<p>
</p><p>the same for <span>EmployeName :</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>=DESTRA(B2;LUNGHEZZA(B2)-TROVA(",";B2)-1)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Destra" is translated in "right" and Lunghezza in "Length" and trova in "Find"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>anyway to avoid problems try to get a look at this example, it's the same purposed above:</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft 950xl Dual sim Recovery locked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leandrospagnol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft 950xl Dual sim Recovery locked</h2>
                    <p>Goodmorning, I have the smartphone in the subject. Since it continuously rebooted when not in use and the front camera was not working (it triggered an error) I restored the phone, using phone keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the phone, that I regularly own for three years and that was linked to my Microsoft account and I could see it in my device, says it is locked in anti-recovery protection.</p>
<p>When I connect it to my wi-fi and try to log to my Microsoft account with correct login and password, I get the answer
</p>
<p><strong>I cannot disable anti-recovery Protection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ops! There was an error during deactivation of Anti-recovery Protection. Check again if you are Online and try again.</strong></p>
<p>This is translated from Italian, but the meaning is correct.<br />
</p>
<p>Since I cannot unlock it online, I tried to&nbsp;follow the suggested procedure, and&nbsp;disconnected the phone from my account: in theory, I should have seen the unlock code on the web page, and also have received an email with the unlock code. Neither of the two
 happened.</p>
<p>When I check the IMEI number of the phone in https://account.microsoft.com/devices/resetprotection, the answer is that the protection is NON active.</p>
<p><strong>It is almost like the phone is locked, but it did not update Microsoft accordingly, and so Microsoft did not send an unlock code.</strong></p>
<p>I understand that Windows Mobile 10 is not a finished job, but this is weird!</p>
<p>In Summary: the phone is locked, disconnected from my account, and unlock code is not available!</p>
<p>Moreover, in Italy smartphone support forum is dead and not followed by any technician&nbsp;since July 2017, only available support is from an external company at 10 EUR cost, in English, moreover they already told me this is not their matter, pretending it is
 a matter of accounts, Windows support is not taking care of this because it is connected to Windows Mobile and Account support is pretending this not their business.</p>
<p>As original cost of the phone was 650USD this is outrageous.</p>
<p>Kindly help on this matter.</p>
<p>In private message to a moderator of the forum, I can give evidence of the buying, IMEI phone code and Microsoft account to check this issue.</p>
<div>
<p>Kind regards.</p>

<h2>            e61 mismapped, Arabic characters appearing in certain keys</h2>
                    I have an unlocked Nokia e61. At some point, it must of had arabic language loaded. I have the phone language set to english. All is well, except for certain keys. When I press them I get either mismapped characters (e.g. + gets me =, the $ get me ')<br />
<br />
On other keys - the lowest row - I start to get arabic characters. For example, @ and ? give me arabic (I don't even know how to get them on a PC keyboard).<br />
<br />
While in a message, I have gone to Options &gt; Writing Language. 3 languages appear: Arabic, English, and Francais. I select English, but it does not change anything.<br />
<br />
How do I remove the arabic? How do I get the mismapped characters remapped?

<h2>            Gray window with 6 tabs just started appearing in Word for Mac 2011</h2>
                    I am using Word for Mac 2011, version 14.3.7 (130812), on a Macbook Pro running OS 10.6.8
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been using this same software on my same Mac for a few years now. &nbsp;Starting a couple weeks ago, every time I open Word, an annoying gray box opens in the upper left corner that I cannot move and cannot figure out how to get rid of. &nbsp;It is permanently
 in front of my word document and blocks some of the options in the upper left corner of the Word window, and so I have to move my entire document over to the right in order to access them. &nbsp;I have searched all the different windows, toolbars, and view options,
 but I cannot seem to get rid of it. &nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am sure there is a simple solution, or I accidentally toggled some option, but I can't figure out how to remove it. Please help! It does not appear when using other Microsoft apps like Excel or Powerpoint. &nbsp;Here is a screenshot of the box.</div>

<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/006358a2-18f9-493a-905f-083fcbc4c455" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In case you cannot see the image, the gray box has a numbered list of 6 items, each with their own gray triangle beside them for a dropdown menu. Here is the list:</div>
<div>1. Select Document Type</div>
<div>2. Select Recipients List</div>
<div>3. Insert Placeholders</div>
<div>4. Filter Recipients</div>
<div>5. Preview Results</div>
<div>6. Complete Merge</div>

            Take a look at&nbsp;<i>Tools &gt; Mail Merge Manager </i>in Word's main menu bar.<i>&nbsp;</i>If it has a checkmark, select it to close the Manager. If it doesn't, try toggling it. Word has misplaced it, so the upper portion containing the close circle is missing.

Symptoms
<p>When you click <strong>Contacts</strong> in the Outlook <a href="http://office2010.microsoft.com/client/helppreview.aspx?AssetId=HA102194289990&amp;lcid=1033&amp;NS=OUTLOOK&amp;Version=12&amp;respos=7&amp;CTT=1&amp;queryid=0cd93ac39ada4e73830f6de360ea3a7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Navigation Pane<span><span> (Navigation Pane: The column on the left side of the Outlook window that includes panes such as Shortcuts or Mail and the shortcuts or folders within each pane. Click a folder to show the items in
 the folder.)</span></span></a>, your contacts appear, but when you do one of the following, they do not appear:</p>
<ul>
<li>While composing an e-mail message, you click the <a href="http://office2010.microsoft.com/client/helppreview.aspx?AssetId=HA102194289990&amp;lcid=1033&amp;NS=OUTLOOK&amp;Version=12&amp;respos=7&amp;CTT=1&amp;queryid=0cd93ac39ada4e73830f6de360ea3a7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
To, Cc, and Bcc buttons<span><span> (To, Cc, and Bcc boxes: A message is sent to the recipients in the To box. Recipients in the Cc (carbon copy) and Bcc (blind carbon copy) boxes also get the message; however, the names of

Message</strong> tab in the <strong>Names</strong> group. </li><li>In the <strong>Mail</strong> view, you click the Address Book icon on the standard toolbar.</li></ul>
Cause
<p>These scenarios most frequently occur when you set up Outlook after moving to a new computer, or when you reinstall the Microsoft Windows operating system after you reformat your hard disk drive.</p>
<p>Even if you have successfully added your Outlook data file, also known as a <a href="http://office2010.microsoft.com/client/helppreview.aspx?AssetId=HA102194289990&amp;lcid=1033&amp;NS=OUTLOOK&amp;Version=12&amp;respos=7&amp;CTT=1&amp;queryid=0cd93ac39ada4e73830f6de360ea3a7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 above scenarios.</p>
Resolution
<p>The first step is to ensure that your Contacts folder is configured to be part of the Outlook Address Book. If it is, the next step is to reset the Outlook Address Book settings. Start with the first section below and, if necessary, continue with the second
 section.</p>
Configure a Contacts folder as part of the Outlook Address Book
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Go</strong> menu, click <strong>Folder List</strong>. </li></ol>
<p><strong>Keyboard shortcut</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the Folder List, press CTRL+6.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Navigation Pane, right-click the <strong>Contacts</strong> folder, and then click<strong>Properties</strong>.
</li><li>On the <strong>Outlook Address Book</strong> tab, select the <strong>Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book</strong> check box.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Diane; thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>However, I am using Windows 7 and the "add a profile" info in Outlook 2007 help only includes instructions for XP and Vista (though I tried them anyway). &nbsp;I could not see info on creating a new email profile in Win 7. &nbsp;Of course, I may be missing something</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Control panel, mail works the same in all operating systems.</p>
<blockquote>What are the implications of creating a new profile? I'm not sure why it's necessary to do such a brute force workaround . . . But at any rate, thanks again for your help and hopefully I am missing some piece of understanding that would make it
 work.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;A new profile is necessary to fix the problem because the outlook address book can't be deleted from the Account Settings dialog. We like to say its a bug since you could delete the service and re-add it to fix this problem in older versions but I believe
 it was "by design".</p>
<blockquote>As a minor rant aside, why can't Microsoft ever quite seem to get their upgrade migration stuff right? It went pretty smoothly for files and folders,but there were still quite a few places where I had to change security settings for folders in order
 to see their contents via Win 7.</blockquote>
Honestly, Easy transfer is not the best way to move to a new machine. Yeah, its easy but no migration software is perfect. I prefer to migrate the manual way - i move all the files i want moved and reinstall then reconfigure my software. Yes, it takes a lot
 longer but its well worth it.

                    I purchased Office Home &amp; Student 2019 when I bought a laptop. I had to return the laptop. I was told that when the laptop is wiped clean, my Office Home &amp; Student would show as new. Contacted techs multiple times and they claim I am using the 2019 version.

<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/i...</a>
<br />
<br />Under PC/Mac installs used, locate the computer where you want to deactivate Office 365.
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate to deactivate Office 2019 on the PC or Mac. 
<br />
<br />Try activating again.
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some websites specifically for Banks or any Company that cannot be accessed from outside. This does not depends on the Operating System you use. There are some setting of the browser that has to be taken care of.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">For the issue related to iPad I would suggest you to post the issue on Apple Support forum for iPad. You can use the link given below.

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However there are few websites which are very secure, you need <span>authorization to access</span>. Therefore I would suggest you to contact the IT Administration department of the company website which you are trying to access.

<h2>            Outlook 2016&#58; Saving Task views seems pointlessly tedious</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook 2016 I can set up a calendar view by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Picking View from the Ribbon</p>
<p>2. Clicking View Settings</p>
<p>3. Applying whatever filters and so forth</p>
<p>4. Clicking Change View and then selecting Save Current View as New View.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I switch over to tasks and follow the exact same steps everything works until the the final step where "Save Current View as New View" is greyed out and unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't the two view UIs behave the same way? It's possible to save a task view by going to Manage Views and copying the current one but requires a couple extra steps.</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion and thought for view setting. I totally understand that you want to simply copy and current view setting to the Tasks and reduce the steps of the view setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no such option or method to archive your goal, we can't apply the view setting form manage views to the tasks directly. For this useful suggestion, we recommend you can send your
 thought or comment to <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook uservoice</a>, and our related team will be happy to hear from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Twitter app for WinMo Standard 6.1 edition&#63;</h2>
                    Why is there no Twitter app on the marketplace for my Samsung Jack (WinMo 6.1)??<br />
<br />
Also, forgive my bluntness, but if your app store can't even get a twitter application, do you seriously expect 22 year old students like myself to continue using Windows Phones??

            The developers are the ones who make those designations in the marketplace. I'm not a developer, so I've never submitted any apps there, but the process may be confusing to them...I don't really know. I think the Marketplace is still working out some kinks.....But
 the 3 apps I posted links to work on Winmo standard phones.

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the error message you receive when you try to connect to Pogo games on the Pogo website?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What are the troubleshooting steps you tried to fix the problem?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When were the online games working properly?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>To work with this issue, follow these methods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the article:&nbsp; Troubleshoot problems playing online games using Internet Explorer<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2528246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2528246</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Clear cached data in Internet Explorer<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To determine whether a performance issue or an error message is caused by corruption in the temporary Internet files or in other cached information that is used by Internet Explorer, you must clear cached data.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;Open <strong>Internet Explorer 9.<br />
</strong>b.&nbsp;Click <strong>Tools</strong>.<br />
c.&nbsp;Scroll down to <strong>Internet Options</strong>.<br />
d.&nbsp;Select <strong>General </strong>tab.<br />
e.&nbsp;Under <strong>Browsing history</strong>, check the box <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>.<br />
f.&nbsp;Click <strong>Delete</strong>. <br />
g.&nbsp;<strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>Ok</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A progress bar is displayed to indicate that the browsing history is being cleared. After this process is complete, test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method 3.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> Reset security settings for Internet Explorer<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you configure security settings to be too restrictive, you may prevent Internet Explorer from displaying certain Web sites. To determine whether an issue is caused by overly restrictive security settings, revert to default security settings. To do this,
 follow these steps: </div>
<div>a.&nbsp;Open Internet Explorer.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click Tools, and then click Internet Options. <br />
c.&nbsp;Click the Security tab. <br />
d.&nbsp;Click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After you do this, test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method 4.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note If this method does not resolve the issue, you can restore Internet Explorer to its previous security level.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reset Internet Explorer settings and check if that fixes the issue.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Reset Internet Explorer disclaimer: <br />
</strong>Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this
 will clear browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information is helpful.<br />

                    <p>I select "all" on one sheet, </p>
<p>open a new workbook, paste values and then paste special formats</p>
<p>In my new sheet, only some of my originally grouped rows are there. some are missing, they are not grouped.</p>

<p>My file is created in earlier versions of office but has been converted to office 2010 format .xlsm by saving as.</p>
<p>I have both grouped columns and rows, but it seems like it's only rows that are affected.</p>

<p>any ideas? other ways to copy/paste to keep the grouped rows.</p>
