<h2>            The file is not in a recognisable format, using excel 2003 opening a file from the internet created in a newer version of excel. What do I do&#63;</h2>
                    One of my lecturers has posted an assignment on blackboard, he created the assignment on a later version of excel than mine (i.e. Excel 2003). I get an error message saying that the file is in an unrecognisable format. I've tried viewing the alternate
 file location, that field is empty, also I've tried downloading file format converter from the microsoft website but that is no help either. What do I do?

    <title>identify where all the data is inside a OneNote notebook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jj_the_skeptic  say:</h3>
<h2>            identify where all the data is inside a OneNote notebook</h2>
                    <p>We created several OneNote notebooks inside an o365 sharepoint site for an internal group.&nbsp; They are using them heavily.&nbsp; One of the notebooks is 93 GB in size.&nbsp; One of the sections in it is 90 GB in size (identified by looking at storage metrics in the
 site collection).</p>
<p>That one section appears to have a couple hundred pages.</p>
<p>Is there some way I can analyze the notebook to determine what pages are using the most storage? I'd like to identify objects are consuming the bulk of the data and move them out to a document library or similar.&nbsp; I've got a user telling me her OneNote crashes
 about every hour, even if she uses someone else's computer, and I suspect it is because she has six different OneNotes opened - including that 93 GB notebook.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Jj_the_Skeptic,<br />
<br />
It is not feasible to check the size for each page. We suggest you submit feedback in OneDrive
 for you and others.<br />
<br />
To clarify the OneNote crashing issue, I would like to confirm the following information to clarify the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does the crashing issue only occur when the large notebook opens? This can help us determine if the issue is related to the specific notebook.<br />
2. Do any other users in the group have the same issue? Could you share the detailed steps this user did when she encountered the issue?<br />
3. Let the user close some notebooks to see if there is any improvement.<br />
4. A screenshot of the Office version. To do it, open OneNote, click<strong> File</strong> &gt;<strong> Account
</strong>&gt; under <strong>Office Updates</strong>.<br />

<p>The user always has that notebook open, so she can't test having it closed (she works in it daily).</p>
<p>But, I also use OneNote daily(different notebooks) and have not had any problem with it crashing.&nbsp; Yesterday I opened this (potentially) problematic, 93 GB notebook and, after having it open for several hours, OneNote crashed (I wasn't actively using it
 at the time).&nbsp; I restarted OneNote and left for the day shortly afterwards. When I arrived this morning, OneNote had again crashed with an error "Microsoft OneNote has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience"</p>

            Hi Jj_the_Skeptic,<br />
<br />
I believe you manage to narrow down that this particular notebook is the cause. Also you did pointed out that the size would probably the culprit who caused the crash.
<br />
<br />
Although we do not have any public document that define the maximum size allowed for a notebook, I would say that the best practice is to allow a notebook&nbsp; stay at a reasonable size. Reason is that the notebook is stored in SharePoint Online, any changes require
 this notebook to sync back. Also another backup copy is placed on your system as well.<br />
<br />
c:\users\[your username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote <br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding,<br />
Linda

            After numerous tries, it is somehow fixed. For the possible benefit of anyone else with this problem, the only thing I did differently was to look at the Exe file in its folder and open it from there rather than press 'Run' as would be usual with an installation.
 Beats me.

<h2>            Excel 2016 crashes with  macOS Sierra and High Sierra Text Import Wizard</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I try to import a .txt or .log file into an Excel document using the Text Import Wizard, Excel will crash when I try to scroll in the data preview window. I cannot scroll down to see where the columns are to properly insert the column dividers. As far
 as I know, this problem does not exist in El Capitan, but it does in both macOS Sierra and High Sierra, in all versions of Excel 2016 from v. 15.17 to the latest Insider Preview v. 16.8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have found that if I delete the top rows in the .txt or .log files, the Text Import Wizard will recognize the columns and insert the column dividers automatically and I can insert this data into the document. However, I still cannot scroll in the Text
 Import Wizard data preview window without Excel crashing.</p>

<p>Hi Martin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your report. To get things started, if you haven't already, could you click the smiley-face button in the upper corner, and send this report to the team. They'll get it along with Office and device info that will help them troubleshoot the
 problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, the smiley face feedback button does not open when you have the Text Import Wizard open, so I cannot do that. Otherwise, it only allows me to take a screenshot of the functioning Excel absent the operations that cause
 the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>HI Martin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ugh, I didn't know that. Maybe just do the report without the actual screen shot.&nbsp; If you can attach a file, maybe do a screen shot with Command + Shift + 3 (or 4) . Put in the top line that you couldn't shoot a screen of the actual process. I think they
 want the info that also goes along with the report. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a check and didn't find a bug yet (could just be my search skills), so I'm going to also pass it to the team once I know you've done been able to send a report (w/o actual screen shot :))
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know. </p>
<p>Thanks. </p>
        </p>

<p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue only occurs after I open the Text Import Wizard. Up to that point, I have a blank workbook, so there is nothing to submit in the report. I can send you a sample file if that would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Martin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can send it before it crashes, and copy the crash report you cc'd here, and add a link to this thread, that might be helpful. There's some boilerplate metadata that is sent with the report that helps the team see the environment. They usually&nbsp;want
 the device ID which goes with that report. I'll send a note to the team from this end.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I'm having a similar problem with my Lumia 520. It started when I connected the phone to a Lenovo desktop to upload photos. The phone was not recognized because the PC couldn't find a device driver on either this PC or an HP laptop. I had done this before
 with no problems. The Windows 8.1 Phone App had trouble connecting as well. When I had used this a year previously it had taken many hours to update and never completed. It had started downloading from the PC to the My Pictures folder in the phone. I stopped
 it after about 24 hours. The photo hub continued to work and display correctly, and I uploaded photos by accessing the phone as a hard drive using Windows Explorer from then on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When nothing worked this year I took the micro SD card out of the camera and put it into the PC's SD card slot. This worked to upload the photos. The photos on the SD card are all in date sequence (in camera roll), exactly as they should be. I deleted the
 duplicate photos in the My Pictures folder on the SD card. The phone camera then spent a while apparently trying to reorganize the pictures (in some &nbsp;kind of index?). It tried this multiple times across opening the photos hub and rebooting the phone, but has
 not been able to accurately display images from before my July 11 upload by date (location is not turned on). Photos are randomly grouped by date for some photos while others are close to the original date, or even correct. All photos taken since July 11 are
 working correctly. Favorites, however, are also scrambled, with pictures never marked as favorites showing up as favorites and vice-versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go in to scroll through the pictures the picture you are not will go to the next picture, then by itself go to another picture (without sliding the display in any way). This too is only for pictures taken before July 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the setting to Group Pictures by Time and Location apply only to the display, or does it modify the storage of the pictures on the phone? I haven't been able to determine this from web searches. Would setting it off, rebooting and turning it back on
 correct the problem or make it worse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone camera has been having shutter issues too, so I switched from the Microsoft Camera to Lumia Camera, which seems to have fixed that issue, but not the display issue in viewing the camera roll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried a soft reset (power and volume down buttons) on the phone since I'm not sure what it would do to the SD card. Should I try it with the SD card removed? A post I saw said it would not remove user content but did not go into detail about what
 it would actually do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found a post on the web that gives details of how the photos get displayed in the photo hub, but it looks like there is some kind of internal index in the phone's memory (not on the SD card) that has been corrupted and which the phone is unable
 to rebuild. The photos on the SD card are in sequence by the date in the name of the image. The properties detail information for the uploaded photos appears to be correct and complete, including the date taken, so I'm not seeing any bad dates related to the
 actual photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no error messages appearing in any of this. The phone thinks it's fine. Other than switching to the Lumia Camera today, there have been no changes other than any downloads that are applied automatically to the phone and it's apps, and to the PCs
 through Windows update. All are current. There have been no updates to the Windows Camera app since we got the phone in 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Powerpoint Timing in 2016 edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tina-2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint Timing in 2016 edition</h2>
                    We upgraded with a new laptop (i5) to Powerpoint 2016 and Windows 10 from Powerpoint 2007 and Windows Vista. We have 100 powerpoints timed to music to show lyrics in our church for singing. The timings no longer match. I tried to rehearse timings again
 (in the Powerpoint 2016) in one song a couple of times but the playback does not match the lyrics. It is too slow. I am using just a simple fade to change slides. No other animations. Any suggestions?

            <p>Ouch!&nbsp; My sympathies ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, PPT has never been very good at maintaining accurate timing of slide changes to music.&nbsp; Sometimes people get lucky and land on a hardware/software combination that gives them reliable, repeatable results (sounds like that's what you used to
 have) and other times, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try exporting slides as images, then bringing the images into Windows Live MovieMaker or the like, where you can more reliably synch slide changes to music.&nbsp; Then export as a movie (which you can link to or embed in your PPT presentations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another old trick that may still work is to let PPT play through the presentation once before you actually start it in front of an audience.&nbsp; That sometimes helps to stabilize the timing.&nbsp; That may not be practical to do during services, but it leads to
 another idea:&nbsp; IF you can get the new version of PPT to give you repeatable playback, try saving the presentation as a movie.&nbsp; Then play the movie during the service rather than the original PPT.</p>

<p>The Javascript switch is located in the browser at Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Java/ECMA script.&nbsp; But how are you trying to download and install EBuddy?&nbsp; I don't use it, but browsing to
<a href="http://get.ebuddy.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.ebuddy.com</a> and clicking Download seems to work fine on my E73.&nbsp; And downloading and installing doesn't appear to depend on the Java/ECMA switch setting.&nbsp; If you still can't get it

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 930 keep reboot constantly on both ver 8.1 &#47; 10</h2>
                    <p>Before thinking like ,another newbie ,same problem etc, listen my case .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already im the point to throw my phone on window and change the OS (sick of &nbsp;windows). The phone work very well before never had problems ,but in one day (9days ago) &nbsp;ive installed Windows 10 , i think worked like 5-6h ,while in this time ,i have installed
 app,maps etc ,after those 5-6h ,it RESTARED first time ,ok ?!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got back to main screen ,after i tried to make a photo ,restared again ,after10min ,i was on Edge Browser ,it restared again ,and from this point ,the phone was&nbsp;constantly restarting , to the point where Nokia logo dissapearing ( nokia logo -restart-nokia
 logo -restart etc ).</p>
<p>Couln.t done nothing ,turn off, even soft reset didn.t change nothing ,just&nbsp;constantly restarts .</p>
<p>Tried to plug to the power and finnaly work, went me to main screen , and it worked fine while it was plug in to power. After unplug and i wanted to do some stuff in Edge,photo,browser menu , AGAIN keep&nbsp;constantly restarting .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in this point ,went on google look for solution etc, well here is the problem, ive done everything from google, &nbsp;HARD RESET (&nbsp;constantly restarts-Fail ) , Soft Reset ( fail -constantly restart again) ,</p>
<p>Recovery Tools ( went me back to Windows 8.1 ver SO: 8.10.14219341 ) : Fail-constantly restart , hard reset ( win 8.1 )-Fail-constantly restart , Stop restart app ( Fail - my phone it ok,didnt find nothing wrong )- fail -constantly restart .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now even plug in , it let me browser EDGE , photo -fail restart . I was thinking to change battery too with new one,but this in 10days i can . So could be the battery or realy phone is DEAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my Last SO ver now "Windows 8.1 ver SO: 8.10.14219341".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ?? any suggestion ? Thank You .</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS :Realy dont post again to do hard reset,recovery tool,stop restart app, already done and none of them didnt worked .</p>

            <p>So in the end , i've changed the battery with the new one ( 20euro on amazon), and YES he stop rebooting, and now work fine on windows 10 OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So seems to be the battery that force rebooting non-stop the phone or maybe OS,not sure, for me all the &nbsp;FIXs that microsoft recommended,didn;t worked at all. Last step was to change battery ,and FIXED .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How to change battery ,look youtube there is a video,and quite simple to do that ,do not ask here ^^.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Mine was too, first reboot unplugged ,after few days ,he started to reboot plugged in &nbsp;from once to reboot after reboot after reboot ( plugged in) so my thought was to change battery which cost 20-25euro ( amazon ) so i did it since i didn;t had nothing
 to lose, and yup it work now no problems in win 8,1 and now in win 10 ( which i use now )..</p>
<p>So my advice if u realy &nbsp;wana do this ,change battery &nbsp;,try this for 25E you dont lose nothing .</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer 11, MSN.com Homepage Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike cadet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11, MSN.com Homepage Problem</h2>
                    I am using Internet Explorer 11 with Windows 10.&nbsp; When I try to customize my MSN.com homepage, by removing sections (i.e. Lifestyles, Entertainment, etc.), they do not come back when I reopen Explorer after closing it and/or after the computer is restarted.&nbsp;
 For some reason it is not saving my settings.&nbsp; These settings&nbsp;were saved in previous versions of Internet Explorer.&nbsp; I have looked at the various places to see if I can save these settings, but have not found anything.&nbsp; Any help to correct this problem is
 appreciated.&nbsp; Mike

<h2>            Table cell resize suddenly doesn&#39;t work anymore</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 365 on a Mac with VMware Fusion so I can run a Windows operating system. This is necessary because my Word projects are shared only with Windows users. I have a number of forms constructed with fairly complicated tables. I need to resize
 individual cells often, which I normally do by selecting the two cells on either side of a border, and dragging just that one border. Normally when I do this, as soon as I roll over the border, the arrow tool changes to the tool that looks like a cross with
 arrows on the ends and then I can drag the border. Suddenly, since my last update, this does not happen. The arrow tool, or sometimes the type-looking cursor, (whatever it is) won't change and I can't drag the border anymore. This happens regardless of whether
 the file is still in .doc format, in .docx with compatibility mode on or if I let Word save the file to the newest format. This is driving me nuts -- what do I do? Do I need to reinstall the whole Office suite?</p>

<p>Hi Amy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You posted your question to the Word for Mac forum, but your screenshot is from Word for Windows. Can you verify you are asking about Word for Mac? If you are using Word for Mac, could you go to the Word menu and choose About Word and get the version information
 and reply with that along with the version of Mac OS you have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want this question moved to the Windows forum, just reply and we can move it for you.</p>

<p>My post probably does need to be on the Word for Windows forum. I have a Mac, but I use VMWare Fusion to run a Windows operating system on part of my Mac and the Office Suite lives on that Windows operating system. The Mac is running Mojave and the Windows
 operating system living within the VMWare Fusion is whatever the lastest and greatest is. I updated it a couple of days ago. The Office Suite is all Office 365. IF you would move my post I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<br />What is the make and model of your Mac? Click the Apple menu &gt; About this Mac to find out.
<br />
<br />Also, supply information about the version of macOS installed: 10.14, 10.13, 10.12?

<h2>            Cloud Fonts in Office 365 Mac - Word</h2>
                    Is there an option to turn off cloud fonts in the Mac version of Word as you do in the Windows version? I've had to return to version 16.16 to get away from such a large font menu.

<p>No. And, the fonts got larger and larger when they started&nbsp;office365/2016, then 2016, and now, 2019.&nbsp;In 2011 you had one set of fonts and font cache&nbsp;file to serve all the office Products. With the versions now, there are 3 sets of Fonts with about 60 fonts
 each for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word and no font cache.&nbsp; That means the&nbsp;font has to be loaded each time. Maybe if&nbsp;you have an SSD&nbsp;it won't&nbsp;matter, but if a standard Hd Drive,&nbsp;prepare for a slow operation.</p>

<p>One way you could improve it is to give the user that option to turn it off just as you have done in the Windows version. There are so many clouds that the font menu becomes so lengthy it's difficult to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's particularly annoying when the response from the developer essentially tells the user "We don't care what you want, we're going to give you what we think you should have." There's a reason Apple is so successful, they listen
 to their customers. I would hope that Microsoft would do the same. To you it may be a feature. To me it's an annoyance. Of course I can always speak with my wallet. While I find your software helpful, I certainly don't need it. There are other pieces of software
 that will do what I want without making my work harder than it has to be.&nbsp;If you don't think the additional clutter in the font menu is annoying try it yourself</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are wondering why I responded as I did it's because your response, Jim, came across to me as arrogant and indifferent. You really need to do better. The only reaction I have to your response is to seriously consider not renewing
 my subscription when it comes due.</p>

As forum support, we care about your feeling and always like to help our customers.<br />
<br />
I think there must be some misunderstanding. I'm just trying to help without any offense.&nbsp;I apologize for the frustration it caused. But unlike the development team, for feature improvement, I can just provide the feedback channel Uservoice, which is the best
 place to let them hear from you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

            Nope. It's certainly worth requesting this feature but don't hold your breath. The typographic features of Office for Mac keep getting worse and worse, starting with the decision to bury scores of useless fonts inside application packages, which Microsoft
 falsely claims is required by Apple's sandboxing policies. Now it's cloud fonts. Complain loudly and often. Maybe someone will eventually listen.

<h2>            How to change the E71&#39;s default browser&#63;</h2>
                    Even though the E71's default browser is not bad at all, I prefer using Opera Mini.<br />
<br />
An example: the page [<a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/about_pl.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/about_pl.html</a>] just doesn't render ok in my E71 when using the default browser. The entire left side of the page doesn't
 show up. Needless to say that Opera Mini renders it nicely.<br />
<br />
So, my question is: how do I change the browser used by the phone by default?

<p>For the site you list in your link, open it with the default browser, and then zoom to 50%.&nbsp; It almost looks right.&nbsp; :smileywink:</p>

<p>There are a lot of sites that the default browser, and even Opera Mini 4.2, do not render properly.</p>

<h2>            MyPhone sync problem</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
today, i hard reset my Omnia, and tried to sync, the contacts synced fine, but no text messages .. i went to the website, and found that all my test messages were archived (i didn't archive them...), i selected them .. pressed restore, and now i get a sync
 problem in the phone .. :<br />
Some files couldn't be synced, and were skipped. My Phone will attempt again during the next sync.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
is there anything i can do in order to restore my text messages back ?<br />
thanks in advance.

            Hi BlacKICce,<br />
<br />
Can you do a small test? go to the application access to the synchrinization options and unselect all types of data except SMSs.<br />
Then press sync. It should only&nbsp;sync SMSs. Can you check if you still have synchronization errors?<br />
<br />
Did the SMSs got restored to the phone? or at least some of them?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for using My Phone,<br />

            I have this exact same problem which, for me, also began after the beta version went live. &nbsp;I have the most recent version of MyPhone installed on my phone. &nbsp;Is it possible that, if something altered the threading on messages on the phone, that MyPhone
 somehow gets lost on future synchs?

<h2>            Outlook renames attachment, but why&#63;</h2>
                    In Outlook 2010 I compose a new email, attach a file that on disk is called CoMa.as and it appears as CoMa.as in the draft. But as soon as I send the email, I can see (and the receiver as well) that the filename is renamed to CoM_.as. Why is this?<br />

<br />
All tried, nothing helped. My best guess is that this renaming occurs due to the (very) old DOS reserved device called "COM1:" (serial port 1), "COM2:" (serial port 2). But that is only a poor excuse as files called com1.ext have always been legal. Only files/folders
 called "com1" were illegal/invalid (due to poor parsing by dos/windows, : is ignored in the filename before comparison which is stupid of course). Other filenames like "aux.txt" are also invalid/illegal.
<br />
<br />
But as the file "comb.txt" is legal, Outlook should NOT rename it.<br />

            <p>Hi - I have also seen this problem with any file type attachment that name conforms to the format "com?.???" - the filename can be any file type but must be 4 letters long and start with "com".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any update for this??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

Hi Nicholas, Excel shouldn't have a problem opening a big file. If you can send me the file, I'm more than happy to take a look. 16MB is too big for email - it would be great if you can post it somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How to use Direct Push and Myphone simultaneously&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to use Direct Push and Myphone simultaneously&#63; </h2>
                    Hello.<br />
I use Microsoft Direct Push on my HTC Touch HD to get the e-mails from Gmail immediatly on my phone via mail2web. For this purpose i use syncronasation with mobile.exchange.mail2web.com.
<br />
Now I wanna also use Myphone service. But Active Sync can be used for synchronasation only with 1 server. At least i didn't find how to sync in with mail2web and myphone at the same time.<br />
Both items are interesting and usefull for me. Are there any ways to use it simultaneously on my device while both demand using Active Sync?<br />
Thanks in advance.&nbsp; <br />

            I also use Mail2web. Unfortunately, MyPhone won't work on your device because you are already synchronizing with &nbsp;an Exchanger server and there is no workaround. Unless you give up on Mail2web and use MyPhone only. In which case you will lose the DirectPush
 functionality.

<p>For hiding photos or videos you could always use file manager such as Lonely Cat Games X-plore for S60 5th edition to change file attribute to hidden; you could also purchase software application such as Touch Hider to achieve the same result more easily.</p>

One example is Y-Browser (<a href="http://www.drjukka.com/YBrowser.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.drjukka.com/YBrowser.html</a>) and then set your files to "hidden".

            If you're interested in setting password to memory card, its preety easy, no apps needed whatsoever. In file manager go to memory card &gt;open &gt;options &gt;memory card password &gt;set.

            You can make your own custom themes, but its not that easy. Besides you need tools to do that. There are a number of sites that provide you services using which you can make themes. Just look around in internet.

<p>Hi Nam hai nguyen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be that most of the apps available from Windows Store supports Windows OS version 8.1 and 10. Also, most of the app makers have discontinued its support for Windows phone running OS version 7, because of availability and numbers
 of users having it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have more inquiries.</p>
