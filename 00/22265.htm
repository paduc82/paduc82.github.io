<h2>            WinMo 6.5 Tip&#58;  Speed up your phone by using the &#34;real&#34; WinMo interface</h2>
                    
<p>Did yo know that the UI that ships on most phones is really an app (a huge app) that hides the 'real' WinMo interface -- known as Titanium.</p>
<p>Titanium is sleek and efficient and modeled after the Zune and Windows Media Center.&nbsp; When phones from companies like HTC srrive this UI is hideen in favor of something really flashy with tons of eye candy.&nbsp; This looks better in stores and they hope it will
 sell more devices. These alternate UIs (such as Sense and TouchFlo)&nbsp; eat up lots of memory and cause your phone to drag.</p>
<p>Titanium is not customizible out of the box.&nbsp; You need a free app called home screen customizer.&nbsp; Find it in the marketplace.</p>
<p>I suggest you give it a try.&nbsp; IF you find it "boring" then you can also re-enable the 3rd party UI.</p>
<p>On my phone, I disable Sense by going to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Home &gt; Items. Then slecting "Windows Default" as the only item.</p>

            I ALWAYS disable the bloatware that is inserted by the manufacturer and the service provider. There is no need for it and I wish to High heaven there was a way to delete it from the phone completely. Unfortunately&nbsp;it is typically part of the rom and all
 providers state that messing with the rom will invalidate the warrenty. I especially wish things like Opera which Verizon installs were able to be removed in favor of the latest Opera browser. I use IE mostly but Ocasionally Opera is my choice.

<h2>            Tasks assigned to the wrong account in Outlook 2011</h2>
                    I was concerned that my newly created tasks were not appearing in my task list.&nbsp; However, i have since noticed that they have been assigned to the incorrect account (I have 2 email accounts setup in Outlook).&nbsp; I cannot find anywhere where i can change
 the default account setting for tasks (the correct email account is listed as the default account in Tools) or how to change the account that tasks have been assigned to - to bring them into my correct listing.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />

            <p>I don't think either of Joe's links have anything to do with the problem you asked about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in Mail view in Outlook, pay attention to which account is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in tasks, make sure the correct box for the account is checked in the left pane before you add a task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I don't care for having multiple accounts in a single identity for the very reason you are mentioning. It's too easy to have the wrong account selected when you add a task, calendar, event, note, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer to have separate identities for each email account. Click the New button to make a new identity. See:</p>

<h2>            Updates</h2>
                    <p>This continues to baffle me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If I have auto-update on, I am still prompted to install the updates. And, of course, I am prompted when I open a MS Office product - when I'm ready to dive into work and not wanting to be delayed by 10+ minutes for updates to happen prompting me to close
 all applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Similarly, when an office app crashes (often, I'm on a Mac so such as it is I guess)... the app to send feedback to MS (I'm forgetting the name right now) also crashes and I have to force quit that, in addition to the actual app I was using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to be frustrated by MS products but need to use them nonetheless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*This applies to all apps, but that was not a dropdown option below and I was forced to pick so I chose Word (another minor but annoying CX issue).</p>

<h2>            Have Office 365 and not new functions such as MAXIFS, TEXTJOIN, etc, etc</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason the installed version of Excel 2016 (Office 365 version) 64-bit does not seem to have the new Excel functions of MAXIFS, TEXTJOIN, etc, etc. This is in a corporate environment where have an Office 365 Enterprise E3 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically the version the IT team have installed on my machine is the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9233384e-9cdc-40e2-b16b-b7b5f79984c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9233384e-9cdc-40e2-b16b-b7b5f79984c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>From the About MS Excel dialogue box I can see the following in the top-left:</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel 2016 MSO (16.0.11126.20102) 64-bit</p>
<p>Product ID: 00339-23802-76147-AA014</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to everything I have read Build 11126.20188 should have the new functions, but it doesn't. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Chris W.</p>

            These functions are available only in Subscription version of Office. 
<br />
<br />If this is a subscription version, then Subscription Product comes written. If Product Activated is written, it means that this is not a Subscription version. The screenshot which you have posted has Product Activated written. This is a perpetual version i.e. payment is done in one go (till few years back all softwares were sold like this only). In Subscription version, either you pay Monthly or Yearly.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping, but I have finally figured it out and solved the problem. I'm posting my solution in case this happens to someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially when this computer was initially setup, the IT team installed the standalone 2016 version (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 as above). This was incorrect so they used a script to remove it and install the retail Office 365 version. By
 installing this version first it must have put some settings in the registry somewhere that the install of Office 365 did not overwrite by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was to click the button in the above screenshot labelled "Change License". This took me through the steps to change to a Subscription version (just needed to verify my office.com account) and after doing this I simply had to restart my Office
 applications to now see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/838a8ba8-7674-4360-9c2f-0760ef9fb425?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/838a8ba8-7674-4360-9c2f-0760ef9fb425?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So now all working as expected. It would be good for Microsoft to document this somewhere though, as it is very confusing that the Version and Build number can be the same but the features completely different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Chris W.</p>

<h2>            Newsletters that I didn&#39;t subscribe to on my Outlook.com</h2>
                    Last night when I was looking at my outlook.com account, I noticed that there is a lot of subscriptions newsletter that I didn't even subscribe to. I tried unsubscribing it using the outlook program, I got some of them out but most of them saying that
 the link is not working. I have set my account to be on the highest security and making sure that my account doesn't get hacked. I counted the all and I have over 75 different newsletters that just added to my subscription list without my knowledge. Is there
 a way for me to remove them and keep what I want on my subscription list?? I'm willing to share you the list that I have found and I would like to get rid of them.

            Hi airwolf,
<br />At this time, there is not a way to delete the spam subscriptions from the list. It's a work in progress though and that is one of the requests. 
<br />
<br />Do not click the links to go to any website if you did not sign up for newsletters or have a relationship with the vendor. That just validates your address is good. 
<br />
<br />They pull that list from information in mail headers that indicate it is a newsletter - unfortunately, it also includes spam.

<h2>            Windows 10 activation issue 0x803FA067 - Windows 10 Insider Build 17063</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After downloading and installing windows build17063, Windows now keeps asking me to activate windows and it shows error&nbsp;0x803FA067 while in the troubleshoot it shows 0xc004f012 and it says I have an invalid digital license.</p>
<p>I bought this laptop nearly 2 years ago with windows 10 already installed on it .</p>
<p>I had this issue before on one of the older windows builds and it was fixed by Microsoft customer support but I don't see this option anymore.</p>
<p>I haven't had any hardware changes at all on this laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still haven't tried to revert to the older build yet probably this weekend if I found no solution.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Andrey,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to sync files between OneDrive for Business library and SharePoint Online site library directly. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>You may consider syncing files from OneDrive for Business library to local first then sync them to SharePoint online site library. Or using Open with Explorer command to bulk copy and paste files from one location to another.</p>
<p>Here is an article about how to use Open with Explorer command: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-Copy-or-move-library-files-by-using-Open-with-Explorer-c27bc6f3-7b38-4c29-b947-5d00c7153384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Video: Copy or move library files by using Open with Explorer</a> Note: this command only works in IE browser.</p>
<p>You may also consider monitoring this thread. Hopefully other community members who have related experiences can share their ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Iris</p>

            <p>This error happens when one or both of the following conditions are present:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. PowerPoint has not been updated. There was a bug in some old builds of PowerPoint that caused this error. If you have that old build still installed, you will get this error. The cure is to update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open any Office application:</span></p>
<p><span>3. Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection</span></p>
<p><span>4. Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p><span>5. Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>
<p><span>6. Restart your Mac</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you saved your presentation using the bad build of PowerPoint, then the presentation is permanently messed up. You should start over with a new presentation (after you've updated PowerPoint to get rid of the bad build). If you have a backup of your
 presentation that did not have the problem, you can start with that file and go forward, but update PowerPoint before opening your backup.

Do let us know the result. Prior to the addition of "cleaning" of logs for MSE by ccleaner and advanced system care, the reinstall solution (well, workaround) was almost always successful for this situation.</p>

<h2>            how to pin a webpage to the startscreen</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Pin Web Page<br />

</p>
<p>When in Windows 8 and using Modern IE, I am able to pin a web page to the start screen.&nbsp; I can't seem to do this as IE only opens on the desktop.&nbsp; Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; That did work. But this sure seems like a lot of work to do something so simple.&nbsp; I would recommend that another choice be added of Pin To Start Screen.&nbsp; That would be the simple, easy and most obvious way to accomplish this task</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am installing Office 365 and was doing fine until it reached 94%. I am unable to repair from the control panel and unsure what else to do, unless it is supposed to take this long?</p>
<p>It's been on 94% for almost an hour.</p>
<p>Please help?</p>

            <p>No, it normally should NOT take over an hour if you have a reasonably high speed internet connection.&nbsp; Normally the initial part of the install process should only take a matter of minutes, followed by a slightly longer interval downloading in the background
 while you can already start using some of the applications.&nbsp; When 365 first came out MS had a series of videos showing what I call "stupid install stunts", doing Office 365 installs in stupid scenarios: parachuting, water skiing, race cars etc.&nbsp; But that all
 depends on a good clean internet connection. <br />
</p>
<p>There are various causes for this sort of "hang". Sorry, there is no one simple fix for the problem.</p>

I solved the problem myself by reloading the OS on the affected drive as several “trojans” had been put in my Windows 7 which, I think, caused the problem. Both the all-in-one printer and Windows 365 were affected suddenly after a threatening screen came up
 “screaming” at me to phone a specific number to dispose of my “bugs” by MS “experts” which, no doubt, had been put in deliberately by these extortionists in the hope they would be able to charge me a great deal for fixing the problem they had caused. It was
 time consuming but probably a good idea to reload the OS at times as I built the machine myself with two HDDs and it refreshes it although needing a great many updates to catch up to where it was originally.</p>

<h2>            OWA or Outlook for iOS, what do you recommend &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I would like to understand what is best choice in between OWA or Outlook for&nbsp;IOS for users on Ipad (sales rep)&nbsp;?</p>
<p>We have deployed OWA for IOS since a while now, but it seems that Outlook for IOS is updated more frequently and offers new possibilities not found in OWA.</p>
<p>So, my question is :</p>
<p>do you recomend we start to move our users from OWA to Outlook for IOS ?<br />
what is future for OWA app on IOS ? ( be replaced by Outlook for IOS, or not ?)</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help, and if you can provide links to some articles .....</p>

<p>Hi ALain,</p>
<p>For the question 1: <em>do you recomend we start to move our users from OWA to Outlook for IOS ?</em></p>
<p>Generally, there are two main applications people use their email with Office 365 in the Apple mobile devices, Outlook for IOS and OWA for IOS. I have done some research about the differences between them but found no official article about it.</p>
<p>However, based on my personal experience, when using Outlook for IOS, we can set other email accounts, such as Hotmail, Yahoo, Google accounts into it. It’s not feasible to use these kind of accounts in OWA for IOS. Also, there are some features supported
 in OWA for IOS but not in Outlook for IOS, such as accessing shared mailbox and online archive mailbox.</p>
<p>It’s recommended you refer to the articles below to find more information about the two applications and then decide which to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.office.com/2013/07/16/owa-for-iphone-and-owa-for-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA for iPhone and OWA for iPad</a>.<br />
<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/01/29/deeper-look-outlook-ios-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">A deeper look at Outlook for iOS and Android</a>.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the question 2: <em>what is future for OWA app on IOS ? ( be replaced by Outlook for IOS, or not ?)</em></p>
<p>We haven’t received relevant report regarding this, you can keep an eye on our
<a href="https://blogs.office.com/office365forbusiness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 for Business blog
</a>for updates of the information regarding this.</p>
<p>Feel free to post back for any further concerns.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Unfortunately it's not really helping me to take a decision :-)</p>

If you are "inserting" the file from the Insert tab &gt; Illustrations group &gt; Picture command ... click on the drop down of the insert and select "Insert and Link"</p>

<p>Not that is built-in in 2003, no.</p>
<p>You could always PDF the Word file, and then apply the PDF security setting of Not Allow Printing, among other options.</p>
<p>But please be aware, that when you send a document electronic, even PDF, there are ways and means, some easy - some harder, to remove protection and easily print out the document, a protected PDF can still be printed with "Print Screen".</p>

    <title>Error when attempting to open a form from VBA module called from - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error when attempting to open a form from VBA module called from Autoexec Macro</h2>
                    
<p>Access 2003 - I have an autoexec macro for my database, which launches a module to check the LoginID of the user when they open the database. That function is working fine.</p>
<p>What is failing on me is when I try to Open a Form from this module. I'm receiving a runtime error of 2001 and the message "you cancelled the previous operation".&nbsp; The logic of the code is to look up the corresponding LoginID in a table (that too is working
 fine) and based on the role that is read form the datbase record read (that works as well), the code determines which form to load.</p>
<p>I don't understand the cause or how to debug.</p>
<p>Here is the code snipet causing the error;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If rst!ResourceRole = "Manager" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frm_Manager", acNormal, , , , acWindowNormal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Found my own answer. The form had some residual code (form was copied from another form), which had an "On Open" event coded. Removed residual code and everyting works fine now.

            An anti-virus program alone <strong>does not provide comprehensive protection</strong> and cannot prevent, detect and remove all threats at any given time. Anti-virus and anti-malware programs each
<strong>perform different tasks</strong> as it relates to computer security and threat detection. Essentially, they look for and remove different types of malicious threats. However, there can be some overlap in functionality and detection features depending
 on the program's scanning engine, how the vendor defines a specific threat and what
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/malwarenaming.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>inherently reactive</strong>...meaning it usually finds malware after a computer has been infected. The security community is in a constant state of change as new infections appear and it takes time for them to be reported, samples collected, analyzed,
 and tested by anti-virus researchers before they can add a new threat to database definitions. Further, if you're dealing with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">zero-day malware</span></a> it's unlikely the anti-virus is going to detect anything.
<br />
<br />
In simplistic terms, <strong>Anti-virus programs</strong> generally scan for infectious malware which includes
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">viruses</span></a>,

<a href="http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-062614-1754-99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
<strong>Anti-malware programs</strong> generally tend to focus more on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
Therefore, <strong>you need both an anti-virus and an anti-malware solution for maximum protection</strong>.

            <p>You can set the header and footer margins in the <strong>Position</strong> group on the contextual
<strong>Header &amp; Footer Tools | Design</strong> tab that is displayed when you access the header by double-clicking in the header area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it is not likely that the footer margin is the problem. Rather, it may be the bottom margin you need to change. If you have the vertical ruler displayed, you can do this by dragging the margin marker on the ruler when the insertion point is in the document
 body. Or you can set an exact amount through the <strong>Page Setup</strong> dialog.</p>
<ol>
<li>The easiest way to access this is by double-clicking at the top of the horizontal ruler.</li><li>But you can also get there using the dialog launcher (tiny arrow) in the bottom right corner of the

<h2>            Advice structuring income&#47;expense for pivot table</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a pivot table/chart (using PowerPivot) to help me analyze my company income/expense. I took reports from my accounting software and created the following columns: revenue/spending category then column for each month (May09, June09...
 May11, June11). So each row in the sheet is a category and what was received (income) or spent (expense) going across.</p>
<p>This is all fine and good, but the problem is that when you create a pivot table from it, all you get are the months and no way to break it down.</p>
<p>What I'd like is to get to a point where in the pivot table I can pivot on income/expense categories by month/quarter/fiscal year. I expect some calculated columns will work, but can't seem to figure out how to break out the categories.</p>
<p>Any ideas/suggestions? I seriously doubt I'm the first one trying to do this...</p>

<p><br />
Some hints:<br />
- to leverage pivot you should NOT place each month as column in your data, but one column "month" you can group by (You can&nbsp;use excel feature "transpose" to convert your data from columns to rows)&nbsp;Then you can create additional powerpivot columns which year,quarter..
 or create a relationship with a separate timetable</p>
<p>- If a column contains values wich are a regular date (2011/10/7) you can right click this column in pivottable row/column and choose the "grouping" feature to get a date hierarchy (Year&gt;quarter&gt;month..)</p>

 frontend.

<p>You don't actually need to open a table, just initialize a database<br />
variable pointing to the back end. It's easier to open the table if<br />
you have linked tables, of course. </p>

<p>i checked and my other links are in the frontend. speed of other queries are ok. just for append query is very slow, it seems does not work.</p>
<p>append query is very important if it does not work , i don't know what i have to do? maybe unsplitting?</p>
<p>please help.</p>
<p>thanks in advanced</p>

<span>The shared folder there is in my computer so I made links from FE to BE locally something like "e\dcc\mydatabase.mdb" and for another users made map drive to my computer something like "Y:\mydatabase.mdb" now
 append query from my computer is working fine (speed is more than from network) because just I use append queries (before splitting also just myself from my computer I had to use that) and it was enough append query from just my computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>My question is with this way and these links it will working? It is normal? Or I will have some problem in future?</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks in advanced.</span></p>
