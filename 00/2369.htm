<h2>            Export contacts to vCard file</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>I am trying to help a friend export their contacts from their Windows Phone to a vCard file to be used in a new android phone. The problem is that we can't install the app contacts+messages backup because of an error (80073cfe) and exporting through outlook
 is not possible due to stupid language encoding messing up the names. </p>
<p>Is there any way of accessing contacts directly on the phone to be exported? Are there any programs that can extract contacts from the phone? Or can you make a backup of contacts in any other way than the aforementioned app? Or maybe there is a way of solving
 the problem without a reset as suggested <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/wpdp-wpupdate/error-while-updateing-or-downloading-app/bc3cd873-b4d5-45ae-951e-0953901131d4">

<p>Reset will wipe contacts from the phone but they will be restored automatically during the following setup if the same MS account is used as default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do not believe the app you cannot install will actually help achieve what you want:</p>
<p>
"Contacts + Message Backup app is a Settings app that enables you to make backup of all your contacts (in VCF format) and messages (SMS &amp; MMS including attachments) to SD card (in XML format) for later restore
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Contacts cannot be accessed directly from the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not aware of other programs which can extract contacts from the phone nor of any other way to make a backup of contacts.</p>
<p>
I would suggest persevering with extracting the contacts from the Outlook account. If you have any issues with that please seek assistance in the relevant forum of this community (Office &gt; Outlook &gt; etc.)<br />

</p><p>If that works, great. I personally did the export from Outlook to Gmail and it went fine. As I mentioned above, you can try a hard reset to get the app to install. The contacts should be restored back to the phone as explained and you can back them up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just not sure how transferring through a .vcf file will resolve the language encoding issues you mentioned - I'm not saying it will not, I just don't know.</p>

    <title>Deleting faulty email address from Outlook.com&#39;s memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greybird1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting faulty email address from Outlook.com&#39;s memory</h2>
                    After mis-addressing an outgoing email, it bounced back as undeliverable. No problem. But now, I can't find a way to delete that incorrect email address from the system memory. I can find no way to find, or access, a comprehensive list of "remembered"
 email addresses, and delete unwanted ones. My "contact" list seems not to be the same as the elusive list of auto-remembered email addresses, so that's no help. Any ideas?

            Following the link to "contact list management", and to "people", leads to a very short list of people I've emailed. The list is incomplete. The email addresses I wish to delete from the system, are not displayed.

    <title>Active Sync not responding to plugged in IPAQ device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darlene2k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Active Sync not responding to plugged in IPAQ device</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I have an IPAQ Pocket PC and initially the sync feature great with my (fairly new) Vista system. It began dropping the connections. And now it totally doesn't recognize any device connected. I get the audible tone when I plug and unplug, but the Mobile
 Device Center shows nothing connected. Further, the option to create a new connection isn't appearing in the menu.&nbsp; Only thing I have available is the Mobile Device Settings - which lets you choose if you want USB, Bluetooth etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've reinstalled the latest
 patch (6.1.6965) for the Mobile Device Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at my wits' end. This has been locked out for about 4 weeks now. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How can I disable the worst &#34;feature&#34; ever implemented&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreas van dem helge  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I disable the worst &#34;feature&#34; ever implemented&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The "Junk E-Mail" folder in Outlook indicates that "to help protect your personal information, this message has been converted to plain text. Links and other functionality have been disabled. To restore functionality, move this message to the Inbox."
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That sounds all fine and dandy and a great way to protect the many PC-wielding idiots int his world, however this is very poorly implemented. When you select to move the message to the Inbox it the message window closes and the message disappears. Sure,
 if you check your Junk E-Mail folder every 5 minutes you can move it and it will be right at the top of the Inbox, but if the message is a few hours, or God forbid a day or more, it just gets lost with all the mail in your Inbox.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Someone tell me how I can disable this "feature." I do not require protection from myself. Disabling the Junk E-Mail is not an option, as it would cause even more Inbox clutter.</p>

            Mark the message as unread before moving it and it should be easier to find. Better still make&nbsp; use of rules and sub folders to file your incoming messages to avoid storing everything in Inbox. Add the folders to Outlook Today or display the Navigation
 Pane and it is obvious which folders have unread messages.<br />

            <p>Create a 'holding' folder for messages like this and drag it to the holding folder to read it.
</p>
<p>Make sure you add the message's sender to the Safe list before moving it so they aren't moved to the junk folder. Don't use Not Junk command, use Never Block then move the message yourself. After a while, you'll have few good messages in the Junk folder.

            Dear Eliza,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This is a scam emails. Please do not click on any links there. If you use your account regularly it will not be deleted. When you will want to close it you will need to wait 60 days for it to be closed, If you will change your mind you just need to login to your account and process of closing will be stopped.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4.

<h2>            Facebook constantly not responding and lagging - Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Pro for&nbsp;2 days now and since then&nbsp;I have a problem with Microsoft Edge while browsing on Facebook. While scrolling it lags and shows that its not responding. Same problem is while typing, it lags and often is not responding, it's really
 annoying.</p>
<p>Is there a fix and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Man am I relieved someone else has the same problem, maybe they'll fix it faster that way. This doesn't help much, but for chat you can use Messenger.com, it lags less.

            I also face some lag while typing anywhere else, It doesn't happen much and it's not usually noticeable but I know it shouldn't be like this, because for example, typing on the twitter app is working swiftly.

<h2>            Datasheet view in form</h2>
                    Hi Friend,<br />
<br />
I am fairly new to Microsoft Access Forms. I will brief my trouble -<br />
<br />
It may seem too trivial, but, I need to develop master child form, where master as well as child sections are either datasheet type or tabular type.<br />
<br />
Is it possible?<br />
<br />
My table formats are -<br />
<br />
Master Table<br />
========<br />
tblHubData<br />
-------------<br />
HubID<br />
HubSize<br />
Location<br />
<br />
Child Table<br />
=======<br />
tblHubDetail<br />
--------------<br />
HubID<br />
LineID<br />
AssemblyType<br />
ScopeOfSupply<br />
Quantity<br />
<br />
I did received response from UtterAccess forum, but, being new to forms, I could not figure out the solution.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me.<br />
<br />

            Thanks for quick response.<br />
<br />
The first part is nicely taken care of.<br />
<br />
Second part is to have detail section that shows rows from child table tblHubDetail, that matches HubID of tblHubData, in datasheet view.<br />
<br />
In effect, I need master as well as detail table in datasheet view.<br />
<br />
How do I achieve this?<br />

<br />
You cannot do that in datasheet view, but it is possible with the form and subform in continuous forms view.&nbsp; This can be done in two ways:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Create the parent form in continuous forms view and give it a form footer section.&nbsp; Create the 'child' form also in continuous forms view, and then embed it in the form footer of the first form as a subform, linking them on HubID.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; A more flexible way, which allows more scope with the layout, is to embed both forms in an unbound parent form and correlate them.&nbsp; To do this the second subform is based on a query which references the HubID control of the first form as a parameter.&nbsp; The
 second subform is requeried in the Current event procedure of the first subform.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example of the second method, using data from Northwind, as CorrelatedSubs.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the information your provided, it should be an expected behavior for domain-joined laptops when accessing Skype for Business Online using external network, since the client cant resolve the .local domain which is hosted internally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the issue, may I know why you would like to set up the internal .local domain as the SIP address? Since usually we should use the public routable custom domain as the SIP address suffix. We can check if we have any alternate ways to fix the issue
 if you could share more details about the setup with us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can set the connection type to manually by referring to the following steps and check if the issue can be resolved:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Skype for Business client, click the <strong>setting icon</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Personal</strong> in the left panel. </li><li>Then click <strong>Advanced</strong> beside the sign-in address.</li><li>Select <strong>Manual Configuration</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>in the pop-up window and set both the
<strong>Internal server name</strong> and <strong>External server name</strong> to:<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>sipdir.online.lync.com:443</strong>.</li><li>Back to the main panel and check if it will sign in correctly.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo Yu</p>

<h2>            Misplaced sections not responding in iPhone, nowhere to be seen in webapp or desktop app</h2>
                    <p>I just reopened the webapp after a couple of days since working there and noticed a section missing from one of my notebooks, search doesn't find it. When I opened the iPhone app I found a notebook titled "Misplaced Sections" which has the correct page titles
 but the pages are empty despite the notebook claiming to have synced. I tried clicking "Edit" but the app won't let me select a page in order to move it. I tried my desktopo app and the section is missing from there as well as the webapp and neither has a
 "Misplaced Sections" notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to recover the pages?</p>

<h2>            SBS Style Sharepoint template</h2>
                    
<p>We have a customer using SBS 2008 and we are now making plans to migrate them to Office365.</p>
<p>One of the features they have made great use of in SBS is the 'Links' web part in Sharepoint on SBS. &nbsp;Staff members use a variety of web portals for their business and have found it useful to easily add links to the portals on the homepage of companyweb.</p>
<p>Is there a template available for Office 365 that will easily allow users to create links? &nbsp;I can see a way of doing it by editing a page, but it would be handy to have a direct way of adding a link as you can with companyweb on SBS.</p>

<p>hi inovix,</p>
<p>it is doable, in sharepoint online, to add an links app and then further add the app as an app part to the page. the users with permissions in the links list would be able to directly add new link to the web part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=76dfe1e9-b5b8-4fdf-8f84-7a3ce42c02d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d76dfe1e9-b5b8-4fdf-8f84-7a3ce42c02d7" /></a></p>
<p>please find the general steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. as the site admin or owner, go to your team site &gt; click the&nbsp; at the right-top, site contents &gt; add an app &gt; find the app of links &gt; follow the instructions to create the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. go back to the top-level site page &gt; click the&nbsp; at the right-top, edit page &gt; on the insert ribbon, app part &gt; find the app you just create to add to the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. you may further edit the web part to adjust how it displays on the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=66962be2-4843-4f82-8453-43f212bd34d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d66962be2-4843-4f82-8453-43f212bd34d9" /></a></p>

            I worked refactoring software for about 18 months and it's a totally thankless task. Like "agility" it sounds great in the boardroom until you have to start climbing into the minds of the original programmers and everyone who fixed or otherwise fiddled
 with it. I take my hat off to MS for even attempting it, and if they finish I'm hoping Windows will run like a streamlined tiger.&nbsp;

<p>When I run the O365 readiness tool on some of the clients in the site I get a message telling me that I don't have the latest version of Outlook and the minimum supported version is 14.0.7160.5000.&nbsp; While I am trying to get WSUS working is there a way to
 bring Outlook up to a supported version so that O365 will work OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">KB3085604&nbsp;</span>will bring Outlook up to 14.0.7160.5000 but is that enough or are there other updates which are required ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>My office recently upgrade to a cloud based network using Office 365 for Business.&nbsp; On the cloud server we use Outlook 2013.&nbsp; On my home computer I have an Office 365 Home subscription and use Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I noticed recently that many of my recurring all

<p>hi raymond,</p>
<p>regarding is there an easy way to convert these now recurring meetings back into recurring events, based on my test result, the answer is no, we are not able to convert recurring meetings back to recurring events. the recurring events can be easily converted
 to recurring meeting by inviting an attendee, but once the recurring events are converted to recurring meetings, we are not able to convert them back.</p>
<p>so, we have no choice but to cancel the meeting by right click the recurring meeting &gt; cancel meeting &gt; cancel series. after that, we can create a new recurring event.</p>

<h2>            MFA and Third party apps and Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<br />
I've enabled MFA con my account to perform some testing, in hopes of having everyone with MFA enabled. However, There are some things that I don't manage to completely understand or get working properly.<br />
<br />
As I see it right now, when I want to use Skype, Outlook(desktop), and some third party applications (blackberry work, for example) I have to use an application password instead of my password. What I don't understand is, How is this MFA? I am still only asked
 for my personal password when I login into this apps, unlike my office 365 which prompts me to allow or deny from my smartphone. So for all this applications I am still using Single factor Auth, but I am required to make an extra step to link the account.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, is there anything Im doing wrong? I don't believe this adds the security of MFA and its harder to push on people less familiarized with the platform.&nbsp;<br />
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hi Luis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I ask you have enabled Modern Authentication in your tenant? If not, it requires additional configurations to let your Outlook and Skype for Business client be able to open the MFA prompt.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable Modern Authentication in Exchange online:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-or-disable-modern-authentication-in-exchange-online-58018196-f918-49cd-8238-56f57f38d662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable Modern Authentication in Skype for Business online:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there are some limits to the apps: Modern Authentication is automatically integrated with Office 2016 apps, but with Office 2013 you need additional configuration steps:

    <title>Public docx with custom dotx on network share - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pocketnerd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Public docx with custom dotx on network share</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We create word 2010 documents and publish them to our customers using SharePoint 2010. The templates (dotx) used to create the documents are on a share drive within the company e.g
\\ourserver\ourdrive\.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a customer tries to open a document, Word tries to download the dotx to update the styles but obviously this network location isn't available to the customer and it can take several minutes to eventually fail to download and open the document anyway.
 We can host the dotx on a website and link to that, but even in this case the user has to be on a network with web access to enable the dotx to be downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a setting in Word or the docx / dotx that will prevent it from trying to be downloaded? How does everybody else do this - create documents from an internal template that are sent to or shared with customers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help on this as i'm not getting much from Google!</p>

            Before you post a document for customer access, open it and go to the Developer tab, click the Document Template button, and attach Normal.dotm in place of the original .dotx. Make sure the "Automatically update document styles" box is NOT checked. Click
 OK and save the document.<br />
<br />
When a customer downloads the document, Word will attach their local Normal.dotm template without the delay.<br />
<br />
As long as the automatic update is turned off, the change of templates will have no effect on any styles in the document (ref.

            <p>Thanks for reply Daniel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp; not a wiz when it comes to pictures but I like to watermark mine or have it look like a watermark, on my Win 7 computer I have excel and powerpoint, I remembered doing something like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not trying to insert a picture, I just want to watermark photos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So not to confuse with Win 8, I went to other computer and played with excel, the 3D text, reflection&nbsp; but it's a bit time consuming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just easier to make a look alike in paint but I'd rather not use that</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping Office 365 had this, I don't understand why not,&nbsp;&nbsp;something like an improved paint, it should be included for the monthly rental.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if I will keep up this subscription on my Win 8 computer, I&nbsp; know its not you and I really appreciate your help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>BTW &nbsp;I also have&nbsp; and older version 8.5</u> of works this program did&nbsp; have excel,&nbsp; word processor, database,&nbsp;spreadsheets, calendar &nbsp;but I never used excel with this program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the photo in excel with the watermark look alike</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I right click and there is no option to save as .jpg etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click the copy from the home tab, then the paste special, then click jpeg, after that there is nothing telling me to save as filename to this place</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try again,&nbsp; see paste as picture, the fake watermark I created does not come over with picture, &nbsp;I was doing this in paint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not understanding somewhere here, inst from help with excel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <b>Home</b> tab, in the <b>Clipboard</b> group, click the arrow under
<b>Paste</b>, and then click <b>Paste Special</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Paste Special</b> dialog box, in the <b>As</b> list, click
<b>Picture (GIF)</b>, <b>Picture (PNG)</b>, or <b>
Picture (JPEG)</b>.</li><li>Right-click the graphic, and then click <b>Save as Picture</b>.</li><li>Type a name for your graphic file, browse to the location where you want to save the file, and then click
<b>Save</b>.</li></ol>

<p>We appreciate your response. We would need to clarify if you are trying to delete the conversation history from the Outlook web (Outlook.com) or the Outlook desktop app (Outlook 2010). If you are using Outlook 2010, the conversation in Skype will be automatically
 deleted after approximately 48 hours. To be able to manually delete the conversation history in Outlook, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch Outlook.</li><li>Go to the Conversation History folder.</li><li>Using the Search box, type the name of the contact that you want to delete the conversation that you had with.</li><li>From the search results, right-click the conversation history and then choose Delete.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you'll need further assistance. </p>

<p>We appreciate your response. Deleting a conversation history in Outlook.com requires the same steps that we provided. The only difference is that you have to log in to your Outlook.com account and then follow the steps from 2 to 4 to successfully delete
 the conversation history.</p>
