            Hardware mftrs. are responsible for writing drivers for their products for particular operating systems. In the case of proprietary hardware such as is used on OEM machines like Toshiba, the source for drivers would be Toshiba. You can look on Realtek's
 site and try some drivers from there as a last resort but usually the hardware is proprietary for the OEM.<br />
<br />
You can try the drivers from Toshiba for Vista and sometimes even from XP, but if they don't work then you are out of luck. Contact Toshiba and see if they have any plans to offer drivers for this hardware for Win7.

    <title>Windows security pop-ups after network connection changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristinmaree  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows security pop-ups after network connection changes</h2>
                    After making some changes to the LAN settings a 'Windows Security' dialogue box opens after I perform basically any function, specifically in Itunes. Eg., I click on a new song and a pop-up reads: "The server web-cache-ext****** requires a username and
 password." Along with a warning that this information will be sent in an insecure manner. Exiting out of the box doesn't work and it pops up a further 3 times, then I try and do something else and it comes up again. The same occurs in Media Player&nbsp;<br />
The changes I made to LAN include setting up a VPN for uni (which I'm not currently connected to) but also some other network/wireless related changes in an attempt to get this sorted. &nbsp;<br />
The internet is fine, as is normal documents and my computer functions. None of the troublshooting options could provide any answers...<br />
<br />
Any ideas?&nbsp;

</span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts
<span>Windows</span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start
<span>Windows</span> are installed.</span></p>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2</strong> : Perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div><br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Follow&nbsp; step 7 to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.

<h2>            I recently had a program &#40;Axis and Allies&#41; that runs in windows 95&#47;98 stop working.</h2>
                    <p>I have had many problems but I think they are working themselves out. I finally got to where I could update things (the blue dots in the update area are gone), All the things in the notification area are showing, and all the words and tiles in the app area
 are there. I am still trying to get one app but I have somethings I need to do first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had a program (Axis and Allies) that runs in windows 95/98 stop working. It was working but then it didn't respond. I couldn't do anything. I then did the control-alt-delete and asked for the task manager. The task manager said it was there but
 I couldn't get to see it. I had the task bar (at the bottom that shows running programs). I then right clicked and said close. Nothing happened. I had to bit the bullet and to to restart. I then was told that there were some programs running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use old programs and I expect them to do this from time to time (they even did it in windows 98). I don't like the "let's see if we can fix it" window. I have had this in another program and when I hit cancel, it kept the program running instead of turning
 it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do (other than not run this program)?</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to Uninstall and reinstall the program and check if it helps
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>
<strong>Disable Anti-virus software. <br />
</strong>The issue may also arise due to the security software installed in your system. So, I would suggest you to disable the anti-virus installed on your system and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Place your computer in clean boot state and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article
 mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></p>

            Thank you for replying to my problem. When i try to log in to live on&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;flight [the free one] it brings up a small window saying that i need to put a product key in but there is one in. So i hit agree and submit. It starts to load then it says
 that "the product key you provided has&nbsp;already been&nbsp;registered to another live profile. please enter a valid product key or go back and choose a&nbsp;different windows live ID." It&nbsp;doesn't seem to be a error&nbsp;message&nbsp;or any thing like that. I could not get into
 my rexman61 yahoo account to buy content for the game. so i changed&nbsp;everything&nbsp;over to a&nbsp;different account named jamesdillon1125 but the thing is i played the game before i did this action. Now when i try to get on live it must have the product key for the
 rexman61 account and not for the jamesdillon1125 account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello requires an Intel RealSense camera for facial recognition to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For options and recommendations of which devices or models are compatible with Window Hello facial recognition, we suggest contacting the device manufacturer since they have more information about devices that use an Intel RealSense camera.</p>

</p><p>Some things I delete and within seconds it's back. Sometimes it returns at the next start, and some things won't let me touch it. Furthermore, some of the things I have been able to delete results in the provider (MS, HP, Intel, etc.) constantly connecting
 with me, which I can't or don't know how to stop, slowing the computer down. The event logs from computer management are non-stop log ins and special log-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need or want office, xbox, Cortina, the cloud, tablet, touch screen, the POS touch pad that has cost me hours of work from an inadvertent touch at the wrong time and I use a mouse to limit touching the computers--oil and grease--, 3 different print
 controllers, 3 different wi fi controllers, quick access, one drive, HP radio service, HP update service (their updates have always been unnecessary or for their benefit). Jesus I could go on and on but 2 of the worst are Norton and Mcaffee. One came with
 the computer and the other I use to use and I've been told once you have them, you have them. I want a firewall that lets me choose who can and can't "impersonate." I don't want any automatic updates. Twice they have stopped my needed software from working.
 The diagnostic software is controlled by a separate program that controls the updates I do want, online conferences, online support by accessing a vehicles information and more. Apparently if someone's update doesn't recognize what's going on, it has to fix
 it. Actually I think the "someone" is more interested in what benefits them rather than me. I don't know why computers aren't handed out now. We buy them but we don't own them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could keep going but I hope I've explained the problems and what I'm after. Is there anyplace that can give me a computer that will work the way I want it to work? A computer I actually own. I've also found the "needed for security" arguments specious,
 pretentious and arrogant. Everyone I know that has had a serious security issue had the problem because of poor security from the likes of MS, Yahoo or Experian. Yet these same "people" talk to us like we're the security risk, not them. We are soon going to
 need to maintain an unsecure hard copy log of information like passwords for the computer. There is no way I can remember the number of passwords I have to have as it is now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. BTW, I have to use windows. I am willing to buy another computer if that's what's required.</p>

<p>I appreciate that but all the Bosch designed systems were written for windows. That goes back to the mid 90's and many people swore sticking with windows was a mistake. With the future in autonomous driving getting closer I suspect an operating system will
 be developed that will be dedicated to the transportation industry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to think of, "People like me," because the extent of complaints is vast and it's not limited to my field. The last thing that should stand out on a business computer is the operating system but that's what it's all about. Professional versions
 are no different per MS. They just aren't as over the top with the hokey nonsense. When something like Cortina becomes integral instead of an add on, someone is missing the entire point of how those that can't work in jeans and tee's use a computer. They're
 tools, not a friend. Actually they are more toy then tool now.</p>

"People like me," were treated to this today. Didn't ask for it. Didn't want it. Using a metered connection has no meaning anymore. All my settings were discarded for MS defaults. The tracking protection add-ons are not accessable with this update. They are
 either unavailable or selecting them doesn't initiate a response. <br />
This is not my first attempt at posting this. Background activity is still going on that initiates a "refresh" like action that results in what I've written being gone and logging in again being necessary.
<br />
In the following I'm really impressed by "force" or "forced" being reqired,&nbsp; or "this action is marked to ignore errors" or "Ignore privacy settings, errors assumed."<br />
Finally, the dates in the event viewer are todays but when the log copy comes from the copy action in "Computer Management" the date becomes August 3rd.What's that about?
<br />
What are people like me suppose to think of this "nonsense?" I don't have any idea of what is going on but I'm confident of this, the issues with hacking and security haven't blossomed from those of us that have been fortunate enough to be allowed to purchase
 a computer and maintain it for the pleasure of MS, HP, Intel or whoever else is broken enough to blur the difference between arrogance and benevolence.

<h3> normandowner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows Movie Maker 2012 as part of Windows Essentials &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    I have no elements of Windows Essentials on my computer, and no traces, yet, each time I try to download Movie Maker as part of the Essentials, the box tells me that I have One Drive, Mail, Writer, Messenger, Photo Gallery and Movie Maker!&nbsp; I have checked
 the computer additionally with Iobit Uninstaller and&nbsp; Bulk **** Uninstaller, and there's nothing there!&nbsp; I have also checked the AMD and virtually everything else that could prevent the download.&nbsp; My PC is a 6 months old HP desktop and I have no problems downloading
 anything except Movie Maker.&nbsp; Some assistance would be gratefully appreciated.

            Hi Arun - many thanks for your reply and apologies for not getting back to you sooner.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the links you provided are exactly the way I've been trying to download Movie Maker!&nbsp; As I said originally, I have no components of Microsoft Essentials
 on my computer, and never have!&nbsp; Despite knowing this, I have searched thoroughly for any/all of them, and none of them are there; yet, whenever I go to download Movie Maker via the Microsoft Essentials link, the box tells me that they are all already installed,
 with the exception of Microsoft OneDrive which has a ticked box.&nbsp; I am at a lot as to know what to do next as, try as I will, I cannot download Movie Maker!

<p>If it does not work, try the following suggestions by Rob Brown MS-MVP</p>
<p>Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown continue below.<br />

Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.</p>

<p>At one point, HP sold printers with a "smart install" capability that involved a small program in the printer's firmware that "phoned home" to the HP servers, automatically downloaded the correct software for your printer and your version of Windows, and
 installed the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it, when you first connected a printer with this feature, the printer was detected as a mass storage device and when you looked in "Computer," you would see an HP disk.&nbsp; When you double-clicked on that disk, the installation would start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, HP discontinued that program and disconnected the servers to which such printers connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Disconnect the printer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the Windows Logo key and E simultaneously and confirm that there is no "HP" disk.</li><li>Open Devices and printers.&nbsp; If there is an icon for your Laserjet 1007, right-click and select "Remove device.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Go here and download the "HP LaserJet P1000-P1500 Hostbased Plug and Play Basic Driver" for Windows 7 x64 --

https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/swdetails/hp-laserjet-p1007-printer/3435678/swItemId/bi-55362-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Install the printer using these instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Close any software programs running on your computer.</span></li><li><span>Double click on the downloaded file. The self-extracting process will appear.</span></li><li><span>Click to accept the terms in the license agreement. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Driver installation begins. Driver files are pre-installed during this process.</span></li><li><span>A screen pops up to prompt to connect the USB cable. Insert the USB cable.</span></li><li><span>Device is connected, waiting for PnP to finish installing driver.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Finish</strong> to complete software installation. </span>

<h2>            PC Not  W10&#58;  WANT FLAC&#33; FLac do I rip to  WAV  Lossless  or WMA Lossless and then convert&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It appears that I can't directly rip new CD's to FLAC, rather than MP3 best quality&nbsp;is 320 Kbps</p>
<p>
</p><p>I I can use on online converter to convert&nbsp; the &nbsp;ripped music to FLAC</p>
<p>WMP is giving me&nbsp; TWO options </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WMA lossless quality&nbsp;&nbsp;is 470- 940&nbsp;Kbps </strong></p>
<p><strong>WAV lossless&nbsp; quality&nbsp;&nbsp;is 1411.2 Kbps</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As above my paygrade&nbsp; it appears that WAV is the better option&nbsp;? does it really matter as both are superior to the 320kbps.</p>
<p>

<br />You can always rip a song using each choice &amp; see if there’s a difference in audio quality.

</p><p>When I turn on the privacy settings for mail and calendar Windows 10 mail works just fine--when I turn them off Windows 10 Mail no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have almost all of my privacy settings turned off because I do not want Microsoft collecting information on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Essentials does not show as an installed program so I am unable to uninstall them. &nbsp;However, when I try to install the programs the installer states that they are already instanne and stops te installation process.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for updating us with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that to access apps you need to turn on the Privacy settings. without turning on the privacy settings you wont be able to use apps full functionally. Microsoft doesn't collect your personal and sensitive information.&nbsp; Information
 which are required for the process are only collected. So I suggest you not to turn off your privacy settings as it will prevent you from using your apps properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And related to Windows Essential, just to double check if we are going in the right direction, I suggest you to type Windows Essential in the search bar and check if its present on your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status if the issue. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are no elements of Windows Live programs on my C drive that I can find in Common or Program files or Old files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still cannot get the offline installer to work--states the programs are already installed.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Mouse 3500 problem on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop is&nbsp; Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga and as default using Windows 8.1 64 bit Single Language.&nbsp; I'm using microsoft wireless mobile mouse 3500 as primary pointing device. At first it's work normally but about these three weeks some error happened when I use
 these mouse. The problem are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The taskbar suddenly cannot be clicked, so I can't click the start button, switching between application or even to activate notification area with the mouse, touchpad or&nbsp; track point and even several touchscreen action can't work.<br />
</li><li>When I click on the active application , but the application precisely become inactive.</li><li>All Pointing device cannot work in metro mode application</li></ul>
<p>I've to restart the windows and use another mouse or unplug external pointing device to make all work normal again</p>
<p>It's all doesn't happen when I use another "wired"/wireless mouse brand. </p>
<p>The mouse is working good on my another laptop which using Vista 32 bit home premium or desktop PC, and I really love microsoft mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restore the system to factory default and install MouseKeyboad Cetnter but the problem is still happened and It's really disturbing me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe somebody can help me to solve this problem?</p>
<p>Is the microsoft mouse 3500 compatible with windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>What an uninformed answer. First no CD comes with this mouse. Second, the person is running Win8.1 not Windows 7. I am looking for help with this stupid non-functioning mouse also, so thanks for nothing.

<h2>            Trojan wiped my digital license for free Windows 10 upgrade - now what&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop that came with Windows 7 Pro. I took advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10. Had I known this was important, I would have written down the digital license number, but it never occurred to me. A Trojan hit my laptop from an email account
 inside Outlook. After the cleanup, Windows 10 now wants activation. But I don't know how to do that since this was the free upgrade.&nbsp; What now?</p>

            Hi Erin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is no number or key for the Digital License, it is a profile of your hardware stored in Microsoft Activation Servers that it compares whenever you reinstall or change hardware to reactivate.  
<br />
<br />What is the Activation status and Edition showing now in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?    Run the troubleshooter there and report back what it reports.  
<br />
<br />Did you input any other product key into Activation settings as this will mess them up.  
<br />
<br />Do you have the old Windows 7 Product key from retail packaging or the sticker affixed to the PC that's still readable?   You can try that key to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If not the only key that can be present to activate a DL is the Generic Product Key:

<br />
<br />Please reply to everything i asked to continue.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>The oddest thing - while I was posting this, a Windows Update started. When it was done, the system was no longer asking me to activate it. It no longer tells me I cannot make this or that "customization" (I was trying to lower the volume) until I activate
 and get a proper license. I am once again fully activated and I'm not sure how it happened - but I suspect it had something to do with the Windows Update.&nbsp; Thank you Greg for your quick reply, but it looks like my operating system healed itself!&nbsp;</p>

            Glad to hear it, Erin.  
<br />
<br />They often push out fixes for what Updates break shortly thereafter.  Such is life with Windows 10.

<br />Let me know if you need anything else.

            Hello RITABARNARD,
<br />
<br />Open Cortana by pressing Windows Key + Q.
<br />Type in "printer."
<br />Select Printers &amp; Scanners.
<br />Turn on the printer.
<br />Refer to the manual to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. Unfortunately, this process varies not just from manufacturer to manufacturer, but often from printer to printer.
<br />Hit Add a printer or scanner.
<br />Select the printer from the results.
<br />Click Add device.
<br />You should be now good to go.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day       
        </p>

<br />Usually you run the setup CD &amp; when it comes to choosing USB or wifi you pick wifi &amp; then enter the router’s SSID &amp; passphrase.
<br />However upon the first setup you have to use USB to download drivers &amp; updated software.
