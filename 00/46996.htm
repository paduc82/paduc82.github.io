            If you are talking about a <strong>BIOS level</strong> password (you are required to enter a password as soon as you turn the computer on) then you will need to reset the BIOS to default to clear any passwords. Follow the instructions here:<br />

If you are talking about a <strong>Windows</strong> password, then use NTpasswd to clear passwords from the built-in Administrator or any other administrative user account.

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in previous versions of Windows you can make your own theme and select the images to include it in, the screen saver, the colour of windows and the sounds. It was great.&nbsp;<a href="http://postimg.org/image/abzej4hp1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here
 is what I am looking for</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after upgrading to Windows 10, I see that feature missing?! Is there something that needs to be enabled or am I just looking in the wrong place? Or has microsoft removed the feature :( ?&nbsp;<a href="http://postimg.org/image/olcfahyu3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">In

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community - let's see if starting with the Settings app (rather than the Control Panel) begins to address your questions. Some links below will lead you back to the Control Panel personalization view, some will not.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On the Start Menu - select Settings (or in the Action Center - select All Settings)</li><li>In the Settings app - select Personalization
<ul>
<li>The Desktop Slideshow is available under Background</li><li>The Windows Color is under Colors</li><li>The Sounds can be reached through Themes - Advanced sound settings</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>As you begin to change the options there should be an Unsaved Theme that you can rename.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>All brightness settings are completely gone in new windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spydercrawler  say:</h3>
<h2>            All brightness settings are completely gone in new windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just got a new windows update after delaying getting it for a few days, and found that for some reason my brightness is much lower than it was before the update. This made my desktop background and many themes I was using in many applications look much
 worse, so I looked for a way to change it. Unfortunately, the brightness setting in action center, the brightness slider in power options, and the brightness setting in the system display settings in the settings app all appear to be completely gone. With
 the lack of all three of these, I appear to be completely unable to change my screen brightness. Is there any way to restore these buttons or any other way to change my screen brightness?</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            MSN apps not working after upgrading to WIndows 10</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original Title:</strong></em> Windows live tiles don't work and Store APP too
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Four weeks ago I was able to install Windows 10 on my ASUS laptop via a prearranged download session. All went well, however, 3 MSN APPs don't seem to work very well or at all.&nbsp; I've tried all the suggestions I have found on this forum. Some of the discussions
 are hard to follow, none don't seem to resolve the issue. Some tips and/or suggestions are for advanced users and PC knowledgeable persons. I'm thinking many folks are frustrated about not being able to use Windows 10 APPs as intended. I know I am totally
 dismayed as I like the weather and sports as hobbies and entertainment. As when you buy a new car, you want to know how and why things work, OR you just want them to work as intended - not the case with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't received very good support from the MSN people, so I go here looking for insight. I have been told that my PC may have a corrupted WindowsAPP folder, and there is a fix but wanted some input from others.</p>

<h2>            How to get rid of Chinese WIN10</h2>
                    My Surface Pro 3 finally died the other day. It appears to be unable to see its internal drive and simply stops during boot at the logo. Any attempt to boot for the USB&nbsp;fails as it says there is no device (probably as a result of dropping the machine some
 6 months ago). &nbsp;I gave up and bought a second hand Pro 4. I tested the machine before I bought it and all seemed good (it was difficult to tell because the computer was in Chinese). I should mention I live thousands of miles from any Microsoft store in a country
 with terrible Internet (Myanmar). I copied down a copy of Windows 10 to USB and started a fresh install. This repeatedly failed as it said it did not have a needed media driver. I copied all of the surface pro 4 drivers and put them on a stick and when the
 installation as for them I browsed to the directory but the installation kept saying it could find no driver and refusing to proceed.&nbsp; I them copied down the recovery image from the net despite 10 failed copies

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The situation you're currently in is quite tedious, especially that the Surface Pro 4 that you bought was previously owned by someone else. We are not quite sure what or where it was originally purchased, so basically if it was bought in the Chinese region
 the default language would be in Chinese and one way to change the display language is to install a language pack that you prefer. In order to do this you need to be familiar with the icons that you need to click on in order to get to the point where you can
 download and install the preferred language pack. You may follow Charlene Gal's reply on this Community link:

<p>perhaps, the folder is too big.&nbsp; you might try simply copying the individual files over to the cd without creating a subfolder on it.</p>
<p>however, you might also try using an enhanced utility for making cd's like nero.&nbsp; it can give you more information and helpful tools not provided in xp.</p>

<p>thank you for your reply. No, it's not the folder too big, I can't move even one file. I do have nero but&nbsp;I can't copy the files. I tried nero but I get a message saying it has encountered a problem and needs to close. I cannot send a file or folder anywhere
 or copy to somewhere. This has only happened recently, I had no problem copying a few photos to a cd before. I even tried making a new folder in (E) CD drive thinking I could send the files over one by one but that said 'unable to create the folder&nbsp; File system
 error (16389)'</p>
<p>I tried doing a full antivirus scan and did find some malware, which I cleaned off, rebooted and I still have same problem. I would consider system restore but then I would probably lose the files I had just uploaded as I can't copy them (they were from
 my phone and I deleted them from my phone because I had safely uploaded them) but cannot then guarantee it would fix the problem anyway. Oh My Gosh.</p>

<p>E: is your optical disk drive, correct?&nbsp; Make sure that it has a recordable CD in it (of a format compatible with your drive's hardware) and NOT a DVD of any type.</p>
<p>When you write, "I cannot send a file or folder anywhere or copy to somewhere" do you mean that you can't copy a file from one folder on your hard drive to another folder on the hard drive?&nbsp; Or do you mean that you can't copy files to your CD drive?</p>
<p>What does Device Manager have to say about your CD drive (right-click My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Hardware &gt; Device Manager)?</p>
<p>Open My Computer &gt; Right click on the icon for your CD drive &gt; Properties &gt; Recording tab.&nbsp; What's there?</p>

            Hello, I understand that you are having some issues with the new version of Windows 10 1809. Since this update is very new, there may be some incompatibility with some computers. You may need to rollback the update until Microsoft releases a new patch for the update. Go to Windows settings and click on recovery. Find "Go back to previous version of Windows 10", and click on get started. Follow the instructions and continue with the downgrade. If the problem persists even after downgrading, please let me know as soon as possible!
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know on the status!

            If this is a showstopper, you can choose to go back to previous build also. (Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Go back to previus Build). But I would recommend that if this is the only problem you are facing, you should stay put as in subsequent patches, it would be corrected.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend that you submit this issue as a feedback to Windows team through Feedback Hub

            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />It sounds like either your Windows 10 is not activated or you are being signed into a Temporary profile each time you log in . . .
<br />
<br />Are you able to make changes to a file on your PC and when you restart, are the changes still there?
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation. Is Windows showing as activated?
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type cmd and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />whoami
<br />
<br />Is the returned value your correct login name?

<p>
</p><p>we have BitLocker with Network Unlock in Place. Everything is working fine (with Lenovo &amp; Fujitsu devices).</p>
<p>We have Surface Pro 4 devices as well and unfortunately they're not working (same Setup, same Policies). When booting up, we have to enter the Bitlocker PIN.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what UEFI/BIOS Settings the Surface Pro 4 needs, to get the Network Unlock feature working?</p>

            <p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question. It looks like you are facing issues installing silverlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silverlight is a powerful development tool for creating engaging, interactive user experiences for Web and mobile applications. Silverlight is a free plug-in, powered by the .NET framework and compatible with multiple browsers, devices and operating systems,
 bringing a new level of interactivity wherever the Web works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&nbsp;doesn't &nbsp;come pre-loaded with Windows Vista. We need to install it if a particular application needs it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer these questions which would help us to provide a better solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What exactly happens when you try to install Silverlight?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

            When I bring up lusrmgr, the left panel shows "Local Users and Groups (Local)", but the center panel says "This snapin may not be used with this edition of Windows 8. To manage user accounts for this computer, use the User Accounts tool in the Control
 Panel."<br />
<br />
But the User Accounts tool does not show the account "Mary". Only the Family Safety tool shows it.<br />
<br />
I imagine this partial account is leftover from my earlier attempts to set up an account to connect with a Vista machine. I could always set up a "Mary2" account, but I need to use the exact same name/password for the connection.<br />
<br />
Barring any other ideas, I suppose I'll have to resort to a complete reset and start over.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            MPSA pricing for PSTN Conferencing</h2>
                    When will PSTN Conferencing be available to be&nbsp;purchased through MPSA for LSPs, like SHI?&nbsp; Now that the O365 &nbsp;EA min seat count has changed to Qty 500, that greatly effects SMBs looking to purchase E3 with Add-ons. I thought it was to available for purchase
 under MPSA starting July 1, 2016. Please advise.

</p><p><strong><em>THE GOOD&nbsp; NEWS</em></strong>, Computer seems to run fine! my total failures &nbsp;last month were around 18000 errors and critical but when I click "Event log online" never shows a resolution. always state nothing available. The only change to the
 system after the update was enabling all the window logs. When these errors are submitted to MSFT, I never receive anything via the action center and the number of solutions are 0. Concern is the amount of errors and this being a new computer. Critical errors
 are at times as high as 50-200 per week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularly do defrag, have done several diagnostics on the mem, hdd, and hardware through the vendors built in assist options with no errors. MY MAIN CONCERN: Was using VS Pro 2013 from school that was to have a year license. It crashed today, and now it
 states the license expired (after 2 months) Hence my concerns..</p>
<p>
</p><p>will appreciate any help/advice and were I can get a c++ compiler. Also software installs are limited to Office 365,visual studio express, AVG virus, and was unable to install MSFT essentials and no use of defender. I am hoping I don't have to do a complete
 restore,Unfortunately midterms are around the corner.</p>
<p>

            <p><strong>You need a user account to use Windows,</strong> and <strong>if you share a single PC with other people</strong>, each person should have their own account. Each person can customize their account with their own settings and preferences, like a desktop
 background or screen saver. User accounts also help control which files and apps each person can use and what changes they can make to the PC.

<h2>            Skype crashes on calling&#47;receiving video call</h2>
                    Hi! I am using Skype 12.1815.209.0 on Windows 10. Every time I make a video call Skype just goes to the background. I can only have options "end the call" and "mute the call". I can hear the other person and he/she can hear me, but no video. Please help.
 I need Skype for my job. :(

            <p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, you need to use a password. Your password helps keep your account secure, no matter what PC you sign in to or what apps, settings, and services you use while you're signed in. If you don't want to enter
 your password every time you sign in, you can create other sign-in options to use with your account, like a picture password or a PIN. If your PC has a fingerprint scanner, you can also sign in with a fingerprint.</p>
<p>If you sign in to Windows with a local account, you can choose not to enter a password. However, we don't recommend this—it's the least secure way to sign in to your PC. You can also switch a Microsoft account to a local account, but you can't use a local
 account to download apps from the Windows Store or sync settings online. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any Windows related queries in the future, let us know. We will be glad to help.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>a <span style="font-style: italic">program</span>, part of Microsoft Office (usually further identified by a year of release, like Outlook 2013);&nbsp;</li><li>an <span style="font-style: italic">app</span> available for most mobile devices and included in Windows 10 Mobile;<br />
</li><li>a <span style="font-style: italic">webmail service </span>once known as (Windows Live) Hotmail, later as Outlook.com and most recently as Outlook Mail or even simply Outlook.</li></ul>

Bearing this in mind, can you please explain what you mean when you <em>sign in to Outlook</em>?</span></p>

                    Is there a RT application that allows a person to sign a PDF document in a field designed for signatures? PDF Expert for the IPad allows for this action to occur but the only application I have found thus far is Reader&nbsp;for RT&nbsp;and when I click the signature
 field it simply tells me "Customer Authorized Signature" in hover like words.

<h2>            Network Controller missing Driver Windows Vista</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>My old Dell Inspiron 3520 had a broken hard drive, so I bought a new one. I downloaded Windows Vista Ultimate on it, but I couldn't connent to internet. I downloaded some drivers, and I can now connect to ethernet cables. I still can't connect to wifi. I
 have service pack 2. When I looked under device manager, the network adapter was fine. The Network Controller and the SM Bus Controller had no drivers. I tried to install them, but it said there were no compatible drivers. The weird thing is, when I did this
 before (computer was wiped), the wifi worked. Please help. If any more info is needed, say so. My adapter was realtek, if that helps. Also, my wifi is turned on. The wifi light never turns on with "Fn + F2".</p>

<h3> domajazz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pandigital Photolink One-Touch PANSCN04 5-Inch x 7-Inch Photo Scanner</h2>
                    I just purchased a

<span>Pandigital Photolink One-Touch PANSCN04 5-Inch x 7-Inch Photo Scanner.</span>
<p><span>I can't get it to link with computer - I don't know if security might be blocking but when I plug directly into computer and turn on - the unit only blinks (can't scan while blinking) and eventually stops and turns off.&nbsp; The computer says "You have
 files ready to be burned..." which is something else I DO have waiting to burn again.&nbsp; How can I make this work?&nbsp; Thank you anyone.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi domajazz,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Where are you getting the message: "You have files ready to be burned" on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check if the Scanner is getting detected in Devices and Printers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start and click on Control panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click on Devices and Printers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. If it is not listed, then select the option add a Device and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it is not getting detected, then check for any error codes or messages and post back the same.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also check if the scanner is getting detected in another computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since the scanned images are saved directly to the SD card, you may also try connecting the SD card&nbsp;and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

<h2>            How do I run the store app on Windows 8&#63; I select the tile and nothing happens so does it exist or is it a myth&#63;</h2>
                    Nothing happens, it just doesn't seem to work and I am wondering whether Microsoft have sold us all down the river with Windows 8 because it is bloody awful! I have frequent crashes and freezes which I rarely got with Windows 7.

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that you are facing multiple issues with windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your issue description, I understand that you are unable to open store app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you receive any error message/code while trying to open the store?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you able to open other apps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend you to follow the below given methods and check if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method1: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are using any Proxy connection, then try disabling the proxy connection and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to disable proxy:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the Gear box at the top right corner in internet explorer.<br />
b. Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.<br />
c. Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN settings.<br />
d. Select the Use a proxy server for your LAN check box.<br />
e. In the Address box, type the address of the proxy server.<br />
f. In the Port box, type the port number.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method2: Run app troubleshooter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer:<br />
“What to do if you have problems with an app”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: perform the troubleshooter mentioned in the end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method3: Put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow Step 3 from the link to return the computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Temporarily disable the antivirus if you have one installed and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Important: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats.<br />
In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is
 disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Debbie_H</p>
<p>That was the first thing I did when windows update was not accesible any more. I even try with disabled both firewalls (on my computer and on my firewall). Nothing helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I reinstall everything again and some days everything works well, after some days windows update was disabled again if I access to it throug xDSL connection. Via smarthmobile it works all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
