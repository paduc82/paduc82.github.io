<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Internet &#40;except Google&#41; when connected to my D-Link DI-604 Ethernet router</h2>
                    I just bought a new Compaq Presario with Windows 7 pre-installed to replace one of the two old&nbsp;Windows XP computers in my wired home network. The new computer will not connect to the Internet (except for Google.com) when it is connected through my router.
 It does connect to the other computer (which is an old Dell computer with 256 MB of RAM running Windows XP) through the router, and&nbsp;the other computer can connect to the Internet (although the&nbsp;Internet seems slow).<br />
<br />
I tried connecting my **** TM602G cable modem directly to the Windows 7 computer and resetting this modem, and I was then able to connect to the Internet. However, when I reconnected to the router the Internet connection was lost again.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that the source of the&nbsp;problem is that Windows 7 does not support my router, which I bought almost 7 years ago. I checked the D-Link Web site and found that this router is no longer supported.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can fix this problem? Do you think it's necessary for me to buy a new router? If so, do you have any suggestions for what compatible router I should buy? Are there any wired routers still being made that will work
 with Windows 7? I'm on a limited budget, and I don't currently have wireless network cards.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!

<span>Hi swheeler3,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please visit this link to check the for the compatibility of the router with Windows 7:</span></p>

<p>
<span>I suggest you to update the network adapter driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Right click on the installed driver setup file, select properties.</span></p>

<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the compatibility tab. Under compatibility select the checkbox ”Run this program in compatibility mode for”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the drop down box and select “Windows Vista”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under privilege level, select the checkbox which says “ Run this program as an administrator”.</span></p>

                    When I tried to download app in Windows Store, the download stuck. I leave it for doing laundry, it still stuck. I tried to run WSReset, the windows store restart, but when I tried to download, the app still stuck . I am so tired of this kind fraud. Any
 solution? Because downloading in some store like Google Play or iTunes I never get something like this. I think the worst App Store goes to Windows Store

<h2>            Microsoft stole my Skype account how do I get it back&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So last night after using Skype for more than 10 years in over 30 countries, last night some 'crisis' message flashed across my screen saying I was using Skype in an unusual place (Geneva Switzerland) and........ I missed the rest. But my Skype account,
 10 years of messages and my Skype credit have gone forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded what seems to be a new - and truly horrible - version of Skype. In order to do that I was forced to open a Microsoft account - which I did not and do not want to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I cannot use this new Skype as when I try to find friends it directs me to a screen that attempts to contact my phone number (of 23 years( and tell me there's a problem and I must make sure it's my number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WTF? Who can tell me what happened, where my Skype account went, and what I can do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enraged&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am an occasional Skype phone user. And hence, I routinely need to reactivate my account. However, it seems I am no longer able to do so. When logging into my account, I can see my "purchase history", and it shows as the ast entry the following more than
 a year back (in February 2017):</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Feb 03</td>
<td>(blacked out)</td>
<td><span>Balance expiration</span></td>
<td>Balance inactive</td>
<td><span>€</span>-6,25</td>
<td>Delivered </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>Please provide guidance how I can reactivate this expired account balance. How do I get it back? An account balance is an account balance. You are the custodian of that money - you may elect to reimburse it, but Microsoft cannot just expropriate it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Ulrich Hege</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: As an aside, I never understood why Skype has this 180 days deactivation policy. This is not how other online merchants proceed, and it seems to create more hassle than good for users. If there are security issues, you can address then differently (with
 limits on perpetual accounts etc.)</p>

<h3> rubix99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One technical question</h2>
                    
<p>Just trying to find a few things out about Xbox One.</p>
<p>The last few days saw Xbox Live and PSN get compromised which affected people being able to play games.</p>
<p>People were saying they were unable to sign in.</p>
<p>I really dont care about multi player gaming and only play single player games.</p>
<p>On Xbox 360 you can still sign into your account and play single player games even without an internet connection.....you just wont obviously be able to access any online features.</p>
<p>If I, for example, had purchased an Xbox One a few weeks back (installed all the latest updates etc) and got GTA V.....would I have still been able to play GTA V single player over the last few days when Xbox Live was down? Or does signing into an Xbox account
 require an internet connection on Xbox One unlike 360? Hope this makes sense.</p>

<p>Pretty sure you need to be signed in if you want to be able to access your save files for a game don't you? At least thats how it works on 360.</p>
<p>I can still sign in to my 360 profile even if the internet cable is disconnected, I just cant use any online features......but I can still continue single player offline games from save files.</p>

<p>So basically that amounts to DRM?</p>
<p>You have to actually connect to the internet in order to go offline! I thought Microsoft did away with all that and said when you buy an Xbox One.....you just need to install a one time update and then you can constantly play offline without ever having
 to go online ever.</p>
<p>This is even worse than the 24 hour check in thing they originally planned.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I was aware of the Offline Feature before any of this happened but what I found was a bit annoying. There is a problem with the Offline/ Online Settings from the Xbox One that when you pick Offline and then Sign-in (on the same
 Console you should have your most current Save File as well) it works fine.<br />
<br />
But the problem becomes when it is intermittent failure of Xbox LIVE (like on Christmas Day) you will be Offline and playing along in a SP Game Mode but when Xbox LIVE Connects (without your knowledge) it reverts the Offline Settings back to Online. This would
 be all fine and dandy if it stayed Online but when it fails again and disconnects, Xbox LIVE cannot verify your Profile and it Signs your Profile out while you were playing without warning!<br />
<br />
The above was truly frustrating as in the Games I tried it would send me back to the Title Screen with only a last Auto-Save (depending on the Game). This made for a very annoying I Sign-in and Xbox LIVE Signs me out back and forth.<br />
<br />
The above needs to be addressed by MS in a future Update.</span></p>

<h2>            Tired of these updates&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've posted this before when there was 5 updates a week, and got no satisfactory answer. But I am extremely upset that I keep getting kicked out of online games with prompt, "Time to update". &nbsp;Then have to wait the 20 min to install/apply. &nbsp; I want to quit
 this stupid early access program, what good is it really, but it says it will delete all hard drive...which all I have is digital games???!!!</p>
<p>Is there any way to make this at least stop kicking me out of online games? Or if someone from xbox reads this please fix.</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>Me too. &nbsp;In my case, it's a Gateway laptop. &nbsp;There's no driver or other info on the SYTEM THREAD NOT HANDLED line like some other threads mentioned with various video driver issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was notified the free upgrade to my Windows 7 was available so stupidly scheduled and for more than 12 hours now the machine is just endlessly rebooting to the blue screen with that error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no media with Windiws 10 on it to try to bypass that reboot. &nbsp;It won't let me get to safe mood.</p>

<h3> joannascripta manent  say:</h3>
<h2>            XML Core Services and Encarta 2009 -- How to get dictionary unstuck&#63;</h2>
                    So with help from the community (Swapnil99pro and RajithR), I was able to install Encarta 2009 in my Windows 7 32-bit laptop. I was overjoyed! But then I noticed the dictionary doesn't work as it should. It gets stuck in a previous word I looked up, reports
 that the word is not in the English dictionary, shows a blank page, or both the word index in the left panel and the definitions panel go blank. Also, not all the translations tabs show up, though I don't know if this is normal and should be set.
<br />
<br />
In the README file in the installation DVD, I saw this in the General Issues section: "Page Not Found error or blank pages appear when navigating content. This may be caused by a problem with Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) 6.0. Please download and install
 the latest version of MSXML 6.0. Go to http://www.microsoft.com/downloads, and then search for "MSXML 6.0".<br />
<br />
When I went to microsoft.com/downloads, there are a lot of MSXML 6.0's there. <br />
<br />
Which should I get and how do I get them to work? I did already download and install several (msxml.msi -- Parser and the service packs, though one of them says "Setup Interrupted") but the Encarta Dictionary is in the same buggy condition. So perhaps I got
 the wrong xml thing. <br />
<br />
I have XML 4.0-- in case that's relevant. I've also already downloaded and installed Windows Install Cleanup so I'm ready to delete and reinstall, hehe.
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance! <br />
<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's troubleshoot the issue by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Reset the app settings</strong></p>

<p>3. Click on <em><strong>Advanced options</strong></em>, then click on <em><strong>Reset.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run PowerShell</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We recommend running the following PowerShell script to re-register the Windows Store.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, then select</span><span>
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. In the command prompt, enter the following command:
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Reboot your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you perform the steps from <strong>MrAbhishekDatta
</strong>on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/windows-10-store-and-apps-close-immediately/b08fea2b-a1eb-47d9-9f0f-2ae845ff3447">thread.</a></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Neither of these items worked. Each time I tried download content, the app crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, a lot of my items in the Start Menu have down arrows. When I click on those items, a Tips app appears with info about "Get online" - showing how to connect to Wifi, despite me already being connected that way.</p>
<p>One last related strange item&nbsp;- after resetting my PC, I installed the Office suite. When I go to Cortana and type Word, only "wordpad" shows up as an entry. But Word (and the other apps) are there in the left part of the Start Menu, when I scroll down.</p>

    <title>Surface RT and Re-sizing of Metro Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johntci  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT and Re-sizing of Metro Apps</h2>
                    <p>The recent update to Windows 8.1 to allow the return of the start button is very welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I use the RT as much in desktop mode as in tablet mode and can appreciate the relative merits/benefits of each.&nbsp;</span>However, personally, I have always found the split screen in 8.1 rather cumbersome and difficult to manage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, as the availability of "Desktop Apps/Programs" for the Surface RT is rather limited, is there any way to re-size the Metro Apps&nbsp;(such as Skype, Mail, People and Photos etc.) to stop them hogging the whole screen? (e.g. in the same way as Desktop
 Apps such as the included MS Office Apps).</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you Arul for your reply . . .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in a desire to be brief, maybe I didn’t explain well as this is not about the&nbsp;<strong>monitor</strong>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<strong>screen resolution</strong>&nbsp;nor re-sizing of the&nbsp;<strong>tiles.&nbsp;</strong>Therefore, please allow me to&nbsp;try and clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am referring to the fact that when you first open a Metro App in RT, it initially occupies the whole screen with only 2 options available in the top right corner in desktop/PC mode&nbsp;</span><span>(i.e. minimise and close).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only method I know to be able to reduce the amount of the screen occupied by the app is the “split screen” option with fixed horizontal ratios, which seem to be 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60 and 30:70 . . . and, as I said, I personally find this rather
 cumbersome and difficult to manage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, the Metro apps in Windows 10 now open with all 3 of the traditional options&nbsp;</span><span>(i.e. minimise,
<strong>maximise/restore down</strong> and close) . . .&nbsp;</span><span>as well as no longer opening in full screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For me at least, the original use of the name “Windows” and its whole philosophy/raison d’être was based upon the “<strong>maximise/restore down</strong>” option, which enables one to be able to create multiple “windows” of infinitely variable sizes.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Therefore, another way of completely rephrasing my original question would be, “Is there any way to have the “maximise/restore down” option for Metro Apps on the RT?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I read recently that Microsoft have decided to rename Metro Apps to Windows Apps . . . so, is there some hope that Microsoft themselves may yet offer a solution for their loyal RT owners, who are already v. happy with the resurrection of the "Start" button?
 Could someone please advise how and where to request it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks your understanding and I trust that this is now clearer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Another, though less preferable alternative &nbsp;might possibly be the "Change the size of apps, text, and other items on the screen etc." from PC Settings / PC and devices / Display/ More options. However, I have no idea how it would work, because it is
 grayed out in RT and I no longer have anything else still running on 8.1 to try it.</p>

<p><span>Hi steevwish,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For this issue, first to isolate if it is related to the cache of your browser, you can try to open your Firefox Browser with InPrivate Mode or change to other browsers and see if you could install and use the skype for
 business plug-in. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, as far as I know, if the ActiveX controls are not enabled, the plug-in cannot be used to join in the skype meetings with your browser, so you can try to check it with your browser. For more information, please
 refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/trouble-installing-the-skype-for-business-web-app-plug-in-958fc5f1-2d6f-42e3-815d-a9516c591274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you got any updates, welcome back to share with me, thanks.</span></p>

<p>Hello Xbox,</p>
<p>I was wondering if the development team is still considering UASP support to the USB 3.0 ports of the Xbox One. This would improve load times via external harddisk (especially in combination with an SSD). See the link below:</p>
<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_early_access/update_preview/update_preview_forums/wave_6_1408/f/5015/t/1798371.aspx</p>
<p>This has also been suggested in the User Voice program, but it seems to get to few votes because of being too "techy":</p>

<p>Hello Thee Elf,</p>
<p>The topic from the first link I posted was from more than a year ago. At the time the answer was the following:</p>
<p>"I spoke to the development team and USB 3.0 UASP is not currently supported, but it's under consideration to be added in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks! ~Hammer"</p>
<p>Could you ask the development team, like Hammer did, if there is any clearance/progress about this?</p>
<p>I would really appreciate that! </p>

<p>Hi Gaaiz,</p>
<p>Xbox Feedback can stay there forever. Microsoft may or may not actually implement suggestions, even though they try to give us everything we want. A change like this also may require new hardware, and if that's the case until a new Xbox One model is released
 we won't be seeing this. Also, Thee Elf is an Xbox Ambassador like myself, and as such we have no ties to Microsoft. We would use the same path you would for suggestions, which would be using<a href="http://feedback.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this site</a>.</p>

<h2>            Lost Windows 7 upgrade CD but still have product key</h2>
                    I bought a laptop a few years back that came with Vista. I have the recovery CDs but I lost the Windows 7 home professional 64-bit upgrade CD. Can I use any Windows 7 home pro disk with my product key which I still have? I need to reimage but don't want
 to buy a new laptop or software if I don't have to and I have a my key but the CD is missing.<br />

    <title>why can I not make changes to permissions in the registry when logged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hipkts20152002  say:</h3>
<h2>            why can I not make changes to permissions in the registry when logged in as the primary administrator in windows 10 home</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to modify the registry in Windows 10 in order to set my WiFi connection to metered. I have signed onto the machine as the primary administrative user. (The user that was initially setup when the system was restored as new). We bought this
 machine from a store that had already setup the OS and they ran a full recovery that I completed.</p>
<p>I did find the selection for metered connection while logged in as the administrative user and it was active and allowed me to alter that setting.</p>
<p>However, when I got to that same area to set up the metered connection while logged in as a standard user, it was grayed out so I could not make the selection. Since I try my best not to connect to the internet as an administrative user, I am sort of stuck.</p>
<p>So, I found on the Microsoft site, the instructions for altering the registry. I signed on as the administrative user and went to the area that needed to be altered and tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was then told that I did not have permission to alter this value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not change the permissions either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a happy user at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Microsoft products since 1981 and have used all versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do recall a time when I could not alter pieces of this or that but login as the original administrator usually took care of that.</p>

</p><p>The guide explains the difference between a standard Admin Account and the elevated Admin Account that most people should never want or need to mess with. In fact, most users are better of not knowing that it exists, which is why it's probably not so obvious.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info on the hidden administrator account. That however did not allow me to alter the registry. I could not get to the settings page that allowed me to setup the metered connection again. I found it the one time but it was like it went away.
</p>
<p>Since I could not alter the registry as the true administrator, I decided then and there to restore the machine using the recovery process and returned it.</p>
<p>I will be staying on Windows 7 as long as possible.</p>

<h2>            I have tried everything to run my older software programs on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have tried running software such as Panzer General 3D Assault, Panzer General 2 Adlerkorps Edition, Scrabble, etc. in compatibility mode, and everything else suggested, plus any ideas I have been able to locate on the web. Panzer General 3D Assault displays
 the initial screen, then the options screen comes on with the text in the wrong color and slightly blurred. Move the arrow to an option to choose and the game freezes and quits responding. I have to run task manager to actually end the program. Other programs
 just give me a message about a compatibility issue with 64 bit windows 7 home premium which my brand new Compaq came with. Seems to me that all is lost with all my&nbsp;software and I will have to use an old harddrive if I can locate one with winXP or older on
 it if I want to run <strong>ANY</strong> of my software titles. This seems like such a waste of my new computer if I have to do just that to run any of my disks! Will there be a cure, hopefully in the near future, for those of us stuck with this 64 bit win
 operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any answers you can give.</p>

                    I can't download the sling tv app in windows 10. I get error code, 0x03f7000. I have tried to contact sling with no answer. I have a microsoft streaming acct, so this is not an issue. I've turned off all adblockers and ghostery. not sure what the issue
 is at this point.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As per your query, the app "Sling TV" is incompatible with Windows 10. I would suggest that you try to install the app in compatibility mode and check if the app gets installed.
 To do so follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press and hold (or right-click) the program icon, tap or click
<strong><span>Properties,</span></strong> and then tap or click the
<strong><span>Compatibility tab.</span></strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On the search bar, enter the name of the program then press and hold (or right-click) the search result, and then tap or click Open file location.
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select one or more of the settings.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you want to apply the settings for that program to all accounts on the PC, tap or click
<strong><span>Change settings for all users.</span></strong> You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 7 will not start, restarts boot sequence after &#39;Starting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> capnjack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 will not start, restarts boot sequence after &#39;Starting Windows&#39; screen. Can not access system repair, or safe mode.</h2>
                    
<p>About a month and a half ago, I purchased a new Toshiba Satellite C650D laptop, as I was about to start university.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be working fine up until about a day or two ago, when my computer began to work much slower than usual.</p>
<p>Last night, when I tried to turn on my laptop, everything worked fine until it got to the 'Starting Windows' page. From that point, the windows logo animation played continuously, without stopping. I restarted my computer, and I was faced with an option
 screen to either start windows normally, or run a system repair. I tried both options, neither of which fixed my problem. By starting windows normally, the same problem as before would happen. By running a system repair, it would come up with nothing.</p>
<p>I decided that I would put my computer down, and try to see what the problem was in the morning. When I woke up today, I started up my computer, and was faced with the same problem, except infinitely worse. By running windows normally, the 'Starting Windows'
 animation will play for about 3 minutes, the blue screen will flash quickly, and the computer will restart, and begin the same process over again in a continuous loop. By running a system repair, it brings me to a blank screen showing nothing but my cursor.</p>
<p>I pressed F8 at start up to run the computer in safe mode. This did nothing but bring me back to the same 'Starting Windows' problem. The same thing would happen by running any of the other options.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do at this point. I'd like to make it clear that I DO NOT have any windows disk, and I'm likely too broke to buy one (I am a university student, after all).</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. I'm not the very best when it comes to computers. So, if you could make your replies somewhat easy to understand, it'd really help me out a lot. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You have to press F2 as it starts up, tap it until it says it is entering setup or similar.<br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen (also F12 on Toshiba allows a<br />
one time boot drive choice) - set the boot order to CD/DVD first - remember to set back<br />
later.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Sounds like a bad drive and needs to be replaced. Have it checked at a real computer<br />
shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the System maker's<br />
Support. That the drive will not run in another computer tells the story.</p>

<p>Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code<br />
If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer, Contact Support.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<p>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.<br />
Scan your computer for computer viruses.<br />
Check your hard disk for errors.</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: ED&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000ED&nbsp; &lt;-- read this though its likely hardware error</strong><br />

<p>=====================================================<br />
<br />
The same repair methods listed in the 1st troubleshooter above still apply, check<br />
the drive.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
