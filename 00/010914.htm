<h2>            Help Please&#58; Unable to login to Skype due to the incorrect age on my Microsoft profile.</h2>
                    <p>I have been having problems accessing my Skype account, which appears to be because for some reason my birth date is incorrectly recorded as 01/01/2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have submitted many 'Age Verification Request's using the form provided at:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequestform/eb14cf1b-970d-ab30-a009-c47c459f8ec6</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get an email verification and sometimes these requests are logged at:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/my/supportrequests?wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others don't appear and/or there is no email verification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In four cases I've had a reply to say that I have not submitted any documents showing proof of ID, which is wrong. Each time I have been absolutely sure to add the necessary file attachments, but when I do get a response it is always as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We recently received a request to verify the date of birth on your Microsoft account. We received your submission
 containing the profile information, but we either did not receive an ID or it was not legible. Provide an ID proof so that we could verify your account.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please create a new manual age verification submission and be sure to attach an image of your government issued identification that shows your name and date of birth. You can access the submission
<span>Please create a new manual age verification submission and be sure to attach an image of your government issued identification that shows your name and date of birth. You can access the submission
 form by using the link below:</span></p>
<p><br />
I have written replies to all of these emails, the replies all apparently being ignored.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no question about the attachments being illegible; I scanned the documents at 600 dpi and the images are razor sharp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just going around&nbsp;and around&nbsp;and around&nbsp;and around the same loop and getting nowhere with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please contact me directly to resolve this. Skype has become a necessary element of my work and am now anxious that the deadline will arrive before too long without this being resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise could anyone who has got through this same experience please advise me on what they needed to do to progress it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

you can try to search a different version of QtCore4.dll. I'm not sure if it works. Just a suggestion - for elder versions of .dll might be fully tested by vista.

            If you install an older version of QTCORE4.dll, than you also have to install older versions of several other files that are compatible with the older version of QTCORE4.dll. However, I have tried this and it does not work either but thanks for your help.
 I wish Nokia itself was half as helpful.

<h2>            Zune wmdu component not installed ..</h2>
                    <p>I had Zune 4.7 on my Windows 7 64 bit laptop and Nodo version on my HTC Mozart. When my Zune prompted for upgrade availalbe (i.e. 4.8) I clicked and it started download and installing. At 88% installation it stopped and returned error that Zune WMDU component
 not installed, after that I'm not able to install any version of Zune. I tried with different profile on same laptop but its same.</p>
<p>However, on my work PC few days back when I connected my Mozart to my PC, it prompted for upgrades on both Mozart and on Zune, both updated successfully. My work PC is running Zune 4.8.xxx and my Moazrt running Mango.</p>
<p>Now, how to install Zune on my personal laptop, I've deleted any zune folder/file presence and most of the entries in registry.</p>
<p>BTW, how ot open a support case with Microsoft?</p>
<p>cheers...</p>

<h3> jackyboy552  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t sign up</h2>
                    The whole of yesterday I was trying to recover my email address "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" which I never quite badly, but it has come to conclusion that Microsoft support are completely useless when it came to solving my problem and I have had to result to
 this. First of all Microsoft De-activated my email without giving me any indication (which they could've emailed me on my alternative email) they were going to. Which in my opinion is an abomination. So after a full day of trying to sort it out I got, "your
 email address is not in our database" so I accepted the fact that I'm not going to to get it back. But then I came up with an Idea to which might solve my problem, If I created the email address again then the company's and games I used to be associated with
 would re-send email to the address, so I try and Sign up with the domain @live.co.uk which I thought was discontinued by Microsoft in the first place. and I sign up with all the correct details and I get the error message "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** isn't available."
 which Is really annoying because support have just told me that the email is not in there database, and I would be able to sign up again with them. Ergh can some one help me with the rather annoying situation.<br />
<br />
Thanks, A cheesed off customer<br />

            <p>Hi FrankManobianco,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information you have provided. To manage your folders in Outlook.com, you need to right-click on the folder name and the list of options that you can do with the folder will appear such as rename, delete, empty folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot manage your folders, we need to know if you are encountering any error message. If yes, what is the exact error message. In addition, we are asking for a screenshot of the issue for us to better understand what happened to your folders when
 you try to manage it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a private message area where you could upload the screenshots. Looking forward for your response.
</p>

    <title>Office cannot use pen or any inking tools - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dylan stone96  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office cannot use pen or any inking tools</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to use my surface pen in the desktop version of OneNote&nbsp;I get the error "Tablet drivers are not installed on the system, please install them to enable tablet features" and I can't do anything with the pen. Again, in OneNote if I click the
 draw tab, everything is greyed out and unclickable. In all other Office desktop apps that support some kind of inking, for example; Word, when I click the Pens tab, the program stops responding and has to be closed. All other apps work perfectly fine with
 Inking, including the OneNote Metro app, Microsoft Edge, etc. it is only office desktop programs&nbsp;that have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information that should be helpful;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office</p>
<p>I installed Office 365 Home (2016), inking worked fine</p>
<p>I cancelled my subscription because my school provides office 365 ProPlus</p>
<p>I installed Office 365 (2013)&nbsp;ProPlus, <strong>Inking stopped working</strong></p>
<p>I installed a trial version of office (2016) to see if it was a problem with my schools version inking still didn't work</p>
<p>I installed my schools version again (2013)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro, Surface Pro 3, 256GB, i5, 8gb RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any reply, Microsoft just gets mad at me because its a school account and not a Microsoft account so they refuse to help me. Thanks for your time.</p>

<br />Clear the cache of your browser:
<br />
<br />1 Open Chrome on your computer.
<br />Go to the top right and click More More.
<br />
<br />2 Click on More tools and then Delete browsing data.
<br />
<br />3 At the top, choose a time interval. To delete all the data, select All periods.

<br />Go to Tools, and touch on Mailbox Cleaning. Select: View mailbox size, Search for items before, Search for items larger than, View size of deleted items, Empty deleted items folder, or View size of conflicts, according to what interests you most. You can locate large items, or deleted items that have not been completely deleted. Get rid of everything you do not need.
<br />
<br />Then go to File, and Account Settings. On the Data Files tab, click on the data file you want to compact (compress). Then click on Advanced Options and Settings of the Outlook data file. Finally click on Compact now to complete the process. This will reduce the size of the message management file.

            Hi Christinaszeman,
<br />I would run Adwcleaner which would search out and remove any hidden malware that may be slowing down your system. After running the first time So the Scan now again It will run a basic repair. This option helps to fix slowness issues on Chrome. When checking for Malware and your second scan it will want to restart.
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />See if that helps with the slowness problem. 
<br />Please let me know the results.
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4900484B-93ED-4EC0-B888-188152052473">szdhsn,</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your post and welcome to the Nokia discussion forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What I recommend you try doing a soft reset by dialing *#7780# and if prompted enter the code 12345 which is the default code. If you have changed this then please enter this. This reset your device but this will not erase any of your data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If this doesn't resolve your issue you can try removing the the Opera mini and see if this helps. Once again if this hasn't resolved the issue then you could try doing a hard reset. Doing this will reset your phone and remove all data so using Nokia
 suite please back up your device first. To do a hard reset dial *#7370# and if prompted enter your device code. This will reset your device. Then using Nokia suite restore your data. This should hopefully fix your issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let me know how it goes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I also face the same problem with the Nokia110 phone. It seems there is issue with OS soon as you install any Java app it starts misbehaving. Screen goes blank off and on randomly. I have got the latest firmware V03.28 dated 13 July 2012 RM-827 from Nokia
 care. but the problem seems to persist. We have taken up the issue with the Nokia R&amp;D team in India about a month back and are still awaiting resolution.

<p>This may be a bug that will get cured thru' a Firmware update. Is your phone Firmware upto date ? You may check thru'&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/in-en/support/product/nokia-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Suite</a>&nbsp;. If it already has the latest version
 try re-installing ( if the option is available as seen in the attachment) or wait till one is released ...</p>
<p>BTW, There are many threads on this Forum for the 'Subject' but may be for different models ..</p>

            Just Keep your phone Memory More than 5MB and delete some not important messages in your inbox. Don't put any app on Homescreen Shortcuts and Goto Shortcuts. By the way it is normal for a low ram phone to restart.

<h2>            Modify signature date into format yyyy-MM-dd</h2>
                    <p>Can somebody tell me how to change the representation (format) of the sign date of a Word signature? The current date representation on my system is 3/24/2016 and has to be changed into 2016-03-24. I have already changed the short date of the control panel
 without positive result.&nbsp;</p>

            The date part of the signature does not seem to be a field, and the representation must be determined by a format value somewhere on the system. Could this be determined by a value somewhere in the registry, somewhere in one of the office maps, or is this
 hardcoded in Word? I could not find the format in the .docx (after I changed the extension into .zip.) The &nbsp;sig1.xml shows just "&lt;xd:SigningTime&gt;2016-03-24T13:47:23Z&lt;/xd:SigningTime&gt;". What must I do to influence the signature date representation.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Mac is automatically deleting emails</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2016 for Mac setup with an Exchange account and it is deleting emails after a certain number of days. Last week I noticed that I could only go back to emails from October 24th, now today I notice I can only go back to emails on October 30th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any filters on the "Filter Email" button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have Parallels VM setup with Outlook for Windows, and I can access emails from the day I started the email account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I have to go to my VM to look up emails past 3 weeks, which is really annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<h2>            Outlook Web Access Not Working Well w&#47; IE11</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 and it came with an upgrade to IE11.&nbsp; I have read in other forums that it is not possible to downgrade back to IE10 without resetting to a previous system restore point, as I would have to revert back to Windows 8 in order
 to get IE10 back.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Ever since I started using IE11, my Outlook web access will only work in "Outlook Web Access Light" mode.&nbsp; I miss the functionality that the regular web access provided, but I'm not willing to do a system restore just to get it back.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have attached a picture of the login screen.&nbsp; Even when I uncheck the "Use Outlook Web Access Light" box, I am still taken to the "light" version of Outlook webmail.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do?&nbsp; I tried clearing the history/cache etc. and then logging into my mail again, but I just can't seem to get it to run the fully functional version of the Outlook web access.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Help please if you can!<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; I see that there is a Windows 8.1 preview and IE11 preview.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I have the preview or the complete versions.&nbsp; Is there a difference?</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, or Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 environment? If yes, you may follow the steps provided.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download and install the update as suggested in this article.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue occurs because the <b>MSIE</b> token is removed from the <b>user-agent</b> string in Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can't load OWA Premium by using Internet Explorer 11 in an Exchange Server environment</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, there are preview editions available with Windows 8.1, To confirm the operating system version, you may refer to this article.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you so much!&nbsp; We are using Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, so the fix that worked for me was this one:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>To work around this issue in Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2007, or Exchange Server 2003, use Internet Explorer 11 in compatibility mode to access OWA. To do this, press F10 to display the menu bar, go to the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>
 menu in Internet Explorer 11, and then click <strong>Compatibility View settings</strong>. Then, add the OWA site to the list of sites to be viewed in compatibility view.<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;When you use this workaround, Internet Explorer 11 saves your Compatibility View settings for the website. Every time that you access that site, Compatibility View will be used. To stop Compatibility View for a website, click the Compatibility View
 icon for that website. You can also add or remove specific websites from Compatibility View without accessing each website&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I now have my Outlook Web Premium access back.&nbsp; Thank you!<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; Sorry it took me so many days to reply.&nbsp; I think the response either got buried in my inbox or may have gone to my junk folder.</p>

<h2>            Feedback on OneDrive for Business&#58; Syncing malfunction and freezing</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
Hi!<br />
<br />
I would like to report some issues I have been dealing with OneDrive for Business and make some suggestions.<br />
<br />
A) When I move folders, OneDrive goes crazy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How I discovered the problem:<br />
<br />
I am using OneDrive for Business along with SharePoint to share files with my team. I was in charge of organizing files and folders after my team put it all together for the first time. I waited SharePoint to Sync files with my computer, and then I used the
 my local SharePoint folder to organize the files. I expected that, once my work was done, Sharepoint would sync and our team folder would be OK.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, OneDrive app (the little blue clouds on taskbar) worked in loop, demanding all the CPU capacity. It was so serious that I had to call our IT support - they erased my user profile from windows (yes, you got it right, the hole user profile was compromised)
 and I had to start all over with a brand new profile.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After a few days, I had the same problem again after I moved a few folders on the SharePoint team folder. My Windows user profile had to be reset.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestion:<br />
Improve how OneDrive monitors the local folders changes. I believe it tries to delete files from the first folder and copy them to the destination folder. The bug happens somewhere inbetween.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The OneDrive app could instead simply change the file path, each time the user drags and drops files and folders.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
B) The OneDrive app (the little blue clouds on taskbar) does not offer good feedback to the user nor controls to avoid sync problems.<br />
<br />
There is no clear progress bar to help the user to know if the syncing is stuck or actually progressing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The green bar bellow the clouds is not enough. For several times, they ran endlessly. I suspected something went wrong. But what happened? I checked the Load Center (the white arrow in an orange circle), but it gave me no clear info.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Eventualy, I found a small Word file (~120kb) which was not syncing. But what could I do? I tried a lot of ramdom things, and the only thing that worked was to move the file out of the OneDrive folder, change its name and put it back. It was not the case of
 a long name, I kept the same number of characters. And I did not have a clear control to solve the problem - like a button for "try to load again".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I suggest you study the app GoodSync. It is very well-done. Commands are clear and advanced user have total control over uncommon situations. For example, the application offers controls to decide about syncing conflits, to set how often each task will be run,
 to protect folders against accidental deletions and other essential controls.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C) Long file names<br />
<br />
Yes, I have experienced some long file names issues.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Once I adopted OneDrive as an option, I had to move some files from older folders to OneDrive folders, which added some characteres to the file path.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Create a character counter for the file paths. It could be shown on Windows Explorer. Actually, it would be useful to all the folders and files, not only for OneDrive. But please, this is urgent. Long names are an anoying problem. It is hard to solve, as most
 of the time Windows Explorer "freezes" when we try to rename a file in a long path.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Whenever a long file path is detected, Windows Explorer should prompt the user to rename the file, offering a user-friendly window to do it. The "long path rename window" should count the exceeding characters (like Twitter does).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, the rename window should exibit all the name at a glance. Instead of one line, the file name should be shown on at least 4 lines.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
D) Editing files from a local SharePoint/OneDrive folder can be ****.<br />
<br />
When I open a file on MS Office, right from a local SharePoint/OneDrive folder, the OneDrive app (yes, the little blue clouds on taskbar) keeps trying to sync the file all the time. This is especially anoying when we save the file. Sometimes it takes unbearable
 10 seconds to save a simple file. Office slows down a lot if I try to keep editing before the syncing is done.<br />
<br />
To avoid this, I move the file out of the SharePoint/OneDrive folder, edit it, save it and put it back to the SharePoint/OneDrive folder.<br />
<br />
Suggestion:<br />
Come on, Microsoft, you can make this better! You should either choose to set OneDrive to sync files AFTER the saving is done, or you choose to improve the on-the-fly syncing until it is imperceptible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This issue has a strong negative impact on the user experience. It is impractical to edit files from SharePoint/OneDrive folders. Please do not take long to fix it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Thiago<br />

<h2>            A new account and an old account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a huge problem.&nbsp; I had an account, and I kept getting told that I was being signed out because I had an old version of SKYPE, and in trying to download the new version, I ended up creating a new account, which I DON'T want to do, since I already
 have my number and money credited to my original account.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, it's possible that you've used a different sign in credential, the reason why you cannot see your number and credit. But to further check on this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to our <a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Problems signing in</span></a><strong>
</strong>page.</li><li>Enter your email address or phone number and select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important note</strong>: When entering your phone number, be sure to enter it with no spaces or dashes (example: 12223334444).</li><li>We'll show you all the Skype accounts associated with that email address or phone number.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have questions and clarifications.</p>
