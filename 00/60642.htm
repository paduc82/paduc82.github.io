<h2>            Setting up user accounts on a new Windows 7 Professional computer.</h2>
                    <p>Setting up user accounts on a new Windows 7 Professional computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to get prepared, before starting up my new computer so that I get it right the first time. My thought is to set up two user accounts. The initial account as
 an Administrator and the second account (for every day use) as an Administrator also. This way I can change the second (every day use) account to “standard user only” if I later decide, rather than trying to change it the other way around if I don’t like being
 on a standard user only account. I will be the only user on this new computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible and/or a practical approach. I want to keep everything as clean as possible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Steve</p>

            <p>Windows 7 is different in almost every aspect of using Accounts from previous versions, especially if you have come from XP.</p>
<p>In Windows 7, running as a Standard User is not only extremely easy, it's far more secure. There's no question of "liking" it or not - the two types of account look exactly the same and operate exactly the same!</p>
<p>Create your two accounts as administrators, and give both strong passwords. Install all your apps in your daily user account, then log out and log on to the other Admin account. Change your daily use account to Standard User without delay.</p>
<p>You will find that even running as a Standard User, you can perform Admin tasks perfectly well because all that happens is you are asked for the other Admin account password.</p>

            You will probably get as many opinions as you get responses. Here is mine:
<div>
<ul>
<li>I insist on creating, testing and documenting two admin accounts. This is important in case something goes wrong with one of them. It's like having a spare key for my house.</li><li>I usually work under an admin account. Many people think this is risky because it gives a virus or some malware much more power over my installation than if my everyday account had only user privileges. But then I practise "safe hex" and I have a good idea
 what's dangerous. In 24 years of computing I've had exactly one infection: Back in 1988 when viruses were brand new and largely unheard of. Nothing at all since then.</li></ul>

            Hi Jean.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See this thread I've just reviewed and marked a couple of Answers that might help:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/harman-kardon-invoke-loses-wifi-connection-cannot/15d87776-1c44-4b9e-9cb4-83f81cb698bb">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Keep in mind as well that every hardware purchase comes with a one year Support and repair warranty, so if none of the suggestions above help you can contact them from the Manual or setup literature you got to see if this is a known issue and get supported assistance.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What kind of Internet connection are you using?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you have described, my first suspicion is your Internet connection speed. if you have a bit slow internet connection, that could result in the reservation notification showing "please wait' for a long time. This would also explain the "<strong>Something
 happened"</strong> error. While, if the network connection drops unexpectedly, the setup might not be able to continue with the installation and might show the above mentioned error. On the other hand, if you have a good internet connection, something else
 in the background might be causing the issue. In either cases, I would recommend you to first download the ISO and then perform a upgrade installation. Run the Media creation tool and when asked if you want to install now or create an installation media, choose
 the later option. Then you would be asked if you want to create a USB bootable drive or an ISO file. Choose to create an ISO file and then choose the language and edition options. Once the files are downloaded an ISO file will be created. You can open the
 ISO file in File Explorer and double click on the "<strong>setup.exe</strong>" file to start the upgrade process. By following this process you will be eligible for the free upgrade to Windows 10 and at the same time since you have already downloaded the ISO
 file, you have less risks of getting interrupted during the installation process due to drop in network connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Feel free to get back to us if you have any further questions, we'd be happy to help.</p>

<h2>            pc shuts down after disabling items in msconfig</h2>
                    <p>So, i was playing a game and it lags (my internet is normal) so i asked for their help, they said that disabling items from msconfig would do the trick. so i did, i disabled items from startup and even in services but didnt include the microsoft services.
 after resarting, the game really runs smoothly. but after a while, my pc would just shut down, its almost like unplugging from power. i also noticed that when this happens, the lights on my cpu are still on so i thought its gonna restart, but it didnt.</p>
<p>i dont know what was happening. i only disable items that i myself installed in my pc, i dont know what i did wrong. i dont know how to fix this. pls, i need your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<h2>            Netflix is showing me 1080p24 content at 1080p60. Is anyone else having this problem&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The Netflix app on my Xbox One S isn't giving me 1080p at 24 Hz. Instead, content that should be shown to me at 1080p at 24 Hz is being shown to me at 1080p at 60 Hz. Keep these things in mind: when I first bought my Xbox One S and set it up a few weeks
 ago, Netflix WAS, if I recall correctly, streaming to me at 1080p at 24 Hz. But after an Xbox One system software update that started being pushed out to users on August 19th, 2016, and after a Netflix app update that I received on the same day that I received
 the system software update, it no longer is. However, I DO get 1080p at 24 Hz when I watch a Blu-ray using my Xbox One S' Blu-ray player app! So the problem can't be my TV, otherwise I'd have the same problem with the Blu-ray player app that I have with the
 Netflix app.</p>
<p>I spent several hours on the phone with Microsoft's Xbox customer support department, and then with Netflix, to try and get 24 Hz output from the Netflix app. Xbox customer support had me do everything: checked all of my settings, even had me reset my Xbox
 One S back to factory default settings. I had to set my Xbox One S up from scratch. Even after that, I still am not getting 24 Hz output from Netflix. So, I called Netflix, and I wrote about that experience here. Finally, I called Xbox customer support and
 Netflix at the same time via a three-way call, and found out that since we've tried all troubleshooting steps, and the problem remains, there is nothing that can be done. Except that both Netflix and Xbox customer support have pushed this issue on to their
 engineering departments.</p>
<p>My Microsoft case number for this issue is 1353381964, but I was told that there is nothing else that I can do.</p>
<p>Is anyone else having this problem?</p>

<p><span>You should call Support and get an Unauthorized Access case opened to sort out your account, because it might be at risk of banning: after a gamerscore reset, further gamerscore cheating means a profile ban. And
 your account has online-only achievements showing as unlocked offline for at least Gears of War 2 and Portal 2. (There's also the avatar gamerpic that seems to show hair of a blue color that looks too rich to be one of the "easter egg" colors, but I haven't
 looked at those for a while so I'm not sure.)</span></p>

<h2>            Laptop has been &#34;Attempting repairs&#34; for 24 hours</h2>
                    <p>my acer laptop has been doing 'attempting repairs' for 24 hours now. I've tried a couple of times before and after a short while it said windows couldn't automatically fix the problem. Does the fact that it's been going on so long now mean it IS repairing
 something, or is it stuck and can I safely turn it off and try something else.</p>
<p>I tried to reset it a few times before this, the 1st time it got to 44% then said it ran into a problem, after that it only gets to 1 or 2 percent.</p>
<p>The laptop won't boot unless I use the usb backup I made, to try to do anything. It came with windows 8 (I think) immediately it upgraded to windows 8.1, then windows 10 when that was released.</p>
<p>I'm a novice when it comes to this sort of thing, but i read somewhere online how to run check disk for errors using command prompt, I checked C and it said there were no problems.</p>
<p>Any help, however minor would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            thanks for this, but the pc has only a usb drive no dvd drive. I got fed up eventially and considered&nbsp;the warnings about stopping the 'dreaded loop' and stopped it. I tried it again and it said startup couldn't repair your pc, try advanced options. I have
 since posted a more detailed question as being new to this I didn't know what really to do. However I really do appreciate that you took the time to try and help me with this problem. Thankyou. Gwenma.

<p>I'm tempted to buy the PC version, but I have enough fun with the 360 version. Just would hate to start all over again with just the basic weapons. Plus I havent played a shooter on PC in years. I'd be totally thrown off.</p>

<p><span>Hi Leesza, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Community site. For a better understating of the issue let me know</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Is the computer connected to domain network?</span></p>
<p><span>b) From when did you start to face this issue; have you made any hardware / software changes?</span></p>
<p><span>c) Do you get any error message, if not go to Start Search box and type Event Viewer<span>&nbsp;
</span>and check for the error message and post it back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Suggestions: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Check the Net Logon service is running<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Type services.msc in start search box and Enter. Navigate to Net Logon and ensure it's started and set to Automatic; if not you need to manually start the service and set it to automatic.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:<span>&nbsp; </span>
If the issue is being caused due corrupt TCP/IP follow the link below on How to reset Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 3:
</span></strong><strong><span>Perform an SFC scan and try if this can resolve this issue</span>
</strong></p>
<p>
<span>This method takes a while (between 20-30 minutes or less depending on the number of files you have on your computer) but is a lot more thorough and will most probably fix most of the issues you are having with system
 files as it not only re-registers the components but it also replaces any corrupt or missing files on your computer from your VISTA INSTALL DVD.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Steps to perform SFC scan:</span>
</strong></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click <strong>Start</strong> , click
<strong>All</strong> <strong>Programs</strong> , click <strong>Accessories</strong> , right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> , and select <strong>Run as Administrator.</strong>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Click <strong>Continue</strong> or supply
<strong>Administrator credentials</strong> if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> </span></p>
<p>
<span>4. You should see the following on-screen messages:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Beginning verification phase of system scan</span></p>
<p>
<span>Verification % complete</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p>
<span>6. Once the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span>… found no integrity violations</span></p>
<p>
<span>… found corruption but repaired it</span></p>
<p>
<span>… found corruption that it could not repair</span></p>
<p>
<span>7. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hey, so today I went to play xbox live on my xbox one, and it says it has a wired connection. There is no ethernet cable plugged into it, and I've never used a wired connection before. When I try to setup my wireless connection it tells me to unplug the
 network cable, which doesn't exist. I've tried turning it off and on again and that doesn't help. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

    <title>Language bar disappeared from taskbar on windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abacus2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language bar disappeared from taskbar on windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I had left my PC on for a while, and when I came back I got a full&nbsp;Windows 10 screen to finalize(?) the installation, not a small window suggesting to upgrade. I cancelled it to restore my windows 7,&nbsp;then my language bar is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the control panel and everything was there as I set before. I followed the instructions here without any success. (Both Control Panel &amp; Regedit)&nbsp;Strangely, I don't see the language switch/input icon&nbsp;on the task bar at all. No matter what I do,
 change and change it back, I do not see it. (I made sure it's not hidden.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my language bar back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Addition: I notice that when I start the PC or turn it off (or restart), I see the language icon at the upper left corner before the windows screen goes away. I can't do anything but looking, because my mouse is not working for the period. (Screen shot attached
 below)</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, but as I&nbsp;said in my original post, I went through all the steps in two different methods that you described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm at a point that whenever I boot the system, I have to run&nbsp;the command&nbsp;"ctfmon" manually in order for me to get the language bar back. How do I make it automatic? I already have "ctfmon"="CTFMON.EXE" in Regedit.</p>

            The product key for Office 2007 is not on the base of the computer. It would have been a trial version, and to continue using it you will have to buy the full version which will come with its own key..

                    I have a PC that is connected to Telstra broadband, I also have a laptop that connects to the broadband service via Wi-Fi, I used to be able to print from the laptop via the printer that is connected to the PC. Since installing Windows 10 on the PC I haven't
 been able to print from the laptop. I have gone into Home Network and the devices can see each other but I still cant print. Any help greatly appreciated

 </p><p>Hey, Daniel!</p><p><br /></p><p>Sorry to see any loading issues with your console. I had this happen to me about a month ago on my personal console, and it was a frustrating experience. One of the first things I tried was a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a> on my console. You can select the option to keep your games and apps, but you may need to do a full factory reset.</p><p><br /></p><p>If that doesn't help out, it may be related to your power supply. Make sure you are plugged directly into the wall socket instead of a surge protector.</p><p><br /></p><p>Lastly, it could be internet related, since everything on the dashboard pulls from that to run. If none of the above helps you out, run a detailed network statistics for me and post back with the results. This will help me rule it out as a factor.

    <title>Surface RT Limitations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glennhjohnsonjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT Limitations</h2>
                    I was one of the first purchasers of Surface RT. After several months of use, I find the limitations unbearable. I expect once the Surface Pro is released and other Windows&nbsp;8 based&nbsp;tablets are available, the Surface RT will go the way of the Ford Edsel
 (some of you may be to young to remember, but google it). Hopefully Microsoft will do the right thing and offer trade-in credit to upgrade to the Surface Pro. If not, I will look to other hardware providers. Microsoft needs to&nbsp;admit their mistake and move
 ahead.&nbsp;

            I am horribly confused why anyone would buy a Surface RT thinking they could install legacy software? It was very clear from day one that RT would support apps only, that is why there are different versions. &nbsp;If you made a mistake with what you purchased
 you should have returned it, but blaming MS for selling a product that does exactly what it says it does is rather pointless. &nbsp;As is expecting them to offer you some type of upgrade option, If I buy a older model TV without wifi built in and expect that a
 newer model with wifi somehow entitles me to get a new one is just plain silly.
<div><br />
<div>Know what you are going to buy, it is funny I remember many people being upset that they couldn't install mac software on their ipads when they first came out as well. &nbsp;Here is a real hint if you are going to buy electronics, take the time to do some very
 basic research before making a purchase and then complaining that it doesn't do what it never said it would do.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The surface RT is a stand alone tablet, like most tablets it is built to run apps. &nbsp;The Surface Pro is full Windows 8 computer running in a tablet form factor, it will run any programs that a Windows 8 computer will run. &nbsp;This is exactly as was announced
 by MS during their initial launch event and every press event, and product&nbsp;description&nbsp;since then.</div>

            <blockquote>
<p>I agree about doing research first but some people like me bought it for half recreational and work reasons.&nbsp; This tablet has Ms office which isn't for recreational purposes unless you make lemonade stand posters all day. I'm concerned because BlackBerry
 is bragging about 18,000 apps to review and their phone's isn't even out yet. Maybe a better way is to state what you use this tablet for. This is what I use this tablet for:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet (web browsing)</p>
<p>Facebook </p>
<p>Facebook games like word with friends which I love.</p>
<p>Comixology</p>
<p>Transfer TiVo shows to my tablet for when I'm commuting to work</p>
<p>Gmail </p>

<p>Some games I admit are great like: </p>
<p>Nightmare from the deep</p>
<p>Angry birds star wars</p>
<p>Words by post</p>

<p>I can't print from my tablet and I'm having a hard time finding a suitable printer. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I happen to be an elementary school science teacher so I would like to be able to use it for work and connect to my projector in the classroom. Unfortunately I use an iPad for work and if it wasn't for their Greg app teacherkit which tracks all of my students
 progress (150 plus) I'd chuck it as soon they develop the app for Windows RT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me the barriers between Windows rt and Windows 8 should be removed or let bluestacks app work to allow the huge nbr of android apps to work would be terrific too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I have three wireless network printers at home.&nbsp; When I tested the printing function the first time, all three came up and all three printed.&nbsp; If you do a little research you will find that the RT has built in compatibility with a very large number of devices.&nbsp;
 If you go to Best Buy or Costco and pick up a low end wireless windows compatible printer it should come right up and print seamlessly.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth connection not working anymore in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a UE Boom speaker which was paired and working fine with my laptop that runs Windows 10 and suddenly it quit working.&nbsp; It shows that it is "connected" but no sound is produced. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the bluetooth driver for Windows
 10. I have reset the UE Boom speaker itself at least 4 times. I have run trouble shooter for Windows 10 updates and troubleshooter for Bluetooth and still nothing after 2 hours of this. Under "sound", the UE Boom does not even show, just the built in speakers
 are registering . The UE boom works fine with my Android. Thanks for your help.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Try to add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />3. Try uninstall and reinstalling your Bluetooth drivers and look for updates first
<br />

            After 51/2 hours of dealing with this, including 45 minutes on hold for a Microsoft technical adviser and then 1 hour with him, the issue was still not resolved. He wanted me to restore my computer to an earlier date. Uh no. I had already done everything
 he did on remote assistant.&nbsp; He could not solve the problem. That "session" ended and since this started after the wonderful Windows latest update, I&nbsp; decided to uninstall the new and "improved"&nbsp; update and voila, the bluetooth worked. I wasted so much valuable
 time today. It is time for a MAC.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When do you receive this error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you trying to connect any external USB devices?</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run the Hardware and devices troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link “<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</a>”
 to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check in the Device Manager for the Device entry with SBRE. Once you find the device, uninstall the device by following this step:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “start” button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “Device Manager” in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “View” tab and select “Show Hidden devices”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check if you find any device with exclamation mark on it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If so, right click on it and select “Uninstall”.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you uninstall the device, restart the computer for changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Once you restart the computer, download the drivers for the hardware from the Manufacturer’s website, then install it and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the links to update the drivers.</span></p>
