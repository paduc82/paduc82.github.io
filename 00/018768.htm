<h2>            Lumia 930 dead after update on win10</h2>
                    I got a lumia 930 and recently updated it to windows 10. The update completed without problems and I was able to use the phone for about a day, then when win 10 installed updates for my phone the phone restarted and did not turned back on. I tried almost
 everything (including volume down + power button) but nothing worked, the phone where completely dead. I then tried using the "windows device recovery tool" with the phone connected to the computer. At first this tool didn't find my phone but after holding
 "volume down + power" with the phone still connected to the pc, the phones screen started to show the Nokia logo. At this stage I left the phone for a while (giving it time to try to start). After some time the screen turned black and the text "<span>ERROR:
 unable to find bootable option, press any key to shutdown</span>" showing in the top right corner. Now I gave up trying to boot it without a reset, I repeated the steps above but this time I used the recovery tool to reinstall the phone. During the process
 the screen of the phone turns red and a progress bar is showing, everything worked fine here except that when the progressbar was fully loaded the phone just turned black. On the computer an success message was given. I let the phone "work"- as that is what
 I suppose it was doing, even though the phone looked completely dead. After about 20-30 min, the screen finally flashed and I got to chose language for my newly reset phone! Now the phone finally successfully booted, but it was back on windows 8. After some
 playing around with it and a few restarts i decided to re-install windows 10. I downloaded the "update advisor" and followed the progress, the update was successful and my phone now back to win 10! The phone worked for jet an other day, then it decided to
 update and... guess what? -The problem was back! The phone restarted and refused to turn on! Arghhh!&nbsp; I have now repeated the steps taken above to the stage where windows 8 is up and running. Now I don't know what to do, update the phone to win 10 and probably
 have it crash within a day or two, or stay at win 8, that's nothing compared to win 10 in terms of usability. As my phone is in the list of supported devices I hope that a fix for this will come out, and that Microsoft is aware of the problem. If not, this
 might at least alert them. If anyone else got this problem, hope this post could help you and please leave a comment.
<br />
And for Microsoft: Is this an known issue and how can I make my phone run with windows 10 without crashing within some days?<br />

 they have a lot of problems. Why don't you try communicate with Microsoft via telephone?

You can get the "update advisor" app from the store to enable the windows 10 update.

<p>In that case, I would not wait for Microsoft-Mobile and go for the&nbsp;app&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ed2b1421-6414-4544-bd8d-06d58ee402a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Insider</a>&nbsp;» Release Preview. According to my personal tests,
 this gives exactly the same as the app <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=fbe47e4f-7769-4103-910e-dca8c43e0b07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 the SIM slot and the SIM and post your Product Code (059…) written in the SIM tray.</p>

<p>Although you were able to recover your phone, I would give it to my retailer. The retailer sends it to a local but authorized repair facility. That error message indicates a hardware issue normally, which might not be noticed by Windows Phone 8.1. Better
 to get it repaired today, than to wait until your warranty is over. Or it is related to your E-mail accounts – do you use a work E-mail account with Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)?

Dual boot configurations is the best way in my estimation to evaluate Windows 10, an article was written showing you how to do that.

This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM.

            <p>Hi Blake,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you want to go back to your previous operating system:</strong></p>
<p>You'll need to reinstall your version of Windows from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC (typically DVD media). If you don't have recovery media:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> or
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span></span>: You might be able to create a USB recovery drive. For more info, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a USB recovery drive</a>. If you didn’t create a USB recovery drive before you installed the preview, you can
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create installation media for <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span></a>.</p>
<p>

            <p>In addition to my previous reply about the Rollback feature, probably the best protection is to create an Image Backup of Windows 8.1 to an external USB drive before you install Windows 10. Remember currently Windows 10 is still a work in progress.</p>

<h2>            Help with Sumifs formula</h2>
                    
<p>I am new to using the sumifs formula and specifically I am trying to sum the absolute value of a column of sums with two criteria.</p>
<p>I am using the following formula =SUMIFS(J38:J999,E39:E991,B5,J38:J1000,"celeste")&nbsp;&nbsp; and the result is 'VALUE"</p>
<p>The sum value I am looking for is that of the data in&nbsp;column J</p>
<p>E column represents the first criteria range</p>
<p>b5 = 1st criteria and column</p>
<p>J is the 2nd criteria range</p>
<p>"celeste" is the 2nd criteria</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>

<p><br />
All the ranges have to be the same size.</p>
<ul>
<li>J38:J999 </li><li>E39:E991 </li><li>J38:J1000 </li></ul>
<p>Also, your sum_range and one of the criteria_ranges is the same:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<span><span>=SUMIFS(<span><strong>J38:J999</strong></span><span>,E39:E991,B5,</span><span><strong>J38:J1000,"celeste"</strong></span><span>)</span></span></span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>So, what you're saying there is: sum J38:J999 if J38:J1000 contains "celeste".</p>
<p>Houston, we have a problem! &lt;g&gt;</p>

<h2>            Cannot drag and drop text from IE11</h2>
                    <p>Up until about a month ago, I was able to select and drag text and URLs from IE 11 into other applications.</p>
<p>I am no longer able to do this (even with protected mode disabled as suggested in other posts).&nbsp; As soon as I start to drag the selection, the cursor changes to the "no, you can't do that" cursor&nbsp;(circle with the slash through it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried resetting IE11 and tried running with all IE add-ons disabled.&nbsp; Still no drag and drop.
</p>
<p>I have this problem with computers running Windows 7, Windows 8.1&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions??</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I also tried to drag and drop from the new Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; Same issue.)</p>

<h2>            Explanation&#47;interpretation of a formula . . .</h2>
                    <p>I found this formula online and it works beautifully (pulling the left most numeric values from a string), but I don't understand what it is doing. I'm hoping someone can explain how/why it does what it is doing: &nbsp;=LOOKUP(9.9E+307,--MID(I18,MIN(FIND({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0},I18&amp;1234567890)),ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&amp;LEN(I18)))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically - what is 9.9E+307? And what is INDIRECT? &nbsp;Thank you! &nbsp;</p>

            <p>9.9E+307 means 9.9 times 10 to the power 307. This is (almost) the largest number that can be entered in an Excel sheet. (The actual largest number is 9.99999999999999E+307, but that doesn't make a difference here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The INDIRECT function converts a text string to a cell reference.</p>
<p>Let's say the value in cell I18 consists of 5 characters, so LEN(I18) is 5.</p>
<p>"1:"&amp;LEN(I18) is then equivalent to the string "1:5".</p>
<p>INDIRECT("1:5") is the range 1:5 consisting of rows 1 to 5.</p>
<p>ROW(1:5) is an array consisting of the row numbers of this range, i.e. the array {1,2,3,4,5}</p>

            <p>9.9E+307 is a very large number, that is used to find the largest number returned by the other parts of the formula. You could use any number in its place, as long as it is larger than what you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for up to 3
 digits, the formula could use 1000 as the value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>INDIRECT allows the range referred to to change dynamically, which is required to build up the array of lengths for the extract.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example will help. &nbsp;Say you have &nbsp;B12T &nbsp;and want 12 returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&amp;LEN(I18))) &nbsp;will return the array &nbsp;&nbsp;{1;2;3;4}</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIND({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0},I18&amp;1234567890) &nbsp;will return &nbsp;&nbsp;{2,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14} &nbsp;and the MIN({2,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}) will return 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MID(I18,2,{1;2;3;4}) &nbsp;will return&nbsp;{"1";"12";"12T";"12T"} &nbsp;and the unary operations -- converts those to&nbsp;{1;12;#VALUE!;#VALUE!}</p>
<p>
</p><p>=LOOKUP(9.9E+307,{1;12;#VALUE!;#VALUE!}) &nbsp;then &nbsp;gives the largest value, as the final result: 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your value has two groups of numbers - say, B12T43R, the MID will return&nbsp;{"1";"12";"12T";"12T4";"12T43";"12T43R";"12T43R"} which will convert to&nbsp;{1;12;#VALUE!;#VALUE!;#VALUE!;#VALUE!;#VALUE!}) &nbsp;and still return 12</p>

<h2>            Installed font working in Excel, Powerpoint, &#38; other programs, but not Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Kingthings Extortion TrueType font, freely available on several font websites, e.g. dafont.com. &nbsp;The font outline previews look normal when opened in the Windows Fonts folder. &nbsp;The font works in Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint as well as several
 other programs like Notepad and Gimp. &nbsp;However, it does not work properly in Microsoft Word. &nbsp;The font appears in Word's font list, and the font name in that list has the stylized preview. &nbsp;Yet the font on the page does not appear as it should; it looks more
 like New TImes Roman.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attaching a screenshot where you can see that the font is working in Excel, but not in Word.</p>
<p>I've restarted Word and the computer, but no changes.</p>
<p>Surface Pro 4</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>MS Office 365 Pro Plus Version 1609 (Build 7369.2127)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            It's5 year's old I am willing to bet that the usb port is shot if your phone supports wireless charging you can buy a cheap charging mat on eBay or you can buy a new port on ebay they are not very hard to change yourself you can get a step by step guide
 on youtube or take it to a service centre if you buy the port ( about $5 to $10 max ) a phone repairers shouldn't cost more than $20 to 30 or so au dollars

<p>As far as I'm aware there aren't any third party video players available for download for the 808 Belle FP2. You mentioned UC Player, but that is a S60v5 application so it's not compatible with your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;You're better off converting videos to a device friendly format using the excellent Free Studio 5 video converter.</p>

<h2>            OVI Music and Nokia Music store login issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday Nokia rebranded Nokia Music store to OVI Music in India. Earlier I had Nokia Music Store account as OVI login was not supported in Nokia Music store.</p>
<p>So my Nokia Music account and OVI login were different.</p>
<p>Now when login to music.ovi.com and select India as country , I am asked to login.</p>
<p>I can login with my OVI id but then dont see remaining tracks and download history.</p>
<p>I login with my older Nokia Music account and I can see remaining tracks and History.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of my friends report that in their case , their Nokia Music and OVI account are merged and tracks and history details are still there.But this has not happened in my case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know when Nokia will be able to merge 2 accounts for me. or is there any way I can do it myself? I know that similar thing happened for OVI share and Sports Tracker accounts but they were eventually merged with single OVI account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have replied this in other thread too-</p>
<p>"Me too having same issue, i got an email from nokia music that our older usernames have been changed with OVI at the end of old username and password remaining the same. As soon as you receive this email u can see your download history of earlier . and
 i tried to login by my friends account too by putting OVI at the end of username, the balance of tracks was there but download history is not there. So i think we all have to wait for that email to come from nokia music care to confirm about our account being
 updated with download history."</p>

This was done in case of Share on OVI, Sportstracker , so please find solution and do it.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have 2 different logins for all this.<br />
<br />
This is really bad job and you need to correct is ASAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone from Nokia reading this?????????????</p>

<p>Just got email reply from Nokia Care saying that they won't be able to merge my older Nokia Music account(which has not become OVI account also) and my normal OVI account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is sooooooooooo bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whoever planned for migration of accounts, re-branding services at Nokia Music or OVI music ,w hatever you call it. should be asked to clean up their act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very angry. Another missed chance of integration.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think that copy and paste isn't implemented property on many apps for the N97 for its keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most reliable way is to close they keyboard, when the keypad or handwriting interface appears, click on the icon with the three horizontal lines, cut/copy/paste is always there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've highlighted anything prior to switching, the highlights stay selected.</p>

            You should split your database into a front-end file with all the queries, forms, reports, macros, &amp; code and a back-end file with only the tables. Place the back-end on a network share and distribute a copy of the front-end to every user.

            <p>To add to Duane's post, once you split your db, you place the BE on a central server, then you relink your FE to the new BE location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd urge you to create a persistent Between the FE and BE at the startup of your application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you must share the DB over a wired LAN connection. &nbsp;Trying to share a DB over a WAN or wireless is known to increase the risks of corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always, once you deploy your db, be sure to put in place a backup strategy in case you ever experience issues.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure I understand the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to share an Access database (BE connected to an FE) then some of your options include:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Remote Desktop</li><li>TeamViewer</li><li>CITRIX</li><li>Terminal Services</li><li>Using/Creating a Web Database (assuming you do not need any VBA)
<p>
</p><p>The last true solution, IMHO, is that if you need a WAN enabled database, a proper Web Database, then you need to switch technologies altogether and use something along the lines of MySQL, SQL Server, … in combination with PHP, .NET, and the likes.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In all of the above (excluding using a proper web database - PHP, .Net, ...), you'd setup the db on a PC/server and then remotely connect to it using the technology of your choice (RDP, TeamViewer, CITRIX, ...).</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 - Macros wont disable</h2>
                    <p>I have set macro security to "Disable all macros without notification", but Excel still permits macros to record and run. &nbsp;How can I stop macros? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to be fine, but then I switched the macro security to "Enable all macros" for 10mins to look at a specific workbook with a macro in it, but then I switched the security back to disable, but even though the radio button says its on the disable setting,
 Excel still lets macros work.</p>

            <p>I suspect there is some interaction with trusted documents.</p>
<p>Once you have opened a file and enabled its content it is likely to be noted as a trusted document and it will subsequently open regardless of your macro security settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want this behaviour you should go to the trust center &gt; trusted documents and check the box for Disable trusted documents.&nbsp; Alternatively you could clear the current list of trusted documents using the button on that page.<br />

<h2>            can&#39;t build a link on unbound forms</h2>
                    <p>I have a form (Form1) with a text box (Text0) that contains: =[Forms]![Master]![Combo15].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anytime that I&nbsp;change the&nbsp;Master!Combo15, I have a Macro which requeries Form1!Text0, to reflect the change.&nbsp; Master!Combo15 is for a field called "Comzip."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now would like to put a sub-form on Form1 that is based on&nbsp;Form1!Text0 (which is based on Master!Combo15).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I place the sub-form on Form1, and I attempt to link master and child fields, I receive the error:&nbsp; can't build a link on unbound forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I link the subform?</p>

            As an aside, may I suggest that you use more meaningful names for your controls. A few months from now you may go back to this database and not remember what text0 or combo15 is used for.

</p><p>but since SADLY&nbsp; W10&nbsp; does not have WMC so far in it, it's not a issue.&nbsp; I hope they add WMC to w10 or I wil not be able to upgrade to it, and keep using my SiliconDust HDhomeprime box to record 6 channels of cable tv for the family

            Just got off several calls with&nbsp; representatives from Symantic, McAfee, Bitdefender and Kasperski. None have any intentions of releasing anything until Windows 10 goes out for release. Bitdefender being the only one that might be willing to do an early
 release. Told them I hope so, being I use several thousand copies of there products per year.<br />

            not sure about the robustness but the windows defender for windows 8 (and this preview) is anti-virus as well, unlike earlier versions that where only anti-spyware.

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the life of the Preview, I recommend that you use the included Defender AV application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the <strong>WinKey+ R</strong> to display the <strong>Run</strong> dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type&nbsp; <strong>"%</strong><strong>ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MSASCui.exe"</strong>&nbsp; in the
<strong>Open</strong> box (including the Quotes) and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will start <strong>Defender</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <strong>Defender</strong>, click the <strong>Settings</strong> Tab, select <strong>
Real-time protection</strong> and place a check mark in <strong>Turn on Real-Time Protection</strong>. Click
<strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a good idea to <strong>Pin</strong> <strong>Defender</strong> to the <strong>
Taskbar</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            As stated, AVG free works, as does Avira, Comodo free... for firewall, tinywall, firewall control (be noted they do a lot of popups because they are just frontends to windows firewall). Some chinese AVs also work.

            In the windows agreement which everyone signs, state something about monitoring and updating of the preview.&nbsp; Don't worry about something about South Park episode where Stan forgot to read the disclaimer for the IPAD.&nbsp; There is not some NSA guy watching

<h2>            Microsoft Word for Mac 2011&#58; &#34;there is not enough memory or disk space to complete the operation&#34;</h2>
                    I purchased Office 2011 for Mac for my previous computer, a laptop, then did a data transfer when I bought my new iMac a couple of weeks ago. Since then I have occasionally gotten this error message when I try to save, close, or reopen a file in Word.
 I haven't tried reinstalling yet. Is anyone else having this problem? I've got over 800 GB of space on my harddrive, so space there is not a problem.

<div>The other fun thing that happens is the file will appear to go blank, as will the pull down menus.&nbsp;</div>

<br />
Avoid the temptation to reinstall Office on a Mac -- That's a Windows hack that involves the Registry but is rarely a successful approach on a Mac due to how the Mac OS works. If a proper removal isn't done first it can even make matters worse or cause other
 issues to arise.<br />

<h2>            How to enter the test mode &#40;Nokia 3120 and Nokia 6131&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot enter the test mode for neither Nokia 3120&nbsp;nor Nokia 6131. I used some command like *3001#12345#...I would like to know the RSSI on the handsets, so I have to enter the test mode to get this information. Does anyone know how to do it (for both Nokia
 3120&nbsp;nor Nokia 6131)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            There is no such test mode on Nokia handsets. At least not that you can enter with an RSSI code. The phones do enter a test mode when you update the firmware, but that's all.

            As i said, there is no RSSI to enter test mode. Nokia (and other brands') service centres have specialised hardware jigs for testing phones.
