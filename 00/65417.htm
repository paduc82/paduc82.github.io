<h2>            How do I find out how many bits my computer has when I have no access to the PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently have had a problem with the strange Windows 10 automatic repair loop. I think I've found my solution, but I need to reinstall Windows 10 using the Media Creation tool and I'm not sure how many bits my computer has. Is there any way to find
 this out without accessing the computer? I need the computer to do work and would appreciate any help. I have a refurbished Dell Precision T3600 that runs Windows 10 Home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If you are planning to do a "clean install" of Windows 10 (meaning a complete wipe of everything on your PC), then I'd recommend the 64 bit version.</p>

    <title>Disconnecting from XBL - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disconnecting from XBL</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my Xbox 360 Slim since last summer (so for about a year now) and I've never had a problem connecting, and staying connected, to Xbox Live. I usually use ethernet because wireless isn't very fast at my house.</p>
<p>Last night we had about 5 people over, all of which brought their own consoles and connected to xbox live. Now at first I thought that our internet had just been maxed out, as I couldn't connect last night either, but no big deal. I just hopped on one of
 their consoles.</p>
<p>This morning the problem continued, however, even after they have all left. My Slim connects to XBL just fine, I can play for a bit (about 10-15 min) and then I get disconnected. I've tried using another ethernet cord, same results, and I know the router
 isn't the problem (same router I've always been using). Then I tried connecting using the built in wireless that comes with all Slim models and I get the dialogue box that says, "To connect to a wireless network, make sure you have an Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter
 plugged in."</p>
<p>Well that's helpful...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've restarted the modem, router, and xbox, and the problem persists...</p>
<p>Any help you have would be awesome. I know all signs are pointing to my xbox being the problem but I don't want to hear that right away. Keep in mind, I'm not very tech savvy, so any keep help you can offer should be as dumbed down as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I may have found out what the problem was, but if I'm wrong I'll give that a try.</p>
<p>Last night, when those friends were over, we were one cord short so I donated mine and tried to connect wirelessly.</p>
<p>This morning (after my original post), I reset ALL my wireless settings, disconnected from the wireless network, and reconnected. This time there was no dialogue box telling me to plug in a wireless adapter! :) So then I turned off the Xbox and reconnected
 via Ethernet. So far I've been online for 1 hour without getting bumped off.</p>
<p>I'm thinking maybe my Xbox was getting confused as to which method to connect to : Hard line, or wireless, and was switching every so often. No real way to know for sure, but that's my theory on it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversity Update</h2>
                    <p>During the install of windows 10 my computer went to the black screen with the working circle, it stayed like that for more than 24 hours.&nbsp; A hard boot and windows came back up, but after a normal shut down, the next start up had the same black screen for
 more than 24 hours.&nbsp; Now after several other hard boots and creating the recovery media disk, the computer is non responsive.&nbsp; The recovery disk allows various trouble shooting options, but none of them work and a clean install would not work because of some
 type of partition issues.&nbsp; So what is next? Can windows 7 be reinstalled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has a SSD that is RAID with the hard drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you regarding your concern, we would like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you receiving an error message when performing a clean install of Windows 10?</li><li>Which part do you see the error message about partition?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can reinstall your Windows 7 by using an ISO file. Kindly check the article on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files)</strong></a> for the
 steps on how to reinstall it. Be guided that you need your Windows 7 product key to in doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

            <p>When I tried to perform the clean install from the "custom" install (on the disk) it proceeded to the point where it said none of the partitions were formatted correctly (mbr vs gpt).&nbsp; I did not dare to reformat without some reassurance that it would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After exiting the setup, I rebooted and let the computer spin for another 24 hours until I got home tonight and now it is completely dead, it won't even go through the bios setup.</p>

            I had to go in and change the bios to remove the raid configuration. Then reformat both the SSD and the hard drive.&nbsp; Windows 10 disc worked and was able to reload OS on the computer just on the SSD.

                    <p>For a year I have been having these errors on my PC using 2x 8 gig RAM sticks, so recently I decided to swap them out for my old 4 gig RAM sticks and It worked fine until I Put the 8 gig sticks back in to see if it was just a hardware issue. My PC started
 getting the same errors as it did before, So I decided to put the 4 gig ones back in but then they started getting the same errors as the 8 gig sticks. This leads me to believe it is software (drivers most likely) that is causing the issues.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many reasons that can contribute to a blue screen error. One of these is due to incompatible or outdated drivers. To narrow down the issue, provide more information by answering these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from swapping the RAM sticks, have you made any significant changes to the device prior to this happening?</li><li>How did the issue start?</li><li>Have you recently installed any updates?</li><li>Are there any third party applications or software installed on your device?</li><li>Can you send us screenshots detailing the mini dump files you have?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know these details so we can work towards a resolution on your query.</p>

<p>Probably two different RAM Module cause the issues. from different manufacturer or with different part numbers.</p>
<p>Check the Manufacturer and part Number information's with the CPU-Z third party software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. When the issues initially began it was after installing the two 8 gig ram sticks, but even after I put the old ones back in I keep getting the same BSODs.</p>
<p>2. After I installed the 8 gig ram chips and the problem persisted even after re installing windows two times.</p>
<p>3. Only after the problem started while trying to fix the BSODs with advice and help form other forums and questions on this one.</p>
<p>4. Yes, a few including drivers from hardware manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I believe I can but I am not sure as to exactly where or how to do what you are asking, so if you could just tell me exactly how I would do this then I would be very happy to send any screenshots over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well both sets of RAM sticks are the exact same model from the exact same manufacturer if that's what you are getting at with the first bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have tried MemTest with both sets of RAM sticks and each test with each set said that there was no damage to the RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just a side note I have also tested my hard drive with two different programs (a generic one and one from Seagate) and both came up negative for damaged sectors or anything.</p>

Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and major<br />
drivers. That error can also be caused by incompatible 3rd party antivirus<br />
and other startup programs and drivers. Of course there are other possibilities.<br />

<p>====================================================<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : <br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set
<br />
VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and<br />
<strong>BIOS and chipset drivers</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down&nbsp; <br />
the make and complete model&nbsp;of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click&nbsp;UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right&nbsp;Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this
<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard <br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and <br />
then Device&nbsp; Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their
<br />
latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after&nbsp;each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually&nbsp;shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers&nbsp; particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as&nbsp;needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER <br />
- check&nbsp;manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />

<p>Thanks for all of that it really helped with the drivers and updating them.</p>
<p>Now I have crashed twice so far for "memory_corruption ( nt!MiFinishHardFault+12156e )" now that sounds pretty bad but I still have the other RAM sticks that were having the same "ntoskrnl.wrong.symbols.exe" problem leading me to believe that they were both
 fine hardware wise but an old driver or something was causing those problems. Now I think that if I swap out the two 4 gig sticks that I have in there now for the other ones I will be fine because the software problems were fixed with these 4 gig sticks and
 that will carry over. But in reality I am not even sure that I have fixed the software problems all I know is that I started crashing because of memory corruption.</p>

<br />
<div>BugCheck 4E, {9a, 14084f, 5, 0}</div>
<div>Probably caused by : memory_corruption ( nt!MiFinishHardFault+12156e )<br />

<br />
Probably still the memory. The Nvidia video drivers may have been involved so check with Nvidia Support and their forums for known issues.<br />
<br />
Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for nvlddmkm.sys<br />
&nbsp;nvlddmkm+0x1e3213<br />
<br />
You have the latest BIOS, do you also have the latest chipset drivers from MSI?<br />
<br />
Nvidia - Drivers - Use OPTION 1&nbsp;to manually enter your driver info to&nbsp;get most current drivers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span>Nvidia Support - check with Support as it could be a known issue<br />
<br />
</span>Nvidia Forums - also check for forums as it could be a known issue and/or others likely to have it<br />
<br />
</span>Hope this helps. <br />

            When it comes to updating NVidia drivers I am using the GeForce experience application that can check for the latest drivers. However I remember you saying that I should check the drivers myself. However the program was made by NVidia themselves and one
 of the big purposes of the application are checking and reminding if drivers are out of date. So would you recommend I check the website or use the GeForce Experience application and If I should just check myself should I uninstall the NVidia application to
 avoid any problems or something?

<p>I really dug the swat roll featured as well as the varied melee attacks and that omni tool blade looks sick.</p>
<p>The release date is welcome, with all the new releases this fall (and wtf witcher 2 for xbox as well!) I'm going need all the time I can to get my saves ready for various conclusions in 3.</p>

</div>
<div>I want a definitive answer for this! For some reason this doesn't appear to ever have been solved. I am on a Samsung qx410 J01 laptop with windows 7. The wireless adapter is an Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6250 AGN. I have already tried making it so
 the adapters couldnt be disabled for power saving reasons and basically all the steps concerning that. I have done everything possible with the drivers and the software. In the events log it has this event where it drops the TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper for seemingly
 no reason? I then immediately lose my connection and it never seems to happen with rhyme or reason. Any suggestions? It does not appear to be a hardware issue either. Where is microsoft on this topic? It appears to be a Windows 7 problem...</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Do you have a wired or wireless network connection?<br />
3. Do you get any error message? If yes, what is the complete and exact error message?<br />
<br />
<strong>If you are using wireless connection try Method 1.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
<strong>Disable IEEE 802.1X authentication.</strong><br />
This issue may occur if the Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication for this network check box is selected. If this check box is selected, but there is no server to authenticate against, the connection is disconnected. If you reestablish the wireless network connection,
 it disconnects again after a short time.</p>
<p><strong>To disable IEEE 802.1X authentication, follow these steps:<br />
</strong>a) Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>ncpa.cpl</strong>, and then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>. <br />
b) <strong>Right-click</strong> your wireless network connection, and then click <strong>
Properties</strong>. <br />
c) Click the <strong>Wireless Networks tab</strong>. <br />
d) Under <strong>Preferred networks</strong>, click your <strong>wireless network</strong>, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
e) Click the <strong>Authentication tab,</strong> click to cle<strong>ar the Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication
</strong>for this network <strong>check box</strong>, and then <strong>click OK two times</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
You may try the steps in the link to create a new network profile.<br />
<strong>Create or modify network profiles</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Create-or-modify-network-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Create-or-modify-network-profiles</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong><br />
If the issue persists you may try the steps in the link and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Wired and wireless network connection problems in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windows</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4: </strong><br />
If the issue still persists you may try to reset Internet Protocol.<br />
<strong>How to reset Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 5:</strong><br />
If the issue still persists check if the service is set to automatic or not.</p>
<p>a) Click <strong>Start </strong>and type <strong>services.msc </strong>in the search box.<br />
b) Search for <strong>Computer Browser</strong>.<br />
c) Set the <strong>service to automatic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps to set the services to automatic<br />
<br />
</strong>a. Search for the service (Computer Browser)<br />
b. <strong>Right click </strong>on the <strong>service</strong><br />
c. <strong>If the service is stopped </strong>then <strong>Start </strong>the service<br />
d. Select <strong>Properties</strong><br />
e. And in the <strong>Start-up type </strong>select <strong>Automatic</strong>.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<h2>            error 0x801901f4 for verifying account, Microsoft store &#38; User profile cannot be loaded in Shared experiences. What can I do to fix this problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a syncing issue I think and I want to know how I can get it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started when I upgraded my cpu &amp; motherboard last year. W10 would ask me to verify my account. I try to and I'd get the error: Error 0x801901f4. However, the problem disappeared after a few days. And when I looked at the devices page on my Microsoft
 account. It shows that the hardware changes had been detected. So I thought the problem had been solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago, I was installing a plugin for voice attack, I wasn't paying proper attention when I was reading the instructions. I was doing something I didn't need to in a hidden folder, I wasn't paying proper attention to something I thought was easy
 to do. In the process of trying to find the specific folder, I made a mistake and screwed up my user (named) folder. I couldn't use a restore point, because there was no restore point and I was an idiot for not thinking to make one before delving into hidden
 folder territory.</p>
<p>I couldn't find any other solution to restore the user folder, so I figured I'd do a factory reset on my OS ssd. This way, I could easily get my PC working again and I wouldn't lose any of my personal files, all i'd have to do is reinstall the programs I
 use. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The error rears it's ugly head again. </p>
<p>After the reset. Every time i turn my pc on, I get notified: <strong>Microsoft account problem</strong>. It takes me to
<strong>Shared Experiences</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong>, asks for my password. I input password, get the error message.
</p>
<p>I go into <strong>Accounts</strong>, the verify account link is there, I try the password, same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the same error when I log into the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The solutions I've tried:</strong></p>
<p>I went hunting for a way to fix this problem and these two seemed&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hello-winpc/error-0x801901f4-user-profile-cannot-be-loaded/13726523-2c1a-453b-9774-bf4ebbd60fc2">relevant</a>

<p>I've tried Microsoft Account Troubleshooter, it doesn't fix anything. It just tells me that I apparently haven't enabled sync; Installed Apps isn't syncing &amp; Web Browser isn't Syncing. However, in sync settings everything is checked, my default browser chrome
 is synced. I've only used explorer once and that was to get a chrome installer.<br />
</p>
<p>Is there anywhere else I need to go to make sure i'm synced?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this in Powershell (Admin)<br />

<span>DISM.exe /online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span><br />
<span>sfc /scannow</span><br />
<span>sfc /scannow</span><br />
After restarting, the same error happens across the board for both solutions.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the&nbsp;<strong>SSL</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>TSL</strong>&nbsp;options that I can see checked in the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab in&nbsp;<strong>Internet Options</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I didn't do the <strong>Local Account </strong>switch/creation because I apparently can't use the store with the local account which means I can't access any Microsoft games, even the one I own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Ngc folder solution seems to be PIN specific, so I haven't done anything related to that</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get My PC synced to my Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>

<p>so, I've run the linked file (microsoftaccounts.diagcab file) and here are the results:</p>
<p>1. can't connect to the sync service. There might be a connection problem or the service may not be available.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Internet connection is fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. sign in with your most recent password</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - i've tried verifying my account, same error pops up again, not sure where else to "sign in"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - I then tried signing in online and then verifying account in settings again, that did not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The following settings have sync turned off: Installed Apps</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have no idea where to find that specific thing to sync. Everything that is normally visible in sync settings for synchronising has sync&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;turned on</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Authentication information is incomplete: says to open store by following very specific but weird instructions</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - I don't understand how I can open start with a click on the bottom right side of my screen, I've got the thing that just minimises all&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; windows</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- I open store my way, not signed in because of the original error. I try signing in, same error: 0x801901f4 user profile cannot be loaded</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Troubleshooting has completed. Made some changes to my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems found:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Sign in with your most recent password</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- can't connect to the sync service</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Rootcauses found and created logs</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Authentication information is incomplete</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Some settings have sync turned off</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a list of "issues found" with solutions underneath and "completed" next to them but the ! in a yellow triangle is still there. None of them have a tick in a green circle next to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do now?<br />
Because I can't do the 2nd solution (Group Policy) as I use W10 Home.</p>

<p>I tried deleting the only account setup, when I click on it there's only the option to "manage" which takes me to the account webpage.</p>

<h2>            SAP GUI</h2>
                    <p>I installed SAP GUI Version 7.30 on Windows 8 Enterprise and Professional 64bit and is fully functioning and compatible.</p>
<p>There is some incompatibility issue using Business Explorer features with Office 2010 64 because SAP libraries are written for Office 32 bit environment only.
</p>
<p>Compatibilty with Office 2013 32 bit is granted starting from patch 3.</p>
<p>32bit Office can be installed on Win8 64bit.</p>

            <p>That is why Microsoft recommends you use the 32 bit version of Office in most cases because some third party extensions are sometimes not coded to work with the 64 bit version.

            Hi Alexe, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>My advice would be DO NOT INSTALL this update. My computer installed it automatically last Saturday and now i have no computer at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every single attempt to access anything on the machine is met with Not Responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive tried safe mode from boot. No system restore is available as it goes thru the motions and then tells me that failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to uninstall the update on the restore window and that gets to about 70% and then hangs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, on Saturday morning i had a perfectly functioning computer and thanks to the upgrade i now have junk. I can see where its headed... reset, lose all the apps and settings. Thanks Microsoft. Well done 😡</p>

 of the touch pad and the pen completely break. Tapping the pen tip registers as right click and so does tapping the touch pad. Isn't there any way for windows 10 to differentiate between mouse clicks and touch pad and pen?</span>

            Hi<br />     I've done a bit of research into this and looks like it's not possible to differentiate between the different devices within Windows 10 when it comes to do hand settings. There might be a third party app bit none that I can vouch for. Sorry

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by hand settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried to uninstall the surface cover drivers so it now only shows up as HID Keyboard Device and...the touchpad works as I expect it to actually. Tapping and pressing down on the entire touch pad now registers as a primary click. Which is pretty bad
 if the official drivers actually cause it to function worse but whatever. As for the pen, it stopped being right click on everything (like on the taskbar and desktop), but it still registers as a right click when I'm using certain art software like paint tool
 sai.</p>

            Mandy,
<br />I haven't tried this myself, but see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/286701/how-to-configure-your-pen-and-its-buttons-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/286701/how-to-configu...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have system restore turned on, see if you can go back to a point before you started trying to change settings and uninstall drivers. If system restore isn't on, go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a> and download and run the MSI that corresponds to your build of Windows. If you need help with finding the right MSI, run
<br />
<br />winver
<br />
<br />and reply with the build number, version number shown and we will help you select the file you need.
<br />
<br />After you get back to a known good state, try setting the mouse buttons the way you want and then see if you can customize the mouse functions and the pen separately. 
<br />
<br />For the touchpad, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023466/surface-touchpad-use-and-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402346...</a> 
<br />
<br />If the above does not sort this out, please use the Feedback Hub App and file an issue that you need to have discrete controls for pen, mouse, and touchpad.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Please reply and let us know --

<h3> lucid enigma  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Scan for hardware changes&#39; produces virus like response</h2>
                    
<p>I have just spent two hours fixing the damage Windows did to itself!</p>
<p>Having fully uninstalled graphics drivers to clean install latest drivers I had already downloaded, I hit the 'Scan for hardware changes' button in device manager to be sure that only generic Windows display drivers were in use.&nbsp; It did the scan then proceeded
 to search for drivers without my consent through Windows update.&nbsp; I hit the 'skip this update check' or whatever button it was and it simply ignored me and continued.&nbsp; It then began installing some driver it had found before promptly BSODing.</p>
<p>I rebooted and the PC continually failed to boot properly into Windows but kept restarting itself never even realising its own failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>F8 did absolutely nothing to help as once again my OS ignored me.</p>
<p>Eventually I reset the computer during the boot sequence hoping to force Windows into some kind of recovery prompt where I might enter safe mode and manually uninstall all display drivers again and start over.</p>
<p>It did but I had no choice but to run System Recovery (no such a simple choice as 'boot in safe mode'!)</p>
<p>I then waited over 10 minutes while it checked all manner of things that were totally irrelevant, with no presentation of any possibility of control over the proceedings other than a cancel button that simply told me I cannot cancel when I clicked it.</p>
<p>Having no conceivable way of entering safe mode I eventually had to restart again, reset during the boot process again, and run system recovery again so that I can run system restore and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Why has Windows become more and more virus like over the years, removing more and more control over what it does and doesn't do and why do I have to pay £46 to email this problem to Microsoft Support because I have an OEM install of Windows?</p>
<p>If I click 'Scan for hardware changes' that's what I wish to do.&nbsp; I didn't click 'Scan for hardware changes; Search for, download and install drivers I don't want ignoring my request to stop; BSOD and then fail to boot or to provide any sensible form of
 recovery' so don't do it!</p>
<p>Applications that do things like that without your permission or control are viruses by my definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If F8 didn't respond to give you the safe mode menu when you rebooted it is probably a hardware issue. Usually either 'legacy USB' is not enabled in your&nbsp;motherboard BIOS or you are trying to use a wireless keyboard, which cannot work until after Windows
 is&nbsp;running and wireless keyboard drivers are loaded. In either case you'll need to connect a wired&nbsp;(PS2) keyboard in order to access the BIOS settings or Safe Mode boot menu.</p>
<p>System Recovery is a computer manufacturer's utility to reinstall the OS and software. It is not part of the&nbsp;Windows OS.</p>
<p>As far as the scan for new hardware function, that isn't doing anything different than it&nbsp;has been in previous&nbsp;Windows versions. Installing drivers is the whole point of using it. If you know which driver update is causing the BSOD you can&nbsp;run Windows Update
 from the All Programs menu and "Hide" that particular update. This will prevent it from automatically installing in future. Sometimes "generic" drivers won't work with specific devices.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help but unfortunately it didn't really help! :(</p>
<p>USB Keyboard support is enabled in BIOS.&nbsp; I also used an old PS2 keyboard and even tried hitting F8 on both simultaneously, just in case it requires some feat of circus act or perhaps the F8 implementer as MS used to build missile launch systems or something?</p>
<p>I'm obviously talking about a different System Recovery to you as I have no computer manufacturer's dodgy recovery and hidden partition or anything (and I wouldn't dare use them if I did as they often destroy all data), I have a proper Windows 7 DVD just
 with an OEM license.&nbsp; The System Recovery is part of the OS and will appear if something interrupts the boot process (such has hitting the reset button part way through!&nbsp; Not particularly advisable but I was left with little choice :( )</p>
<p>Scan for Hardware changes hasn't always entered an automated state of not just such searching for drivers but downloading and installing them without even asking before.&nbsp; XP would tell me it had found a new device and<em>ask</em> (novel idea today!) if I
 would like it to search for drivers and even had an option to include (or not) Windows Update in its search locations.&nbsp; From memory Windows 95/98 would simply launch some New Hardware Wizard if it found something that would give you similar options.&nbsp; In Windows
 3.x you had to manually install and configure devices anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You last piece of advise about preventing installation in the future sounded a useful idea except that, now I have got my own up-to-date driver installed, Windows Update won't find an update for me to ignore!&nbsp; DOH!!!</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and advise anyway.&nbsp; I sorted the problem in the end so this was more a rant at MS without having to pay £46 for the privilege than any need for help. :)</p>

<p>Hi Lucid,</p>
<p>Sorry if I was unclear.</p>
<p>I apologize for offending you.</p>
<p><em>"Scan for Hardware changes hasn't always entered an automated state of not just such searching for drivers but downloading and installing them without even asking before.&nbsp; XP would tell me it had found a new device and</em><em>ask</em><em>&nbsp;(novel
 idea today!) if I would like it to search for drivers and even had an option to include (or not) Windows Update in its search locations.&nbsp; From memory Windows 95/98 would simply launch some New Hardware Wizard if it found something that would give you similar
 options.&nbsp; In Windows 3.x you had to manually install and configure devices anyway."</em></p>
<p>It appeared to me that you were having an issue with drivers being updated with no option for installing one of your choice.</p>
<p>The instructions in my post were to avoid future issues of that type:</p>

<h2>            Intel High Definition Audio Driver or &#34;No Audio Output Device Detected&#34; issue</h2>
                    <p>For some reason my audio decided to stop working and I cant hear anything now, I also get the "No Audio Output Device Detected" on my hidden icons. And So I read on the Forums to manually reinstall the driver and I did. But nothing seemed to change and I
 also restarted my computer and checked if there was a issue. My computer says there is nothing wrong but obviously there is. Is there another solution to this problem?</p>

            Hi Mario, this issue is known . . .
<br />
<br />The latest Windows update seems to have a bug in it, lots of users are reporting loss of audio after the latest Update 
<br />
<br />The fix is to go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the audio device drivers they recommend, those will be compatible with your PC, unlike the ones installed by Windows Update . . . 
<br />
<br />From listening to other users, it seems Windows is reporting you have Intel HD Audio, but the driver you need is a Realtek driver from that Support Page . . . 
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty locating the support page for your PC, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 automatic backup error 0x80070015</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading the suggested posts on similar issues, and because none them correspond to my case in all aspects, I am resorting to my own post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My automatic backup is scheduled to run once a week, including a backup of the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just realized now from the Control Panel/Backup &amp; restore (Windows 7)&nbsp; window
<em><strong>(Why does it show&nbsp; "Windows 7"?)</strong> </em>the last time the backup ran
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">successfully</span> was on <strong>November 15,
</strong><strong>2015 </strong>- the last backup under Windows 7 Home,&nbsp;before I installed the Windows 10 upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backup destination is a second (i.e. not C:, the Windows/system drive) <strong>
internal</strong> Seagate 1TB drive E:&nbsp;with nearly 600GB free.&nbsp; The backup size reported is 209GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">"Manage Space" shows <em>Data files </em>using 83GB, the
<em>System image </em>126GB, and <em>Other files </em>124GB. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no button to manage the <em>Other files </em>- what are these? Can the space required for them be reduced?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just changed the backup settings to make Backup keep only the last image, and I manually deleted the oldest data file backups to save space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I manually ran the backup ("Back up Now") - and after few seconds, it failed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can my drive E: be "not ready" if I can access it normally (read and write) with other applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my backup working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All automatic <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">updates</span> - from Microsoft and other makers of apps I have on my PC - install successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why am I getting this error 0x80070015? &nbsp;How do I FIX it?</p>

            It is obvious that this problem is not happening because of bad sectors on the disk.&nbsp; As with hsb3852, Everything else works. I have checked my disk with chkdisk and with other disk checking routines and have not found any errors.&nbsp; If there is something
 wrong with the disk, it must be in something that Windows 10 needs internally that is not needed for normal operations.&nbsp; Further I have been using the image backup in Windows 10 for months without this problem showing up.&nbsp; I wonder if some Windows 10 update
 is causing the problem.<br />

            <p>Raymond&nbsp;is quite correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disk health monitoring software (HD Sentinel Pro) that runs all the time and monitors both my disks - the C: drive (where Windows 10 is installed) and the drive E: (where backup is supposed to save the OS image).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both disks are at 100% health with ZERO bad sectors. I also manually initiated tests of the disks - all &nbsp;passed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion is that both my disks are error-free. This problem, IMHO, can only be an issue of Windows Backup and/or Windows itself, like the other issue I was experiencing: unexplained cessation of operation of the Windows key on the keyboard and the Start
 icon in the Apps tray at the extreme left, which everything points to being connected to Windows Updates. In short, it appears&nbsp;Windows Update&nbsp;broke it, then fixed it - eventually (took a long time). Now I hope it
<em>stays</em> fixed :-) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started a new post on that issue, and I will come back here ASAP and add a link to it after I update it. Other people have also been suffering from that same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meantime... my Image backup <strong>still</strong> doesn't work.</p>

</p><p><span><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption. The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read the post whose link I added to the post you replied to, you will see that I have
<strong>already</strong> run SFC <strong>and</strong> DSIM more than once each, and no problems were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time I was having problems with my Windows key and Start menu icon, I <strong>
also</strong> had this Windows image backup problem., Running SFC and DSIM had <strong>
no effect </strong>on the backup; it continued (and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
continues</span>) to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no purpose to run SFC again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC updates are up to date. I have auto-update set to install all <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
non-optional </span>updates <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">automatically</span> as soon as they become available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I say: I believe the problem is&nbsp;a bug in Windows Backup and/or Windows 10 itself, just like seems to have&nbsp;been the case with the Windows key and Start menu icon issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drive E: cannot possibly not be ready - I have a non-MS backup that runs all the time and keeps a continuous backup of my important&nbsp;files from drives C: and E: on an external network drive. No application that I possess fails to access this drive&nbsp;in both
 read and write modes, so why should Backup have trouble?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can suggest a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">repair</span> that will

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you remember making any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does it happen when you try to download the file from the particular website or with all websites?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>

</span></span></span>Right click on the downloaded zip file.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on Open With.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select Windows Explorer from the list and check if you are able to open zip file.</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails change file association to Zip and check if the issue persists, follow the steps in the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default</a></p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails restart computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists,
<span>follow the “steps 1” in the following link enable to clean boot:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>

<h2>            Hosted Network Supported&#58; No after upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am not able to get my hosted network working with Windows 10 after upgrading from Windows 8.1. I am using Lenovo G510. Downloaded and installed latest windows 10 x64 wireless driver from manufacturer's website.Previously on 8.1 it was working perfectly
 but after upgrading it refuses to work. I have check "netsh wlan show drivers" and result is as following-</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/820cb7e1-2cce-40f6-b87a-739fdf71a786" /></p>
<p>As you can see that Hosted Network Supported is no here but on Windows 8.1 it was showing yes. I don't have any clue why it is behaving like so in this latest version of OS. I have also checked for Device Manager for "Microsoft Virtual Wifi Miniport Adapter"
 and following was the result</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38f3ed75-8009-47c6-8a00-2fc91ed3f153" /></p>
<p>Here it is also not showing. I have tried all possible solutions those have been posted already regarding this matter in this community but no luck with it. Please help me to resolve the issue asap. Thank you.</p>

<p>Dauert lange, ja, aber ich konnte bei BF 4 nach 10% Installation zumindest mit der Kampagne anfangen. Find ich gut.</p>

            Hallo, wollte heute mein erstes Spiel für die XBox One vor dem Mittag spielen. Habe Call of Duty Ghost um 10.15 eingelegt. Es kam die Meldung daß das Spiel installiert wird. Um 12.30 kam dann endlich die Meldung das das Spiel bereit ist! Ist das Normal?
 Wie ist das bei euch?

<p>Eigentlich ging das bei mir sehr schnell. Ryse war nach ca. 15 bis 20 min. ready to play. Bis es ganz installiert wurde, hat es aber schon 1h gedauert. Besonders ab 90 % schien es eine Ewigkeit zu dauern.

<p>Dauert es vielleicht deshalb so lange, wenn man in den Extras die Option "Updates automatisch herunterladen" aktiviert? Nachdem ich das Spiel eingelegt hatte kam die Meldung das ein Patch (1,2 GB) herunter geladen wird.</p>

<p>Bei denen die&nbsp;sich Downloads holen ist es&nbsp;mit ziemlicher&nbsp;Sicherheit ein Problem der Bandbreite.&nbsp;Next-Gen-Spiele können locker 40 GB haben. Was denkt ihr wie lange das dauert? Bei einer 16k Leitung braucht ihr dafür 5 h 33 min und das auch nur, wenn ihr die
 vollen 16k bekommt, was meistens nicht der Fall ist. Wenn ihr eine 6k Leitung habt seid ihr schon bei satten 14 h 48 min und mit einer 2k Leitung bei 44 h. Wie lange der Download bei euch dauern wird, konntet ihr problemlos im Voraus rausfinden. Wenn ihr keine
 ausreichende Bandbreite habt, dann müsst ihr eben zur Disc-Version greifen. Beschwert euch da lieber bei den Stellen die für den Netzausbau zuständig sind. ;)</p>
<p>@Moardrag: Wenn du online spielen möchtest, dann musst du den Patch installieren und bei einigen Starttiteln sogar für den Singleplayer.</p>

<p><strong>Helllo,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have the games mechwarrior 4 (vengeance, Black Knight, and Mercenaries). When I tried to play the games, all 3 would appear to install successfully, but when I would try to start them up, an icon would appear on the desktop explaining that the
 software was not compatible with this game. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My operating system is Windows 7.</p>
<p>If someone could fix this problem, please help.</p>

<p>Hi joman87,<br />
<br />
<br />
First, try running the game as administrator by right clicking on the .exe file and selecting<strong>'Run as administrator'</strong></p>
<p><br />
If that does not work,you may run the game in Windows compatibility mode.</p>
<div>Use the below link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
