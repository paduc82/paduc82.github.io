    <title>Upgraded to 10- Now Stuck in Power Save Mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgraded to 10- Now Stuck in Power Save Mode</h2>
                    <p>We upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1. Everything seemed to go fine except now the computer is stuck in Power Save Mode.&nbsp; If you turn the monitor off and back on it will tell you that it is now going into power save mode.&nbsp; We managed to start it in safe mode
 one time and got things backed up.&nbsp; At that time I changed the settings so it wouldn't go into power save mode at all, yet here we are again, only now we can't get into safe mode either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried buying a new monitor in case it was a monitor problem.&nbsp; That is not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried unplugging and replugging in everything.&nbsp; That doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We bought a digital cable instead of the old connector cable.&nbsp; That didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can we try?&nbsp; Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad part is that we didn't want to do the upgrade because it never seems to go well for us.&nbsp; But it kept asking us *every* time we logged on.&nbsp; We felt pressured into upgrading.&nbsp; We kept hitting no, but then, one day, it seemed to download the update
 even though we hit no.&nbsp;&nbsp; So frustrated and angry. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Likhitha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Basically our monitor is black. We don't see anything. If we turn the monitor off and back after rebooting, the monitor says something about "in power save mode" but that is all it says and does. It did this with the original monitor and with the brand
 new monitor. At one point we were able to bring it up in safe mode by using f8 and got it backed up and changed the power settings so that would not enter power save. It worked ok for a few days after that but now it's stuck at power save again and using f8
 doesn't doing anything. It did not do this until we did the update. Everything worked great before that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. We can't see anything on the screen. The computer is not responding to anything. We can't get to anything. Is there another trick to getting it to run other than f8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. It is an Asus Essentio, ascm6730 is written in the back in two places so perhaps that's the model. Both monitors have been Dell monitors. When searching for information about this problem, something I read led me to believe it could be a monitor issue,
 but since it's a brand new monitor, we're thinking that's probably not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would be happy to try and make the suggested changes...if we could actually get the machine to work and see something display on the screen besides "in power save mode".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we know anything about the Bios? The computer only came with minimal getting started paperwork, everything else is online. &nbsp;Seems like all the details are on the computer and we can't access anything on the computer. Very frustrating!</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>Same problem. I switched my monitor cable from serial to HDMI, and monitor came on. Try it if you have HDMI on computer and monitor.
</blockquote>
Above is not totally accurate. My problem occurred because the monitor was plugged into the onboard serial monitor port. The HDMI port is on a separate card, as is an additional serial port which also works. So the problem was that no signal was going to the
 monitor because the onboard serial port was disabled; therefore the monitor went into power saving mode.

<p>Office Professional and Ultimate versions do include Access.&nbsp; You can also purchase a stand-alone version of Access for about $229:&nbsp;
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access/default.aspx</a>.&nbsp; Access 97 is quite old, and is not&nbsp;recommended for Windows 7.&nbsp; That being said, you can probably get it to work.</p>
<p>You can try to run it in Compatibility mode.&nbsp; <span>
Click </span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span>, type&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong><span>
 in the search field, and click the </span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong><span>
 key. This will bring up the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.&nbsp; Click </span>
<strong><span>Next</span></strong><span> and it do a quick check on your machine.&nbsp;
 It will ask you to </span><strong><span>Select the program you're having problems</span></strong><span>
 with and click </span><strong><span>Next</span></strong><span>.&nbsp; Click
</span><strong><span>Troubleshoot Program,
</span></strong><span>then check the box for
</span><strong><span>The program worked in earlier viersions of Windows...&nbsp; Click Windows XP (Service Pack 2)
</span></strong><span>and click</span><strong><span> Next.&nbsp;
</span></strong><span>Click the box for
</span><strong><span>Start the program.&nbsp;
</span></strong><span>It will attempt to open the program as if you were running XP. After the program attempts to open, click
</span><strong><span>Next.
</span></strong><span>Now it will ask if it worked for you.&nbsp; If so, click
</span><strong><span>Yes, save these settings for this program.&nbsp;
</span></strong><span>If you clicked Yes, every time you open the program now it will open as if it was running in XP.&nbsp; You're done if this worked!</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes that method doesn't work.&nbsp; For those cases,&nbsp;there is a new feature called&nbsp;XP Mode, which will install a virtual machine for you to run&nbsp;your program &nbsp;in.&nbsp;
 It's not too hard to get configured; it actually installs a legal copy of Windows XP for you to run your program in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a Microsoft article on how to get it set up:&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hello I have a HP Envy Laptop and I have noticed an issue when the laptop boots up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop will load the Pre-Login screen, then will hang for ages, then it will flash the login screen, then will hang some more and then finally will load into the main desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to solve this and to stop my laptop taking (literally) five minutes to load.

<p>Hi Tameika,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue that you’ve encountered when your computer running in Windows 10 hangs on boot up can be caused by corrupted system files or a software conflict has occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To isolate this concern, we suggest that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">start your PC in safe mode</a></strong>. Windows will start using a minimal
 set of drivers and services to help us troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you’re in the safe mode environment, try to check if you’ll still experience the same behavior when you reboot or restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’ll wait for your update after trying the steps.</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>I have some further developments. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I had a chance to do the safe mode boot up I have done the recent Microsoft updates. Now just then when I have turned my laptop on I got the pre-login page and then (after waiting three minutes) I got the login screen and the whole thing froze, stuck
 on that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I had to restart it and thankfully, was able to get it to load this time.

<p>
</p><p>Ok so I have restarted in Safe Mode. The start up was so much faster!!! I couldn't believe it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now as mentioned above, when I boot up the laptop it now goes to the pre-login in screen, hangs for ages (longer than before)&nbsp; then I get the white icon that looks like the old Messenger icon, then it hangs, then the login screen pops up, hangs, then
<em>finally</em> loads into the desktop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!!</p>

<p>We appreciate the update that you’ve provided with your concern. Here are the steps that you can try to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <strong>Disable Fast Startup</strong>. It is a hybrid-hibernate mode that affects the shutdown behavior of your computer and may result it to hang during the boot up process. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>Power Option</strong> in the <strong>search </strong>box from <strong>
Start</strong>, then click on the result.</li><li>Once the Power Options window appears, select <strong>Choose what the power button do</strong> located on the<strong> Control Panel Home</strong> section.</li><li>Click <strong>Change settings that are currently available</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Turn on fast startup (recommended)</strong> option.</li><li>Once done, restart your device and check if the issue will persist.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check for available updates for Windows 10</a></strong> and also for your
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">drivers</a></strong>. Installing an update may also include fixes and enhancements to your computer. Also, it improves the
 performance of the device drivers that you have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know your concern has been resolved.</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done what you suggested. All of my drives are up to date and I unchecked the<strong> Turn on Fast Startup</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has made the boot up slightly faster and the black screen has disappeared after the log in screen, but it still hangs on the pre-login screen.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for sharing what did to help resolve this issue, the boot speed of your computer may have been affected if there are many applications being loaded during startup. To check this settings, please open
<strong>Task Manager</strong> by typing it on the search box and choose the <strong>
Startup </strong>tab and disable the applications listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly let us know the result if there are some changes with the speed.</p>

<h2>            Restricted settings</h2>
                    Hello, my name is Matthew. Recently My computer has been acting up lately. Quite a few of my PC settings have been restricted from Myself, such as Cortana and Privacy settings. At the top, there is a string of red text quoting,"<em>Some settings are managed
 by your organization.</em>" This irritates me, since I am the only human who uses this PC, and my account has Administrator privileges. Another thing, is that no accounts on the PC use an account made by an organization, all of the accounts on the PC are outlook.com
 accounts, or hotmail. This started in Windows 10 Home OS on an earlier build. Also, the PC is now OS Build 14393.0 of Microsoft Windows 10 OS, and Version 1607 and the problem continues. (By the way, I had to downoad the 14393.0 &nbsp; Build with an Executable
 Program from&nbsp;http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=823759 [Windows10Upgrade28084.exe])

<h2>            I know my picture password, but not my text password</h2>
                    Its been about a year now, and I've been using my picture password because I forgot my text password long ago, now that I had a little scare by needing it or bricking my computer (Which I found another route) I find that I should definitely know what my

<p>Não abre o console, porque se abrir o console, você perde a garantia, deixa do jeito que tá e leva num técnico ou tenta se informar se a garantia cobre isso. Deixa ele um tempo desligado, 1 dia pelo menos e depois tenta ligar ele de novo, não ligando, leva
 no técnico ou vê a garantia.</p>

<p>Não abra o seu console de maneira nenhuma!! &nbsp;Espere secar e tente ligar normalmente. Caso continue assim, ligue no suporte e conte o que aconteceu. Caso vc queira, poderá mandar para reparo fora da garantia. Tem um preço pra isso e o atendente te dirá qual
 é. Se vc abrir o seu console para seca-lo ou mandar para algum tecnico faze-lo, vc nao poderá mais contar com a garantia Microsoft e nem com o reparo fora da garantia. Se mandar o xbox violado (sem o lacre) para o suporte oficial, vc sera banido.

<p>O Certo era nem ligar o Xbox, tentar deixar em algum lugar que a luz do Sol bata ou apelar pro secador... mas por ter ligado ele após cair água, fica mais díficil, mas nada é impossível :D</p>

<p>Indepentente de abrir e secar, provavelmente foi líquido para algum circuito eletrico, e com certeza, aconteceu algum curto-circuito.</p>
<p>Vc terá que levar em um técnico especializado e ver quanto fica o custo (derepente não compensa arrumar). Garantia esquece, já que não é um defeito de fabricação.</p>

<h2>            kb2809289 causes black&#47;grey screen after boot&#47;login</h2>
                    Hello, when I boot up my netbook asus 1201n, Windows 8 pro starts as usual. But after showing the loginscreen I get an alternating black and grey screen. I can hear (and see at the led) the hard drive working, but besides the alternating screens, noting
 happens. After days of determining the problem (and reinstalling Windows 5 times) I found update KB2809289 to be the cause. All other recent updates can be installed without problems.<br />
<br />
I ignore this specific update for now, but would like to install it for security reasons. Also I am afraid to install coming updates as I don't know whether it will be causing problems or not. I found it particularly difficult to restore Windows when this problem
 arose (especially without the possibility to start Windows 8 in safe-mode). I have to reinstall Windows every time when I encounter those alternating screens, so that's a lot of hassle.
<br />
<br />
So a solution for this problem would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>1. Asus 1201n</p>
<p>2. No</p>
<p>3. yes, on a usb stick. I already tried that; didn't work.</p>
<p>4. No, if I do install this update, the described problem arises.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't think drivers have anything to do with this. I installed the same Windows version on the same system 3 months ago without problems. All drivers were working fine, without problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problems arose after updating Windows about 6 days ago. At first Windows didn't start up properly: after the login screen I ended up with a screen with only the taskbar and an icon (for my anti-virus software) visible. Nothing else but a black screen.
 Later I found out explorer.exe did not start automatically. Executing explorer using taskmanager did work though, this way everything went back to normal.</p>
I tried everything I could think of (and could find on-line) to solve this, but to no avail. Eventually I decided to reinstall Windows. Since then, the black screen problem arose, but only after letting windows update the latest patches. I reinstalled Windows
 5 times. The last time I installed all recent patches from this month one by one, restarting the system every time to check which patch was causing the problem. This was I found out it could only be KB2809289 causing the problem. The system is now fully updated
 and working like it should, but without KB2809289 installed. This means all drivers are working fine, as they did before.<br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
I was preparing to install KB2809289 to see if I could get into safe mode using the method restarting from the sign-in screen (as described at 'method 2- note'). (Though I think I made a mistake here; what I described before as the login-screen, seems to be
 just the welcome screen. So I doubted there would be a opportunity there to restart into safe mode. Don't think so actually.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, to prepare for the install I unhid the KB2809289 patch. Doing so, also appeared an earlier similar patch, kb2792100.<br />
Just out of curiousity I installed this patch first, which went smooth. Then I installed the dreaded KB2809289&nbsp; patch. And guess what? This did the trick, Windows did start up as it should!<br />
<br />
So I am quite happy now, but not satisfied; this shouldn't have happened in the first place. And I still don't know what went wrong here. So I also can't trust future patches. It's going to be a scary moment; every time I have to use Windows update. Especially
 because I found it <span><span>inevitable to reinstall Windows being the only solution. And it's an big and frustrating operation</span></span> to get your system back the way it was before...<br />
<br />
So I still would like to hear suggestions/solutions for this problem, please.<br />

            <p>This may be too late but if you still cannot boot to normal screens try something simple.</p>
<p>Either restart or cold boot, your choice, but this works every time. </p>
<p><strong>Login</strong> (note the computer screen is normal at this time, colors, image, etc.)<em> keyboard</em> works as you login and&nbsp;you can click on the
<strong>eyeball image in the password box</strong> and change the password from stars to text and stars will return when the mouse button is released.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This much tells you that windows 8 has booted and windows (explorer) is running properly.</strong>
</p>
<p>Then after you click to enter the password and continue to the user screen you get the blank black screen of d***. At this point windows
<strong>&lt;explorer&gt;</strong> has been <em><strong>suspended</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then after a 15 or more second pause press the <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Del&gt;</strong> keys and you will be shown a troubleshooting screen with at least a&nbsp;list of 4 selections. Click on
<strong>Task Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the blank black screen. wait for about 10 seconds (seems like an eternity - right) but a window will pop up showing the Task Manager's contents.
</p>
<p><em>Note: If it shows a blank area, click the lower text on the left to show all (usually the "Hide Microsoft..." &nbsp;files has been clicked in a prior session).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The status of the <strong>explorer</strong> app or operating system is never shown here.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the text link at the bottom right for the "<strong>Resources Manager</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here <strong>explorer </strong>will be shown in&nbsp;(maybe) a color [mine is blue from personalization's]
</p>
<p>On that line you will see on the right that resource manager&nbsp;shows <strong>&nbsp;explorer is "suspended</strong>".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point I got my screen back by going into the<strong> task manager </strong>
<em>&lt;File&gt;</em><strong> </strong>menu item and selecting <em><strong>&lt;add a new task&gt;</strong></em>. The new task must be
<strong>explorer</strong> and the <strong>administrator</strong> or <strong>administrators</strong> right
<strong>checkbox</strong> must be <em>clicked</em>. Then <strong>Ok</strong> the selections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediately your&nbsp;<strong>&lt;<em>background&nbsp;screen&gt;</em></strong> will be back. that does not fix everything but most things will be back.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some <strong>icons</strong> and/or <strong>tiles</strong> will be dead ended. Some will be working&nbsp;great like the Internet explorer[version 10 - mine]&nbsp;or whatever browser you use will be working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial &nbsp;cause on my system [x64] was an update that turned all windows services to
<strong>&lt;disabled&gt;</strong> and I had to [as administrator] manually select each services properties box&nbsp;[right click] select &lt;<strong><em>automatic&gt;</em></strong> and &lt;<em><strong>start&gt;
</strong>then</em> <strong><em>OK</em></strong>! to close each services properties box. That is a two hour chore. . . . once done; however, &nbsp;you will not have to do it again. And, you will not have to install windows again and again on itself then reinstall
 all third party apps [maybe - mine still work but see below]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do this as much as you need to troubleshoot. I'm not done yet, but Microsoft wants $99.00 to fix their $66.00 operating system.&nbsp; I'll be back with more info even if it is to say at 75 years old . . . I'm still working on this . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: What or where is this, &lt;WINDOWS&gt;Key? My kbd still works after 20 years, its programmable and the first 12 function keys &lt;F1-F12&gt;are on the left with 12 &lt;F13-F24&gt; more on the top row in sets of 4.&nbsp;</p>

I do not know which version I'm using. Purchased HP Sept.2011. About&nbsp;3-4 weeks ago a new tool bar appeared above the existing Live Mail window with a save file icon. I assume it was an automatic update enhancement. With in days we discovered that we could no
 longer print the entire email or any attachments, unless we saved them as a .txt document and then printed the save document. If we try to print the email from widows live, all it prints is the header (To:, From:, &amp;,Subject:). I contacted HP and they referred
 me to Microsoft/Windows. MS/Winows sent me here.</p>

As a workaround, I suggest that you saved the email message&nbsp;in Notepad before printing. To do that, please follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Sign-in your account in Windows Live Mail.<br />
2. Double-click the message you desired to print.<br />
3. Press <strong><span>ALT+F</span></strong> then click<strong><span> Save</span></strong>.<br />

            Highlighting page didn't work for me. <br />
Is there a fix available so we can go back to printing whole email from windows mail without the workarounds.<br />
Or is there one and I have missed it?<br />

Please verify if you have tried the previous workaround given to save the email message in notepad before printing. Another workaround is to upgrade your browser to Internet Explorer 9.

    <title>Microsoft MIDI Mapper Fail. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft MIDI Mapper Fail.</h2>
                    After using FL Studio 12 for a few hours today, my playlist stopped making sound. The Metronome played and the samples in the browser still play, but nothing in the playlist plays.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After further research I discovered that the possible cause of my dilemma was that the
<em>Microsoft MIDI Mapper</em> had failed and was no longer sending MIDI signals to play patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I received an error message; "Undefined External Error".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried to use register edit to help, making a new entry named "UpperFilters" which was supposed to fix my problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem only exists in one project file, and I need this fixed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you.&nbsp;

            Hello DMS8375,<br />
<br />
There are 2 ways in which this can be accomplished.&nbsp; The first is a simple one.&nbsp; Just copy the font to the Font Directory located at C:\Windows\Fonts which will install it for the system to use.&nbsp; The other method is to click on the font file at its current
 location.&nbsp; It will then give you a screen that shows the font preview and there you will see the button to install the font right at the top of the screen toward the left side.<br />
<br />
Regards,

    <title>How Exactly Does Matchmaking Work in this Game&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rehab grimace  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Exactly Does Matchmaking Work in this Game&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Am I the only one who thinks matchmaking is completely broken?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I mean, aside from the completely unbalanced teams (even in lobbies w/ no party bigger than a duo &amp; even in Merc Mosh where parties aren't allowed, the teams are split up in very, very unbalanced sets), I constantly see "need more players..." when the lobby
 is completely full, the 40 second timer resets itself (more than once) for no apparent reason (even when the host doesn't leave), I can back out of a lobby &amp; get thrown right into a match-in-progress w/o ever see the main menu, I always see "game session no
 longer available," and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Does anyone have any insight or info on whether or not any of this is being addressed or even known? I mean, one of 3arc's strengths during BO1 was their line of dialogue w/ the community, but there's nothing close to that for BO2 -- not here, not on the
 cod forums &amp; not on Twitter. I'm just wondering because I really enjoy this game &amp; aside from the community, I have mostly positive things to say about the game, but the matchmaking is starting to make me want to play different games.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There is NO matchmaking in MP, its totally random. Let me rephrase that. In normal core modes the ONLY matchmaking may be a "locale" type search (to have you in games with people near you), but I dont think rank or stats nor "skill" effect this in any way.
 I have been in parties of 5 and we were the top5 scorers on the leaderboards, but the next game will start and we pick up (by matchmaking or whatever) the top scoring player from the other team, LOL). There may be a small stat/rank matcher in there somewhere,
 but I think its mostly just searching for the best host after it places you in lobbies with people near you (which helps connections, theoretically). League Play has a "skill" matchmaking , but its based off of wins and losses ONLY. I would assume it places
 you in lobbies after a "locale" type search (which is good), then it matches off WL. Most of the time core searches seem random, JMHO.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 preloading profile of the last user logged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 4llan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 preloading profile of the last user logged</h2>
                    Scenario: I have a Windows 10 PC with multiple users. If I was the last user logged and someone login in the next hours, they see under my username that I'm logged. When they try to shutdown, the warning that other users are connected pop-in.
<p>
</p><p>This is not a problem with fast-boot, since it's disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have time to search this strange behavior and find some threads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/preloading-user-profiles-in-background/00697550-d32d-4490-a10f-82bfd15ef09c">Q: Preloading user profiles in background</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7n5bfa/do_you_hate_how_windows_10_opens_up_every_single/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Do you hate how Windows 10 opens up every single program after a reboot? Well boy do
 I have the remedy for you! How to restart to a blank desktop in Windows 10: The mediumish way.</a></li></ul>
<p>So, this is a "feature"? Where's the official documentation explaining this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested a shutdown using the "Alt + F4" and my user don't get pre-loaded (pre-login, whatever this "feature" is). The other users of my PC will always shutdown using the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, with multiple users this behavior is annoying. Can I disable this without workarounds?</p>

<p>Yes this is not good, my menu/tool bar is missing as well. By the way I loved the new message I got from win 10 here is what it told me "it is taking a little longer than usual, but we are sure it will be ready soon" Did they mean that the menu bar would
 be ready soon or what would?</p>

            I can't seem to get my toolbars, either. A short-term solution is to click on the 3 dots at the right edge and then select "Open with Internet Explorer". Everything is back to the way it was! Now, how about getting it on Edge, Microsoft????

            I just checked and it really is IE 11, bet the edge people will be adding this feature or we will still be running IE 11. With all of this location stuff that they want to know they should explain why they took or menu bar away, they should show a little
 good faith on there side if they want us to trust them because I do not like to be tracked 24/7. Why do they really need to know where I am ??&gt;???

            Shaking my head and saying thank you, thank you, thank you &nbsp;, two days of pulling my hair out and I have relief. So I go on using chrome and use IE when I need it . So much for the great new browser, they have to fix this. I am sure this effects millions,
 if fact I don't see how hardly anybody can completely do without the command bar. They could not have done this on purpose, a code writer had to back slash when they needed forward slash.

            <p>Don't be upset if your win 10 Cortana quits working after a reboot, I know how to fix it. It is kinda like taking the tie wrap off of a new loaf of bread it always seems like it has been twisted on backwards, in other words you have to twist it clockwise
 to get it off (just the opposite of what you would think) Lefty loosen -- Righty tighten, the geniuses at Microsoft have used some of that same logic on the new win 10 control surfaces, now I have always wondered what type of people worked at the bread factory
 twisting the ties on backwards ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what I noticed buttons that look on or off and buttons that look off are on !!!! I just wonder what type of people think backwards like this ??? Just be very careful when trying to make sense of it.....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Open the new "Microsoft Edge" browser (Get on the Internet). Click on the three dots at the top right-hand corner of the page (More actions). Click on "Open with Internet Explorer". You are now back to using Internet Explorer as your Web Browser, with
 all it's Toolbars, Menus and Favorites, which are still saved.</p>

<p>It's been going on for over one month now. Half of the posts for about the first ten pages here are about the same thing: achievements not unlocking. For a bit of personal amusement I spoke with MS support the other day and the guy I spoke with thinks that
 achievements and their progress are stored on the game developer's servers. Apparently MS are unable to fix this problem!? Well he is right in one sense: the technical team at MS cannot fix the problem, but that's for very different reasons.</p>

<p>Hey, you won't believe this. I don't know whether someone at MS finally got a right telling off for allowing this issue to go on for so long, but my achievement just randomly popped less than 30 minutes ago!? Was this MS or was it the game developer who
 fixed it? Anyway, I finally got 100% in Hitman; until episode 3 comes out, that is. I hope your achievement pops sometime soon too, Sir Mauz.</p>

    <title>What causes burned DVD&#39;s to have momentary pixelation during - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kipg  say:</h3>
<h2>            What causes burned DVD&#39;s to have momentary pixelation during playback&#63;</h2>
                    I have burned many DVDs on my system (os: xp) successfully, but recently when i do so, i am beginning to see that during the playback of newly burned DVDs, i see random moments where the audio has clicks and the video pixelates - sometimes pausing the
 video, then automatically resuming as normal. this occurs anywhere from a few times (annoying) to more - sometimes making watching a DVD unwatchable. i have both an older burner and a newer burner and i have utilized both. there have been no changes, modifications
 or additions to my system over these past several months and any default settings in my software (nero) have not been changed. during the burning process, no error messages appear.
<br />
<br />
when i play back on the burners, there is no video issue. <br />
when i playback on a stand alone player, this pixel issue arises. <br />
so does that point to the player as having the problem? <br />
and if so, why do earlier burned DVDs played back on the stand alone player not have this pixel issue and recently burned ones do?<br />
<br />
thanks for any help.<br />

            <p>What DVD Authoring software are you using?<br />
<br />
It's possible that the drive in the DVD Player needs cleaning.<br />
Have you tried the problem DVDs on a different free standing <br />
DVD Player just for comparison?<br />
<br />
Maybe it would help to use the slowest burn speed.<br />
<br />
And it could be an issue with the brand of DVD Blanks. <br />
<br />
Also the content (file formats) of your DVDs could be an issue. <br />
<br />
Believe it or not...multitasking when video is being encoded for <br />
a Video DVD can cause issues.</p>

            as i mentioned, the authoring software i have been using is nero.<br />
<br />
and i have already 'cleaned' the player and drive - though it is really difficult to determine how thorough a job that it did. but this was the first thing i actually performed before submitting my question. even still - my older burned DVDs continue to play
 fine with no issue - as i mentioned.<br />
<br />
i considered burning at a slower rate, but i would rather find out what the problem might be and then correct it - or at least find out why this is happening. but i know that i may never find out and be forced to resort to this as a default option.... ; /<br />
<br />
the brand of DVD's are ones that i have always used - and never had a problem with before.<br />
<br />
as for the file content issue: i thought this might be applicable as well, but after watching the video file on my computer before burning, i determined that all of this was probably happening during the burn process.
<br />
<br />
and i also considered the multitasking issue as well, but this minimal activity had not affected previously burning dvds.<br />
<br />
thanks for your suggestions to help. maybe someone will respond who has successfully resolved the same issue.<br />
<br />

            Sounds like you have tried everything...<br />
<br />
When you find the solution, please share it with this forum.<br />
<br />
And BTW, I recently solved some intermittent issues very<br />
similar to yours.&nbsp; My fix was installing a new burner.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
And you did not mention if you tried the problem DVDs on <br />
a different stand alone DVD Player.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
One last thought...I had issues with Nero and found that the<br />
freeware DVD Flick worked well when burning Movie Maker<br />
.wmv files to Video DVDs.<br />
<br />
Cheers...

            <p>I have experienced the same problem you have described.&nbsp; I used Windows 7 slideshow creation utility and the resulting video played on two different players showed no problem for about 75% of the video then the last 25% showed pixelation, pausing (at times
 for a few minutes) and so on.&nbsp; The video played back on the same player I used to burn the video showed&nbsp;very little&nbsp;problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;burned the video at a slower rate and the problem persisted and since video editing uses up a lot of processing bandwidth, I did not run any other tasks while encoding and burning.</p>
<p>This is a very annoying problem.&nbsp; I have no clue to the cause of the problem.</p>

            <p>Burning at a fast speed can cause problems with inaccurate burns, so changing to a slow burning speed&nbsp;is classified as a solution to the problem, rather than a way around it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing to try is lowering bitrates, lots of dvd players can have trouble with dvds burned at greater than 8,000 and this figure needs to include both video and audio bitrates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DVD manufacturers can use and/or swap their dye manufacturers or the same dye manufacturer can upgrade their dye. This means although you are using the same make they may be totally different. Even some makes have several factories and one made in China
 may be different to one made in Taiwan, so I'd buy a different batch of dvds to trial. It could just be a faulty batch, it does happen.&nbsp; I know, I burn hundreds of dvds every week, and have this problem even with the high quality taiyo yuden disks that I buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi tasking is a hard one, as it only needs something to be using the same data route as that which the dvd burner is using to cause a glitch. I'd turn off everything that you don't need to be running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the issue show up at the same point of the movie in each dvd player?</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Does the problem occur on each dvd player but at different points in the movie?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first tends to be bad disc, the second bad authoring/burn.</p>

            I have also tried burning at a slower rate as well - but to no avail!<br />
it is annoying for sure.<br />
the real mystery to me is the fact that virtually nothing had changed on my computer: no new programs added, no viral/trojan infections, no change in settings, no change in the methodology i used to burn dvds!<br />
<br />
one day what i burned was perfect - as it should be (and i have burned a lot of&nbsp; dvds) , and the next - this pixel issue starts! and since then, it has been a consistent problem on everything i burn to dvd. playing these discs on a stand alone player and my
 computer tend to show the pixel problem.<br />
<br />
i have always had two installed dvd burners and before this problem, a way older burner went out on me and i installed a brand new one that burned dvds just fine - up until the fatal day. that left the new one and a slightly older hp burner as my burning options.
 but as i mentioned: they both now give the same results - the pixel issue.<br />
<br />
also - when i burn regular music cds or data discs, both of my current players/burners do so without error. wft?<br />

            as i mentioned in another reply, i have done all the obvious things to help resolve this pixelization problem, but nothing has worked - including changing the burning speed.<br />
<br />
with regard to lowering the bit rates, my question would be: why would this now matter, since i had such a long history of previously successful dvd burns? why would the need for a bit rate change be needed, since nothing has changed externally - no different
 external player - nor any substantive change in my computer system?<br />
<br />
also as i mentioned, i sometimes burn data to a dvd disc, and have yet to receive any burn errors - or data errors when i do this. it is only when i burn a movie or video to dvd!<br />
and i do not multitask when burning either.<br />
i have used a range of blank dvds: magnavox, verbatum, memorex, maxell, etc in the past before this problem appeared - and this has not changed.<br />
<br />
as for your question: <br />
<p>Does the issue show up at the same point of the movie in each dvd player?</p>
<p>yes it does, however, if i re-burn the same video to another disc, the issue reappears, but usually at different points during playback.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
it is pretty obvious that the issue is a 'bad authoring/burn.'<br />
the question is why is this such a chronic issue now - and what can be done about it?
<br />
re-install my software? did that already. <br />
clean by burners? did that first. <br />
buy an new burner? one of my burners was only a few months old (but both do the same thing).<br />
try adjusting the burn setting? did that too, and no change. <br />
try multiple burns of the same movie and/or change a dvd maker? done and done - and still no change.
<br />
pull my hair out by the roots? now THAT will do a lot of good....!<br />
<br />
and it is very odd that both burners (a new one and slightly older one) would suddenly be affected at the same time and give the same pixel problem. but when i burn audio cds, there are no problems at all.<br />
<br />
this is driving me nuts!<br />
<br />

            <p>Why to change bitrates and the reasons for is very complicated, but it si all to do with the way a dvd is burned, the de[pth of the laser burn on the disc, the way the laser reads this on the player. Different players have different capabilities for reading
 bitrates, so generally for SD dvds it is best to keep below a combined figure of 8,000.</p>
<p>This of course does not totally solve the problem, but 99% of the time should help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What were your video bitrate settings?</p>
<p>What were your audio bitrate settings?</p>
<p>What make of disc have you used?</p>
<p>What type fo disc is this? -/+R</p>
<p>Does it have the same pixelation issue on a variety of stand alone dvd players?</p>
<p>In the same place each time?</p>
<p>Have you tried a different make of disc?</p>
<p>If not, do, if yes, what was the result?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try downloading some other authoring software, there are some good free ones and/or many trial versions of paid for apps.&nbsp; Author and burn your dvd with one of these and what is the result?&nbsp; Here'sa good one to try
<a href="http://www.dvdflick.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dvdflick.net/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try saving your movie as a data dvd or to a hard drive/flash disc and borrow a friends computer and author/burn your dvd using this?</p>
<p>What is the result?</p>

            you asked some really great questions, but most of them i have already answered. please reread the last post i made, as well as the others.
<br />
<br />
fyi - the bitrates are standard burning rates - as i have mentioned before, i tried lowering them, but that did not help. i have used 4330 and 3382; resolution 720-x480 (CCIR-601); encoding mode - 2-pass VBR; writing speed 2.4x (3324kbs)+<br />
<br />
i have already mentioned the make of discs i have used - but i have always used dvd-<br />
<br />
i appreciate your interest and attempts for help.<br />

            <p>Sorry, I reply to tens of q's a day, it is often best to get the answers you want in one place so you can digest the info readily, to try to some up with an answer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not see any previous reference to your audio and video bitrate settings, speed of burn, type fo disc used or the make you are using this time, just a list of what you've used in the past. This is no use to anyone a you aren't having a problem in the
 past, the problem is now.</p>
<p>I don't see any mention of trying on a&nbsp; friends computer, other dvd players, using other software.</p>
<p>In fact, reading quickly through all the answers you've given I can't see an answer to any of the q's I've just posed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of&nbsp;answers you've just given are no use, standard burning rates???? What is a standard burning rate?&nbsp; My standard burning rate is 7600 for video and 256 for audio. I'd rather not assume you use something, I'd rather get the real answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't the time or inclination&nbsp;to answer these questions, I'm afraid that's all the help i can give.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Olha ai, eu tentei e consegui jogar ! Eu mesmo criei este texto e públiquei em inglês para a Microsoft.</p>
<p>Olá meus amigos este problema aconteceu comigo também. No primeiro olhar te Eu acho que se o problema é com o meu dispositivo de armazenamento, unidade de memória (pen) ea memória do sistema. Mas eu percebi que não porque eu formatado todos os dispositivos
 e limpei as 3x de cache e desligar o consle, depois de eu ligar, mas o problema (tela preta quando eu começar um jogo ou aplicativo) continuar acontece, mas eu tenho uma boa idéia, eu removido o cabo Ethernet causa eu não tenho Wifi, eu uso o cabo, e eu faço
 isso. </p>
<p>Siga os passos. </p>
<p>1 ° Desligue o console. </p>
<p>2 ° Remova a conexão, cabo ou desativar o Wi-fi. </p>
<p>3 ° Tur em seu console. </p>
<p>4 ° Escolha o seu perfil e jogar qualquer jogo que você deseja. </p>
<p>5 ° Conecte sua rede, cabo / Wifi e pressione o botão home, faça o login em seu perfil e divirta-se!
</p>
<p>Aqui funciona, mas se eu tentar jogar ou abrir qualquer aplicativo, se eu estou conectado no meu perfil a Tela Preta voltar, porque isso eu acho que o problema é com a verificação da conta (se é que são de ouro ou não) porque eu estou no Xbox Casa e tento
 participar de uma sessão de amigo a mensagem dizendo: Você precisa ser um membro de ouro para jogar com os amigos, mas eu sou ouro! Aí está o problema!

    <title>Windows Installer &#34;Preparing to install...&#34; and hanging for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrduane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Installer &#34;Preparing to install...&#34; and hanging for unknown reason.</h2>
                    Updated some software yesterday, with no issues reported and the software runs fine, but now Windows Explorer locks up because Windows Installer starts but just hangs. I have tried to cancel but it hangs.
<span style="font-style: italic">However</span>, this only happens when I use the left pane. If I click on "Windows7_OS (C:)" in the left pane, I can navigate and do what I need in the right pane. As soon as I try to expand the view of the C: drive in the left
 pane by clicking on the arrow, Windows Installer comes up. I ran the FixIt utility and once again it has proved useless (tried on other issues in the past and has never been of use).
<br />
<br />
And, of course, Installer doesn't say what it is trying to install. Note that this occurred
<span style="font-style: italic">after</span> I installed and ran my software and <span style="font-style: italic">
did not</span> happen while trying to install anything. What can I do?

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message you get when trying to browse using Windows Explorer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which Microsoft fixit have you tried?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Unregister Windows Installer, and then reregister Windows Installer.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Click <strong>
Start</strong>, type <strong>cmd</strong>, right-click and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>b) Type the following commands and hit Enter after each command:</p>
<p><strong>msiexec /unreg</strong></p>
<p><strong>msiexec /regserver</strong></p>
<p>d) Restart your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refer: How to resolve Common "Windows Installer" Problems -
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Stop and restart the window installer service</b></p>
<p>a) Click on Start , type "<b>services.msc</b>", the click on OK.</p>
<p>b) When the Services window loads, navigate to the “<b>Windows installer</b> ", the double click on it to open it.</p>
<p>c) Click on stop, wait for few seconds and then restart the service</p>
<p>d) Make sure the "<b>Startup Type</b>" says "<b>Automatic</b>" and started. If it doesn't, use the drop down menu to change it.<br />
If it already says: "Automatic", then click on the "Recovery" tab at the top, and change the "First Failure" line to "Restart the Service", then click on "apply", then OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p><b>You can try running a SFC scan and check.</b></p>
<p>This issue may occur if a particular system file is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>You may refer the Method -The System File Checker tool in the following KB article:</p>
<p>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</p>

            <p>Hi there,<br /><br />Remeeming errors can be caused by issues on the account itself. Be sure to check if your billing information is correct at <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> and also check <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com/services</a> for any outstanding amount issues, these need to be sorted prior to being able to redeem codes. <br />After that try redeeming the code on both xbox console and via xbox.com/redeemcode</p><p><br />Also check that the Xbox Live account , the console and code all match region wise, using different regions for any of them cause issues too.<br /><br />If you can't find anything wrong and it is still not working, best thing to do is to contact official Xbox Support via Phone or Microsoft Support Chat at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://suppor
