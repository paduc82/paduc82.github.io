<h2>            Can&#39;t delete birthday from Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    <div>Welcome everyone,<br />
I have a birthday problem in the Outlook calendar. All applications that connect to the server download 3 birthday (duplicated) calendars that I can't find on my Outlook account. They are stored on the server, but I cannot manage or delete them. I would like
 to remove all 3, but I do not know how. They are visible on the phone, for example, in all applications that connect to my account such as Google Calendar, Outlook. How do I delete my birthday calendar from the "server"?</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi - I have MS Viso Standard 2016 and have a similar problem. &nbsp;I can create a pdf of my Visio diagram by selecting Print and selecting pdf, but when I attempt to "Save As" a pdf type it renders incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "save as" pdf gives me about 25% of the single-page Visio diagram (upper left corner). &nbsp;I have verified that my page size is 8.5 x 11, orientation is landscape... &nbsp;Pretty much out of the box defaults. &nbsp;I reloaded Visio to my laptop about a week ago and
 don't remember this being an issue in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Problem viewing emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertschlessman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem viewing emails</h2>
                    <p>When I open my email through the ISP site I can see my inbox and all of the email in it. But when I try to view one from that site, the email texts are greyed out. I have tried to find a setting in IE 10 Security tab that would seem to apply but no luck.
 All of the Sender info shows as well as the email title but not the text of the message. This only happens on the PC that has Windows 8 and IE 10. My other system has Windows 7 and IE 9 and I can view email in this manner without any problems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Robert,
</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you have problems viewing emails on Internet Explorer 10. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.Are you using the Metro tile Internet Explorer or the desktop Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>2.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span>3.Which security software is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>4.Do you have any other browser installed?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you are using the Metro tile Internet Explorer, then you can try the desktop Internet Explorer
 and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2.</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you another browser installed, then check if the issue persists in that browser also.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

            <p>Hello, and thank you for responding.</p>
<p>The problem occurs with both versions of IE 10 and has existed since I Installed Windows 8. I installed the OS on a clean SDD so it is not related to any baggage carried over from my previous setup.
</p>
<p>I don't have any other browsers installed and would rather not install one. I have used IE through many different versions for many years. I have tried other browsers but have never found one that I liked.
</p>
<p>I am using&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials as my security software. </p>
<p>I also want to clarify the it only happens when I login to my email account at my ISP's website. They use the Ice warp Web&nbsp;Client to access email accounts.&nbsp;I can view the&nbsp;email through my Outlook.com&nbsp;account without any problem. However, there are occasions
 where I would like to do it in this manner since the Outlook.com account does not update immediately and I often need to view an&nbsp;email sooner.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be some sort of security action by IE 10. But it won't allow me to add the site to my trusted sites since it isn't an https:// site. But as I stated previously, I have no problems using my Windows 7 system and IE 9 to view the emails
 in this manner. </p>
<p>Any help you can provide would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindest regards,</p>

                    <p>Hello, <br />
&nbsp;Iv been trying to log into my accounts and it keeps asking for a code that gets send to my other hotmail account and when I log on to that its asking me for a code for my other hotmail account then the final account is asking for my phone number despite my
 not using a mobile. <br />
This is absolutely ridiculous because I have 4 days access to my account before I am completely locked out and the account is the same one I log on to my laptop with so what happens to my laptop if I get locked out of stupid OUTLOOK. I have done these code
 less than 6 months ago on all my accounts this should not be happening this often as I use all my accounts on a regular basis.
<br />
</p>
<p>Can someone from outlook explain this stupid mess as to why this is happening and help me so that it never happens again as I do not have access to 4 of my 5 accounts because they keep asking for a stupid code, despite the correct passwords being placed
 to log in. <br />

<h2>            Installed Office 365 over 97</h2>
                    I could not uninstall Office 97 so I uninstalled it piece by piece in the control pannel, choosing Excel, then Word,, etc. &nbsp;I was then able to install Office 365. I never got an Icon for 365 nor does it show in the control panel. I tried to open one of
 my Excel files but it won't let me. &nbsp;So far I've tried repairing the installation and running a "fixit program" and still I can't get it to open the file. &nbsp;The error says something went wrong and directs me to this website. I keep trying different suggestion
 from questions from other participants but nothing seems to work.

                    I am using Windows 7(64). There is a download for a compatibility issue with my scanner Canoscan LiDE 600F but I am unable to download it. I keep getting an "Error on Page" message. Canon tells me they have no problem with their end. I usspect there is
 a security issue with something but I can't find it. Any suggestions?

<p><span>Hi betty54,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Are you having issues only while attempting to download Canoscan LiDE 600F file? Do the other downloads happen fine without any trouble or errors?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, letâ€™s
<span>disable antivirus software</span></a> and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Firewall-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Firewall</span></a> on the computer as a test and then proceed with downloading the file and check what happens.<br />
</span><span><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you turn-on the antivirus software and Windows Firewall later.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may optimize Internet Explorer settings and try downloading the file again and check if can successfully download the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Iâ€™d suggest you to refer the following Microsoft knowledge base article and follow the methods listed as applicable to Internet Explorer 8:</span></p>

    <title>Onenote 2013 search function - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Onenote 2013 search function</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Microsoft Onenote frequently and have been incorporating many pictures that have text in them in a variety of notebooks. Recently I was attempting to find something that would be in one of the pictures by Crtl + E for searching across multiple
 notebooks but was really surprised when I found that it could not search the text in the pictures. However, when I finally found my page and did a Crtl + F on that page, the word was highlighted. Is there a way to enable word searching in pictures across multiple
 notebooks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Coffee bean_,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To pinpoint what might be going on, could you first try and limit the search scope granularly to just the current notebook? You then perform the same search and see if the result has improved. The default OneNote search option is All Notebooks. Click on
 the <em>(change</em>) link to change this to current notebook or current section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your text show up now?</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf4aa342-4a73-4197-b7d9-b298b9a5a921" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I'm suggesting this is that depending on the size of your notebook, the search results may have been hidden too far down in the search results list. You can also try "embedding your query in quotes".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if this is a helpful suggestion.</p>

            <em>Addendum: I wrote first reply assuming that you were using OneNote 2013 for Windows desktop, which offers searching from images across notebooks. If - as I suspect now - you are actually using OneNote Windows Store version, then I can confirm from
 my own experience that the Modern app indeed has limited searching abilities and is only capable of searching for printed text in images in the currently selected notebook.

<h2>            I can&#39;t insert a page number AND text in the footer of a Word document.</h2>
                    When I insert a page number in a footer that contains text, the text disappears.&nbsp; When I have a page number and go to insert text, the page number disappears.&nbsp; Apparently this version of Word does not allow page numbers and text in the footers.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp;
 It was possible in earlier documents.&nbsp; Is there a workaround?

<p>I'm using Word 2010 and I can insert text and a page number. Select the page number option that you want, i.e., page number to the right. Next place your cursor to the 'left' of the page number and start typing. The text should now appear and your page number
 should remain on the right. Once all your text is in place press the space bar to move the text to the required position. You will need to press the space bar a number of times if you want the text on the left and the page number on the right.</p>

<h2>            Cell Formatting and Printing issues - Excel Online</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently started working from one drive with a colleague of mine, and so far it's not too bad. However there are a few minor issues that I've experienced and I'm wondering if anyone else has had these same problems and could recommend a fix or whether
 this is an issue with Excel Online itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printing - I've moved an invoice type spreadsheet file over to the one drive that previously was saved on my computer. The formatting and spacing was set to print out in an A4 page. It was a rather nice design so I'm not wanting to mess around with it. However
 when I move over to Excel Online and print, it wants to print it in Two Pages. From the looks of things there is no way to change it to print to one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatting Cells - When I enter a cell and want to make half the words in the cell bold and the other half not, this is not possible. I'm wondering if there is something I'm missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A part from that it seems to be working fine, a few hiccups but nothing major.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Support  and Recovery Assistant for Office  365</h2>
                    My Office 365 on my laptop was working perfectly and recently started slowing down and locking up. I just noticed this app on my laptop. I assume our IT person (who is not very savvy) installed it. Is it a Microsoft tool? Does Microsoft recommend it?

            HiGeralyn
<br />
<br />Yes, Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 is a legit Microsoft tool, it is generally used for finding problems with Outlook.
<br />
<br />If you are still having issues with your Office configuration, try running a quick repair on that:
<br />
<br />follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the quick repair option, of that does not resolve the issues, choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .

            I had this problem too. I had to reinstall skype. Uninstall it from your computer and then reinstall, then search for them and click unblock. If that doesnt work,
<strong>go to the top of the Skype window and click the tab "Skype", then click "Privacy", then on the left side of that window, click "Blocked Contacts". It should have the person you blocked listed in the box there. Click on the username of the person you
 want to unblock, and below that box hit "unblock this person". That worked for me.</strong> If it doesn't work then, contact support for Skype.

<p>I bought Office Home &amp; Business 2013 less than a month ago. I installed it and all seemed to go well. I used the online support as my laptop does not have CD reader.
</p>

<p>Today, when I try opening Excel or other MS office documents, it says the product does not have licence! I then tried to reinstall and I get a message saying that they have found some problems while trying to install the product.</p>

<p>I need help please.</p>

                    I just bought an Alcatel, and wish to transfer data from my Lumia 950 XL. When I went from Nokia Lumia 635 to Lumia 950 XL, this was mostly accomplished via the Transfer my Data app. So far, I have basically gotten nothing ported over, except some photos
 and a couple of year-old Excel documents.

    <title>Text Box in Form not populating Query or Table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmg petroleum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text Box in Form not populating Query or Table</h2>
                    <p>Wondering if someone can help me with this. In Access,I have an unbound text box on a form that is populated from a another field on the form. That part works great however the unbound text box is not populating the desired field in the table. Without that
 field in the table being populated any query I build won't have the field populated either. I'm dead in the water here so any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Can you explain in more detail what the value in the unbound text box represents.&nbsp; If it is a value computed from other values in the same row (record) e.g. a control which shows the retail gross price of a quantity ordered of an item in an OrderDetails
 table or similar by means of an expression such as Quantity*UnitPrice*(1+TaxRate), then that price is always computable and should not be stored in the row in the table.&nbsp; To do so would introduce redundancy and the risk of update anomalies.&nbsp; The value should
 always be returned where necessary by means of a computed column in a query or a computed control in a form or report.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, the value is derived from the value of another column in the row, e.g., staying with the above example, where the UnitPrice and TaxRate are both derived from the ProductID value by referencing the UnitPrice and TaxRate columns in a Products
 table, then, because, while both of those values in Products can change over time, the values in OrderDetails must remain fixed as those at the time of the order, so the derived values should be assigned to controls bound to UnitPrice and TaxRate columns in
 OrderDetails by means of code in the AfterUpdate event procedure of the control bound to the ProductID column.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example in InvoicePDF.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file, the values are assigned to the controls as follows by referencing the Column property of the ProductID combo box in the invoice details subform: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Private Sub ProductID_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.UnitPrice = ctrl.Column(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.TaxRate = ctrl.Column(2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
No redundancy is introduced because the UnitPrice and TaxRate columns in the Products and OrderDetails tables are in each case functionally determined solely by the primary key of the table in question.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the NetAmount control in the same subform is bound, not to a column in a table, but to a computed column in the subform's query, for which the expression is:<br />
<br />
[InvoiceDetails].[UnitPrice]*[Quantity] AS NetAmount<br />
<br />
In this particular case the VAT (Value Added Tax) is not added in each row because the invoices are not for retail sales, so the VAT is computed and added at invoice level.<br />

<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. So far nothing. I found those solutions as well but they all didn't work.</p>
<p>The only thing that I haven't tried it .net 2.0 reinstallation. (This is server with Citrix, so I can't just unistall it)</p>
<p>I am doing a restart and see if it will give a kick, but probably not.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest version of Office 2011 for Mac is 14.7.6, if this is your current Office version, then there is no update available now for you to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Office version is older than 14.7.6, I'd like to confirm when you mentioned "do not seem to be able to install any of the updates", does it mean there is update available when you

check for updates</a>? Or does it mean that you can't find any updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we need to confirm some information to better understand your situation:</p>
<p>1.Where did you download Office from and how did you activate it? Did you activate Office by product key or by your Office 365 account?</p>

I'm running Office 2013 which I downloaded from my work's Office 365 account. &nbsp;It's been working fine for several weeks, but yesterday it went really wonky. &nbsp;I can open Word and Excel, but when I try to open a file, Word/Excel reboots and takes me back to the

                    i've been getting an icon that says there is a headset connected, though there is not one. i can kind of bypass this by turning on loudspeaker mode, but that drains the battery and is just plain annoying. i've tried to research the problem, but the FAQ
 and email sections of nokia's website don't appear to be loading for me.<br />
<br />
already tried restoring factory settings. if anyone has a better idea, i'm all ears.

            If you have a Headset symbol stuck on your screen but have no headset plugged in, its probably down due to the pop port at the bottom of the handset.<br />
This normally shorts or fuses together inside the phone when exposed to some type of liquid.<br />
You will need to take this to a Nokia Care Point and they will need to check inside the handset for you.<br />

If it has got wet, then it is not covered under the manufacturers warranty.<br />

            There is no need to check the key. If it is NOT working you will get a message to activate Office.
<br />
<br />The messages you are seeing are simply MS trying to convinceyou to spend more money. Ignore them if you don't have a real need for the new features in Office 2016.

<h2>            More currency formats in dropdown list</h2>
                    <p>In Excel for Mac, I want more than two currency formats to show up when clicking on the dropdown arrow next to the currency icon. I currently see only two -&nbsp; South African Rand (ZAR) and US$. I would also like to see Euro, pounds, etc - WITHOUT having to
 click on 'more accounting formats' and then scroll through a very long list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear, I have looked at System Preferences &gt; Language&nbsp; and Region, and set ZAR as my default there. that is not my issue.

<p>Hans is correct - the controls on the Ribbon cannot be modified. Also, I believe that the default is localized based on the UI language of the installation.</p>

<h3> ms-steve69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 640&#58; Switching between two Microsoft-accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Hello :rolleyes:<br />
i`m using a Lumia 640 DS and i asked myself how it could be easily feasible to â€œswitchâ€ the Lumia from my current connected Microsoft-account to my another Microsoft-account?</p>
<p><br />
I have read somewhere the info that the Lumia has to be reset complete to start â€œdefaultâ€ again to connect to the other MS-account. So, it is not possible to â€œswitchâ€ on the fly between two MS-accounts?</p>
<p><br />
Independent from the question about handling two MS-accounts, would it be possible to get access to two different OneDrives on the Lumia?</p>
<p><br />
640 DS Dual Sim would be optimal for supporting and configurable some more services double (like already the 2 x phones and 2x SMS areas).</p>
<p><br />

<p>'Micorsoft Account' - the account entered in settings, 'microsoft account'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This account is used for many things like find my phone and&nbsp;app purchases not releted to onedrive.</p>
<p>Don't think there will ever be a way to switch on the fly to another account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add another account to the phone like a live.com or outlook.com account, both have a seperate onedrive. You could select to sync or not sync contacts, calendar and people using that account.</p>
<p>You can currently add another account to the onedrive app if you want from the menu on the top left. This is just for file storage and can not be used as the primary phone backup.</p>

<p>Ok, thank you for info. :w00t:</p>
<p>Lumia contains an 1-year Office-365-personal and i installed the Office-app. The Office-App is also connected to my one OneDrive (the primary for phone backup, which is connected to the MS-account where also the PC Office-desktop-Apps are located).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to use another OneDrive within the Office-App as the connected now?</p>

<p>If I&nbsp;understand correctly, your PC 365 account is the same as the&nbsp;Microsoft account on the phone.</p>
<p>I don't think there is a way to use another account, which would give another OneDrive, with Office 365 on the PC.</p>
<p>Others here may give more information on this.</p>

            <p>You can't sync the two OneDrive accounts but you can add another account to the OneDrive app on the phone.&nbsp; Add the account in the onedrive app when it opens, top left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You can add the gmail account to the phone in email+accounts in phone settings. &nbsp;For phone accounts other than your primary outlook account you can select what to sync to the phone. There are check boxes for content to sync,&nbsp;email, calendar and contacts.</p>
