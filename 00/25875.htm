    <title>Only one appointment showing on Today screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrypin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Only one appointment showing on Today screen</h2>
                    I have these appointments scheduled in Calendar:<br />
<br />
Tues (Today): Normal appointment<br />
Wed (Tomorrow): Normal appointment<br />
Fri: Normal appointment<br />
<br />
But only Tues is shown.<br />
<br />
After research I found an old newsgroup thread about All Day Events not appearing in the list until the day itself (not much practical use!) and wonder if my issue was somehow connected. I
<em>did</em> have an all day event in my original series of appointments. But after seeing that thread I first changed it to normal, then deleted it altogether, but neither solved
<br />
<br />
I tried soft resets but no difference.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated please.<br />

<blockquote><br />
I've run the same tests on two separate PPCs: my old iPAQ 2210/15 (using WM 2003) and my new HTC Touch Pro 2 (using WM 6.1).
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>I did a test using the Touch Pro and was able to get upcoming appointments but as for ALL DAY, you only get the current day.<br />
</p>
<blockquote><br />
It's only an issue on those occasions when I'm trying to get back to a 'minimalist' style, with no Today plug-ins.
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I think that says it all .... minimalist style.&nbsp; When the ZToday screen was developed, I think that may well be what they had in mind .... although I would love to have the ability to pick the number of appointments and the number of days to show.</p>
<blockquote>But I'm also now curious whether I'm right about this being a glaring and long-standing bug (leaving aside the other issue of All Day Events being shown only on the day itself). Does anyone see multiple future normal appointments? I'm sure I did
 so, at one stage of my tests, but frustratingly I cannot repeat that now!<br />
</blockquote>
I don't think it is a bug as you indicated but rather a design they chose to use based upon input from users.&nbsp; I would urge you to make a request in the "suggestion box" area of the forums.&nbsp; The Mobile Device Team DOES read that area.<br />
<br />
As for "multiple future normal appointments", it only shows future appointments for the day.&nbsp; When the last one for the day has gone by, it then shows the following day.<br />
<br />
Not ideal IMHO.<br />

<h3> aleksandarobu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 Home and Business &#40;Click-to-run&#41;, German Language Pack and auto update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought two licenses for Office 2013 Home and Business, one for my laptop and one for my dad's desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we recently moved here from Germany I still frequently write emails and other documents in German and for that reason I need German spelling and grammar checking. So after installing Office 2013 Home and Business on my laptop, I installed the German
 proofing tools which can be downloaded here: http://www.microsoft.com/de-DE/download/details.aspx?id=35400</p>
<p>
</p><p>The German proofing tools work like a charm and I didn't notice any issues so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after noticing that there is a SP1 update available for these proofing tools I was wondering whether I should install that one too? I know that Office 2013 H&amp;B itself does install updates and service packs automatically since it is Click-and-run,
 but does it also automatically update the German proofing tools I installed separately?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't installed the SP1 update for the proofing tools so far and as I said I didn't notice any issues yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However now I'm about to install Office on my dad's PC and since he doesn't speak English very well yet, I bought the "German Language Pack for Office 2013" (http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/German-Language-Pack-for-Office-2013/productID.259330800)
 so that I could change the Office UI language to German on his computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is an SP1 update for the German language pack too I'm also wondering whether I have to apply it after installing the service pack or whether Click-to-run will take care of automatically updating the language pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the proofing tools I was less worried because I thought that even if they are not updated and therefore outdated it wouldn't be that much of an issue because it is not very likely for them to contain major security vulnerabilities. However when it comes
 to the language pack, which consists of considerable more than just proofing tools, I'm worried about security vulnerabilities that might be caused by a potentially outdated language pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question basically is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to manually update Proofing Tools and/or Language Packs that I install manually after installing Office 2013 H&amp;B or does Click-to-run take care of automatically updating those additional components?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t type in Chat box</h2>
                    <p>The oddest thing, I am not able to type into the chat box? This has never happened before, out of the clear bleu this started yesterday.</p>
<p>I am on an iMac (27 inch Desktop) OS X El Capitan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can type fine on my iPad but not on my desktop.</p>
<p>I have downloaded a new skype app but the same thing happens. It will let me type one word then nothing... eventually after a few minutes I can see what I typed, but it won't let me send it, unless I hit the send button several times ( too many for this
 to be normal)</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<br />Install Skype then check if its working again.
<br />
<br />If its still not working...
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>The disks often come with other, peripheral software such as OCR or image management. Go to the HP web site, or google "HP Reflash" to find out what it actually does. One possibilty is that&nbsp;it&nbsp;updates the flash memory on the printer.</p>

                    I bought a Nokia 620 WP8 in Beijing where I live. The appstore in China only has Chinese language apps and no English at all on the website. Therefore, I cant get apps since I dont read or write Chinese. When I go to the US app store or the English version
 of the Hong Kong app store and try to download Skype for my phone, it says I cant download the app since I am outside my home region. How to get Skype (and other apps) on my phone? Thanks!

            I was not able to get it sorted while in China. I was able to while I made a trip to Bangkok. While here in Bangkok, I was able to reset my country as US and download the apps I needed directly from he US app store. I havent returned yet to Beijing, so
 cant say with certainty whether the apps will work there when I do. I'll be interested to see if they do- especially skype which works fine here in Thailand.<br />

    <title>Force previous slides to conform to Master&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathan7zerozero7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Force previous slides to conform to Master&#63;</h2>
                    I have spent over an hour reading other threads about Slide Masters and my desired ability to force previous slides to conform to a chosen Master. I see that Office has made the relationship between Master Slide and changing content MUCH MORE COMPLICATED.
 So I am trying to adapt. I use Office 2010 and in my teaching need to create elementary school content in different "decks". In addition, it is common to get a slide from other source and require that the new content conform to the existing Master.<br />
<br />
In my previous corporate life I could more cleanly control the look with a Master. I did a lot of Powerpoint. That harkens back to Office 2003 of Office XP. I believe in upgrading and adapting, truly. I learned about the Reset command among the tabs. Despite
 trying reset and cutting down to the simplest group of Master and Layout slides in the Slide Master view, I cannot make a simple footer show on all the slides. In addition, the slide number and date are not showing. I went to Insert-&gt;Header and Footer -&gt; Slide,
 checked Date/Time, checked Slide Number, checked Footer, and the ckicked "Apply to All" Nothing happened on that slide or any other. If I go to a differemt slide the settings in that same bow are all greyed out again and require a new set of clicks in the
 checkboxes. <br />
<br />
Why is that?<br />
<br />
There are text boxes in one of my decks that I had to put in, so I deleted them to see what I could force into the open from the Master. Nothing upon use of "Reset". There is no big white graphic hiding anything, I promise.<br />
<br />
So I really need to learn a LOT more about the new characteristics of Masters. Can someone help me solve this before tomorrow's afternoon class and then point me to more help? I have already bought detailed (I thought) $50 books about office and they do not
 even mention the idea of using a Master to force a design into EXISTING slides, which is a very common corporate and teaching need.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant but I believe there are lots of people trying to figure this out. I read a lot of posts and the suggested tips have not worked - yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks, in advance,<br />

            <p>I'm guessing that you have a very good idea how to use Masters and layouts already, Jonathan.&nbsp; It certainly sounds that way from your explanation with just a soupcon of&nbsp;(entirely justified) rant for spice.</p>
<p>Fact of the matter is that MS made a mess when they changed the way footers/headers work going from 2003 to 2007 and onward.&nbsp; Put otherwise:&nbsp; It's not you, it's PowerPoint that's at fault here.</p>
<p>The quick fix will be along these lines:</p>
<p>Go to the headers/footers dialog while in normal view, remove all headers/footers/etceterators and Apply to All.&nbsp; Do the same in Master view.</p>
<p>Check to verify that there are no stray bits of headerfooter text on your slides or masters; delete them if so.</p>
<p>Then in master view, add a text box where you want, say, a slide number.&nbsp; Type any text you want into the text box then on the Insert tab, choose Slide Number (or Date/Time if you'd rather a date time footer).&nbsp; Format to taste.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you want this to appear on every slide, put it on the topmost master (the Slide Master itself).&nbsp; If you'd rather have it appear on some but not all slides, put it on one of the layouts then copy it to the others where you want the header/footer to appear.</p>
<p>Now they'll act more like the ones you're used to friom 2003.&nbsp; Controllable but not selectable from the slides themselves.</p>

<p>There are several types of password protection, all of which can involve passwords &amp; can be used in virtually any combination. You haven't indicated which type of password protection you want to apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password to Open (File Level)</li><li>Password to Modify [Read Only] (File Level)</li><li>Protect Worksheet (cells)</li><li>Protect Workbook</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest that you go to <strong>Help&gt; Excel Help</strong> in the main menu &amp; search using the term
<em>protection</em>. You'll find complete &amp; accurate descriptive information on protection for Worksheets &amp; Workbooks. However, the article on
<strong>File Level</strong> protection (which is what Karl referred you to) accurately describes what that type of protection does the steps are for a Windows version. They do not pertain to Mac Excel... to begin with, step 1 is "Select
<strong>File&gt; Info</strong>" which doesn't even exist in the Mac version of the program. Reply here with complete descriptive details if you have any additional questions or need further clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For File Level password protection click the <strong>Options</strong> button in the
<strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Save As</strong> dialog then supply &amp; confirm either or both. Include the check for Read-only (recommended) if you want a prompt to advise users when the file is opened. It gives them the choice of supplying the password in
 order to be able to modify the file or simply to open it in read only mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: Excel password protection cannot be bypassed so if you forget the password you will bot be able to access the file. Keep a record fo the passwords you use.</p>

                    <p>I use Essbase once a month, the Essbase Excel Add In automatically loads every time Excel starts. When the Essbase Add In is installed Excel does not work well. I have been trying to create code to automatically change the install state to false. My code
 only works every other time I open the file, the other times I get errors - any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Remove the AddIn from Excel, but keep the AddIn file in a safe place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when you need it, open Excel, double-click the AddIn file within the Windows-Explorer (or only open the AddIn file with Excel), then open your file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may happen that the AddIn set the installed flag to true.&nbsp; In this case you can try two ways to prevent that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Set Application.EnableEvents = False before you open the AddIn and back to True afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Use your code from above in the Workbook_BeforeClose event routine and close the AddIn file like this line:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Workbooks("WhatEver").Close False</p>

 that is where I ran across it. When&nbsp;opening up IE as a new user on a Windows 7 machine, I was directed there. If you run the Install now, I guess you could call it a browser hijacker, but it only runs if you click on the button and even then, you can just
 check or uncheck the items below it&nbsp;as you wish and only run the options you want.</p>

<h2>            settings button missing on navigation pane, Outlook 2011 Mac</h2>
                    I recently installed Outlook 2011 for Mac on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3. &nbsp;The navigation pane is missing the settings button and the folder list (but does show mail, calendar, contacts, tasks and notes). &nbsp;See image at link below:

<div>Is there either a registry setting to enable the settings button or is there a reset button/action for the navigation pane to restore the settings button?</div>

<h2>            Brother Scanning&#47;Outlook &#39;bug&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, hoping someone can help me out</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10.&nbsp; Have a Brother Scanner and am using Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I scan to email, Outlook no longer opens a new message.&nbsp; I contacted Brother and was in a live chat when one of their representatives.&nbsp; Did what they asked which included changing the default mail to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been mucking around with this for awhile.&nbsp; Can't send a file from a Microsoft program either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hunch it is a Windows or Outlook bug.&nbsp; I am having the exact same problem on a pc at my parent's business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use OneNote to create an audio note to record sound/voice. In a note, tap Audio. Speak and record what you want to say. Then tap Stop when you are finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also search on the Marketplace for any third party apps to record sounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p><br />
Kind Regards,<br />

<h2>            Applying a custom view to severals worksheets</h2>
                    I have a workbook that contains several worksheets that have identical columns. I created a custom view in one of the worksheets and would like to apply the same view to the other worksheets. If I select the new worksheet, navigate to View&gt;Custom View,
 highlight the view I created and select Show, it takes me back to the original worksheet where I created the custom view and doesn't apply the view to other worksheet. Am i misunderstanding the use of custom views? Anything I'm doing wrong? Thanks!

            <p>Hello Robin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The custom view created can be applied to that particular worksheet which was active when the view was created and saved. It cannot be applied to another sheet of the same workbook as well.

    <title>Can I failover to a 2nd On-Premise Exchange server&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I failover to a 2nd On-Premise Exchange server&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This is really a question regarding Exchange Online Protection, but as it is a component of O365 I'm sure this is a suitable place to raise the question</p>

<p>I want mail to be sent to and scanned by O365 and then sent to my On-Premise Exchange servers. I have one primary server and a 2nd running in a Disaster&nbsp;Recovery environment. I want mail for all mail domains to be sent to the primary but to failover to the
 secondary if an outage occurs. I'm sure this is possible, but have a couple of questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I add both servers to one connector or create two different connectors? </li><li>If the primary server does not accept the SMTP connection, will mail be queued up until the service resumes?
</li><li>In that scenario, can I manually change the delivery to point to the secondary server?
</li><li>Can I configure a rule to automatically failover to the seondary server and &nbsp;if so, under what conditions eg. Time To Live etc.
</li></ol>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
Exchange Online Protection is a component of Office 365 online services, however, as I see, your questions are mainly about Exchange on-premises servers. Since our forum focuses on Office 365 online services, we may not be very familiar about Exchange on-premises
 settings and configurations (such as failover or Disaster Recovery). Therefore, it is recommended you post these questions in the
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=exchangeserver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange on-premises server support forum</a> for professional assistance. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
Additionally, for questions about EOP alone, you can also refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj723132(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Allen.</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. However, I feel that that the question I am asking is more focused on Office365 functionality than Exchange on-prem. If there Exchange configurational questions that arise from this conversation, I will gladly take raise it on the
 other forum. I appreciate the link to that foum though.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, assuming that both Exchange servers are capable of receiving mail i.e. SMTP enabled, how can Office365 (Exchange Online Protection) be configured to send to one Exchange server and then try a second if that server is unavailable? I would
 think that there is capability to do so, much like an MX record with multiple targets assigned various costs, but am unclear of whether this can be done manually or automatically.</p>
<p>Mnay thanks</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback.<br />
<br />
According to my research, from the perspective of Office 365 (Exchange Online Protection), we cannot directly achieve this kind of goal.<br />
<br />
You had mentioned connectors in your first post. Yes, mail connector is an important tool for Exchange Online users to customize their mail flow. However, it is only the mail flow process a connector can affect. It cannot directly control how the mail flow
 continues to go after reaching a destination (the first Exchange server you mentioned). In other words, once the mail flow finds a destination, the connector’s job is already done, even though the destination cannot work currently.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I still think you need to consult our Exchange on-premises engineers to see if the failover can be set on your Exchange servers.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I'm obviously not explaining things well enough. Forget mail connectors completely then. What happens to email once it is received by an on-prem Exchange server is not within the scope of this conversation.</p>
<p>The question is, how do I configure Exchange online to send SMTP mail, once scanned for malware, to Exchange01 at Site 1 but to redirect mail to Excahnge02 at Site 2 if Site 1 goes down?
</p>
<p>Surely an enterprise product such as Ecxahnge Online has the capacity to accomodate business continuity scenarios such as these.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to configure Exchange Online to do that. There’s no such setting from Exchange Online side. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p>However, I have re-considered your requirement, and I suppose you might try a “not-official-recommended” way to see if it helps. Generally, we suggest Office 365 users set one MX record only. If your Exchange Server 1 and Server 2 can be distinguished by
 using different MX records, you may try to set two MX records with different priority levels. For example, set the first MX record to point to Exchange Server 1 with priority level 0, and the second MX record to point to Exchange Server 2 with priority level
 10. (A lower number represents a higher priority.)</p>
<p>Again, please be aware that this is not an official-supported way (actually, the MX priority levels are not designed for failover purposes at all). I just suggest you try it, and hope it meets your requirement. If it cannot work as expected, I’m sorry that
 we cannot help you further on this subject. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Do you know whether your Exchange account is an on-premises account or is it hosted through Office 365 with Microsoft?</p>
<p>Office 365 accounts are now being accessed through REST, which should be much faster than other accounts accessed through Web Services (but it could be a bug in the REST support too… I'm just trying to find out).</p>

<p>The best option is to ask your email administrator.</p>
<p>Though if your address ends with onmicrosoft.com, then you know for sure it's Office 365.</p>

1. Model of the device being used --dell inspiron 1520 - windows vista basic?? -10 years old -still meets very well, my basic needs of email/ word/fb/web and photographs - -would love to have skype back though<br />
2. Operating system running on device - intel core 2 duo??<br />
3. Skype version installed on your device - 7.36, maybe 5.4<br />
