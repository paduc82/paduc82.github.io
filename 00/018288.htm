<h2>            Permanently Disable Windows Defender&#63;</h2>
                    <p>With the most recent Windows update (end of Nov 2016) suddenly Windows Defender has turned itself back on. Windows Defender keeps disabling my Panda Antivirus and won't let me turn it back on. I'd prefer to use Panda. How can I permanently disable Windows
 Defender?</p>

            I did this, and so far it seems to be working... but I also have Defender disabled at the moment... have to wait and see if it turns itself back on and starts blocking Panda again.

<h2>            Using Field Naming &#34;worst practices&#34;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I've been doing these databases for years and am reconsidering whether I should "follow the rules" with field naming. For example, if I have a field that will appear as Acct # on a form, the "right" way to do this is use AcctNo as the field name
 when creating a table.</strong></p>
<p>I see two reasons to use "standard" naming conventions. One is whether the database will ever move to SQL, etc. I rarely see this happen with my existing Access databases. The second issue has to do with coding and having to bracket field names with spaces
 or special characters. (I suppose a third issue would be web databases... but lets set that particular topic aside for right now.)</p>
<p>I write an awful lot of code, but... I spend more time changing label captions on forms and reports then I would ever spend putting brackets around field names with spaces when I code. Form and report layout is time consuming enough without having to through
 "unnecessary" editing into the picture.</p>
<p>Just thought I'd throw this out there and see what others have to say.&nbsp;</p>

            I typically will change the ones I anticipate a need to use where having the same name (from the wizards or such) could cause a problem (like for calculated controls on reports).&nbsp; I don't normally change labels.&nbsp; I do use CamelCase when naming my fields
 and objects so that I don't have a problem later and no need for extra brackets.&nbsp; I don't use special characters and rarely use the underscore.&nbsp; I do suggest also not naming fields or objects with Access Reserved Words.

            Use legal field name (no space, no illegal character) to avoid having to use [ ] in SQL, and use Caption property in table design to avoid changing the labels on the forms. When the field define a caption, it is the caption which is used for labels on
 forms, and caption can have "illegal character" for name.

<p>Umm aren't you aware of the Caption property? You can set this property on the table level. When you add a field to a form or report it will use what's in the caption property. I'm currently dealing with an inherited database that used field names like Acct
 # and its a nightmare writing code&nbsp; to deal with controls that have inherited those field names.</p>
<p>Best practices have become best practices for a reason.</p>

<p>Like Bob, I'm a fan of <strong>CamelCasing</strong> for multi-word names. Form single word names, such as Date, Name, Count, where no detailed explanation is needed, I use what I call '<strong>Stuttering Convention</strong> .'<strong>Date</strong> ,
<strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Count</strong> become <strong>DDate</strong> , <strong>
NName</strong> and <strong>CCount. </strong>I find this especially helpful in avoiding the accidental use of a<strong> Reserved Word.</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand why that would be so. In your table design, your<br />
field is named AcctNo and the Caption is set to Acct #. When you<br />
drop the field on the form/report, you get the caption you want<br />
without having to alter it. <br />
Now, of course, this doesn't work with a non-Jet/ACE data table, but<br />
with Access, it's always worked that way, and has always made this<br />
task quite easy. </p>

<p>I would say that each of those as field names in a table has an<br />
implied more specific name. In an Invoice table, the field called<br />
Date (or DDate) should be called InvoiceDate. This is not just<br />
helpful for avoiding reserved words -- it also means you won't have<br />
collisions when you need the DDate field from multiple tables in a<br />
SQL SELECT. <br />

<p>I do the camel casing too. I'm aware of the caption property for the fields but consider that a pain in the neck because you have to click into the properties window. When I do tables, I like to keep my hands on the keyboard and keep typing. And the thing
 about special characters and field names is that one always seems to be stuck typing brackets all over the place when coding. (I will say that I really like the improvements to the autocomplete features in 2010.)</p>
<p>It would be really cool if MS would pick up on the CamelCasing for the next Access. I would really like to be able to type in a field named DueDate, have that come out as Due Date on all the labels, and then see the text boxes and so forth named txtDueDate.
 On my wish list would be to Also see that happen when one drags a control onto a form or report from the record source. I don't like text boxes named text24, nor do I care for textbox names that are the same as field names (although that rarely causes any
 problems).</p>
<p>Also on my list (while I'm ranting) is an underline property for text boxes and labels, especially needed on reports. I'm not talking about underlining just the text, but the whole textbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funny thing is I was never really bothered by this stuff until I hired a "table jockey" to lay in tables, forms and reports for some of my projects. He's working on some really complicated (layout-wise) reports and started saying stuff like, "Why isn't there
 an underline property for a textbox? Why can't I put spaces in field names? This is a pain in the neck!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granted he's a newbe, but his comments really hit home. He's got a hundred hours into a massive report, and I bet a huge chunk of that time has been spent renaming labels, drawing underlines, etc.</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>P.S. No offence meant on the "table jockey" comment. Its actually my son doing the work ;-) And I -really- appreciate all your thoughtful and helpful replies.</p>

<p>hi sheena,</p>
<p>to narrow down the root cause of the issue, i’d like to confirm some information:<br />
1.&nbsp;about “our organization has just signed up to the office non-profit program”, do you have any ideas about which office 365 non-profit plan your organization has signed up?<br />
2.&nbsp;could you please share the detailed steps of how you share a calendar so that i can try reproducing the issue from my side?<br />
3.&nbsp;i tried sharing my calendar in owa and received an email without xml file attached, only with 2 buttons:
<strong>accept</strong> and <strong>share my calendar</strong>. so, could you please capture a screenshot of the email you received with xml file attached?</p>

<p>hi sheena,</p>
<p>thanks for the detailed information.</p>
<p>i’ve run a test based on your description and got the same result as you. when i share my calendar with someone else who sets up his office 365 account into the outlook for mac 2016 client, he receives an email with xml file attached and there’s no “add
 calendar” button.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0d1f784b-6887-4d76-bc0f-60890d26455f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0d1f784b-6887-4d76-bc0f-60890d26455f" /></a></p>
<p>in outlook 2016 for windows client, there is a button called “open this calendar”. we can add the shared calendar by clicking this button. but in outlook for mac 2016 client, there is no such a button.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=05b4144c-e3b4-4757-b6f8-3553c92740b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d05b4144c-e3b4-4757-b6f8-3553c92740b5" /></a></p>
<p>however, even though there is no such a button in outlook for mac 2016 client, we can still open the shared calendar by referring to the following articles:<br />

<p>Hello Mouran</p>
<p>Neither of the solutions suggested are working for us. &nbsp;I will give you as much detail as I can:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;I am the administrator of the Office 365 account (sheenamcd@ [<em>remove by moderator to protect your privacy</em>]). &nbsp;I am using an Apple MacBook, but I am
<strong>not using Outlook for Mac.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I log in to Office 365 using Safari with the url - <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://login.microsoftonline.com/login</a>. &nbsp;I am then presented with a logon screen. &nbsp;I will include a screenshot at the end. &nbsp;My posts won't post if I have too many screenshots!</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The invites to shared calendars that I have sent so far (only 3 as we are in test mode) are to users who are all using Windows PCs, one is using Windows 8.1 and using Microsoft's Mail Program (version 17.5.9600.20911) that comes with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;The
 other two are using Windows 7, with one using Outlook and the other using Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;This morning I used a Windows 7 PC, logged on via the url given above and tried to share a calendar firstly using my admin account, and then using a non-admin account that I created for myself. &nbsp;Both invites resulted in the recipient receiving an xml
 file that couldn't be opened. &nbsp;I will include screenshots of these as well.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;So I am puzzled, as I think the issue may not be related to using an Apple MacBook as we are getting the same problem using a Windows PC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very frustrating and I do appreciate your help. &nbsp;Sharing calendars is a key requirement of the charity I am working for, so I do hope we an resolve this.</p>
<p>Many thanks and best regards</p>
<p>Sheena</p>

<p>Hi Sheena,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed screenshots and information.</p>
<p>I’ve read the whole description, do you mean that both the Windows PC and Apple MacBook receive an XML file when you are trying to share your calendar in your MacBook’s Safari browser?</p>
<p>Since you are not using Outlook for Mac client, to better understand the current situation, I’d like to confirm some more information:</p>
<p>1. Regarding “<em>as I think the issue may not be related to using an Apple MacBook as we are getting the same problem using a Windows PC</em>”, I’d like to know if the you are using Outlook for Windows client (e.g. Outlook 2013, Outlook 2016) on the problematic
 Windows PC. If so, can the user that you are sharing the calendar with see the “Open this Calendar” button? Did the user still receive an XML file in the calendar sharing invite email in Outlook for Windows client?</p>
<p>2. Since you are not using Outlook for Mac client on your MacBook, what kind of mail app you are using on your MacBook? Apple Mail? I’ve run a test from my side, I still get an XML file in the calendar sharing invite email in Apple Mail.</p>
<p>3. About “<em>The invites to shared calendars that I have sent so far (only 3 as we are in test mode) are to users who are all using Windows PCs, one is using Windows 8.1 and using Microsoft's Mail Program (version 17.5.9600.20911) that comes with Windows
 8.1. The other two are using Windows 7, with one using Outlook and the other using Windows Live Mail</em>”, what does the Microsoft’s Mail Program you mentioned refer to? Did this issue happen to the user who are using Outlook?</p>
<p>4. Could you please capture a screenshot of the calendar sharing invite email in the Windows PC?</p>
<p>Your continued patience and efforts are much appreciated.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

    <title>File duplicates are created in SharePoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morten de melolyng  say:</h3>
<h2>            File duplicates are created in SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>for some days, duplicates of files are created in SharePoint. Upon every edit, a copy is created and a number is added to the new file (see screenshot).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42fd8bee-cbf8-4805-bf44-da9b4fa8e7b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42fd8bee-cbf8-4805-bf44-da9b4fa8e7b2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we use SharePoint as a document library. We are 3 people in the company. I and one other use the SharePoint to acces files. The third person in the team has set up a OneDrive sync to his local machine, so he accesses files from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked perfectly for 2½ years. But now it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a setting in SharePoint to create versioning. I thought maybe one of my colleage enabled this, so I disabled versioning. Problem persists.</p>
<p>I also disabled autosave on a file to see if it made a difference. No effect - problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A strange thing is that when I edit a file and it replicates itself, in SharePoint it appears as if it was my colleage (the one with the local sync) who created and modified the file. My name is not there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I suspect that it could be the sync job that does something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing pointing in this direction - when I delete a file through the SharePoint interface, after a few seconds, the file re-appears. Again, from the guy with the sync to local disk, I assume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Morten</p>

<p><span>Hi Morten,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The versioning settings should not cause such issues.</span></p>
<p><span>For autosave feature, we suggest you enable it. As this supports co-authoring.</span></p>
<p><span>To narrow down the issue you have, please provide the information below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>To check if the issue is caused by OneDrive sync, please let your colleague right click the OneDrive desktop icon&gt;settings&gt;Pause syncing. Then check if the issue persists. You can resume syncing later.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the issue persists after you pause syncing, please provide the information below for our more investigation:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Does the issue happen to all the documents in this library? If so, please create a new document library to see the result. If the issue only happens to a specific document, please copy and paste contents to a new
 document to see the result. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the issue doesn’t happen any more after you pause syncing, this issue may be caused by the OneDrive sync client. Please follow the steps 1 by 1 to see if the issue can be fixed:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Right click the OneDrive sync icon&gt;Settings&gt;Office&gt;sync conflicts to check if you select “Always keep both copies (Rename the copy on this computer)”, change to choose “let me choose to merge changes or keep both
 copies” to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Follow the steps in this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-problems-207e983e-146d-404c-a994-672ef29e1f90?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you Rena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have investigated further. I agree that AutoSave is not the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, we discovered that the creation of duplicate files did only occur, when my colleague (with OneDrive sync to local disc) has his computer on. When he is not online, it does not happen. So - this supports your theory that his sync is causing the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have several libraries in SharePoint. They are all synced to local disk as described. However, only one of the libraries is causing problems. So - it concerns only files in that library. Not others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will try pausing syncing to get confirmation that the sync is the cause. And follow your instructions. Thanks - will post back results.</p>

<p>Thanks Sohel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>but given the fact, that only one of several document libraries are having this problem, I do not understand how this setting could be the explanation?</p>

<p>Hi Morten,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you paused sync to confirm the cause of the issue? And what's the result after you follow any suggestions above?</p>
<p>In the meantime, you mentioned that the issue only happens in a specific library, we would like to know does the user edit files in other libraries in the local client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

<p>So, my colleage and I did some more testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the document library in question, we stopped sync on his PC. And from SharePoint we synced again. As suggested</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">green sync icon</span> does not appear on his machine, but the duplicates keep being created when I work in SharePoint and his machine is one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&gt; so - stopping sync, and syncing down a fresh copy has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we tried the opposite. I synced down the doc library to my machine and he was the one working in Sharepoint&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&gt; same result. There was not green sync icon on my machine, but it does sync. It also creates duplicates, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, we tested other document libraries to provoke the error, but everything worked fine (and the green sync icon was on those folders).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - today we took another of the libraries and synced to my machine also. So, one library in SharePoint synced to two local copies. What happened now is very strange. Without any of the files being edited (in SharePoint or by Excel, Word, whatever), new
 copies started to appear. In the root of the folder it made about 10 copies of each file there, and name them filename+ "-1", filename+ "-2". I hurried to stop syncing to my local machine and it stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - what have we learned:</p>
<p>1) If we take a previously working document library from SharePoint and sync down locally, the problem will start there (no green icon, but sync happens). For document libraries where the sync was started months ago, no problem (and they have green icon)</p>
<p>2) if we have 2 local syncs of a SharePoint document library, and we are online at same time, the sync will "go in circles" and create copies of files - even though the file is not currently worked on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - the combination of a recently synced document library and both of us being only creates copies when file is edited in SharePoint and one of us has a sync local. And it creates multiple copies if we both have the same folder synced down (even for files
 not being worked on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>very strange - any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Rena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry for the delay. This is the current status:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) We tried pausing the sync on co-workers PC. During this pause, the problem stopped. After resuming the sync, the problem came back</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2) We tried to follow this:<br />
<span><em>Right click the OneDrive sync icon&gt;Settings&gt;Office&gt;sync conflicts to check if you select “Always keep both copies (Rename the copy on this computer)”, change to choose “let me choose to merge changes or keep both copies”
 to see the result.</em><br />
<br />
The setting was already "let me choose to merge...." - so, this was not the explanation</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3) We tried to reset OneDrive on co-workers PC as per your instructions. The problem persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Further information:</span></p>
<p><span>- The problem only exists for 1 of several SharePoint document libraries<br />
- This particular library does not have a sync "overlay" icon on my co-workers PC, but sync DOES happen - but also the duplication of files.<br />
<br />
The above leads me to believe that my co-worker's sync is the root of the problem.<br />
<br />
His OneDrive build version is 17.3.7076.1026<br />
His Windows is Windows 10 Pro 10.0.15063<br />
<br />
So - I am thinking - since the problem is only for 1 of the synced SharePoint document libraries - can we do something to remove the current sync for this library only? And to start over for this library?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            Use the Full Screen setting before closing and see if that sticks. It looks like you have the unreleased 10125 build--if my eyes are seeing the tiny print. That might have something to do with it.&nbsp;

            <p>A defective SD memory card, maybe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia phones put a lot of strain on the memory card. It's vital to purchase a genuine, reputable brand SD from a reputable retailer. Genuine SD cards come with an extended limited warranty, typically 5 or 10 years, via the retailer or directly from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for reference, which brand, capacity and speed class is the current SD memory card - and are you confident it is genuine?</p>

We have several 2015 Macbook Pros at my work (non-profit) and we use Office for Mac 2011 ( I'd like to move us to pages, etc, but there are reasons we can't).&nbsp; What I'd like to know is:&nbsp;<strong>post
 the 10-21-15 updates</strong>, has anyone had any issues with either their MacBooks or the MS apps?&nbsp; Everything I see in Apple forums and in MS forums lists one specific issue or the other that is corrected.&nbsp; I realize&nbsp; there may be other things to consider
 but the only other work related third party app we use has already said it is on a stable release (Viscosity) with El Capitan. Before I say we should all go to El Capitan, I want to be as sure as I can that we won't loose massive capability. ( I have seen
 everything from Macs that wouldn't turn on to being unable to open MS Applications- I'd like to avoid anything between those two scenarios).</p>

Thanks in advance!</p>

            Most of the issues were fixed with the release of the update to El Capitan 10.11.1, So as a test you could try installing the same on particular Mac and check for the compatibility issues prior to rolling it out to all employees

</p><p>I have upgraded three machines to El Capitan...two work and one fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One was a 2009 MacBook Pro repair for a friend. That machine had Office 2008 and everything is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another is my 2012 Mac mini - Office 2011 and everything is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there is my 2010 MacBook Pro with Office 2011. Excel and Word crash immediately after opening. I'm all up to date on Apple and Microsoft updates. I've disabled the MS Crash Reporter as some have said that was a problem. I've cleaned up the three fonts
 that Font Book complained about as some have said could be an issue. Even in Mac OS X Safe mode, it crashes immediately. I did create a new user and it seems to work there. I have no intention of moving all my stuff to a new user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly this is mind boggling on the part of Apple and Microsoft. Probably 90% of all Macs have office. They all knew from the auto reported crashes and couldn't get their act together.</p>

            <p>The answer depends on what you do with your Office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Joe said, many problems are resolved by the Apple 10.11.1 update, and that is assuming you have Office updated to 15.15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not everything has been fixed. There is still a known problem with an Outlook hang/crash that remains to be solved. The Visual Basic editor has had a feature or two added and stability improvements, but it is still useless. Microsoft Query continues to be
 stillborn. Customizing the Ribbon is now possible, but only programmatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hundreds of features were cut in the 2016 edition of Microsoft Office for Mac. It's hard to know which of these feature cuts, if any, will affect you. You can install Office 2016 and Office 2011 and run them side-by-side. My advice is for you to do that.
 If you run into obstacles, stick with 2011. If you don't hit any snags, then maybe you will be OK with 2016.</p>

            But, Office 2011 <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">isn't usable</span></strong> either -- at least on one of my machines. I've yet to figure out a viable workaround after hours and hours of research and log reading and various experiments.

            <p>Can you be a little more specific? "Isn't usable" can mean anything from an application not running to you don't know how to get a particular feature to work the way you want. If you are getting a crash, then start a new question regarding that particular
 crash. Include the update level of the application, the OS and what steps you took to generate the crash. If you were getting error messages, please include the text of the error messages. Remember, we can't see your screen and we don't know what steps you
 are taking. You have to tell us everything because otherwise we simply won't know what is happening on your side.</p>

            See my reply of October 28. "Isn't usable" means it crashes immediately upon opening. Excel crashes immediately when I try to open the application. Word may or may not crash immediately upon opening, but it will crash within seconds of opening once you
 try to do something -- even as simple as scroll the page. I'm a long time software engineer. Of course it could be something simple, but I don't know what that is. It does seem to work on the new user I created, but that isn't a viable solution. I didn't stress
 that test user, but at least they don't crash immediately when opened.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for including the error report. If you notice about the 5th line down it says Build Info is ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>That suggests that some component of Excel is missing or corrupt, or perhaps there is some system directory corruption. There could be a bad font, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start with easy troubleshooting steps first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform a <a href="http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/Safe-Boot.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Safe Boot</strong></a>. In El Capitan, Safe Boot runs Disk Utility and fixes directory problems and repairs permissions. Try Excel in Safe Boot. If it is OK then do a regular restart and things may be all fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still crash in Safe Boot, you can try reinstalling the latest Office update while in Safe Boot. If that doesn't clear things up, I'd go for a complete uninstall and then reinstall of Office.</p>
<p>

            <p>Line 5 is "Build Info", but it says "Unknown-151005~0".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Line 7 is "Parent Process" and that is "??? [1]".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously uninstalled Office using the instructions below and reinstalled. That's the install I have now.</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2398768</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously booted to Safe Boot (sometime after I reinstalled). It crashed there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not enough of a Mac expert to know is Build Info or Parent Process are unusual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other uninstall instructions I should follow? I'm game to uninstall/reinstall again.</p>

            <p>That is the correct page of instructions for completely removing Office 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have already done that and reinstalled and re-updated, I suspect the problem is not within Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you did a Safe Boot we can rule out competition from other applications. Safe boot empties the system font cache, another potential source of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you done anything with fonts? Specifically, have you removed or replaced any system or Office fonts?</p>

            <p>That smells like bad database design. It is highly unusual to have two tables with the same fields. If you are the exception, let us know why you think it should be this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, you can create a new select query, put both tables on the design surface and drag-n-drop the primary key field from the one to the other. Then you can create a column in the output grid like this:</p>
<p>Result: [table 1].supply - [table 2].supply</p>

            <p>As Tom said, duplicate table is not normally good design. But what I don't see are key fields that relate the two tables and that is mandatory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Tom said, this should be easy with key fields. You just join both tables on the key fields, add the columns you need and a calculated column to subtract them.</p>

            <p>I apologize for my first stab at database design.&nbsp; maybe you have a better idea for the design?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do my best to paint a picture of what I want to accomplish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here are the parameters:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; data is downloaded into Access 1 time a week from an excel spreadsheet (52 downloads a year).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; every download will have the same column and row headers, however the data will change</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I want is to have access run mathematical expressions between tables to show how the data is changing over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as I only have authority to manipulate data that comes in the form of an excel download my creative problem solving seems limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also the kicker is the primary keys will change over time due to a dynamic processing environment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>my idea was if I had a primary key that existed for weeks 2-10, then access could relate those tables that had the same primary keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a better approach?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the help</p>

            <p>Yes, there is a better approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel is a spreadsheet, best of breed. Access is a relational database.&nbsp;<strong>They are very different.</strong> One sheet per week is very normal for a spreadsheet, but it's simply WRONG for a relational database!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead you should (probably, your data structure is still a complete mystery to us, especially the "primary keys will change" bit) have one big table with a date field; or probably several tables with appropriate one-to-many relationships. It will then
 be relatively easy to create Queries joining the tables, or joining the master table to itself, with date criteria to allow you to compare the data from one week to that from another week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make productive use of Access you really need to design a relational database structure for your information, rather than trying to treat Access as if it were "Excel on steroids". The data may originate in Excel, but you are certainly NOT limited to working
 with it in that data structure; you can instead move the data from the 52 sheets into one relational database, and work with it there.</p>

 color scheme is not working properly.&nbsp; For example, if the slide has a multiple choice question (3 choices), students individually hyperlink two (incorrect) choices to a slide which tells the player that they are incorrect and the 3rd (correct) choice is hyperlinked
 to a slide that indicates they are correct. In theory and in the past, when one incorrect answer is chosen, that one incorrect answer choice will switch to the followed hyperlink leaving two choices remaining. In PP 2016, all text that is linked to the incorrect
 notification slide will switch to the followed hyperlink color once any text hyperlinked to that slide is clicked even though they are done separately and the text is not next to each other. Any ideas of why this happens or if there is a way to fix it?</strong></span></span>

            Hi divyamsharma,
<br />
<br />One options would be to use the free Office Online:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you can pay a monthly subscription of about $&amp; for Office 365:

<h2>            Sharepoint Online User Directory Duplicate Profiles and not all the Information Accessible</h2>
                    <p>I do a search in the SharePoint Online Member Directory and I get two choices for John Doe.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Both choices lead to the exact same profile http address in Delve.</li><li>Both choices are missing telephone information. </li></ul>
<p>

<li>Only one profile comes up.</li><li>That profile has the telephone information and it is set to show for everyone.</li></ul>

            Hi Katherine,<br />
<br />
From your description, when you access users in Delve, you get two different pages. One page has =profiledetails at the end of URL, which displays users' contact information. Another has =work at the end of URL, which doesn't display&nbsp; users' contact information.
 If so, I would like to share the information that if you click Contact information, you will acess users's contact information including phone number.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b57051-86cb-4720-8e2c-94d644422712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b57051-86cb-4720-8e2c-94d644422712" /></a><br />
If this is not your scenario, please provide detailed steps and related screenshots about the issue you encounter.<br />
<br />
Regards, <br />
Yoga

<p>Hi Tricia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you give them permission, you need to send them a link.&nbsp; Once the other person opens the link, it will appear on their My Sways page.&nbsp; If you send them a view link, it will show up on the Viewed tab and if you send them an edit link, and they choose
 to become an author, it will show up on the Edited tab.</p>
