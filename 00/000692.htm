            <p>Hi every body</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- first you have to remove the home page using the home icon on the IE browser</p>
<p>- then you add another home page also buy using the same home icon</p>
<p>and this will solve the problem </p>
<p>note : if you add a new homepage from the tool/internet option&nbsp; the ver-filmes will be back again do not do that</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful</p>
<p>rgds,</p>
<p>Feras&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Worked for me as well.&nbsp; Here is what I did. </p>
<p>Went to Program Data in C. Looked for an irregular name folder. Tried cutting and pasting the folder onto an external hard drive just in case it was not the one. Could not do it. Any time I tried to take the folder out of there it was replaced by another.
</p>
<p>Next I copied the name of the .exe file in the folder.</p>
<p>I did regedit in the start window to open the registry. Then Edit Find, and in the search bar pasted the .exe file's name. It brought up the registry entry created by the .exe file. Made a note of the registry entry.</p>
<p>Rebooted in the safe mode ( by pressing F8 as the computer booted and moving the cursor to select safe mode on the menu) Now, went to Program Data folder&nbsp;and deleted the folder with the .exe file. Went to recycle bin and permanently deleted it.
</p>
<p>Did regedit and deleted the registry entry related to the .exe file</p>
<p>Also, in the process of testing for finding the location of the virus, I found another&nbsp;folder named Adober in&nbsp;C: not program data&nbsp;with a .cpl file which was causing the browser to close down repeatedly. Permanently deleted that folder as well.</p>
<p>Re-booted normally. No ver-filmes. So far so good.</p>

    <title>How do I delete all my music tracks&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miqspix  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete all my music tracks&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have approx 590 MP3 music tracks on my 5230 4gb memory card and I want to delete them all and start afresh. &nbsp;I have deleted the playlist but obviously my music is still there. &nbsp;I then tried to delete all my tracks by marking them all and then deleting
 but I got "general system error" message. &nbsp;Am trying to delete too many tracks at once, or is there a way of deleting them, or formatting my memory card to clear everything? &nbsp;I know I could take my card out and use a PC/card reader to clean but I didn't want
 to remove the card if possible. &nbsp;Is it possible or not please?</p>

            Thanks amblors but do I understand that the Ovi player is part of the Ovi suite? Unfortunately as I understand it the Ovi suite is not available for the Mac so I cannot download it and guess the file would be too big to download to my Nokia 5230. I may
 be wrong on this ... possibly!!

<p>I've tried this on my Nokia 5230 and it does work but in my Music Library all the tracks are gone but the Artists, Albums and Genres are still listed. When I enter that category, then choose a album/artist or genre it appears empty. I have tried deleting
 and renaming them but a message saying : " File is corrupted. Operation cancelled." appears. Anyone know how to remove all the artist/ album and genres?</p>

<p>Hi Renatenata,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried refreshing the music library on the device? Also check that you have deleted the folders for your albums on your computer itself (when you connect the phone in mass storage mode). If this doesn't work, then check for a firmware update for
 your phone via Nokia Suite. Also try formatting the memory card through Windows Explorer as suggested previously in this thread.</p>

                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well after I updated my Lumia 920 (Unlocked) a few days ago the LTE/4G signal just vanished from my phone. If tried Soft Reset, Hard Reset, the ##3282# trick and nothing seems to work. I'm stuck with 2G/3G and no what matter what I do I just get stuck there.
 The signal is switching from 3G to H+ to Edge every few seconds, it's so unstable and crazy now. By the way the Hotspot feature does not work either. Please help me out :-(</p>

            <p>Hello SlayerXtreme:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with your data connection.&nbsp; Issues such as this are most often related to the SIM card or the phones firmware working hand in hand with the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have a couple suggestions you can try.</p>
<ol>
<li>You might try getting alternate APN settings from your provider and entering those in the cellular + SIM settings.</li><li>You might try using an alternate SIM.&nbsp; I might try another SIM from your carrier as well as a SIM for a different carrier to see if you have a different experience.</li><li>Finally, you can try the Nokia recovery tool to reinstall the current OS and firmware,
<span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><a href="http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/product/lumia925/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987&amp;category=softwareupdateanddownload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/product/lumia925/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987&amp;category=softwareupdateanddownload</a>
 .&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the issue continues, you might considering using the tool one more time and installing 8.0 back to the phone.&nbsp; Once on that, see if you have a similar issue.&nbsp; If you do not, check the phone for updates and see if the issue comes back.&nbsp;
 If it does not, you can consider reinstalling the developer preview to see if the issue no returns to the phone.</li></ol>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

            <p>Guys,</p>
<p>This thing has been a nightmare for me, the Recovery Tool didn't do anything to my phone, it couldn't find any software for it (it sucks big time), the SIM card thing didn't do anything and by the way I have another Nokia phone and my SIM card has 4G on
 that phone with no issues. I also flashed my phone like 4 or 5 times after I got your answer but sadly I got no fixed either. Nothing seems to work for that fix, I even flashed the phone with with a ROM that has no Developer Preview stuff in it (clean one)
 and nothing happened. Before the Cyan/8.1 Update 1 I had blazing speeds up to 38mb and now I'm at 6 or 7mb which is sad :-(</p>

            <p>Hello Slayer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the feedback.&nbsp; At this point if this is only an issue when you are running Cyan on this phone then all I can suggest is to continue to try and get the phone flashed back with a pre Cyan firmware.&nbsp; The Nokia recovery tool works for most when
 trying to accomplish this.&nbsp; If you are not able to get this to work, it would be time to contact Nokia to see if they have any suggestions on how to get the tool to flash your phone back to 8.1 or 8.0 with Black.&nbsp; If they cannot help with this it may be time
 to see if they have any other options to manually flash the firmware for you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was more I could suggest but at this point I am unaware of anything else related to the OS that would be preventing your from connecting with your 4G network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>

<h3> mauslyon---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP&#33; cannot install apps in Nokia 6120c with pc Suite 7</h2>
                    I have a strange problem with the apps installation part of Pc suite and my nokia 6120c.<br />
The phone is brand new and the pc suite was installed a new pc (no previous installation)- the pc-phone connection is made with the USB cable.<br />
Al the common parts of Pc Suite (messages, contacts, ecc) work fine so I can sync without problems. When I open the "apps-installation" part, the pc is showing the following message in the phone panel "the application is unable to show the contents of the phone
 model curretly selected" (I'm retranslating from the original in italian).<br />
If I try to install an application (let's call it APP-X) the download completes and the phone shows "do you want to accept APP-X?", however if i press YES -after the license and so on - the phone will eventually answer "Cannot install, missing main container"
 (?).<br />
If the vey same APP-X is delivered thru the DOWNLOAD! server then it is installing without any problem.<br />
any idea what can be wrong?

            I'm using "nokia application installer" included in nokia PC suite 7.0.7.0.<br />
The application (.SIS) that I'm trying to install for instance is ForecaWeather<br />
If I download it to my PC then try to install it thru the above mentioned "application installer" then I get the error<br />
If I download it directly to the phone using the Download! tool then it works<br />
<br />
hope it's clear

<p>Hi RogerBayless,</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstanding, do you mean that you successfully set up the account in Outlook for Android and after a couple days of not using it, it required you to input the password?</p>
<p>If so, after inputting the password, did the pop-up box disappear and you were able to use the app or the app kept asking for password?</p>
<p>If the latter, it should be an issue, please share with us the following information and we will further assist you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture a screenshot of the issue. </li><li>We would appreciate it if you could set up the account in another Android device for a test.
</li><li>Make sure the Outlook for Android is up to date and share with us the detailed version.
</li></ol>
<p>To upload the screenshot in the forum, please click&nbsp;<b>Use rich formatting</b> and then the<b> Insert/Edit Media</b> icon.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brook,</p>
<p>Here is the update: I am running the latest version of Outlook for android. I was able to successfully set up the account. after inputting the password twice (once for the initial login and another for verification) i am then able to access my Office 365
 email, but if I don't touch Outlook for about 2 or more days (I only touch it for important emails that I see in the Notification window) I am having to enter my password two more times (again once for the initial log in and another for verification). I am
 tired of having to retype my password due to the amount of password I have to remember I can't always keep up with them and also it slows down the process of me being able to check my email on the go.</p>

<p>hi rogerbayless,</p>
<p>i understand that you were able to successfully set up the account in outlook for android and encounter the password issue with a period of idle of the app.</p>
<p>please refer to the following steps to see whether it could make any improvement to the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>login to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a> with admin credentials.
</li><li>navigate to <b>mobile</b> &gt; <b>mobile device mailbox policies</b>, create a new policy &gt; tick
<b>allow mobile devices that don‚Äôt fully support these to synchronize</b> &gt; untick
<b>require sign-in after the device has been inactive for</b> (minutes). </li><li>navigate to <b>recipients</b> &gt; <b>mailboxes</b>, choose the mailbox &gt; edit &gt;
<b>mailbox features</b> &gt; <b>mobile devices</b> &gt; <b>view details</b> &gt; <b>mobile device mailbox policy</b> &gt; browse &gt; choose the newly created policy and then save.
</li></ol>
<p>if the issue still persists, it could be related to the outlook app. we have a dedicated channel where you can use the in-app support to report any issues regarding this app. you may also request bug fixes and submit feature requests via in-app support.</p>
<p>*note when using the in app support:</p>
<p>1. it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.</p>
<p>2. if you don‚Äôt have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you will see a response from the technician.</p>
<p>3. it is recommended that the user‚Äôs initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1fbe4eb-cc81-4b82-91c1-45204c3c3e00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1fbe4eb-cc81-4b82-91c1-45204c3c3e00" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2d42d90-34a3-4751-8481-e88576b54ca7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2d42d90-34a3-4751-8481-e88576b54ca7" /></a></p>
<p>by the way, here‚Äôre some our tips that may be helpful to find out the root cause of the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>check whether the issue occur to the latest version of the app. </li><li>if available, set up your account in another android device for a test. doing this can help narrow down whether the issue is related to your android device.
</li></ol>
<p>best regards,</p>

<h3> scb31  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts &#34;File As&#34; change&#63;</h2>
                    WM6 on Orange SPV-E650<br />
<br />
Is there any known way to set the default "File As" order for storing contacts on the handset as there is within Outlook?<br />
<br />
I prefer to have names filed in "First Last" order rather than the default "Last, First" and having set this up in Outlook, would like to be able to do the same when entering/amending contacts on the phone.
<br />
<br />
This was a slight problem under WM5 but seems to be a lot worse in WM6 with the format being reverted back every time you save a contact (even if just by opening it and then closing without making any changes).<br />
<br />
Also, on a slightly different vein, is there a way to set the default means of contact as you used to be able to do in WM5? It seems that WM6 now switches the default to whatever means you last made contact by (i.e. not acting as a default at all !)<br />
<br />
<br />
TIA<br />

            You can change that in Outlook in the Contacts folder properties. However they will apply to new contacts only. If you do not have too many contacts on your device, you can change the display manually by editing each of them and chanding the File as field.

            Thanks for prompt response!<br />
<br />
I am aware of being able to change Outlook and of manually altering individual contacts on the phone. My question was more about being able to make the same Outlook change on the actual phone. The "File As" field has to be manually set for not only each new
 entry made on the phone but whenever changing an existing one. As soon as it is saved the original setting is forgotten and the it reverts back to "Last, First" - very annoying when quickly updating a contact and forget to reset !<br />
<br />
Have searched various forums for this and checked through registry on phone but have found nothing.<br />
<br />
TIA<br />
<br />

            &nbsp;There just doesn't seem to be an answer to this problem. I really wish I hadn't upgraded my phone to a win mobile 6 version now. I'm afraid WinMobile is the biggest piece of crud ever. I've been suffering it for years, hoping it would get better. I give
 up. I'm going to return my phone and get one with a decent OS instead.

            There's no way to manipulate the File As option within the Contacts software on the device, but there is third party PIM software that allows you to sort contacts just about any way you wish to view them.&nbsp; I like to view my contacts by first name/last
 name, and the PIM software i use (<a href="http://www.developerone.com/agendafusion/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Agenda Fusion</a> ) allows me to sort by by First Name, by Last Name, by File As, by Anniversary, by Birthday, by Company....

            Hello,
<div>I have only one account - Office 365 as Exchange.&nbsp;</div>
<div>You did give me an idea - to add the connected account as a second email account in outlook and make it default for sending emails. Will try it now.. Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi Andre, &nbsp;Did you get the desired result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am most interested as I have a similar issue. &nbsp;Like you, I only have one account in Outlook 365, but I have a second, I suppose you'd say,
<strong>sub account,</strong> which is set up for my own domain email address. &nbsp;It all works very well, except that, whichever inbox I am in, new emails always go from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, when I want the to go from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I know I can chenge the
 from address manually every time, but IO tend to forget, so I need to make it the default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to know if you have cracked this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>David&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Today I upgraded my computer to Windows 10 build 10130 . The first thing I noticed is that my computer said that it isn't connected to the internet ,so I tried restarting it. After logging in,same issue. But,this time,my antivirus firewall (Eset
 Smart Security 8) failed initalising. I also tried opening the "Change adapter settings" before the error. Nothing. But after the firewall error popped out,the Change adapter settings folder opened like miracle.(after a minute or so of waiting..)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I also tried in Command promt(with admin privilleges) the "ipconfig" command. All I got was "Windows IP configuration" ,and nothing more. Also tried "ipconfig /all" ,same issue,but with some more things: Host name,Primary Dns suffix,Node Type,IP
 routing enabled,WINS Proxy Enabled. Nothing more,again: no adapter IP ,nothing</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can anyone help me solve this issue?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks in advance.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: Managed to uninstall the antivirus and everything runs pretty smooth!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2>            How to get rid of the little tabs at the bottom of the email pane&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Note: I'm using the web interface.&nbsp; When I compose emails, each draft I have gets its own little tab on the bottom of the screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0e94248-8457-479a-ae4c-79480c55c5c1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0e94248-8457-479a-ae4c-79480c55c5c1?upload=true" /></a></p>

<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />In order to get rid of those minimized messages, please click on "X" on them. However before you will do it, please check if you need them or they are part of your drafts.

<p>Hi LA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp; I do know that hitting X will close the tabs.&nbsp; Do you know how to disable it altogether?&nbsp; I don't need it, and I'd rather use the real estate for something else.&nbsp; I almost never have multiple drafts open (that screenshot was
 for illustration purposes only), and when I do I prefer to use the Drafts folder to manage them.</p>

I doubt as Lumia 920 works with gloves, does screen protector causes problems?

<p>Control Panel&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced. Put a checkmark in "Disable Script Debugging (Internet Explorer)" and "Disable Script Debugging (Others)". Apply/OK out.<br />

If that doesn't take care of the issue, in the Debugger itself:<br />

1. Use the Tools menu and click Options.<br />
2. In the Options dialog box, select the Debugging folder.<br />
3. In the Debugging folder, select the Just-In-Time page.<br />
4. In the "Enable Just-In-Time debugging of these types of code" box, clear the boxes next to Managed, Native, and Script*. Click OK.</p>
<p>The Internet Options part and the JIT Debugger part are two separate things. In order to do the Debugger changes, wait until the Debugger shows up and make the changes to it from its Tools&gt;Options menu.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. When did the issue occur?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;2. Do you remember making any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;3. When exactly do you get this message? When you are on a particular application or when you start the
 computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;In the mean time you might consider following these steps and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just-In-Time debugging is a feature that launches the Visual Studio debugger automatically when a program,
 running outside Visual Studio, encounters a fatal error. Just-In-Time debugging allows you to examine the error before the application is terminated by the operating system. The Visual Studio debugger does not need to be running when the error occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong>To enable/disable Just-In-Time debugging</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;In Visual Studio,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. On the Tools menu, click Options.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. In the Options dialog box, select the Debugging folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. In the Debugging folder, select the Just-In-Time page.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. In the Enable Just-In-Time debugging of these types of code box, select or clear the relevant program types: Managed, Native, or Script.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To disable Just-In-Time debugging, once it has been enabled, you must be running with Administrator privileges.
 Enabling Just-In-Time debugging sets a registry key, and Administrator privileges are required to change that key.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Checks out this link for more information on JIT debugger. Also To enable/disable Just-In-Time debugging</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5hs4b7a6.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5hs4b7a6.aspx</a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;<strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If case Visual Studio is not installed, I would suggest you to disable script debugging in Microsoft Internet
 Explorer and check if the pop-up eliminates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.Open Internet Explorer.
<br />
b. Click on Tools <br />
c. Click internet options&gt;&gt; then advanced tab <br />
d. Under browsing section&gt;&gt; uncheck "disable script debugging(both others and Internet Explorer) " and "display a notification about every script error".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<p>I had similar issue with German language and it was never been easy to change the language. I had in the past many windows mobiles and I had to change the firmware.</p>
<p>In this case , you utility in the phone Omnia I8000 . click the cube button , then setting silver cog icon and then slide the bar on the top towards right one time and you will find TVout and Divix at the bottom , clock more/Plus and you will see more options
 and chose the Globe with ABC . once you select any language , it will warn you and it you click OK , it will ask you to enter the pin . default 1234 and after that it will reboot 2 times . it takes around 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Good Luck and</p>
<p>&nbsp;Samsung is the best</p>

<h2>            Dynamically refernce a worksheet name based on a cell value to retrieve data from the worksheet.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to dynamically reference a worksheet name based on a value in a cell. For example&nbsp;I have a workbook of 25 worksheets which are company names Gap, Nordstrom, Best Buy, Staples, etc. I am aggregating data on a worksheet within the workbook&nbsp;using
 vlookup. My formula is =vlookup(b3,Gap!$a$3:$at$6, etc, etc). Within the worksheet I have the list of company names in column A. Gap is in cell A5. What I would like to do is have the spreadsheet name reference a cell&nbsp;so for the previous Gap example something
 like &nbsp;=vlookup(b3,A5!$a$3:$at$6, etc, etc), where A5! reprsents the cell that Gap is typed in but references (retrives data) from the Gap worksheet within the workbook.&nbsp;

            <p>I am trying to expand on the above formula now to incorporate other workbooks as well. So from the above example lets stick with Gap but now assume that I've moved the Gap spreadsheet to a different workbook named Retail.&nbsp; In my current workbook in cell
 A5 I have typed Gap and want it to reference the workbook Retail without losing the functionality of the indirect function in the above formula.&nbsp; Does this make sense?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.
