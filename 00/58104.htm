<h2>            Retrieve skype account by skype number</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I made a new skype account and created a new email (hotmail) associated with it. I also purchased a skype phone number. All this happened a little over a month ago. I didn't sign in to either skype or hotmail since the opening of the accounts. Yesterday
 when I tried to sign in to skype or hotmail it tells me that the account doesn't exist. I assume hotmail closed my account because I haven't logged in or I totally forgot my email (which is unlikely). I need one of the following: 1) help me retrieve my skype
 account (the only sure information I have is my skype number and the exact date of paying for the skype number) or 2) close the skype number so I don't get charged since this is automated charge... Please, help.</p>

    <title>automatic updates breaks screen share - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            automatic updates breaks screen share</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 home edition (i have been told by knowhow its the anniversary edition but im not 100% sure) and when i bought this laptop i discovered it could connect wirelessly to my tv but pretty soon after, the automatic updates started installing
 themselves whether i liked it or not and then suddenly i was no longer able to connect to my tv... after being able to stream programs to my 55 inch 4k tv i understandably do not want to go back to watching on a crummy 15 inch screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way i have found to fix it is a fresh install of windows (metered connection didnt) but of course with forced updates this only works for a week before i have to spend a couple hours doing a fresh install of windows redownloading the software i
 want, readding bookmarks and changing the stupid way the mousepad scrolls after windows had the terrible idea of mimicking apples scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a wire to connect to my tv is also not an option.. if i wanted an immovable machine i wouldve bought a desktop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally thought it was the kb3197954 update that was causing this but it just happened again and this update was nowhere in sight</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know the true cause of my problems or anyway to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wanting to throw my laptop out of the window on a weekly basis is not a good place to be in :'(</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar Transparency Level - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neoblakkrstal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar Transparency Level</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 and would like to know if there is a way to control the level of transparency of the Taskbar and Start menu? I have turned on transparency, but it is nearly opaque. I would like to raise the level of transparency
 until it is like a piece of tinted glass, like it was in Windows 8.1. Can this be done without downloading a piece of third party software? If not, this was really a bad idea. From what I have been reading online, most people want MORE control, not less. I
 would still like the ability to customize my color scheme more. This was taken away with Windows 8.1 and I was hoping Microsoft would have taken the hint from the online community-at-large and given us back this ability with Windows 10. I see that the deaf
 are still leading the blind, and controlling the stupid, when it comes to design. I hope future updates will address this obvious flaw.

<p>
</p><p>Well, it's bad design then. What reason is there for restricting options like this? Is Microsoft trying to be Apple? My taskbar was nicely translucent in Windows 7 for years, and now it's so close to opaque that there might as well not even be a "transparent"
 option. 90% opaque is a pretty pointless transparency setting.</p>

            <p>About transparency of the tiles background in the Task menu. I noticed that a friend who upgraded from W8.1 has this background completely transparent. The tiles are over the background image. I upgraded from W7 and It seems I cant recreate the same total
 transparency of background.&nbsp; I just get the blurred translucent effect of a almost black background. I would be the most happy guy if I could get rid of this dark blurred background for a completely transparent one. Is this possible or will it be? I suspect
 (without finding any info on this) that we get a different version of the display if we upgrade from W7 or W8. Is it the case.</p>
<p>Thanks for any info on this.</p>

<p>On the Desktop, right click and choose PERSONALISATION.</p>
<p>Click START</p>
<p>Turn START FULL SCREEN to ON </p>
<p>Then the tiles are detached from the semi-transparent background that can be seen around the tiles.</p>

            Yes, we know that. It doesn't change the fact though that you cannot control level of transparency of a taskbar, like it used to in W7...

<h2>            How to delete the need to eter apassword everytime i turn my laptop on&#63;</h2>
                    I just downloaded Microsoft10 yesterday and now when I turn it on I have to enter my password.&nbsp; don't want that, only I and my family use it, I have nothing to hide. It also makes the start up slower. I just want to turn it on and be able to access everything.&nbsp;,
 my computer has an ELAN touchpad and it has a&nbsp;bar on the side for scrolling, but now it doesn't work. I have to use two fingers to scroll and I don't want that.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step1: Open <strong>Registry Editor</strong>. To do so, type <strong>Regedit</strong> in the Start menu search box or Run command box and then press Enter key. Click Yes button when you see the UAC (User Account Control) box.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/180bbaa3-e719-4499-9be9-f9609077bdba" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step2: In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c71af994-a6c7-4a86-9a24-615f7bdf0fd1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step3: On the right-side, look for the entry named <strong>DefaultUserName</strong>, double-click on it and make sure that your Microsoft account or local user account name is appearing under
<strong>Value data</strong> box.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/760381f7-f016-4d91-8663-343ccb6dbe98" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step4: &nbsp;Next, on the right-side again, look for the entry named <strong>DefaultPassword</strong>. If the entry doesn’t exist, please create one by right-clicking on empty space, clicking
<strong>New</strong> and then clicking <strong>String Value</strong>. Rename it to
<strong>DefaultPassword</strong> and enter your password in the Value data box. Click OK button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/496341b6-610c-4fad-b5fb-bab7b985e366" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c6819c4-1840-42fa-b772-e5604df46dd3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step5: Finally, you need to enable automatic logon. To do so, on the right-side (once again), look for the entry labelled AutoAdminLogon and then change its value from
<strong>0</strong> (zero) to <strong>1</strong> (one).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2afe05d7-1562-4844-b875-f30edc69ae89" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your PC to see your Windows 10 automatically logging into your account without asking you to enter the password.

<h2>            Why does Microsoft Support use Rescue-Logmein for remote support&#63; It doesn&#39;t work on most macs&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>i just had a question for microsoft support and was asked to download rescue logmein for further diagnostic. I asked if it worked on mac (as i mainly use a mac for my daily work) and was told it would work. When i downloaded it and tried running it, it didnt
 work and showed the white-gray cross. This is a sign that the program doesnt work with the current mac os version. I was told it was probably a setting that disables foreign apps but that was not the case. So i did some research and found that rescue logmein
 only works for devices running os x 10.11 el capitain and earlier (which is already 3 years old)&nbsp;https://www.logmeinrescue.com/remote-mac.</p>
<p>I hope that microsoft can convince logmeinrescue to update their mac version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I am unsure which category to choose. If i chose the wrong one, please move me to the right one.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided and the troubleshooting that you've performed, there is a possibility that the NVidia video card driver that is installed on your computer is a generic driver. We suggest downloading the driver directly to manufacturer
 website to get the specific driver designed for the device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Insignia Tablet Stuck in Reboot Loop, Can&#39;t boot from USB</h2>
                    <p>I've had this Insignia tablet since Christmas and recently, it's been freezing up on me. I decided today to reset the whole thing. While it was reseting, something screwed up and it rebooted. Now the Windows 10 installation is stuck on 64% and it keeps rebooting
 over and over and over with no progress being made.</p>
<p>After researching this problem, I made a bootable USB drive with Windows 10 on it in order to boot the tablet from the USB. I went into BIOs and changed the boot order to make sure that the USB drive was listed first. I restarted the tablet but it doesn't
 even try to boot from the USB, it just boots like it normally does, flashes the 64%, and enters the reboot loop. I've been trying to fix this for hours and I'm not sure what to do.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Problems with installing Windows 10 can be caused by several things. The media creation tool provides the best download running Windows 10. Before you reinstalling, we suggest that you check the following requirements:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A stable internet connection.<br />
</li><li>Sufficient data storage available on a computer, USB or external drive for the download.</li><li>A blank USB or DVD (and DVD burner) with at least 4 GB of space if you want to create media. We recommend using a blank USB or blank DVD, because any content on it will be deleted.</li><li>Read the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>However, you have mentioned that the installation stuck at 64%. We recommend that you re-download the media creation tool. If the issue persists, try using another USB flash drive or DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            <p>I've tried loading the Windows 10 ISO onto two different USB drives and I made sure both were bootable but the tablet doesn't even acknowledge they're there when it's booting up. If I go into the BIOS settings, it recognizes that my USB is plugged in and
 lets me set it as number 1 in the boot order, but then it skips right over it and goes through the normal boot method whenever I turn it off and turn it back on again.</p>

<h3> mfmg  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 7 Home Premium takes long time to delete or move &#40;TIF&#41; files within the same physical hard drive</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have Windows Home on several machines. It takes significantly long time to delete a tif file or move it from one folder to another within the same drive.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I tried to disable the thumbnail preview, and indexing, but that didn’t help.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I also tried to delete from cmd, but it took the same amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I found a program called “LockHunter” that can run from the context menu and whenever I run it, I found the files are locked by Windows Explorer. I could unlock them using
 the same program, then deleting/moving files become instantaneous.</span></p>

<p><span>Is there a better way around that since I need to delete/move the files in a batch mode (cmd or in a c++ program) without using Windows Explorer or any software that needs
 an interface?</span></p>

<p><span><span>Thanks for any suggestions<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try creating a new user profile to see if the same problem occurs. If not then it could be a corruption/permissions problem of the old user profile.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>

            <p>This solution did not work.&nbsp; The same behavior happens with a new user profile.&nbsp; I have also disabled virus scanning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I have found, it is only with TIF files.&nbsp; The files I have been testing with are 15 to 70mb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my testing I have found that if I move the files or the folder with files, I experience the long delay as described.&nbsp; However, if I move a folder that contains another folder that contains the TIF files, the move is instantaneous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Windows Home Professional, 64 bit, Service Pack 1.&nbsp; Windows automatic updates is enabled and current.&nbsp; The account I'm logged in with has administrator privileges.</p>

            Hi thomaschapin 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />You didn't specify what app you were using so below is a link using the Photo Gallery app to rotate photos.
<br />Hope this helps.

            Hi Thomas
<br />
<br />If you are using the Photos App, if you rotate an image, it is not really rotated, it is just marked as rotated
<br />
<br />The best way to correctly rotate an image in Windows is:
<br />
<br />Find that file in Windows File Explorer in your Pictures folder
<br />
<br />Right click and choose 'Open With - choose another app' - Paint
<br />
<br />At the top of Paint, click Rotate

    <title>Windows 10 Bug - Start menu doesn&#39;t display with multiple screens - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlosvizcaino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Bug - Start menu doesn&#39;t display with multiple screens &#40;works with single display&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The problem: When using multiple screens the the clinking the window icon on the task bar doesn't open the start menu (also, new notifications and Search windows don't work ). When I boot up in single screen mode everything works fine, this only happens
 with multiple displays (displays are connected thru a port replicator, all equipment is dell ). I have updated all my video, bios and other drivers to their latest versions but that didn't fix the issue. &nbsp;I tried all the suggestion from the following websites:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.thewindowsclub.com/start-menu-does-not-open-windows-10</p>
<p>http://www.urtech.ca/2015/05/solved-windows-10-start-menu-and-modern-apps-do-not-function/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But none of these worked. I did find a temporary work around: If you switch the displays to duplicate the switch back to extend display it will fix the problem but you have to redo this every time you logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Found another work around, if I set my laptop screen as my primary display then it will works (even between reboots). So it looks like the issue occurs when you have multiple displays and the primary
 display is no longer the laptop screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>This is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;a bug.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi AhteshamHaq
<br />
<br />Select Start , choose Settings , then select System &gt; Display.﻿ Under Brightness and color, move the Change brightness slider to adjust the brightness﻿﻿﻿. (If the slider isn't there, see the Notes section below.)
<br />Change brightness slider
<br />
<br />Some PCs can let Windows automatically adjust screen brightness based on the current lighting conditions. To find out if your PC supports this, in Display settings, under Brightness and color, look for the Change brightness automatically when lighting changes check box, and then select it to use this feature. This automatic setting helps make sure your screen is readable wherever you go. Even if you use it, you can still move the Change brightness slider to fine-tune the brightness level.
<br />
<br />Notes: 
<br />
<br />    You might not see the Change brightness slider on desktop PCs that have an external monitor. To change the brightness on an external monitor, use the buttons on it. 
<br />
<br />    If you don't have a desktop PC and the slider doesn't appear or work, try updating the display driver. In the search box on the taskbar, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the list of results. In Device Manager, select Display adapters, then select the display adapter. Press and hold (or right-click) the display adapter name, then select Update driver and follow the instructions.﻿﻿﻿

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<h2>            Keyboard accents stop working everytime</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 system with Microsoft Comfort Desktop 5050, and in about 5 in 5 minutes the accents stop working. As a workaround, I switch to another language, and the accents start working again. Now I have the Portuguese language with ABNT2 Keyboard
 and English language with ABNT2 Keyboard. When PT language accents stop working, I switch to English, and when English accents stop working, I switch to PT again, and so goes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/677e3c59-5875-4093-8e3c-bc2c7fb362b1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/677e3c59-5875-4093-8e3c-bc2c7fb362b1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see there that both PT-BR and ENG languages have the same keyboard type</p>
<p>(English with US Keyboard is there because Windows simply puts it there automatically, even if I don't ask for it, but this is another issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Observations:</p>
<p>It is happening since I installed this OS.</p>
<p>The first main system language was English, but I installed the Portuguese language because of the date format. I know that the system translation has a lot of bugs since Windows 7, so maybe this can be the issue as well, as I installed this translation
 just after I installed the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, in advance</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This can be caused by several factors. Can you give me the current build and version of your Windows 10? Press
<strong>Windows logo key + R</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, then select <strong>
OK</strong> to get this information. As an initial troubleshooting, follow these methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Use the Keyboard troubleshooter.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter will try to find and fix problems with your computer's keyboard settings. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, type <strong>troubleshoot</strong> and click the search result.</li><li>On the list, find <strong>Keyboard</strong> and click <strong>Run the </strong>
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>Verify if the issue is resolved.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Update the keyboard driver.</p>
<p>Download the link here to install the latest drivers for&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/wireless-comfort-desktop-5050/pp4-00001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wireless Comfort Desktop Keyboard 5050</a></strong>
 to update the drivers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update me if there are improvements.</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thanks for answering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: The troubleshoot said that there was nothing to do, and everything was ok.</p>
<p>Method 2: I didn't have the driver installed, but after installing the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, <strong>winver </strong>said the version is&nbsp;1803 (Build 17134.228)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tested the keyboard in a Macbook, and this issue didn't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks for the updates, Chris. Its possible that there is an issue with your language packs. I recommend uninstalling your 2 languages packages aside from English and reinstall them again. To uninstall a language pack, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong>Settings </strong>app, you can remove a language by going to <strong>
Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Region &amp; language</strong>.
</li><li>Click on the language you'd like to remove, and then click on <strong>Remove</strong>. Windows will automatically delete language pack files the next time it runs its automated cleanup tasks.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After removing the language pack, reinstall them again and see if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update me if there are improvements.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t right click on Start menu</h2>
                    When I try to right click on the Start menu button my mouse cursor simply shifts slightly to the upper right. I've tried running a SFC scan and copying AppData/Local files from another user to no avail. This issue first occurred on Windows 8.1 and persists
 after Windows 10 upgrade.

<p>if you have an existing fm3 save &nbsp;and load forza 4 &nbsp;when you start the season mode for the 1st time it will ask if you want ti import your profile over .</p>
<p>as for vinyl groups and designs &nbsp; there is an option to import more than once,You go to my vinyl groups and at the bottom it says press Y to import,It will warn you about your file names because if you import again it imports everything again and anything
 with same name on your forza4 will be overwritten.This option to imort again has been usefull,I had three vinyl groups that just didn't load on forza4 so i went back to my FM3 game and saved these three vinyls and no others,Then I imported again giving me
 my three vinyls that didnt work, and they worked fine.Again important make sure they have different file names.
</p>
<p>see if this helps</p>

<h2>            Microsoft office files doesn&#39;t open in OneDrive and won&#39;t sync in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Original Title: </span>HELP !!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TWO weird issues</span> I believe are connected to the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">FIRST</span></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;A specific&nbsp;folder</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> is selected on Folders List to sync</span><span>, but Office 2013 files created before&nbsp;two or three weeks ago&nbsp;aren't been syching. I've deselected, reselected, but
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">only PDF files </span><span>are been synching&nbsp;to&nbsp;this folder on my local disc.
</span></p>
<p>2) Have reset Onedrive and the files were not synched again</p>
<p>3) They are on my Onedrive online, but Onedrive doesn't download them to my PC (the Office Files created BEFORE two or three weeks ago are there (local), BUT.... (look to the second list below)</p>
<p>4) Onedrive icon says it is updated, but office 2013 files aren't there</p>
<p><span>5) NOW, </span><span style="font-weight: bold">after I've reset Onedrive, NO OFFICE FILES&nbsp;are been downloaded on ALL FOLDERS and not just the new ones.
</span></p>
<p>Only PDF files, images, but NO Office Document&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">SECOND</span></p>
<p>1) Weird also is that, if I go to WORD, in the recent opened files, there are some files I was working on a few days ago, I click on any of them and they are loaded. I click on SAVE, check the file folder path on onedrive, but they ARE NOT THERE !!!! Even
 after I save them on Word, I look at the local Onedrive file and they are not there.</p>
<p>If I try to open thru the file dialog window on Word and go to the onedrive folder, there is NO word file there, but I can still open using recent documents list on word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting desperate because I can't access my Office files on onedrive using local folders</p>
