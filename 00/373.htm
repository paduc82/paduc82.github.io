<h2>            POP UP entitled&#58; &#34;Help improve proofing tools.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed a couple of times when using Microsoft Word 2010 that I sometimes see a pop-up dialogue box entitled "Help improve proofing tools."</p>
<p>The main scrolling textbox contains lots of lines which look like fragments of text from emails that I have sent using Outlook, and has buttons to 'Delete Line' , 'Send Now' , 'Send Later' , 'Don't Send' and a hyperlink which says 'Read our data collection
 privacy statement' and another hyperlink which says 'Don't send, and don't ask me again.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are simply:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) where is this data physically stored on my computed? I assume its some sort of cache file (or files)</p>
<p>2) how can the privacy settings be modified so that it does not gather this data in the first place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not too bothered about the reason why it happens as I am sure its explained in the Microsoft privacy policy that it links to, however I have not been able to determine and answer to my 2 questions above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope that someone who knows the inner workings of this can help answer my questions directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rod</p>

            <p>Ok well I have found out the answer to the second one and it appears to be documented here :-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/infopath-help/participate-in-the-customer-experience-improvement-program-HA010354232.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/infopath-help/participate-in-the-customer-experience-improvement-program-HA010354232.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.e. untick the box called 'Sign up for the Customer Experience Improvement Program' in the Trust Center Privacy options :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would still be grateful if anyone can satisfy my curiosity about the first one though - i.e. which physical file or files is the data stored in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            It should be the items that the spelling checker flagged and that you then corrected and clicked Add To Dictionary. The data will probably be in the file %appdata%\Microsoft\UProof\Custom.dic. That's in a hidden folder in your user profile area.<br />

    <title>&#34;Fit to width&#34; should be the default PDF view mode in Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Fit to width&#34; should be the default PDF view mode in Edge</h2>
                    <p>"Fit to window width" should be started up as the default page size of an opening PDF in Edge, namely, when a PDF file is opened by Edge, just should be in "Fit to window width" mode, rather than have to click "Fit to window width" button to achieve that
 state. Because the "Fit to window width" mode can satisfy most demands for reading.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92a1b1d7-fc44-4b98-8efc-d9db5fedb896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92a1b1d7-fc44-4b98-8efc-d9db5fedb896" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And, when it is in "Fit to window width" state, the horizontal scrollbar should not be displayed, namely at this time it should be disappeared; because it already does not serve a useful purpose any longer at this time, nor is there any need for it to exist
 any more, its existence seems rather redundant, on the contrary it easily leads to the reading pages shift to the left or right by the user's misoperation and corrupts or affects the user's reading experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43802896-ee9c-442a-a111-4c9c040798d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43802896-ee9c-442a-a111-4c9c040798d9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be more clear after comparing the similar situation in the Adobe Reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Adobe Reader, most PDF files just opened is in the "Fit to width" state;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9af91360-0728-4a1a-ba58-d7698f29523f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9af91360-0728-4a1a-ba58-d7698f29523f" /></a></p>
<p>or when a PDF file is opened by Adobe Reader, the user can select "Fit Width" to make it in that state,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d769d495-c7cc-4eda-9bbc-4d256e6b9a75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d769d495-c7cc-4eda-9bbc-4d256e6b9a75" /></a></p>
<p>then in it can select "Preferences"-&gt;"Documents" and under "Open Settings" click the "Restore last view settings when reopening documents" checkbox to make it checked, and then click "OK" button to save the settings, then later open this PDF file again,
 it will always be in the "Fit to width" state in this system on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77023915-bccf-4b24-a665-b5d73d886645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77023915-bccf-4b24-a665-b5d73d886645" /></a><br />
As you can see, under the "Fit to width" state in Adobe Reader, the horizontal scrollbar is not displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another problem is that the floating toolbar of PDF viewer in Edge will cover the vertical scrollbar thumb (and top scrollbar button) when it is just started to scroll down. I used to hold down and drag down vertical scrollbar thumb to scroll down PDF view
 pages, but when I want to point to the vertical scrollbar thumb, will trigger that floating toolbar appears to cover it, so actually I can't point to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be25cdab-0180-481d-bc1c-991788fd55ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be25cdab-0180-481d-bc1c-991788fd55ab" /></a><br />
Certainly there are many alternative operations, such as:<br />
I can roll the scroll wheel to scroll down... (but if my mouse only has two buttons and no scroll wheel, how do I do that?)<br />
Although temporarily there is no scrollbar thumb, I can directly hold down any position on the scrollbar's uncovered parts and drag down to scroll down...<br />
I can frequently click the bottom scrollbar button to scroll down...<br />
I can frequently press Down arrow key or Page Down key to scroll down...<br />
...<br />
All of these alternative operations mean that I had to change my usual habit on scrollbar.<br />
Certainly, with the scrolling by alternative operations, the scrollbar thumb will be revealed sooner or later: when the PDF pages' total number is small or relatively less, it will be quickly revealed; whereas, when the PDF pages' total number is large or or
 relatively more, it will be slowly revealed; eventually it will be revealed anyway, and at this time I can use my usual habit to hold and drag down it to scroll down the PDF's pages.<br />
Although can use the alternative operations, but I often unconsciously want to drag the scrollbar thumb when a PDF file is just opened.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am often troubled with this internal contradiction or conflict of the interface design layout: why will the floating toolbar impede the normal operations on scrollbar? So, if come up with a typical negative instance on user friendly design, that such is
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another problem is: when a PDF file's pages are too large or relatively too much, especially that PDF pages with pictures of large size, the PDF pages' display speeds are too slow, slow to unbearable levels.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a9c9700-7098-429d-b444-ac11fc95a5de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a9c9700-7098-429d-b444-ac11fc95a5de" /></a></p>
<p>Microsoft developers should consider how to optimize the PDF pages' loading speeds to let the average length of time for displaying the PDF pages drop in an acceptable range by users.</p>
<p><br />
Sum up, view PDF in Edge, there are three obvious problems to be solved:<br />
<strong>1. The loadings of PDF pages with many pictures are too slow, need to be optimized.</strong><br />
<strong>2. "Fit to width" should be the default PDF size when opening, and the horizontal scrollbar should be not displayed.</strong><br />
<strong>3. The floating toolbar blocks and impedes the vertical scrollbar thumb's started operations, need to find a solution.</strong></p>
<p><br />
If Microsoft could improve on this three, that would greatly enhance the user friendliness of interface.<br />
Thanks.</p>

            <p>I agree.</p>
<p>I have also come around to the opinion that the Edge reader is better for my usage than the Acrobat.</p>
<p>It is simpler as a reader. I like the save and print buttons on the floating tool bar and it will save to the last place I saved for repetition.</p>
<p>I also have had all kinds of problems between Acrobat and Windows 10. Moving defaults, freezes, etc. despite having reloaded the latest version of Acrobat.</p>

<h2>            How to open .docx file from OneDrive on Android&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of .docx files saved on One Drive I would like to view on my Android phone, but I can not open any of them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These files do not have passwords and I have not added any protection to them myself.&nbsp;I don't need to edit them, just view them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Mobile states that it can't open digitally protected files!?!?! Seriously, why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using Kingsoft Office which I have added One Drive to, but it keeps asking me for a password? I haven't added a password, what's going on?</p>

            If you put one of the problem documents in a folder of your OneDrive that you set to be shared and then post a link to that folder back here, I will see if I can open it on an Android device and\or try and find out what is causing the issue.

            Apart from the typo (Destionation should be Destination), I suspect what I remarked in my previous reply: closing the workbook may have cleared the clipboard. In the version that I posted, the range is copied and pasted in one go, and the workbook is closed
 after that.

<h2>            Disappearing emails from the folders</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Disappearing mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello</p>
<p>I have several folders, named holidays, bills ,etc, where I transfer mail that I wish to keep because they are important.</p>
<p>Today I opened the " Holiday" folder as I needed to print my hotel booking document, &amp; that's where I was storing it.</p>
<p>Upon opening the folder there where several e mails there ( which was correct) but they immediately disappeared as I looked at them.</p>
<p>They are not in the deleted folder and a search has been fruitless.</p>
<p>I have looked for an archive folder without luck- in case they had been automatically transferred there.</p>
<p>I was using an I pad but also checked my lap top( just in case) &amp; there is no sign of the missing e mails.</p>
<p>Would appreciate an advise that a pensioner can understand!</p>
<p>Many thanks .</p>

            I am having the exact same issue. All of my sent emails and a few from my inbox have all disappeared. Looks like it's all my emails from 2015, but older emails are still appearing. I saw some of the emails were somehow in the deleted folder, however when
 I selected Recover the messages did not show back up in my inbox. When I went back to the deleted area, the emails aren't even there now!

            <p>Hello and thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I am using Outlook mail (preview) and the up to date version of IE.</p>
<p>I did check the other folders , the missing mail was not in any of them &amp; they look OK,</p>
<p>A&nbsp; few of the other folders were also empty, but they were less important &amp; so&nbsp;its possible I deleted the contents.</p>
<p>Some of the intact folders hold mail that is older than those that have gone missing, so it can't be an age issue.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Hello and thanks for your assistance .</p>
<p>I have tried the search function-- it found several e mails from the sender in question, but only those that I had intentionally deleted.</p>
<p>I tried both my i pad and my PC running IE on windows10.</p>
<p>I tried your other suggestions without luck.</p>
<p>For further information, I had one other e mail recently that I had in my " holiday" folder.</p>
<p>I opened the folder today- the e mail was there.</p>
<p>When I tried to open the e mail, it disappeared &amp; I couldn't find it , it wasn't in the deleted or junk folders- it was gone.</p>
<p>The e mails have always gone missing when I try to access them via my i pad &amp; I believe that is the problem.</p>
<p>I will stop transferring important mail to different folders until we manage to resolve the issue .</p>
<p>thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hello and thanks for your continued assistance.</p>
<p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Please forgive my ignorance- I do not think it is via the Microsoft outlook app, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>From i pad settings---Mail,contacts,calendars----accounts----Outlook.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 I have never actually witnessed the disappearance of mail from my PC ,as I have from the i pad, but once</p>
<p>gone the two pieces of equipment show exactly the same data.</p>
<p>As I usually use the i pad it is logical that that's where I would notice the problem though.</p>
<p>I have checked some intact folders on the PC &amp; accessed some mail, then gone to the i pad and checked the same folder- with the same result.</p>
<p>It seems to me to be some kind of " auto delete " function ,perhaps on the i pad?,except for the fact that some of the intact files are considerably older than those that have disappeared .</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 I have checked the Outlook status ,as requested ,&amp; it was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Simply put, Word is not designed to produce what I understand you to be describing. Most word processing programs are intended to produce manuscript-type documents... Word is no exception.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Charles indicated, the maximum Paper Size (i.e., <em>page</em>) for a Word document is 22"x22". Additionally. pagination is imposed top-to-bottom, not side-by-side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need something "like in excel" you'll need to use a program that works in that manner. If Excel won't suit your purpose perhaps some sort of Page Layout software can provide what you want. I have no idea what your specific intent may be, but perhaps
 even a simple text editor [such as the TextEdit app supplied with OS X] may suffice. Although lacking in many respects, text editors do allow for virtually unlimited line length unless you choose to restrict it.</p>

<p>At least in Word for Windows you need to be using a printer driver that allows edge-to-edge printing. These are rare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there is a page size limit in Word. I believe it to be 22 inches, which is wider than most screens. I haven't checked it recently. You would want to set the page as wide as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can type in draft or normal view and not have it wrap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot from a page at 50% zoom set to be 22" wide with zero margin. I think that is as wide as you can get. I do not know what you will get on a Mac version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cc02e7f-36c3-4fa3-af13-787c45c786de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cc02e7f-36c3-4fa3-af13-787c45c786de" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>22" is wide, but it is not never-ending. This is why, a long time ago, when trying to set up a mail merge data source that would have approximately 50 fields, I chose to use Excel as the data source. Even if I could fit 50 or more columns into 22" it would
 be virtually unreadable.</p>

    <title>conditional formatting based on text string in cell formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kergga  say:</h3>
<h2>            conditional formatting based on text string in cell formula</h2>
                    <p>I inherited a workbook where the original owner did a lot of hand-edited formulas. I'd like to use conditional formatting to visually determine which cells are based on what source worksheets, e.g. all the source cells contain a vlookup, but the source data
 sheet differs across cells:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=vlookup(A1,Sheet1!A:Z,3,False)</p>
<p>=vlookup(A2,Sheet4!A:Z,15,False)</p>
<p>=Vlookup(A3,Sheet3!A:Z,5,False)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I'd like to color cells that contain "Sheet1" as part of the formula text blue, "Sheet3" as red, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I haven't found a way to point the conditional formatting at the actual formula text. Any help would be appreciated, otherwise I'm stuck with creating a UDF to extract the text.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been a long term user of OneDrive and all the previous MS synchronization options.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have 7 clients running the same MS account/OneDrive.&nbsp; I have several operating systems (7, 8.1, Win 10 1511, and Win 10 332).&nbsp; I use several back-up systems (File
 History, file and image and Carbonite (file and image).&nbsp; I'm very careful in keeping all systems current and not to engage or access any questionable sites.&nbsp; I use MS Defender as my primary anti-virus and run Malwarebytes approximately every month.&nbsp; On April
 26, my main computer's MS Defender lit up and said it had detected malware and had either deleted it or quarantined it.&nbsp; I figured I was protected and took no further action.&nbsp; Then my other computers lit up with the same message.&nbsp; I went to my MS Defenders
 on each computer and deleted all quarantined malware detections.&nbsp; Each computer showed the same results, a single instance of Trojan:Win32/Dynameric and multiple instances of Ransom:HTML/Exxroute.A .&nbsp; I then happened to look on my OneDrive for a specific file
 and found it had a .crypt extension.&nbsp; Of course, I then determined that all my OneDrive (and computer Document files had been encrypted.&nbsp; I have approximately 350GB of OneDrive content and found that all computers were now infected with the same file encryption.&nbsp;
 The invaders informed me through a text file that I could do nothing and hope for a miracle or get my bitcoins together and go to the identified site for payment to un-encrypt my files.</p>

</p><p>I have spent the last week attempting to put my system back together from my various back-ups.&nbsp; I've run multiple full scans using MS Defender, Malwarebytes, Hitman, and FixMeStix.&nbsp; I had immediately checked on-line for any information on these particular
 viruses and found only 1 post on Google on April 21, 2016 saying how severe this virus was.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reason for this post is to alert OneDrive customers of the potential for encrypted file propogation through OneDrive (I expect Dropbox would do the same?).&nbsp; I have no idea whether it was only propogation of encrypted files from just one of my infected
 computers or whether the actual virus was also propogated.&nbsp; I have no knowledge of how the virus entered my system as I mentioned I do not visit potentially harmful sites.&nbsp; My e-mail system stayed intact and I have no indication of my many contacts that they
 have encountered this virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted one of the virus protection system providers I used to see if there is any additional testing of removal that I should attempt.&nbsp; I'm more that a little surprised that MS Defender was (and still is) the only anti-virus program that detected
 this virus on my computers.&nbsp; I read that MS was putting more effort in this area and maybe we are seeing results.&nbsp; I would hope that cloud based systems such as OneDrive would determine if there are any protective solutions that might be employed to keep a
 situation such as I've encountered from repeating.&nbsp; In my experience it was a "major" disruption and without various levels of back-up I might not have been able to recover.&nbsp; BTW,, Carbonite was able to reconstruct a "clean" backup from my logs and their backup
 servers.&nbsp; Highly recommended.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 popping up password dialog continuously</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've looked through this forum and the web for an answer and have not found a solution.</p>
<p>This morning, my formerly working Outlook 2010 client popped up a password box for one of my Office 365 clients.&nbsp; Won't stop and won't get e-mail.</p>
<p>1. Yes, my OWA version works if I login.&nbsp; Asked for a verification code to be entered.&nbsp; I entered it.</p>
<p>2. My Android Outlook did the same thing.&nbsp; Asked for code, entered it.</p>
<p>3. I have verified the Mail settings under control panel are set to Anonymous credentials (A MS KB post).</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2984912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2984912</a></p>
<p>4. I have verified that the KB from 2012 regarding Outlook 2010 having a problem with password change messages is installed.</p>
<p>5. I have exited and restarted outlook</p>
<p>6 I have rebooted my computer.</p>
<p>7. I have not howled at the moon, reinstalled Windows (I am on Windows 7) or any other suggestions that I'd likely get if I called tech support.</p>
<p>So, I suspect it might have something to do with the verification of the user name by requiring a code entered is not being handled by Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>No, I don't want to upgrade to Office 2013 or 2016.&nbsp; They dropped the Journal feature.&nbsp; I just want Outlook 2010 to work.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

<p>hi bruce,<br />
<br />
thanks for your information in private message.<br />
i checked your domain and account. they are all fine with no issue. <br />
then i read all the posts above again and found that when you login to office 365 owa and your android device, you would need to enter a verification code sent to your phone. this seems like that this account has been enabled mfa (<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2014/02/10/multi-factor-authentication-for-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">multi-factor
 authentication</a>). so i suggest you check this in <a href="https://portal.office365.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office 365 admin center</a> with the steps below:<br />
1. login to office 365 admin center with an admin account.<br />
2. users-&gt;active users, click set up to check the mfa settings referring to the screenshot below.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=893b3eba-84a8-46dc-b74c-2ed5cc445338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d893b3eba-84a8-46dc-b74c-2ed5cc445338" /></a><br />
3. in the next page, select enabled to see the users with mfa enabled.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0451ff13-317c-48a9-882e-ba42206c77f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0451ff13-317c-48a9-882e-ba42206c77f6" /></a><br />
<br />
if this problematic user is enabled mfa, since this mfa feature is only supported in office 2013 and later version applications as said in
<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2014/11/12/office-2013-updated-authentication-enabling-multi-factor-authentication-saml-identity-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, there would be an issue related to password prompting in your outlook 2010 client. as you don’t want to upgrade to office 2013 or 2016, you may disable mfa in office 365 admin center for this user.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

    <title>MS Access 2007, relationship between &#34;Customer&#34; and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Access 2007, relationship between &#34;Customer&#34; and &#34;Order&#34; tables.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm making a DB for&nbsp; my small business in online sales. I have 3 most important goals to reach :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. making a customers' information&nbsp;DB </p>
<p>2. making a stock available and products quantity.</p>
<p>3. knowing the containe of each customer's order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I'll try to be short now:</p>
<p>I've made 2 tables, Cutomers (with their info fieleds), and Orders. I've made a relationship between the table Customers with the primery key&nbsp;CustomerID&nbsp;-&nbsp;which is AutoNumber&nbsp;data type,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Customer&nbsp;ID - (numbers)&nbsp;field&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Orders table.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba351d0-9ab8-4986-bcbc-5cae7c44f771" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well it works yes, but when I'm chosing "a customer" in Order table, in Customer ID field, it show them as numbers :((( I want them to be names (from Customers name field).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8ac6996-5fab-4db5-baab-63888620df91" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/162945ba-f480-448c-8b93-0fb5aec98d98" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it is a number to number&nbsp;relationship, and as the field "customer name" is not a primary, I can't connect the "customer name" to "customer id", becouse Customer Name = text , but Customer ID = numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I need to do something with the Customer ID lookup - combo box in Orders table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc51130c-87db-4b57-bffa-82a6cac86ba2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don't know WHAT exactly to let it show the NAMES instead of ID numbers.</p>
<p>Please help me in that.</p>
<p>I hope my&nbsp; question was clear , thank you in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

            <p><span>Never enter data directly in a table's datasheet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Create a form bound to the Orders table and for the CustomerID use a combo box set up as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ControlSource:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>CustomerID</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>RowSource:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>SELECT CustomerID, [Customer Name] FROM Customer ORDER BY [Customer Name];</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BoundColumn:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1</span></p>
<p><span>ColumnCount:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2</span></p>
<p><span>ColumnWidths:<span>&nbsp;
</span>0cm</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit
 of the last one to inches.<span>&nbsp; </span>The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For an example see InvoicePDF.zip in my public databases folder at:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your
 browser's address bar.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The main invoice form in this little demo includes a combo box to select a customer in this way.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note also how the NotInList event procedure of the combo box is used to enable you to enter a new customer by typing the name into the combo box, something not possible in a table's datasheet.</span></p>

            <p>In addition to Ken's excellent advice, you really need at least two more tables!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to track information about Products then you need a table of Products; and I presume that each Customer may order zero, one,
<em>or many</em> Products in each order, and each Product may be a component of zero, one or many Orders. So you need a Products table, and an OrderDetails table with one row for each product in each order!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a perfect database by any means, but do look at Microsoft's Northwind sample database which gives an example of this structure.</p>

            And, in addition to John and Ken's comments, using lookup fields on the table level is not recommended (see http:\\www.mvps.org/access/lookup.htm). Lookups should be done on form as Ken recommended, not on tables.
<div><br />
<div>Another point here, regarding John's OrderDetails table. Since you want to track inventory (item 2), then you should be using a Transactions table. This table will record ALL movement of stock either in or out. So it would replace the OrderDetails table
 by showing the line items for each order. But it would also be used to ADD items to inventory by purchase or manufacture. Allen Browne has an excellent article on how to work with Quantity on Hand calculations:&nbsp;</div>
<div>http://allenbrowne.com/appinventory.html</div>
<div><br />
<div>One last point. Its not a good idea to use spaces in Object names. This can come back to haunt you.&nbsp;

                    I have struggled severely with using word and excel for mac when turning in school projects. &nbsp;There seems to be very little support for mac users. &nbsp;For example, no view tab in excel. &nbsp;Well, through trial and error, I have found that when using mac, some
 of your options are actually at the top of your screen toolbar instead of in the actual excel window. &nbsp;It is the same toolbar you would use if you were in Safari for example. &nbsp;File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Window, Help. &nbsp;Hope this helps someone.

<h2>            Windows 10 TP Final release.</h2>
                    Been running the Windows 10 TP for some time now. I just wondering as to when the final release comes out, will the people that participated be able to get the upgrade for free or will we be having to pay for a product key? Not worried but more just curious.
 Hopefully if we have to pay, we might get a bit of a discount. HaHa! Get your geek on!

</p><p>Hi Gary</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing Microsoft has said about a release date for the final version is "sometime this summer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who has a computer with Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 installed can upgrade for
<strong>Free</strong> to the final version. This offer will last for one full year after the final Windows 10 is released. After you upgrade, Windows 10 will be supported for the lifetime of the device where it is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure there will also be other discount offers for users who may still have an older version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p><strong>Will I be able to upgrade from the Windows 10 Technical Preview to the final release?</strong></p>
<p>There is has been some debate regarding qualification for the final release of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GabeAul/status/540579810880147457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft has noted the intention
</span></a>is to provide a direct upgrade path from the Preview to the final release. Of course, decisions can change. Recently, the company noted that
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-to-launch-this-summer-with-free-upgrades-for-pirated-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/18/us-microsoft-china-idUSKBN0ME06A20150318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>So, to be on the safe side, its best you ensure you have a valid genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license installed in order to qualify for the final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How much will Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not revealed all the details about pricing for Windows 10 yet, but they did announce that Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

<p>
</p><p><strong>What are the official upgrade paths to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft revealed in a Channel 9 Video the official upgrade paths to Windows 10:</p>

</p><p>Windows XP and Windows Vista users will have to do a clean install from a .ISO, so will Windows 8.0 users.

    <title>Unable to rebuild database - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stewartgordon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to rebuild database</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office 2011 for Mac and have been using it for a year now. &nbsp;I just purchased an Office 365 subscription and was told that I could not upgrade my existing license to my 365 license. &nbsp;I then uninstalled Office 2011 as per Microsoft's page&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed Office 2011 from my Office 365 link. &nbsp;Since the Office 365 install I have been getting an error when starting Outlook saying my database needs to be rebuilt. &nbsp;I go through the rebuilding and it errors out on "step 4 of 5: Recovering data..."
 and says my database could not be rebuilt -18000</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored my Identity from Time Machine to the date before I uninstalled Office 2011, and still get the same error. &nbsp;I followed the steps on this website,
<a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2012/05/how-to-recover-your-data-when-rebuilding-restoring-and-upgrading-fails/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.officeformachelp.com/2012/05/how-to-recover-your-data-when-rebuilding-restoring-and-upgrading-fails/</a>&nbsp;with the same results. &nbsp;I am at a lost now trying to recover my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>(A standalone application that would take my raw messages and put them into either a *.pst or *.olm would be awesome..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hello ArshadKahn88,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt response to my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to create a new identity and let Outlook open. &nbsp;I restored the main identity from the last backup before reinstalling Office, where Outlook worked fine. &nbsp;I copied 4 folders from that restored identity, Messages, Message Sources, Message Attachments
 and Folders to the new identity. &nbsp;When I start Outlook I am prompted to rebuild the database, but it fails in the same spot with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, I am able to take a *.olk14MsgSource file, rename it to *.eml extension, and Outlook will open the message. &nbsp;Doing a massive rename would be a last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What prompted this issue in the first place is after the reinstall Outlook actually was working. &nbsp;I could open new and old emails, including my archives that I imported from *.pst's. &nbsp;But my search and indexing was only working with the new emails I received
 after the reinstall. &nbsp;I searched the web to fix my indexing/search issue, which led my to doing a database rebuild, and that is when Outlook stopped working when the rebuild failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank your for your reply.</p>
<p>

    <title>MS Office Outlook 2013 contacts file corrupted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bram 6973  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Office Outlook 2013 contacts file corrupted</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my contacts' data disappeared.&nbsp; Have no clue what happened or why.&nbsp; Email and calendar work fine.&nbsp; I use Hotmail for my contacts, then create distribution groups using roadrunner.&nbsp; The groups and the individual contact names appear, but no associated
 data.&nbsp; I'm unable to edit any of the contacts to re-add the data (boxes for email, phone, address are greyed out).&nbsp; My windows phone and windows tablet both have the Hotmail contacts and all the associated information.&nbsp; I'm unable to export that data and import
 it into my outlook 2013 contacts&nbsp;file.&nbsp; It appears the outlook contacts portion has been corrupted.&nbsp; Email and calendar continue to work fine.&nbsp; I've done a repair on the roadrunner file to no avail.&nbsp; The Hotmail pst (or ost) file doesn't exist anywhere in
 the computer. Even if I make a new Hotmail account for my contacts, the software won't allow any editing of the contacts.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; created a new contact for John Doe, giving him an email address.&nbsp; Saved and closed the contact.&nbsp; The list shows John Doe, without
 any email address, and I'm unable to edit the record to add the email (boxes are greyed out).&nbsp; I've spent maybe 4 hours working on this tonight and find no solution.&nbsp; Can't import contacts because they come as names or emails (the data is split) which then
 cannot be edited.&nbsp; Repairing the pst file didn't work.&nbsp; Creating new contacts doesn't work.&nbsp; Someone must have a solution.&nbsp; I need the contacts and need the distribution groups.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just went to other views and it appears the data is there.&nbsp; It can now be seen in business card, card, phone and list views, but not the people view (which is the one I use).&nbsp; No editing can be done in the people view.&nbsp; There has to be a way for me to
 fix the files to view and use them in the people view.&nbsp; That view has also had problems recently as I've tried to get it to sort and be viewed as Last, First order.&nbsp; No matter how many times I apply the settings to sort and view in Last, First order, the People
 view won't do it and continues to show as first, last even though sorted as last first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still need help in fixing this.&nbsp; I really need to be able to use the people view.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Before I did as you suggested, I thought it prudent to back up my Outlook files.&nbsp; Unfortunately my email is roadrunner (easy to back up as the .pst file was quickly found).&nbsp; The contacts and calendar had to be Hotmail accounts and I cannot find where those
 data files are located so I can get them backed up.&nbsp; I don't know why it has to be so hard to find them.&nbsp; Can't find them as .pst or as .ost files anywhere in my system, so suspect Microsoft has them hidden.&nbsp; So until I'm sure the calendar and contact data
 files are backed up, I don't want to proceed with the profile process.&nbsp; To compound the problem, I have a Windows 8.1 phone and Windows 8.1 tablet (got those about a year ago; tried to sync with Windows 7 PC but found it doesn't work, so converted the PC to
 Windows 8.1 so everything would sync).&nbsp; Then I find that I can only sync the Outlook contacts and calendar by using my Hotmail account; it won't sync with roadrunner.&nbsp; So convert my calendar and co

            <span>Hi O.C. Jayne,<br />
<br />
The mouse scroll wheel behavior was intentionally changed in Access 2007 to reduce user confusion. In previous versions, there were instances where the scroll wheel would scroll the scroll bar and others where it would navigate records. The scroll wheel behavior
 is now consistent and only scrolls the scroll bar. There is no property to change this behavior.</span><span>

In addition, there were &nbsp;many, many questions about how to disable the mouse wheel behavior for forms that led to this decision. So many that Stephen Lebans even posted a DLL that users can include in their Access apps to turn it off.</span><span>
<br />
</span><span><br />
You could use code similar to the following to allow a form to scroll between records. However, since there are no events for tables and queries, this would not work for those objects.</span><span>
<br />
</span><span><br />
Add this code to the form’s On Mouse Wheel event procedure:</span><span>
<br />
</span><span><br />
Private Sub Form_MouseWheel(ByVal Page As Boolean, ByVal Count As Long)</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; If Not Me.Dirty Then</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If (Count &lt; 0) And (Me.CurrentRecord &gt; 1) Then</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acPrevious</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ElseIf (Count &gt; 0) And (Me.CurrentRecord &lt;= Me.Recordset.RecordCount) Then</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acNext</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; Else</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox "The record has changed. Save the current record before moving to another record."</span><span>
</span><span><br />
&nbsp; End If</span><span>
</span><span><br />
End Sub</span><span>
<br />
</span><span><br />
You will have to adjust the code above if your form does not allow additions or is read only. It assumes you can scroll to a New record. You would just need to adjust the condition in the ElseIf statement.</span><span>
<br />
</span><span><br />
If the record has been updated, you will likely want to force the user to save the record before scrolling. That was one of the main reasons for this change – users would scroll the mouse wheel and automatically and unexpectedly save their changes to their
 record.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! <br />

    <title>Outlook 2016 Not Junk Greyed Out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Not Junk Greyed Out</h2>
                    
<p>I just upgraded from Outlook 2013 to Outlook 2016 connected to my O365 account. When I right-click on an email in my JUNK MAIL folder, the Junk-&gt;Not Junk option is greyed out. I have been unable to figure out why or how to fix it.</p>
<p>This was never an issue with Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>This is running on a Windows 10 Pro machine.</p>

<p>See screenshot in last post. I was very much hoping to avoid creating a new profile as with our fairly slow internet connection it takes a very long time to create the cache file again. I also have many other email accounts (pop) that I have to manually
 setup every time I create a new profile.</p>

<p>Hi Craigmash,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, please&nbsp; try the following :</p>
<p>1. Do an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online Repair</a> for all your Office programs(It won’t occupy much network bandwidth).<br />
2. To identify if the issue is related to 3rd party add-ins, please hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ from the keyboard to launch the Run command, paste “outlook.exe /safe” in the open box to start Outlook in safe mode and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we need to use the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix it tool</a> to uninstall Office applications and then reinstall them. I understand that it takes time to configure Outlook again. However, based on our experience and other community members’ feedback, the issue may be related to file corruption during
 the upgrading. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>If reinstalling Office applications doesn’t work, we will help you further investigate it.</p>

<p>Looks like my only option left is to create a new profile or remove/reinstall. Do not have the time to deal with that right now so I will have to live with this small nuisance until I do have the time.</p>

    <title>Using Excel to do my Stocktake - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jronthegc9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Excel to do my Stocktake</h2>
                    <p>I have a file with all products info. I would like to scan a barcode in the find option, have it immediately go to a column with the number of items have it calculate the total value and then go back to the find window ready for another entry. I would need
 to protect the info on the file and only allow the one entry before having it go back to the search option. Would look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search</p>
<p>Scan and when the product is found set the curser in a column for number of items.</p>
<p>Enter the number of items</p>
<p>Enter</p>
<p>Go directly back to the blank search option to continue the operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not savvy enough to do it and don't know an Excel expert that can help! Looks like below.</p>

<p>I am working on creating a Spreadsheet But I need know some things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is <strong>PLU</strong>? Is it just some type of identifier and not necessary for Formulas?</p>
<p>What is <strong>GST%</strong> is it a tax and if it is a tax, what is the Rate?</p>
<p>What is Count supposed to represent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, finally what&nbsp;needs to be Totalled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already figured out the SUM formula number of items and cost per unit to come up with the Price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know Tax rate (if GST is a Tax)? And I don't know what I am supposed to Count?</p>
<p>I can sort of figure out Total represents Total of all Sales.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you want to show the numbers as a Bar Code you need a UPC Code you going to have to download and install a UPC Font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finish&nbsp;up the total. Save and will await your answers to the question of above.</p>

<p>Microsoft Excel is very programmable using Visual Basic for Applications. The task you have outlined is quite do-able, but you'll have to learn a bit about VBA first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make a userform to capture the text input from the barcode reader and then tell Excel to perform the search and other operations. I suggest taking things one step at a time, and allow sufficient time to write good software. This will not be a quick
 thing to do.</p>
