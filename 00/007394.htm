<h2>            Problem syncing a windows mobile with Outlook &#39;03 running on a Windows 7 &#40;64 bit&#41; laptop.</h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp;have a Windows 7 (64 bit) laptop and want to sync my windows mobile phone (6.1).&nbsp; I'm running Outlook '03.&nbsp; I installed mobile device center but every time&nbsp;I attach the phone it asks for my Office '07 product key.&nbsp; I've tried the Office '03 key but this
 doesn't work.</p>
<p>I guess this means I can only sync my phone 20 times until I resolve the issue???</p>

<p>Are there any old Office '07 installations on the device available (or removed)? Some OEM images on laptops/desktops have a student/trial version installed. WMDC assumes the latest version is the leading one, leading to this behaviour. Try removing this
 version first....</p>

<p>Something I found using the search function on this board...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Nokia Website Listed <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4678158" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/A4678158</a>&nbsp;this will take you to software update download.</p>
<p>2. Plug your Nokia N810 USB into computer and device (Important) when you turn on your N810 Hold The swap Key down it is located to the left below the webcam.</p>
<p>3. While your device has problems staying on while connected run the update to find your device.</p>
<p>4. Update should find your device and install update it will tell you if it did not find device or if it is searching</p>
<p>5. When download is complete device will start up back at factory settings from the day you got it.</p>
<p>6&nbsp; You will loose the information on it but look at is as starting new i was just glad mine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give it a go and let os know if this set your phome back to factory settings. :)</p>

<h2>            What is NTVDM and why would I need it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP zv6000 laptop fully updated on which I am currently dual booting with Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit and&nbsp;the Windows 10 Preview 64 bit build 9879. Today I got a message that I needed to install NTVDM of one of my Apps would not function properly.&nbsp;
 I am not sure which apps would need this file to be installed. The only 3rd party apps that I have installed is MS Word 13, FoxIt Reader and 7Zip.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a long time Tech Beta Tester and have dual booted many, many times and have never had this message before. So, I am not sure that it is referring to, or if I actually do need it. I don't like adding things that are not really necessary as it
 can cause problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any Apps associated with the Win10 Preview that would require this file to be installed for dual booting?</p>
<p />

            NTVDM stands for NT Virtual Dos Machine. It is not installed by default in Windows 10. It was introduced with Windows Vista as a compatibility component for older programs.&nbsp; It you are installing or running older programs, Windows 10 will identify the
 need for NTVDM and ask you to install it. Once installed, you should not see a request for the component to be installed again.

</p><p><span><em>NTVDM</em> is a system component of all IA-32 editions of the Windows NT family which allows execution of 16-bit Windows and 16-bit / 32-bit DOS applications.&nbsp; I suspect Foxit uses it but am unsure.&nbsp; In any case you can check your

    <title>EOP StandAlone Setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george jeffreyalerta  say:</h3>
<h2>            EOP StandAlone Setup</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an&nbsp;OnPrem Exchange 2010 that is&nbsp;hosting 2 email domains. We currently use&nbsp;Google Apps&nbsp;Spam Filtering but we want to move that&nbsp;to EOP&nbsp;Standalone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have created an EOP account and purchased user licenses. I have done some of the setup configuration but I have a number of questions that I need answers to so that I can finish the configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1. How do I setup the&nbsp;"Domain Purpose" for an EOP Standalone configuration? When I go to the Change Domain Purpose page I&nbsp;only see the following choices: "Outlook on the web for email, calendar and contacts", "Skype for Business for instant messaging and
 online meetings" and "Mobile Device Management for Office 365".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; None of those choices appear to be what I need. I just need EOP Standalone to filter our email and pass it on to our OnPrem Exchange server. We do not want to use any other Office 365 features, just EOP spam filtering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I set "Domain Purpose" so that I can then get the correct DNS settings I need to make to my email domain DNS?</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. DNS - I have seen a number of posts regarding DNS for EOP Standalone that suggest that&nbsp;I only need the MX and TXT records. The CNAME for autodiscover is not needed. However, I have also seen posts that suggest that the&nbsp;"autodiscover" CNAME is needed
 for O365/EOP to&nbsp;finish configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need to add the CNAME to my DNS, finish EOP configuration and then remove the CNAME record from my DNS? Or is there some other way to get EOP configuration to finish correctly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I don't what to immediately switch over to EOP. I want to schedule the switch over for a weekend so that there is less likelihood of lost emails if there are configuration problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do I do when I just want to prep EOP for the switchover but I don't want to switch yet? If I make the DNS MX record changes email will start going to EOP, which I don't want to happen yet. But if I don't make the DNS changes O365/EOP will not finish
 the setup correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to get O365/EOP configuration to finish without making the DNS changes permanent?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. I have setup a Send Connector in EOP and used the Validation test to verify that EOP can send email to my primary email domain. Will all my Accepted Domains use that same Send Connector? Or do I need to create Send connectors for each Accepted Domain,
 even though all the email is going to our single OnPrem Exchange server?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. When setting up the Send Connector in EOP I was asked for a "SmartHost". I put the IP address of our Exchange server. Was that correct? Since that was the only time I was asked for an IP or hostname in the Send Connector creation process and the Validation
 test worked and I received the test email,&nbsp;I assume that "SmartHost" meant "Your Exchange Server". But I would like verification that I put the correct information in the "SmartHost" field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Since I only need EOP to filter email and pass it on to our internal Exchange server can I skip the Send Connector from our Exchange server to O365? I have read some posts that say that if we will not be sending our outgoing email through O365 we can
 skip this part and just continue to send email directly from our Exchange server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can someone please verify that this is correct? Again, we don't want/need Outgoing EOP filtering. Just Incoming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your help with this. I am hoping that the answers to the above questions will allow me to finish the EOP Standalone configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards and thanks,</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<p>Hi Shyamal,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I find your comments surprising given that this forum has been where I found the most posts regarding the setup of EOP in a Standalone configuration. A search of this forum for "exchange online protection standalone" results in over 200 pages of posts
 related to setting up and configuring Exchange Online Protection Standalone. Yet you direct me to the Exchange TechNet support forum where a similar search produces only 2 posts that deal with EOP Standalone, neither of which relate to my questions/problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Based on those results I think I will continue to search this forum for the information I need. If no one decides to answer my post, that is fine. I have already learned a lot from just searching and reading posts on this forum. Of course, I will most
 likely be forced to use your recommended For-Pay EOP Support, but I will first try to answer my own questions by further searching of this forum.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;<span>Bradfion. The availability of updates for games and apps depend on the publishers. However, we can try to further isolate this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you only experience this with <strong>Angry Birds Epic</strong>? How about with the other downloaded apps and games? Do you get any error before the app crashes? Try rebooting your phone. If this is for the Lumia 920, you can press and hold the
 volume down and power keys until it vibrates and restarts. Another option is to remove and re-download the app. Note that this step will delete the app data, including the game level progress. It's best to ask the developer if there's an option to backup the
 app data. Check this link:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.rovio.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rovio Entertainment</a>.</strong></span></p>

    <title>can&#39;t restart computer after using windows defender - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> essbee123  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t restart computer after using windows defender &#91;offline&#93;</h2>
                    <p>My computer was acting weird (shutting down spontaneously, blue screen, annoying pop up adds during&nbsp;use of Internet Explorer,&nbsp;etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;I have Windows 7 Home Premium, 64bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspected a virus.&nbsp; I&nbsp;first used microsoft security essentials and did a full scan.&nbsp; This detected the alureon virus and one other virus.</p>
<p>A message told me to use Windows Defender.&nbsp; I was unable to download Windows Defender.&nbsp; It stated I put Windows Defender Offline onto a clean&nbsp;USB drive and booted the computer from that USB.&nbsp; I did that and did a full scan overnight.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I woke up the next morning, the scan was complete and there was a message saying I needed to restart.&nbsp; I clicked finish, and the computer&nbsp;tired to restart.&nbsp; However, it was unable to open Windows.&nbsp; Windows Startup repair started running, but it was
 unable to fix the problem.&nbsp; Since then, I have restarted multiple times, with the USB either in or out.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; I just keep getting error messages.&nbsp; I even tried a System restore to the farthest back date, but this did not help either.&nbsp; Currently,
 I cannot get the computer to start at all.&nbsp; What can I do?</p>

<p><font color="#0072c6"><br />
</font></p>
<p>We still receive feedback on the forum that many (but not all) users who encounter this issue invlving the removal of Alureon are able to repair their computer by following the steps recommended by GregAnthony.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this procedure is not successful you may need to reformat/reinstall you operating system.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 64bit freezes often on several office computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brennanogburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 64bit freezes often on several office computers</h2>
                    
<p>Basically, what is happening is excel randomly freezes, but does not receive the "Excel is not responding" notification. This started happening right after we moved to Windows 10 Enterprise on Office 2013 32 bit (MLF versions of office) and so we upgraded
 to Office 2016 64 bit in hopes that this would solve the problem. It didn't. There are currently three of us who are experiencing this problem and we have tried several things to fix it, such as updating the computer, restarting, reinstalling Office, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to add detail to the problem, the screen still shows all the options on the visible cells. I cannot scroll, but I can select, copy, paste, type etc, but without any of this reflecting on the visual screen (like it is all happening in the background).
 I know this because I typed and copied selected cells into a specific cell and saved the file. After closing all open Excel documents and reopening that file, the data was there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be temporarily fixed by closing and reopening all excel documents, or by unplugging the docking station which connects two monitors, the keyboard and mouse, and the ethernet network cable to the computer via USB 3.0.</p>
<p>Also, we all have open SQL server 2012, Outlook 2016, Personal Communications iSeries 5.8, Skype for Business 2016, and several instances of excel whenever the problem happens. It seems to happen when a lot of processing power is dedicated to a built in
 query in excel or a large excel file is opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer details: Windows 10 64 bit with 64 bit Office 2016 on Lenovo ThinkPad T440s and T450s, with Lenovo DU9019D1 docking station with dual monitors.</p>

<span>I know how this concerns you, let me&nbsp;help you to resolve this issue.<br />
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<span>Before we proceed, I need more information&nbsp;to help you better.<br />
<br />
1) Have you setup a Microsoft email account (</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Outlook Connector/MAPI)
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>in Outlook?<br />

<br />
If you didn't check whether this&nbsp;issue occurs in a new Outlook profile, I suggest&nbsp;you to try the same and verify the result.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Refer to the following article for instructions on how to create new profile.<br />

</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Note:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
a) Add the email account, then try starting Outlook in the new profile .<br />
b) Ensure that you select the new profile under <strong><span>Always use this profile
</span></strong>for Outlook to start in the new profile.</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<p>I have a mogul 6800 that I have had to get replaced twice. This time none of my non-outlook contacts will sync from my computer to the new phone. I have all the numbers on my computer but cannot sync them to the new
 phone. Anyone have any suggestions? I have alot of numbers and doing them by hand again will be a nightmare!</p>

            When I input a number, then hit save, it offers me two options. It gives me the option to enter it as an Outlook Contact, or as a Windows Live contact.&nbsp;I could never find any info as to what the difference was so some were entered as Outlook, and some
 under Windows Live. I now find that all contacts that were stored under the Windows category will not sync to my new phone. Since I am unable to pull up the contact list on my computer file, I have no idea if all of my contacts were synced to my computer.

<p>Hi RajKumar2946,</p>
<p>In February 2016 build&nbsp;<b>1.1.105.0</b>&nbsp;of Azure AD Connect was released which introduced multiple new features.&nbsp; The scheduler is now built into the sync engine.&nbsp; This means that there is no longer a separate DirectorySyncClientCmd
 tool.</p>
<p>To initiate a Delta Sync, on the DirSync server, open Windows PowerShell and run:</p>
<p><b>Start-ADSyncSyncCycle &nbsp;-PolicyType &nbsp;Delta</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;To initiate a Full Sync, on the DirSync server, open Windows PowerShell and run:</p>
<p><b>Start-ADSyncSyncCycle &nbsp;-PolicyType &nbsp;Initial</b></p>
<p>If you run into any issues when running the cmdlets above, please feel free to post back with the detailed errors and we will provide further assistance.</p>

            <p>It really seems that Homegroup is being sidelined in Windows 10. I really use it a lot, and it works fine in the Anniversary Update, but the new insider versions are not connecting to existing Homegroups.</p>
<p>

    <title>Nokia C2-01 Headphone jack problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maarten_e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia C2-01 Headphone jack problem.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've owned 2 Nokia C2-01s now, and both of them produce the same problem after a few months.</p>
<p>I use the music player very often but sometimes the headphone jack doesn't recognize there is a headphone jack in it. So the phone thinks nothing is inserted, and plays the music through the loudspeaker. Which is annoying when you use public transport. Both
 had this problem after a few months. I've used different headphones to simulate this problem, and it reproduced everytime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like a HW problem, but are there any other C2-01 or C-serie users which have this problem?</p>
<p>I really like the phone, but repairing it is too expensive, so I end up buying a new phone every 3 months.</p>
<p>I've tried to repair i but trying to bow the input in the right direction, but the problem reappeared again after a few days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too bad, because I really like the phone.</p>

<p>Hi Maarten_E,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're sorry to hear about the issue.&nbsp;Have you tried cleaning the headphone socket? In some cases it may gather dust and fluff, preventing the phone from fully 'sensing' that headphones have been plugged in. It may also be that the headphone connectors in
 the phone have been damaged, this can happen if the headphone plug forces the socket to twist (in a tight pocket, for example).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If cleaning the socket does not solve the issue, we would advise you to visit your local
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care point</a> and let them have a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there Zlaja014,<br />
<br />
If you have followed the advice given in the earlier posts in this thread, and that still does not work, then try and check for any firmware updates for your device that may be available. You can do this by checking on the device itself or on your PC via Nokia
 Suite. Update if there is an update available, and if this is still not working, then try Restoring the phone to factory settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
If any of these still do not rectify your problem, then you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for them to inspect. Either that, or hassle your phone shop for a refund / exchange.<br />

<p>I'm having the same problem. I've had the phone for a couple months. I also use it to play music often, through the headphone jack into the auxilary input on my cars stereo. Just today it has started doing this. I tried restarting the phone, but when I try
 restarting it, i just get the white screen, then goes blank, and does this repeatedly untill I pull the battery out. When I remove the memory card, it starts up fine.<br />
<br />
I tried playing music without the memory card in the phone (guessed it could be a problem since the phone wouldn't start with it) but still no luck, so I can rule the memory card out as being the problem.<br />
<br />
I have found that having the auxilary cord plugged in both ends (phone and car stereo), and my car charger plugged into the phone, and just putting it part-way into the cigarette lighter (so it's just earthed and not charging) will make the phone realize that
 the aux cord is in, and then works fine. I thought maybe it was a faulty headphone ground, but I can even unplug the charger and it will stay working until I unplug the aux cord and plug it back in.<br />
<br />
So basically all I have to do is plug the aux cord in, then plug my charger in and unplug it, and it will play music through the stereo. I would still like a proper fix to this problem though</p>

<p>My wife and I purchased 2 Nokia C2-01 phones in Sept.2011 (15mos ago). The headphone jack on my phone now is not functioning at all and since purchase it was erratic. The jack on my wifes phone sometimes makes poor contact or connection. I do like to use
 the radio on it and can no longer do so.Its very dissappointing.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of headset are you using on your Nokia C2-01, is it the one the came in the sales package?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the possible reasons why some other headphones do not work properly on the device is due to the pin of the 3.5 jack. Not all 3.5 jacks have the same pins which fits into the headphone socket of the mobile device. Using a compatible headphone/headset
 is really recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Nokia Stereo Headset WH-102 which is the supported headphone/headset to the device, then most probably it could be a hardware issue on the phone so bringing it to Nokia care Point is the most advisable thing. In this case, you may try to
 contact our local Nokia Support team to assist you on locating your nearest Nokia Care Service center so that our technicians can have an assessment of your phone. You may visit

<p>I had that problem too, went to a cellphone accesory store to buy new headphones- but the 20 or so I tried weren't working either.</p>
<p>I then took my c2-01 to my service provider (from whom I also bought the phone), where i was told that the problem was with the jack. My phone spent the weekend in their labs and VOILA came back in working order!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try sending your phone to a lab too- you should get the same reasults :)</p>

<p>Hi Naresh31,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting and welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that you are having issues with your Nokia device. Did something happen on the phone prior to that? Did you accidentally drop the phone? What type of headphone are you using? Is that the one that came with the sales pack? Are you getting any
 error message? If yes, can you tell us something about the error? Have you tried using different headphone or using your headphone to different phone for us to isolate the issue? Have you tried doing some basic troubleshooting such as
<em>rebooting the phone</em>, <em>soft reset (*#7780#)</em> and <em>hard reset (*#7370#)</em>? If not, please do it first. Make sure that the phone is running on the latest software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Doing a hard reset may delete your personal files, make sure to back up your stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know what would be the outcome. Thanks:smileyhappy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel spreadsheets are opening in Read-Only mode</h2>
                    <p>My computer just started opening my Excel spreadsheets in Read-Only mode, and I have to manually change that every time I open a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, with Word, I am sometimes unable to edit my documents at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both problems just started happening about a year after I purchased Office Home &amp; Student 2016.</p>

            Hi RussFP 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have another Office installed. Looks like either that Office or this Office has become deactivated. 
<br />
<br />Can you confirm?

            Hi Russ
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If the above does not resolve this for you:
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access and check to see if you can open and edit files in Word and Excel . .. .
<br />
<br />If so, from there, you can add an app to the list of safe or allowed apps to prevent them from being blocked 
<br />
<br />Please do not leave Controlled Folder Access turned off permanently       
        </p>

            My Excel spreadsheets and Word documents were all created on an older version of Excel and Word. I determined that if I copy and paste the files onto new blank sheets, I no longer have the problem. Thank you for your response.<br />

<h2>            N8 aol email wont send an email</h2>
                    
<p>Hi i've got the nokia n8 updated to the anna software and my email has decided to change settings and now i carnt send emails, before i could change the settings for sending and recieving account settings, now all i can do in account settings is put in the
 email address and password and a signature. I dont no if it is because of this my email wont send anymore but its really annoying,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can recieve the emails fine, and even write them but when it says its sending it simply puts them in the outbox and doesnt send them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've reset the phone to factory settings and by holding the off button for 8 sec to get the 3 vibration thing and still nothing, and even many times deleted the account and set it back up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>would much appreciate it if anyone has any ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>So you are saying that if you go to Menu &gt; Applications &gt; Mail &gt; scroll down to Settings &gt; select Mailbox &gt; Mailbox settings - you can't access "Advanced mailbox settings" at bottom of screen?</p>

<p>i think the problem is that the server is blocking the outgoing email address, but because my settings have changed and i carnt access the advanced settings to see what the outgoing address is, threres no way of me changing this,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i tried to send a email from my works home and it came up with server wont allow replaying, i googled this and everyone says its the outgoing mail address being wrong</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there any way i can get the advanced serttings back?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using one of the above AntiVirus Programs, this Information from
<strong><em>David O - Support Engineer</em></strong>&nbsp;shows you how to&nbsp;manually enable&nbsp;Windows Defender (<strong><em>disregard Uninstall Information; not possible in Vista</em></strong>):</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b"><font color="#0072c6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b</font></a></p>
<p><span>"Go to Start, <strong>Control Panel</strong>, <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>,
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Services</strong>. Locate Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong> and ensure that the Start-Up Type is
<strong>Automatic. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once changed, click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Exit and Restart your computer. Check back taking the same route to confirm Windows Defender has started"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Note that Windows Defender is not an antivirus program on Vista, just antispyware. What is your installed antivirus program? If it is Microsoft Security Essentials, it will also be repaired with the steps below.<br />

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

            <p>Hi Bill :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS is Windows7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read your ideas on how to fix the constant download error message " Failed - virus scan failed" that you posted on 18Aug2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you then saying that if i AM using AVG(Free) and Microsoft Security Essentials, that i ought to make sure that my Windows Defender is DISABLED? &nbsp;Because i understood you to say that if you are NOT using the AntiVirus Programs you had listed, then you
 need to ENABLE Windows Defender.? Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would SO,SO love to be able to get rid of this totally aggravating problem, as i am unable to download a single darn thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to make sure i understood you correctly before i did anything. And, oh! I would LOVE to be able to use the FREE vs. of Malwarebytes AntiMalware link that you offered, but, am unable to download it :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for ANY help you may have :) &nbsp;I am so desperately in need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kat S.</p>

            <p>You follow the advice from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ee08eaef-5312-4f39-a5bd-0b1577d731ae" title="Le Boule">
Le Boule</a>&nbsp;in the link I posted if you are advised&nbsp;everything that you download contains a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What&nbsp;I wrote is self-explanatory:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One other thing about this statement of yours: "Are you then saying that if i AM using AVG(Free) and Microsoft Security Essentials"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should only have AVG or MSE installed, not both.</p>
<p>You should only have one Antivirus installed, otherwise you may encounter System crashes and other strange System behaviour.</p>

    <title>Adding Skype for Business to existing office 365 Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakehutchins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding Skype for Business to existing office 365 Install</h2>
                    <p>Need help adding skype to an existing office 365 install for a couple hundred machines. The back story is we did an office 365 deployment we built a package&nbsp;and installed it from a thumb drive on all our machines while doing a windows 10 upgrade. although&nbsp;tedious
 it worked nicely all machines now have windows 10 and office 365 (office pro 2016). It had to be done this way because we were limited to 3 MB connections in all our facilities. We were not ready for skype at the time (Managements Decision) so we removed it
 from deployment package. Now we are ready for skype we want to deploy skype and add it to all the machines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the standalone version but it did not play nicely with the office 365 deployment package that we have already installed on our machines. What is the best way to add just skype to these machines? Is it possible to do this using a GPO to push a package?
 We have another project going on that will increase our bandwidth so to download from the cloud is now an option where it was not before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Jakehutchins,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding "But if I run the deployment tool a second time and just remove the exclude part it appears to be essential reinstalling the entire office suite. If I setup the deployment tool to exclude everything but skype then it removes everything except skype.

            <p>Hi Shakti,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is default browser set-up on the system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure Internet explorer is set as default browser and check if the App works fine. Refer to the following link to make Internet explorer default browser.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/make-ie-default-browser#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/make-ie-default-browser#ie=ie-10</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also reset Internet Explorer by running the Fix it in the following article and verify the results.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We
 recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, repair the Office 2013 installation and check if it helps resolve the issue.</p>
