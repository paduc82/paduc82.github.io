    <title>2 accounts under the same email - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            2 accounts under the same email</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been using skype for many years under my main email but never created a microsoft account. I recently created a microsoft account using that same email (but different password) while using my laptop, and now when I sign in to skype, it becomes a completely
 new and fresh skype account without any of my contacts and history I had. If I sign out of my skype and sign in again using that same email, it will go into the new and fresh skype account. However, if I used the username and password of my old skype account,
 I'm still able to access my previous old account. Can you please help as I really want to retain my old skype account but I'm not sure what I am supposed to do. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>To sign in to your old account, make sure to use your Skype name or username instead of the email address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign in using the email address, you are signed in to Skype using the Microsoft account, since Skype is now under Microsoft, you can use your Microsoft account to sign in to Skype.</p>

            Thank you for your reply, but I would like to use the old skype account with my main email address. Not 2 separate ones, so is there any way to merge them and at the same time retain my old skype account under that same email?

    <title>Creating a NEWID&#40;&#41; in Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mielkman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a NEWID&#40;&#41; in Access</h2>
                    Working on a database which is housed on a MS SQL Server 2008 R2 server.&nbsp; I'm connecting MS Access 2013 to it as a front end, each table has an ID field of uniqueidentifier.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The ID is inconsequential for the end user (simply there in case our physical inventory tags ever loop, to maintain uniqueness of the records) and I want the new entry form to autopopulate the ID field wit a generated GUID.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So far, every function MSDN has CLAIMED will do this comes up not-found in Access 2013, even the SQL function NEWID() is unrecognized despite it's extensive documentation in SQL Server.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a way to generate a GUID and populate it to the new record ID field in Access 2013?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            SQL Server has an Identity data type similar to Access's AutoNumber. If you set your ID field to that, its automatic.

    <title>No sound from speakers in Nokia Lumia 635 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barothemadman  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound from speakers in Nokia Lumia 635</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! My Nokia Lumia 635 randomly stopped playing sound. I only get sound when I plug in headphones, but not from the built-in speakers. I get sound during a phone call, but not any other time. I've tried soft resetting many times, even restored factory
 settings. plugging in and out the headphones, resetting with o without headphones plugged in, removing the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the third time this happens to me since I bought the phone last august. Previously the sound just came back randomly, but I'm tired of being late because I don't hear the alarm, missing calls, missing texts, basically having a disfunctional phone. What's
 going on?</p>

<p>I had already tried all of that. I took it to a store of my provider's company (from which I bought it) and they took it for repairing. It worked when it came back, but one week later (today) the problem came back again, on its own. And went away on its
 own just as I was going back to the store.<br />
<br />
Any idea that isn't a reset (because it's obvious it's going to happen again)? because I have tried all possible forms of resetting. I'm regretting buying a Lumia now...</p>

<p>I have had the same issue's with my 635. No sound from speakers or no sound from headphones. It has happened 4 or 5 times now but has always came back and worked. Problem is sometimes it does not work again for a week. And everybody I take it to says they
 don't know what's wrong. Getting sick of not hearing my alarm or calls when they come in. Obviously there is a problem....what is the fix....?</p>

<p>Does Microsoft honestly feel it's put out a worthwhile product in the Windows Phone?? After owning one years ago, I recently ended up getting a Lumia with a new company, hoping that there had been advancements. Alas, this one has proven itself equally disabled
 with better, longer lasting bugs. And, of course, you can count on the lack of both features and support and faulty knowledgebase you've come to expect from Microsoft. This last reply is as useless as the first one was to the query and still lacks any options
 toward issue resolution. "...And, BTW welcome to the community" ??? Really?Everyone who is having this issue is looking to this post for a solution. Can you guys come together with fixes?</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6120 Classic and Bluetooth&#58; Cannot discover device&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new Macbook Pro with built-in bluetooth, and a Nokia 6120 Classic that supports bluetooth...</p>
<p>I know you cannot sync the two using iSync, however, I SHOULD be able to connect the phone to my computer to transfer files, AFAIK?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I try, I can't find my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using OS X's Bluetooth discovery doesn't even see the phone, and entering the device-address directly doesn't work either. (The phone is set to bluetooth ON, discoverable, without access to SIM card)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the phone, I CAN find the mac, but I cannot connect to it. It just says "Waiting for &lt;name of mac&gt;", and nothing happens. (Sometimes it also just ends with an error)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, I cannot send from my phone to the mac. It just says "Opening connection" (Note: The language on my phone isn't english, so it may be called something slightly differently IRL :)), and nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!! What do I do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>in the Windows 10, so I will start first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So far I like the way Microsoft is heading, and return of 2D icons is awesome, in the start menu I would like that</p>
<p>Microsoft enable transparency and return option send this to desktop (create shortcut). I also would disable user account control,</p>
<p>and enable to users that they run programs which are not entered into registry, thats it for now.</p>

            <p>I'm pretty happy that there's a choice between a start screen and a start menu. This put me off upgrading to 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop seems to run a lot smoother on W10. Previous on 7 the cpu use would hit max for no reason, laptop would overheat, browser used way to much cpu, boot and shutdown was slow.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since using W10 all these issues seem to have gone. It wasn't a clean install either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the layout and feel of the start menu and desktop too, only thing I ain't keen on is not been able to chose solid colour on the task bar rather than translucent. I'm pretty OCD and hate that my task bar colour changes depending on whats behind in,
 I like my windows title bars and task bar to be matching lol.</p>

 It can't do the updates in the marketplace. It keeps telling me I should try again later. At times it gives me this error code c00cee3b. There are 28 apps so far waiting to be updated. I'm honesty frustrated.</p>

            <p>It is customary for users to have to click the button to perform the action, not just to set focus there as you are doing. Move your code to the button's Click event.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much Tom. &nbsp;I could display a message when the query returns no records. However I am having another problem now. &nbsp;My error prompts twice each time the query returns no records. Can you please help me again in finding what is the problem? &nbsp;I
 spend the whole day trying to find the problem, but nothing works to avoid the message box to prompt twice. &nbsp;Here is the code with the added error message:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;DoCmd.ApplyFilter "", </p>

            <p>That is impossible, unless you click on the button twice. Set a breakpoint on the MsgBox line and see how often the code stops there. In the VBA editor, check the Debug menu for Toggle Breakpoint, Step Over, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also not that very quickly you will run into problems if you're using VBA without understanding it. There are just too many things&nbsp;that will be baffling to you, and tinkering with it only goes so far.&nbsp;You will either have to learn it or hand it over to someone
 who knows.</p>

            On the contrary I LOVE MSN because it is so trivial. Even my academic husband who reads books like 'how the brain works' used to read terrible trashy romantic novels like Mills &amp; Boon as well. I never understood why until I realised that we all need an
 escape sometimes and that was his. Mine is MSN I go to it every day if only to read the less serious headlines. Life's too short to be serious all the time. MSN is providing a service for those of us who want trivia. It's not to be taken seriously. Enjoy.

<p>Hi Didong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've already set Vietnamese as the voice for the speech, it's very unlikely that the speech goes out as Chinese. To help us work around this problem, we suggest running the Speech troubleshooter. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Search <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search.</li><li>Click it in the search results.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Speech</strong>, then hit <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instruction.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result so we can further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Select a range starting with an active cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmaier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Select a range starting with an active cell</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My code currently looks in row&nbsp;14 of my source workbook and finds a header. It is then supposed to select from rows 15:4999 in that column and paste them to a destination&nbsp;workbook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to&nbsp;leearn how to include an active cell as a part of a range -or- learn how to select the entire column below it (including blank cells).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer the range though. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the bit of&nbsp;code in question...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[CODE]</p>
<p><strong>shSource.Rows("14:14").Select</strong>&nbsp; <em>'Selects&nbsp;row 14 from the source workbook</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Selection.Find(What:="Protection Class", After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlFormulas,&nbsp;_</strong></p>
<p><strong>LookAt:=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlNext, _</strong><br />
<strong>MatchCase:=False, SearchFormat:=False).Select</strong><em> 'Finds the header named "Protection Class" and selects that cell</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Range(Selection, Selection.End(xlDown)).Select</strong> <em>'Selects the Active Cell and the entire column down to the first cell with no data (I need it to select to the 4999 or the end)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>shDestin.Range("K14") = Selection </strong><em>'Pastes the range into&nbsp;the destination workbook</em><br />
</p>
<p>[CODE/]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue I have is with the <strong>Range(Selection, Selection.End(xlDown)).Select</strong>
part. In essence, I need it to say <strong><em>Range(Selection, row 4999).select</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Please help!!!</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

</p><p>One range that is being copied contains a SUM formula. When it copies to the Destination sheet, it pulls the formula rather than just the values. How do I get this to paste values for this one column? Can I simply say something to this effect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Col = Application.Match("Total", shSource.Rows("14:14"), 0)<br />

</p><p>John</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes that's exactly how it's done, that code will paste the values fine. Just one small point, what you should be doing is this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Col = Application.Match("Total", shSource.Rows("14:14"), 0)<br />
&nbsp;LastRow = shSource.Cells(Cells.Rows.Count, Col).End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp;shSource.Cells(14, Col).Resize(<strong>LastRow - 13</strong>).Copy</p>
<p>shDestin.Range("E14").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, _<br />
SkipBlanks:=False, Transpose:=False</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note this uses the lastrow which means you're not copying too many cells and more importantly makes sure you're not missing any</p>

<h3> paolone67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slideshows and Graphics Card configuration</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I launch a slideshow, PowerPoint comes out with a warning message: "<strong><span>PowerPoint&nbsp;</span><span>has&nbsp;</span><span>detected</span> that&nbsp;<span>your&nbsp;</span><span>graphics&nbsp;</span><span>card</span> may not be configured properly for an optimal slide
 show experience</strong>". After this the show starts without any apparent problem.</p>
<p>Is it possible to understand what exactly PowerPoint detects as <em>incorrect</em> or&nbsp;<em>unappropriate</em>&nbsp;in my graphics card configuration? Is there a diagnostic check that I can perform that gives me some suggestion on my graphics adapter configuration?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>What do I need to do to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can Print to PDF and save the file to just my hard drive (not the OneDrive Local location) it works just fine so it is NOT a printer driver issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. &nbsp;This is a very important process for my business and I need to be able to do it this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want to save it to my local folder and then "upload" to Onedrive as this is not a very efficient process that way.</p>

<p><span>Hi Mary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I try to summarize the reproducing steps of the issue you are experiencing. Please confirm whether the steps are the following.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Create a document with Word 2016 and write something on it.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Export the document as PDF via File&gt;Export&gt;Create PDF/XPS and then select the local synced folder as the place where you want to save the document.</span></p>
<p><span>c. After saving it, you go to the local synced folder and can’t find the document.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, I’d like you confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check whether you are using
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the new OneDrive sync client</a> to perform the actions. If no, first configure and install it to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Upload the screenshots showing the local synced folder and the version information of the sync client you are using.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Confirm whether you can find the file in the OneDrive for Business library (online)
<span>&nbsp;</span>and whether the issue happens in a specific file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the reproducing steps aren’t what I mentioned above, list the detailed ones for our investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>It looks like when I select Export within Word it does create the file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not resolve my issue though. &nbsp;I need to use the "Print to PDF" printer to create files. &nbsp;I have since discovered that I am not able to use the function in my accounting program to save files to my onedrive as it uses the "print to PDF" printer
 to create these PDF files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also re-connected my personal 365 folder to my computer and it works just fine to "print to PDF"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the correct version of OneDrive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how else to describe this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Create file in word</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Select File &gt; Print</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Select "Microsoft Print to PDF" Printer</p>
<p>4. Press the Print Button</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;select a location on the OneDrive Business File to save the pdf file</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Type "Test" for the File Name</p>
<p>7. Press the "Save" Button</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;The "Save Print Output As" Screen Closes</p>
<p>9. Navigate to the location in Step #5 and the file is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select a location other than the OneDrive in Step 5 it will create the file fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-connected my OneDrive from my Office365 Personal account and it also works just fine.</p>

            Hi Mary,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed update.<br />
<br />
To further look into the issue, please check if your OneDrive for Business library is syncing correctly. Put some files into the OneDrive folder, and check if will sync to the cloud.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, please save the current Word document (instead of Print to PDF) to the local OneDrive sync folder, and check if it appears.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing

            Hi Mary,<br />
<br />
<br />
For further investigation, could you provide and confirm the following?<br />
1. About “a location on the OneDrive Business File”, is it a local synced folder like OneDrive-xxx?<br />
2. Provide us some screenshots about “select a location on the OneDrive Business File to save the pdf file” and “Navigate to the location in Step #5 and the file is not there.”.<br />
3. If you create a new document to do a test, what’s the outcome?<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can make sure that the newly added file added to the local synced folder can be synced to the cloud successfully, I suggest you reset the new OneDrive client via running C:\Users\UserAccountName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe /reset in
 the command prompt and then restart it to check the result.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Cliff

            Dear Norrain, 
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users using my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />Thanks for your question!
<br />Those emails are not delivered. The senders have received "Mailbox full or Quota exceeded"
<br />This message means that the recipient has too many messages in their inbox. Many email systems prevent users from receiving any new mail until they reduce their mailbox size." 
<br />There senders are aware of that their emails are not received. 
<br />

            <p><span>Hi Teri,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you run the PowerShell command and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven’t tried, run the
<strong>PowerShell </strong>commands by following the steps below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows
<strong>PowerShell </strong>is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the
<strong>.NET Framework</strong>, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Open an Administrator command window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Right click
</span></strong><span>on the taskbar and select
<strong>task manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on<strong> More details
</strong>located at the bottom of the task manager window.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
File </strong>and select <strong>Run New Task</strong>. Make sure you have a check mark beside
<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges.</strong></span></li><li><span>Type <strong>CMD
</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the CMD Prompt:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>After running the above commands and it shows no remaining issues, run the below commands:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4:
</span></strong><span>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5:
</span></strong><span>Check the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If not, <strong>
restart</strong> the PC. In this case try as a new <strong>Administrator user account</strong>.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write back to us with the status of the issue for further assistance. Your reply is important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;JillianConnel,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Nokia discussions board!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to fix this issue, I advise you to perform a soft reset on your phone: type *#7780#. Default lock code is 12345.&nbsp;If the issue persists, perform a hard reset. First of all, back up your data using&nbsp;<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-ovi-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Nokia
 Suite</span></a>&nbsp;(Tools &gt; Back up). Once your data is fully backed up, &nbsp;type *#7370# on the keypad.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you may also check for updates on Nokia Suite (by going to Tools &gt; Updates).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know how you get on and feel free to post any other questions you may have.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Is it a New problem or right from the day you started using this device ?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the phone has the latest Firmware. If not update it thru' Nokia Suite.</span></p>
<p><span>Next,&nbsp;</span>Remove the SIM and the Memory Card. Now see if the problem repeats. If not then place ONLY the SIM and check and then ONLY the MC and check. If you find that SIM is the problem then try other SIM ( borrow from friends / family members).
 If works fine then get your SIM replaced from your Operator. If the problem is due to MC then copy your data on the PC and format the card. then check again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem remains after both this also, then try a Soft reset. First back-up all your data because this reset will erase all data from the Phone memory. Then dial
<strong>*#7370#</strong> followed by 12345 (default code unless changed by you) when prompted.</p>

<p>No. If you have already tried the Hard reset, there is no need for the Soft..as it won't make any difference ...BTW, try the other things suggested and post the results ..</p>

What do mean by saying "Clear RAM". If you are referring to clean your temporary files, go App's Menu&gt;Storage&gt;Internal Storage&gt;Temporary Files.

    <title>When will mobile editing be available for Business Essentials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            When will mobile editing be available for Business Essentials plan&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I do not see the point in restricting the mobile apps editing for business essential license. when i can edit in full or part using the free onedfive/outlook sign in. this is absolutely bad feature setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further more i can edit using the business one drive app (direction to word/excell app) then just signing into a personal account which makes no sense what so ever. just make it available for business essentials full stop.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t activation Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activation Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 365 with my job and I can install it on 5 different systems. I successfully installed Office 365 once on my laptop. I now have a new PC and I did exactly the same thing ton install Office 365, but I can't activate it.<br />
<br />
If I open any Office application (Word, for instance), it will ask me to connect. I will enter the same ID and password I use to get the executable file (for the installation) and to sign in here and then it would say something like "Oups, we have problems,
 please help us".<br />
<br />
Then, I go on my Office profile. It shows I only installed Office on one system (my laptop) and only offer me to install it again.<br />
<br />
I tried to install it 3 different ways, it didn't help me.<br />
<br />
How can I activate it properly ?</p>

<p>Hi Thierry98,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updated information. Based on the error message you provided in your last reply, it seems there’s something wrong with the Office 365 subscription. I checked your Community user profile information, if you are using
Thierry.lXXX@HoXXXC.onmicrosoft.com as the activation account, based on my investigation from back end, I find that the Office subscription is in “locked out” status for your whole tenant.
</p>
<p>The Office client activation checking timer job runs every 30 days. It should be why you still can use Office on your laptop. But the new install needs to check the license, so that’s why you meet the issue because of the problem of the subscription.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s not a specific client issue. Your organization admin needs to check billing status via Office 365 Admin Center &gt; Billing &gt; Subscriptions to check whether the related subscriptions are in active status, then seek help via Office 365 Admin
 Center &gt; Support to contact billing support team. </p>
<p>If you still need further help, you can post back to let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Rena</p>
