<h2>            How can I disable Runtime Broker or decrease its Memory usage&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot go a few hours without Runtime Broker overtaking my entire Memory (8gigs DDR3). I cannot perform any simple actions and my system bogs down with warnings of this app. I can End Task in task manager but it comes back within a couple hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I've read all the forums on this, and no one has a solution. Is there a real fix to this? I do not use any Microsoft Store apps (at least that I've downloaded) and the ones on my computer came with Windows 10, of which I have uninstalled all
 I can, but don't use any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any real ideas or thoughts? No malware (says Windows system defender, Malware Bytes, and 2 others).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any apps that people know are the culprits? etc.</p>

            <p>There is a registry change that should fix this. I had problem with runtime broker using way too much cpu%. I made the reg change and it is now fixed. The only thing that seems to be affected is that live tiles are not live anymore, which I didn't use anyways.
 You can try this---<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TimeBroker] "Start"=dword:00000003<br />
<br />
Change the 3 to a 4.<br />

<h2>            Windows Explorer - Copy Paste Problem</h2>
                    I have Windows XP SP3 - I have read the other solutions to this issue and none fit my problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I can drag a picture file from Windows Explorer to my graphics program and it loads, I can right-click on the picture file in Windows Explorer and select "Open with" and it loads, but I cannot right-click, copy a file and paste it into my graphics program.
 Right-click and Copying a embedded picture from a Word document or from any browser and pasting into my graphics program also works. Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V doesn't work either. Any suggestions?

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The graphics program is irfanview, but it doesn't make any difference because copy paste in the way I described it won't work for Paint or any other editing program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I went through the procedure of a Normal startup state, the exe file downloaded, I double-clicked it, accepted the license agreement, and then a message appeared that "Guided Help cannot be downloaded right now". It went on to say "visit the Microsoft
 Help &amp; Support website" which as usual was not any help at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just tried to copy paste the error message to this reply and it didn't work. I'll try Method 2 now.</div>

            I have just tried Method 2 for starting XP with a clean boot. I got as far as Step 2, no. 7 "Click All and then click OK". As soon as I clicked OK an error message popped up saying that the operation couldn't be performed because I wasn't logged on as
 the Administrator. But, I was logged on as the Administrator, I have no other account on this computer.
<div><br />
<div>I continued to reboot nonetheless, but of course the problem remained. I am hesitant to continue with Step 4 which is the optional step to disable features because it permanently removes all restore points from the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you think it advisable to continue with Step 4?</div>

            <p>Hello paulbasel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for the response back.&nbsp; What antivirus software do you currently use?&nbsp; When have you last ran a full virus scan on your system and have you ran any malware removal software?&nbsp; If you haven't already, I would first suggest performing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malware removal:</p>

<p>&nbsp;How long have you been experiencing this issue and&nbsp;have you made any changes&nbsp;to your system,&nbsp;either new software/hardware?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Did Steps 1-3 help?<br />
<br />
Do you think Step 4 will help?<br />
<br />
I wonder how removing all Restore Points will help with a copy/paste problem in Explorer...???<br />
<br />
There is no Step 5 after that.<br />

Oh dear... I will stay tuned for a bit and see if the issue persists.

            Just to recap the problem:
<div><br />
<div>1. I can drag and drop a picture file from one explorer window to another.</div>
<div>2. I can copy paste a picture file from one explorer window to another.</div>
<div>3. I can right-click a picture file and select "Open with" for example, Paint and it will open in Paint.</div>
<div>4. <u>I <b>cannot </b>copy paste a picture file from explorer into picture editing software, e.g., Paint, etc., but I
<b>can </b>copy paste an image from my Chrome browser into editing software.</u></div>
<div>5. I can copy paste a text/doc file from one explorer window to another</div>
<div>6. I can copy paste a text/doc file in Word, Notepad etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am running XP Pro SP3, fully patched, behind a WAP (16 digit key) protected router, using the latest versions of Avast and Comodo. I have run scans with fully updated Spybot S &amp; D as well as Malwarebytes and the only thing found was that I had disabled
 Windows antivirus security alerts. A HackThis scan reveals nothing unusual at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know exactly when this behavior started because I don't copy paste picture files every day and don't think I have for maybe a month or two. I work on so many different programs every day that it is hard to say when it began.</div>
<div><br />
<div>During the last month, the only program I have installed was ClickTo and I deinstalled it to see if it affected the behavior but sadly it did not.</div>

            I have no idea whether Step 4 will help but I don't like the idea of deleting all Restore Points and it doesn't seem logical that this would have anything to do with the behavior I am describing. What is disturbing is the fact that clean boot process couldn't
 be performed and that the manual clean boot process failed because the procedure didn't recognize me as the Administrator. Yet, I can perform all other functions as the system administrator so I'm not sure why both clean boot procedures failed.

            Hey Paulbasel,
<div><br />
<div>I was re-searching your error "<span>"Guided Help cannot be downloaded right now" and the result I was seeing was that this appears when you are not signed into the Admin account, then&nbsp;continuing your posts on
 December 30th you got another Admin block, so I have an Idea I would like you to try.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p>-In Windows Explorer, click the program executable file that you want to open.</p>
<p>-Press SHIFT and hold, right-click the program icon, and then click Run as.</p>
<p>-Log on using an Administrator account,&nbsp;</p>
<p>-In User name and Password, type the Administrator account name and password&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>For more help follow<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this link
</a>on How to enable Run as Admin in Windows XP.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So try and run the original file as Admin, and let us know the status after you gave that a try. Thanks and I hope this was helpful!</span></div>

            Hello. This sounds to me like the problem lies within explorer. What version of IE are you currently using, and have you recently tried any beta software? I recommend uninstalling your IE and then reinstalling. Especially if this issue has not been occurring
 since day one. See if this link helps you at all. Good luck, let us know how it works out for you.

            <p>This is likely a hardware problem that will require the services of a competent hands-on technician.&nbsp; It could be a failing screen, the cable to the screen through the hinge or the video circuitry on the main board of the computer.</p>

<h2>            Digital game installation stuck at 0&#37;</h2>
                    <p>So basically i got the new minecraft better together version on my xbox one (orignal ) last year and it installed fine. Recently it needed an update and when updating it was stuck on 0% so i uninstalled the game completely, so i have tried reinstalling and,
 again, it is stuck on 0%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have power cycled the console, cleared local saved games, checked for a console update and tried going offline and online to install. Also i should note that this only happens with minecraft, i have tried installing other games / updates and they installed
 perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>note: the game is digital and only happens to this certain digital game</p>

            Definitely try the other suggestions here, as that's what I would do as well. If it's still not working, I just wanted to add that you might just need to wait a little bit and try again. I've experienced a lot of things like this over the past year where
 nothing I tried worked, but after leaving it for a couple of hours to do some running around, make dinner, etc, and then coming back to it and trying it again, I found that it just worked. I know it's not a real, technical answer, but sometimes just leaving
 it for a bit and coming back to it will actually work. I've had plenty of instances where I did that, and for no real explanation because I hadn't tried anything like a hard reset or power cycle or reinstalling anything etc, it just went 'poof' and worked
 on its own lol. If nothing else is working, take a little break from it and try it again tonight. I'd say about 50% of the time, it actually just works on its own when you come back to it. I can't explain it, but it works sometimes for me. Good luck!<br />

    <title>Runtime Broker &#124; Groove Music 25gb Page File usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ritzy business  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime Broker &#124; Groove Music 25gb Page File usage</h2>
                    <p>Every time I run the "Groove Music" app my page&nbsp; file would almost instantly pop from 1.9gb(which is its default state on reboot) all the way up to 18gb within seconds.&nbsp; It only happens with this metro&nbsp; app~ so not completely sure why it is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within 3-6 minutes runtimebroker would be shut down due to memory usage, and most open applications like firefox would crash.&nbsp; Closing Groove Music did not shrink my page file~ memory issues would also persist till reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I don't absolutely&nbsp; /need/ to use Groove Music, I find its nice and adds some eye candy to the start screen if you enable the live tile so I'd really like to make it work.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>:<span>&nbsp; </span>I would suggest you to run App troubleshooter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Type ‘Troubleshooting’ in the search next to start.</li><li>Click on ‘View All’ on left side and select Windows store Apps’.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> I suggest you to run sfc scan. System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Follow the below link on how to run sfc scan applies to Windows
 10.</p>

</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

            <p>Hi I found this useful repair (instructions below *) when you system plays up, it still doesn't cure the runtime broker issue, keeps it manageable, mine run's around 10% now, was hitting 30%, It does tend to help sorting any glitches you may be having. Also,
 if you happen to have an SSD running your OS, try just turning paging off, SSD's don't need it. Indexing, prefetch and superfetch, hibernation, auto defrag and boot time defrag you can also disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Click Start&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the search box type cmd, cmd.exe will pop up in a list.<br />
Right click it, then select 'run as administrator.<br />
<br />
A black box will open up, in the black box type or copy and paste - Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth<br />
hit return/enter. Let it run and don't use your PC while it runs. Once complete should hopefully have worked. Should say&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"The restore operation completed successfully.....(and maybe something else)"<br />
<br />
Now type or copy and paste in the black box again - sfc/scannow<br />
Hit return/enter. Let it run. Once complete should hopefully have worked. Should say&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."<br />
<br />
If it does, you are all done. type exit and hit return/enter<br />
<br />
Job done. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not saying this will help you but works for me. Started using this repair on Windows 8 and it seems to work with Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Microsoft account password characters limited on the Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> strider hr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft account password characters limited on the Xbox 360</h2>
                    <p>Check this out! I've just learned something that&nbsp;I need to share with all customers regarding their Microsoft accounts affiliated with their&nbsp;Xbox 360 profile&nbsp;sign in...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The minimum amount of characters you can input for your password is 6, while the maximum is 16. If you pass those boundaries, you will accidently block yourself from signing in to&nbsp;your profile...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, on your Microsoft account itself, I don't see any limit to any characters needed to creating a password...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am informing you all&nbsp;about this, because I had to change my password about three times in order for me to play on my 360 again...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Until Microsoft &amp; Xbox are perfectly integrated with one another, I strongly suggest to anyone who still owns a 360 to keep your Microsoft account&nbsp;passwords at 6 minimum to 16 maximum, or the same thing will happen to you...</p><p><br /></p><p>Game On&nbsp;&nbsp; : )</p>

            Hi Scott 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h2>            Wifi disconnects, then reconnects for 5 seconds, and disconnects again with can&#39;t connect to this network</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>so I have been having this issue with my home network for a long while now almost three month. All devices in my home connect successfully to the wifi and the internet works on them just fine except for my laptop. Even if I check the mark for connect automatically,
 once I open the laptop, the wifi is disconnected. I try to connect to the home network but here is what happens for the network icon in that order: it gives me the red x with a screen and the cable behind it, a disconnected wifi, a connected wifi for 5 seconds,
 a disconnected wifi with a red x and can't connect to this network. Now, I found a temporary fix is that I unplug the router for 10 seconds, plug it again and then the wifi and internet connect to my laptop on their own. But here is the thing, I have to do
 that every single day in order to get internet on my laptop for the past three month. I tried a lot of the fixes online like forget network,... , but I cannot seem to understand where the issue is to begin with. I have sent the laptop to tech support and whatever
 they did fixed the problem for exactly one week and problem kept persisting from there on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, I am not tech savvy so I tried to find any information to help:</p>

            Hi RomaMaro,
<br />
<br />I am a tech expert, hoping I can help with your issue.
<br />
<br />I'd suggest going to your laptop manufacturer's website, locating your model and downloading the latest wifi drivers.

            You can also download drivers directly from the Intel website:

            One other thing I'd try is to reset your router back to factory settings and set it up again.

The whole purpose of having a password is that one is supposed to <br />

<h2>            Up loading pictures off an SD card onto my PC with Vista</h2>
                    
<p>This may sound like a completely stupid question, but this is the first time I have had or used Vista.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to upload pictures from an SD card onto my pc?&nbsp; If it matters, I've got a Dell inspiron 1545.&nbsp; I've always used windows xp until
 about 4 days ago.</p>

<p><span>Hi Cope004,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
You can retrieve pictures from your SD card by using a card reader and accessing the card from the Computer button in the Start menu. It should be listed as a removable drive or removable media.</span></p>
<p><span>There is more information available in the Help and Support section, accessible from the Start menu,
</span></p>
<p><span>by typing "How do I get pictures from my camera to my computer?"<br />
<br />
Give that a try if you like and let us know how it works out.</span></p>

<h2>            Console Window keeps popping up for one second then vanishes before I can read it</h2>
                    a console window (black background and white letters) keeps popping up for 1 second and then vanishes before i have time to read it - How can i stop that, or how can i capture what is written on the console window before it disappears (o that I can troubleshoot
 it)?
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>

            <p><span>Hi Denny Wilson,
</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you have some issues with the lifecam HD 5000. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may boot the computer in clean boot state and check if that helps.
</span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue.</p>
