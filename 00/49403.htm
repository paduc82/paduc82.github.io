    <title>Cannot link to a USB HD Connected to Router Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pvdg42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot link to a USB HD Connected to Router Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Similar issues have been posted to this and other forums in the past, but I will describe my specific situation here:</p>
<p>I have a USB hard drive connected to my Linksys EA 3500 router and am trying to create a link to it from one specific laptop via WIFI in Windows 10 Build 14965. I also have a second laptop where I had no difficulty (same Win 10 build) creating a share to
 the USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to create a share, using either \\192.168.1.1 or \\LinkSys17963, the task aborts with the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>\\LinkSys17693 is not accessible. You might not have permissions to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.</p>
<p>A specific logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have no issues creating shares to the drive from the other laptop or from the 3 other computers on my network, I believe there must be a problem on the laptop in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how I can fix this gratefully accepted.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To link your laptop to the USB hard drive via Wi-Fi, we will need to access your router's settings. We recommend that you get in touch with
<a href="http://www.linksys.com/us/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LinkSys</a> support for guidance on this process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have additional questions.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Because it wasn't mentioned, what was the source AUDIO format you are/were working with?<br />

</p><p><strong>Yellow Exclamation Mark stuff &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If your system's codecs are updated, you shouldn't have any problems with encoding the video. But if you feel that your codecs are up to date and you're still having a problem, you should consider converting the source audio for the problem clips to a
<strong>WAV</strong> file.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Freemake Video Converter is one of the most recommended media converters for assisting users converting their videos to WMV, but it also converts AUDIO files. Freemake Video Converter is extremely easy to use, but there's some 'opt-out'
 software bundled with the installer that makes user nervous. I've created a post to illustrate the process of the download of the application, the installation step-by-step, explaining which options are optional. I have also provided some screenshots on just
 how easy it is to convert your media; this includes exports to WAV/WMA/MP4 files.</p>

</p><p><strong>DVD Stuff</strong><br />
</p>
<p>When you referred your problem as 'try to burn', I assume that you're trying to create a DVD.&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, it's important to know exactly how Windows Movie Maker creates a DVD. So to clarify, Windows Movie Maker
<strong>DOESN'T CREATE A DVD</strong>; it exports a WMV file to a <strong>TEMP</strong> location where Windows DVD Maker with the WMV in its que for processing. Windows DVD Maker takes the WMV file and
<strong>CONVERTS</strong> it again to a <strong>VOB</strong> format that DVD's use natively; it's just useful to know how the application accomplishes this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">To troubleshoot problems creating a DVD from Windows Movie Maker,&nbsp;you'll want to export your movie to
<strong>WMV</strong> and use a program to play it back [like <strong><a href="http://www.videolan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VLC</a></strong>]&nbsp;to ensure everything is as it should be. If everything looks fine/OK, move on to Windows DVD Maker [<em>open it manually</em>].
 &nbsp;If the movie didn't export correctly, you'll know the issue is with Windows Movie Maker.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">As another step in trouble shooting, try burning the&nbsp;WMV file to disc&nbsp;with Windows DVD Maker. If the burned disc is flawed, Windows DVD Maker is the problem; use another DVD authoring software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps... </p>

<h2>            window 10 useless</h2>
                    <p>I am not a computer whiz , just one of thousands of average people who use their computers for everyday tasks. I would assume that the brilliant minds at Microsoft are paid big Dollars to keep the programs up to date . My question is how do they get it so
 wrong. Had to get a new computer , went to reload Photo Gallery which was a user friendly Program , no longer available , Windows 10 photo App absolutely useless , in each folder it has arranged photos in random order , ask any keen photographer what they
 think of the program &amp; your ears will burn .</p>
<p>updates , popup tells me I am trying to update to a USB using settings ???&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went on to Skype , found I had new Version , popup tells me my webcam is already in use on another device &amp; that I have no speakers connected to my computer. downloaded classic skype which worked perfectly. Turned computer off overnight &amp; Microsoft changed
 it to new Skype giving me 2 useless Apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do they actually test before they foist these changes on us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do Mac computers have the same problems?</p>

<div>Hi Suzainura,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>There could be a number of factors as to why you are experiencing slow PC performance in Windows 10. One possible cause could be insufficient storage space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you let your computer run on it best performance by following the steps below:</p>

    <title>Modify Touch Screen Keyboard in Windows Kiosk Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ram addict  say:</h3>
<h2>            Modify Touch Screen Keyboard in Windows Kiosk Mode</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm opening Windows in kiosk mode and inside it i run Google Chrome also in kiosk mode. (So kiosk inside kiosk).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I want to limit the users to only that particular tab that opens by default in Chrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the keyboard that appears on screen when selecting an input field, people can use chrome shortcuts such as : CTRL + T or CTRL + N and I want to get rid of that. (No physical keyboard will be available, only touch screen keyboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can i disable <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbada10c-6abe-49ee-9017-750e66565ab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbada10c-6abe-49ee-9017-750e66565ab1" /></a>the
<strong>ctrl button</strong> from the touch screen keyboard? Or is it another solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Things I've tried:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Disabling Chrome shortcuts ( Chrome doesn't let you do that, unlike mozilla )</li><li>Disable ctrl command from registry ( This blocks ctrl only for the physical keyboard, not for the on screen one )</li><li>Install a custom keyboard, even though I was able to remove the ctrl key, it wouldn't be accepted as a solution because of security risks.</li></ol>

</p><p><span>Chrome has Kiosk Mode, but that won't prevent users from using Windows keyboard shortcuts (like

</p><p>As you can see in the picture, the touch screen keyboard doesn't have an ALT button, just a CTRL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can get rid of that, there will be no more shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There won't be a physical keyboard.</p>

            I would go to your options in the program and see what you are using for your scratch disk. It may not even be set, meaning you can just choose your External drive and solve it easily.

            <p>Why baby talk? If you've made it to 80, you've got intelligence and wisdom that younger generations can't begin to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your real problem is that Photoshop Elements 9 is very old software that's not likely to work properly or at all on Windows 10. The current version of Photoshop Elements is 14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can either buy PE 14 - which frequently goes on sale - or you can try another product. Many people who've tried the free
<a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">paint.net software</a> quickly forget about Photoshop Elements. And you don't get constantly nagged by Adobe to sign up for this or that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if Adobe is your girl and you aren't giving her up, try the free online <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Photoshop Express Editor</a>. And as long as we're talking about free online photo editing software, if you really want to impress the grandkids, try

    <title>HDMI Audio Issues with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> choogar  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI Audio Issues with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently built a new HTPC with Windows 10. I am using the onboard HDMI output to send both video and audio to my Denon receiver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first week or so that I was using the PC, everything worked fine. Recently I have had serious audio issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the PC is first rebooted, it will play the first audio sound that is played, either a system sound or a test sound through the control panel. Once that first sound is played, nothing else comes through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I use the configure wizard for setting up multi channel surround and hit "test", it will play the first test sound, which happens to be the front left speaker, but the other channels will not play their test sounds. If I select a different
 speaker configuration, it again will play the first test sound but nothing else. I know the other channels work, because if I select a new configuration and then click a different speaker, that speaker will play the first test sound, but no other sounds will
 play until I select a new configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a dozen or more W10 troubleshooting articles and have tried these steps, all with no results:</p>
<p>- Updated all drivers to the newest versions</p>
<p>- Uninstall and reinstall the audio devices in device manager</p>
<p>- Changed the output quality through audio options&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I did try to run the drivers in compatibility mode, but that step was unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading your second article, I did try to install the generic Windows driver for my device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This resulted in basic sounds working in windows through all channels, however I am still unable to get audio in my media player app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digging into settings, it appears this is caused by the fact that under "Supported Formats" on the newly changed High Definition Audio Device, most of the standard Audio formats are missing. Where before I had DTS-HD, Dolby True HD, DTS Audio and many others,
 I now only show Dolby Digital and a few others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly my problem is caused by a driver issue, but the generic driver doesn't seem to be working either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're getting closer!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dustin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you’re having with your mouse can either be hardware or software related. To further isolate your concern, we'd like to as a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the device?</li><li>Which Windows version and build are you using? Type <strong>winver</strong> in the search bar and press
<strong>Enter</strong> to find out.</li><li>When did the issue begin? have you made any major changes on your device prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest that you check the latest Windows update on your device as this method can address any device incompatibilities that may be causing the issue.&nbsp; To check for updates in Windows 10, select the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then go to <strong>Settings&gt;Update</strong> <strong>
&amp;</strong> <strong>security&gt;Windows</strong> <strong>Update</strong>, and select <strong>
Check</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>updates</strong>. If Windows Update says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows is up to date yet the issue still persists, we suggest that you run the
<strong>Hardware</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Devices</strong> <strong>Troubleshooter</strong>. This automated troubleshooter will try to identify and then resolve the issues that it finds. See
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Microsoft easy fix</strong></a> and click the <strong>Find and fix problems with devices and hardware</strong> link to run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>

<p>I too am having this issue. I got the latest updates and ran the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter above, but neither of these helped. See answer to questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the device? -&gt; Microsoft Surface Mouse on Surface Book</li><li>Which Windows version and build are you using? Type&nbsp;<span>winver</span>&nbsp;in the search bar and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>&nbsp;to find out.&nbsp; -&gt; Windows 10, 16299.214</li><li>When did the issue begin? have you made any major changes on your device prior to the issue? -&gt; Just recently, over the last week or so, maybe? It's hard to remember exactly when, you just kind of put up with things until one day you snap :P I
 do not believe there was any major changes, but as I can't 100% say when it started, there may have been some updates installed prior.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing more about this issue, it's really annoying!</p>

<p>OK so for me it is a hardware issue with the mouse - I've brought in another one from home and it scrolls perfectly. So at least I know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, not very impressive as I've had the Surface mouse for less than 6 months.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 LTSB Language Packs do not install for all users - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_7499  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 LTSB Language Packs do not install for all users</h2>
                    I install and test the language packs before backing up an image for the machines used in one of our labs but they are only available on the local administrator account that I build the image on. Any new users that log into the machine have to install
 the language packs for themselves. Is this data not stored in the Windows files anymore but in user profile/app data instead? Is there a way to have the language pack installed to the entire OS and not just one user? Would it have to be group policy?

            Hi David
<br />
<br />Language packs are normally downloaded from the Internet because they are considered as optional features. 
<br />
<br />Here is an example of installing a language pack. 
<br />
<br />You will see there are stages where it needs to connect to the Internet to download necessary files.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a0539b6-0e2d-48a3-b7a4-fdc769be0556?upload=true" />

            Not sure if you read my question. The issue is not the process of installing the language pack, I am perfectly capable of doing that. The issue is that the language packs disappear when a new AD user logs in and need to be reinstalled for that specific
 user.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are unable to install driver and your device manage is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the phone that you are trying to connect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused due to various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service disabled.</li><li>Permission in registry missing.</li><li>User profile corrupt.</li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method1: Enable Plug and Play Windows Service</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click Start, click Run, type services.msc, and then click OK.</span></li><li><span>Double-click Plug and Play.</span></li><li><span>If you receive a Configuration Manager message, click OK.</span></li><li><span>In the Startup Type list, click Automatic, and then click OK.</span></li><li><span>Close Services.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Edit the registry permissions</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>From the desktop press Windows flag key + R , and type "regedit".</span></li><li><span>Navigate to “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum”.</span></li><li><span>Right-click on </span>
<strong>Enum</strong><span> and choose </span><strong>Permissions</strong><span>. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>At this point you will probably notice there are no permissions on this key.</span></li><li><span>Click "Add" and add the group "Everyone" and the user "SYSTEM".</span></li><li><span>Select "Everyone" and check "Read" ONLY!</span></li><li><span>Select "SYSTEM" and check "Full Control".</span></li><li><span>Click the "Advanced" button and select&nbsp;"Replace permission entries on all child objects with entries shown here that apply to child objects".</span></li><li><span>Click OK and if a warning message comes up, just click OK</span></li><li><span>Close “regedit” and restart the computer</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other devices category is displayed, only when there are devices connected to you PC that doesn't have drivers or if Windows couldn't &nbsp;find the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to connect the phone via different port&nbsp;or try to download the PC suite for the phone and install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, for further assistance please reply.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>
