    <title>Lumia 950 XL connected to Display Dock &#40;Continuum&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lumia 950 XL connected to Display Dock &#40;Continuum&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Lately, I have been using my phone with the Display Dock much more than before. Therefore I have some questions. First off a background on my setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Lumia 950 XL, latest firmware, build 14393.5 with a recent hard-reset.</p>
<p>- Display Dock, latest firmware.</p>
<p>- Samsung display, CF591, 27 inch with 1920x1080 as native resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When my dock and display&nbsp;are connected together with a Displayport cable, all is well until I start an app with sound or watch a page with sound. The sound is heard perfectly clear, as one would expect, but when the sound stops however, it starts with
 massive pop noises. These are really loud noises and volume on either the phone or the display seems to affect this popping noise. Is this something anyone is aware of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When my dock and display&nbsp;are connected together with a HDMI cable, does it send its signals on limited- or full-range(0-255)? My small research on this seems to suggest that is sends the signals with full-range, but could we get a setting to control this
 ourselves? And can anyone confirm this? Does it always send on full-range or is it display dependent?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is it possible with either Displayport or HDMI to go over 60hz? Would be great in some way to use our displays to its full potensial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Are there any ways to load a custom .icc profile for the attached display?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. On build 14393.5, I can't seem to find the Display Dock in the Gadget app anymore. Is this something that would be fixed soon? Anyone else experiencing this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Font-rendering on the attached display is really bad. I mean, it looks much better when I attach my Surface to the screen with the same resolution. Not to mention the great handling of fonts when connecting a Mac. It looks much better when I set the the
 scale to 125%. I am quite sure that it is just not the scaling, but there seems to me to be a different type of antialiasing on the fonts going on then. Can someone confirm this in any way? And is someone working on fixing this?</p>

            <p>Leave the boxes for individual nonprinting characters <em>unchecked</em> &amp; also clear the master check box for
<strong>All</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without having to go into the Preferences dialog you can use the <strong>¶</strong> button on the Home tab of the Ribbon or the
<strong>Command+8</strong> keyboard shortcut to toggle the nonprinting characters On/Off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what "lines" you're referring to, though. Other than manual Page Breaks &amp; Section Breaks nonprinting characters does not include lines of any sort. There is no explicit check box for them, but they're included automatically when the display
 of nonprinting characters is toggled On/Off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a hunch, but if this is what you're referring to:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21998440-4f90-47c3-a008-29e96cc4d6c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21998440-4f90-47c3-a008-29e96cc4d6c3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't controlled by nonprinting characters. It's because you have the box checked in that same Preferences pane for
<strong>Text Boundaries</strong>. Clear that check box in the <strong>Show in Document</strong> section at the top of the pane to turn the feature off.</p>

    <title>why are there developer tools on my browser and as a toolbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quicksandyamurray  say:</h3>
<h2>            why are there developer tools on my browser and as a toolbar</h2>
                    I am using Google browser at the moment because IE is constantly crashing and freezing. But in the drop-down for IE tools is a developers tools option I had never seen before. It is labeled F12 developer tools. I have also opened the browser and found
 it opened at the bottom. Since I don't know how to program, etc. there should be no reason for it to be used. I am the only &nbsp;on this computer to my knowledge, since it is a personal computer with only my account on it from the original setup. There is also
 an XML DOM object toolbar add-on that I know is Microsoft's, but wasn't always on my browsers. I tried to read up on it, but it is over my head and I didn't comprehend what it would do or why it would be there. I am getting messages and notations on my computer
 in my control panel and in general, that some settings are being implemented by my administrator. Since I am the Admin. and I didn't set them, how do I pinpoint those things? I tried the Admin console, but again I do not know

<p><br />
How did you get IE9?&nbsp;&nbsp; It has to be installed separately on W7, so if someone did that for you they might have left the Developer Tools enabled and pinned.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that pinned at the bottom is the default.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect that most people unpin it and leave it
 unpinned.&nbsp;&nbsp; In either case Press F12 to dismiss it.</p>
<p><br />
I have no idea why you would have "an&nbsp;XML DOM Object toolbar".&nbsp;&nbsp; That sounds like something that was last available for IE6 (e.g. before there was a built-in Developer Tools in IE.).&nbsp;&nbsp; The old IE Developer Toolbar has been incompatible with IE since IE8 and
 I thought could not even be installed in it.</p>

<p>So, if that is what you have installed, definitely uninstall it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing that might even solve your "crashing and freezing"&nbsp; symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, to answer your question, the Developer Tools are not just there for developers; some of them are also useful for end-users when diagnosing their problem symptoms and trying to refine their symptom descriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ignore them but be aware
 of them so you can press F12 when you need to and are ready to use them.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. When did the problem started?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Did you try installing some sort of add-on or toolbar for Internet Explorer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try the following steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p><span>Run Internet explorer with no add-ons. Follow the steps to open Internet with no add-ons mode:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on <strong><span>start.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. In the search box type in <strong><span>Internet explorer.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>c. Select <strong><span>Internet (No add-on mode).</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you are not facing the issue, then add-on may be causing the error.</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the following article and try the steps provided to enable add-ons individually to determine which of the add-ons may be causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-to-manage-add-ons-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to manage add-ons
 in Internet Explorer 9</a> </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not resolve the issue, then refer the article and follow the steps to reset IE.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reset Internet Explorer settings
</a></span></p>
<p><span>When you reset Internet Explorer settings, all add-ons and customizations are&nbsp;disabled and start with a fresh version of Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Resetting Internet Explorer's settings is not reversible. After a reset, all previous settings are lost and cannot be recovered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As far as the Developer Tools in Internet Explorer, it is there by design.&nbsp;
</span></p>

<h2>            Msn homepage on Windows 10 Home using EDGE and CHROME</h2>
                    <p>I've had problems with MY msn.com Homepage for many Years now.</p>
<p>I'm on WIndows 10 Home.As of August after a week or so of 10 was Pushed to Market.</p>
<p>Both only work correctly;yet only on first opening them. My location is not always correct! It may be the next Town over or many miles from my actual location!??? And OR not logged in.Once logged in it should know instantly!
</p>
<p>My point of this is MSN should know my exact location EVERY TIME I open either browser! Not vanish like it does in Chrome;Edge will give me a Town over many miles away and my Location is locked,so I may track my Devices if stolen!!! :P I hit the Home Button
 and Viola,it works 85% of the time. :P HA!!!</p>
<p>After A refresh,they both seem to want to screw up my location,or not show on Chrome at all;as well as showing ads that refuse to be blocked.Edge will also change in my location.The location and ads show and can't be blocked by adblock.</p>
<p>Adblock will open when clicked on;and opens opens but it doesn't work on both browsers;not even after hiding the page in the taskbar!!???</p>
<p>I have both fixed Edge and even reset it in Apps! It works all of one time! Refresh it doesn't work!??? Same with an uninstall/ reinstall of Chrome after deleting any files found for it! ;) It works for all of one time too unless I restart,then both work
 FIne until I close them.</p>
<p>This is a flaw somewhere,not my end;I have checked many times!!! &gt;:( ;and may be due to corruption! :/</p>
<p>I don't get that many corrupted files unless a disruption in my Internet Connection.I know files corrupt over time but check them for continuity often!</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to HIGHLY test these before rushing them out for use by the General Public!!! So tired of seeing all my apps,which work just fine and UPDATE are showing the need to be fixes(rest or repaired) I just reinstalled this AGAIN and Updated Immediately
 too! :P</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My question is why is this still an ONGOING ISSUE? And why has it not been fixed yet? As well as;why on Earth,LOCK a Forum that has YET to be RESOLVED!???</p>
<p>Stop locking them,they aren't that old,as far as the last reply!!! &gt;:(</p>

<p>No man, I do this on a Weekly basis.It works for all of a day or the next restart; and even close the browser(s) and open them later!</p>
<p>The only fix,which is temporary also,is to reset or repair Edge,as far as Chrome goes,I ususally have to await their next update or uninstall/reinstall.Same response from both,they work the first time only.If I refresh the page it starts all over again!This
 is quite a pain as I just reinstalled the OS again,2ndd time since the 13th because of hackers;they gained entry one way or another!??? Mainly Sync attempts. BUT It wreaks havoc on the PC like it has malware! Nothing ever shows but I see all kinds of errors
 and Warnings in the even viewer! I can fix most;but when this occurs,I have no choice but to reinstall yet again!??? Pure BS,my PC is in top condition except when running Windows, 10 or even 7 when I used to use it.Ubuntu Runs like a Top and have yet to see
 any issues using it! &gt;:( I have fixed this so many times it's a pantload Y'all! :P</p>
<p>As far as CCleaner,there's nothing in it I can't already do manually.And I have used it before,if not craeful what you clean in the programs,you lose vital assests as well so watch what you tick off on this.The cleaner works fine itself! I never block cookies,and
 the browser is not set to clear when closed.Only thing is when I clean the PC nothing happens,it is nothing more than corruption in Edge and the Windows store for apps and extensions! I have to manually fix it or update it myself!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.BUT I have done everything I can according to the forums. Iy just won't solve this issue.Only thing that will for a little while is a total wipe of my files,Format and then reinstall the whole OS like I'm getting ready to sell this.That
 takes TIME to get this Alienware back up to full speed too! :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>What antivirus and/or other security or privacy programs are you running?</p>
<p>Is CCleaner even installed on this computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you are trying to fix things only because they've appeared in Event Viewer, you may be fixing insignificant little glitches that aren't worth fixing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. This msn problem shouldn't require anything nearly as serious as reinstalling the OS.</p>

</p><p>Screenshot above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This change to the default compact view occurred overnight somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, I could do some basic sorting based on From, Sent, etc. using one click in the toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I need to click All, then Arrange By, and then select the option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've moved through the options that are in the view menu and haven't found anything that reverts the view back to the way it was.</p>

</p><p>I have visual studio 2017 with Universal Windows Platform Development in "windows" area of viz installer + Game Development with Unity in "Mobile &amp; Gaming" section of viz installer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unity 2017.2.0b5 aka the beta version.</p>

<p>Upgrade first to build 16251.0. You can download the ISO file, mount it in Windows and run setup.exe to upgrade. Afterwards, you can probably upgrade to 16257.1.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the ISO upgrade will clear out the install folders and likely fix whatever is wrong, without needing to try other more uncertain methods of troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>            One Drive web client - Search across shared sites not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Office 365 at a sports club to share files across the committee members.&nbsp; We have stored the information in a central One Drive account and shared these documents with individual accounts within the group.&nbsp; We are using the web client, and not
 syncing to local devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search function in the web client works brilliantly in the original One Drive account where the information is saved.&nbsp; The shared information displays correctly and users can navigate around the shared site to find information.&nbsp; The problem we are experiencing
 is that there is a lot of information starting to build in the site, and the search function on the web client does not return any results from the shared folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jody</p>

<p>Hi Jody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please help to confirm the following information for further troubleshooting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Let the affected users try searching the files in their Shared with me
<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">from Office 365 home page</a> as below and see if they can search the files.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0cb26be-08c7-44a3-9b09-572eb5bcfbcc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0cb26be-08c7-44a3-9b09-572eb5bcfbcc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.We understand the issue happens to all users you have shared files with. We’d like to know following:</p>
<p>1)What is the sharing link type you set? Anyone with the link? Do you give the<span style="font-weight: bold"> Edit</span> permission?</p>
<p>2)Do you give the same sharing link type with all users?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting on our forum.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22pt"><span>Access to your description, my understanding is that it is stuck on we're getting things ready when you install Visio as below:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebe972d4-6102-4e78-9393-943df9d256c5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebe972d4-6102-4e78-9393-943df9d256c5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>If so, I suggest you try closing anti-virus software or firewall to check if the issue occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which Visio plan have you subscribed?</span></li><li><span>Where did you install Visio?</span></li><li><span>Can you install Office before?</span></li></ol>

    <title>OneNote 2016 Ink to Text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heather1841  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 Ink to Text</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2016 Professional edition on a Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to use OneNote 2013 to take handwritten notes, then convert to text. Later, I used Windows Journal, which is not available anymore. Now I have OneNote 2016 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One crucial feature for me is the way OneNote 2013 and Journal would show a preview of the text conversion and let you tweak it. Handwriting recognition is *VERY BAD* at slashes, punctuation, and even letters and numbers sometimes. I need to be able to convert
 my notes to text so I can email them to other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to convert ink to text on OneNote 2016, the familiar preview is gone! And it did a horrible job at the conversion. And I no longer have the original notes to compare to so I can make sure the new notes are correct. Sure I can make a copy, and
 I can type my notes again, but the whole point was how quick and easy it used to be to go from those notes to having text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found in the options "Enable automatic handwriting recognition" and disabled it, thinking that would bring the preview back, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if the preview and correction dialog box was removed from OneNote 2016? Any way I can get it back, short of downgrading my office back to 2013?</p>

            <p>Just so you know ... I switched back to Journal. OneNote is unacceptable in its current state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take my notes in Journal, convert ink to text, copy to clipboard, and paste the text into OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't make sense that OneNote wouldn't work exactly the same as Journal does, especially since it used to (2013 version).</p>

            I'm in the same situation with you. The conversion results were unacceptable, totally ruined my notes. I don't know how to restore it, but I really need. Have any way to cancel the conversion?

<p>I wasn't aware the preview was available in 2013, but I use a similar feature in an iPad app, and as you mention, it's crucial for ensuring the accuracy of your transcribed notes. My notes include a lot of numbers and symbols and they rarely get converted
 correctly. Small errors can lead to big problems for me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've ended up doing is selecting a word or line at a time and converting it. If it's way off or I need to verify something, I Undo the change to see my handwriting and either correct it manually or copy the text manually, depending on how I need the
 information to look (columns of information never works exactly right).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a pretty time consuming method, so the other workarounds I've developed are turning off wifi on my iPad and referring to it to correct notes or just leaving the notes handwritten, as the actual words usually transcribe correctly and can be searched
 on.</p>

            Here is a workaround I use.&nbsp; After writing the text.&nbsp; I lasso select the text, copy and paste it as "text" below the handwritten text.&nbsp; I end up with a copy of my handwritten notes and poorly converted text that I can correct.

<p>Brilliant! This is exactly what I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I noticed when I tried it out was that I get different behaviors based on where and what order I copy and paste in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Copy and Paste on iPad</span></p>
<p>1. Hand write on iPad</p>
<p>2. Lasso on iPad</p>
<p>3. Tap in the selected area</p>
<p>4. Tap Copy</p>
<p>5. Go to Text Mode</p>
<p>6. Tap on screen to get keyboard to come up</p>
<p>7. Click the Paste icon on the keyboard</p>
<p>8. (optional) Lasso one section and move it elsewhere on the page</p>
<p>9. Lasso one version on the workstation</p>
<p>10. Right click within the selection</p>
<p>11. Choose Ink to Text</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Copy/Paste on Workstation</span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Hand write on iPad</p>
<p>2. Lasso on workstation</p>
<p>3. Ctrl+C to copy</p>
<p>4. Ctrl+V to paste</p>
<p>5. Have two copies of a picture of handwriting</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Copy, Convert, Paste on Workstation</span></p>
1.&nbsp;Hand write on iPad
<p>2. Lasso on workstation</p>
<p>3. Ctrl+C to copy</p>
<p>4. Right click within selection</p>
<p>5. Choose Ink to Text</p>
<p>6. Click outside of selection, where you want handwriting to go</p>
<p>7. Ctrl+V to paste the original handwriting</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last one is the quickest and easiest, for me, but leaves open the possibility that you lose the original handwriting if anything happens to your clipboard. The first one takes more steps, but you have two copies of original handwriting before converting
 anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The middle one makes it much more difficult to convert to text. I was able to eventually get something out of it, but it's far easier to do one of the other ways.</p>

<h2>            How do I add an ip address to a whitelist for live id account creation</h2>
                    <p>We have users siging up for e-learning and to do so they have to create a Live ID from within our internal network.&nbsp; But because we only have two external IP addresses and so we are geting a Sign up error 450 saying that we have reaced our daily limit for
 creating Microsfot accounts.&nbsp; We have a number of users but only 5 are allowed to register a day.&nbsp; Is there a whitelist where in I can add our external IPs so we are not limited to this quota?</p>

    <title>fake trojan infection message&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhoblho  say:</h3>
<h2>            fake trojan infection message&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, when I try to play videos in an area where my internet connection is weak, my headphones stop receiving sound and I must reload the driver. When I did this tonight my computer booted up and uploaded a very strange message (I should have
 taken a screen shot) that my surface is infected with a trojan and it was critical that I click on a dialog box. I didn't know if this was legit or not, so I closed the message, ran a quick scan in windows security and also an offline scan, but both showed
 no infected files. I notices that the malicious software removal tool update for January had failed to update, so I downloaded it off the website and am running it now, but so far it shows nothing, either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, now on the update page it claims that my computer needs to restart with a red exclamation point...</p>
<p>This is very strange. The tool is still running and shows no infected files so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is it possible that message was a scam? If it wasn't, is it possible that my computer is infected with a trojan that windows security and the malicious software removal tool I'm running can't find? If I did a refresh without a complete wipe by loading
 windows from a flash drive, is it possible that I could still have this malware on my surface? What should I do?

            Hi jhoblho 
<br />
<br />If that message appeared in a web browser, rest assured, your system is not infected, that is a Tech Support Scam and it is very prevalent on the Internet at the moment.
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!
<br />
<br />You did the correct thing in just closing out that web page, you have nothing to worry about, your system is fine . . .

<p>Thank you for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it popped up right after the pc rebooted after loading the headphones driver. I had not opened a browser yet. I did have a MS support person scan my computer, and he didn't find anything either, but he didn't look in the registry to see if
 there were weird files downloaded- the kind of stuff I don't really know how to do. He did the same things I did- scans, diagnostic tool, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still concerned, since nothing shows that this popup occurred. It's funny- at my university, when the secure wifi connection is weak, it disconnects and the unsecured wifi connection kicks in, and that's when I develop problems with the headphones driver,
 as well as this incident. If it happens again I will definitely take a screen shot.</p>

            <p>I'm running the ms malicious software tool (for a second time!) because of a message that my pc is infected with a trojan (I did not have a browser open when it popped up- it appeared after restart.) Twice I've been notified that C\Windows\WmiPrvSE.exe has
 been blocked from making changes to memory while this tool is running. I've read that this is supposedly a legit Windows file, but that malware can mask as a version of it. How can I tell? My computer is scaring me...</p>

<p>Re Nokia Lumia 620 is it possible to make the on-screen keyboard letters/numbers bigger for when you type? ( I know they become slightly bigger if you move to the landscape view, but its not much of a hlep.)</p>

<p>A cumbersome way to use the keyboard with larger Fonts would be to go to settings--&gt;ease of access ... and set screen magnifier to 'ON' and then use the function as described below the option .. See if you find it fine ..</p>

            <p>I don't think you can do it for multiple sheets simultaneously.</p>
<p>But for one sheet:</p>
<p>1- select the range, choose conditional format</p>
<p>2- select: Highlight cells equal to </p>
<p>3- type the criteria and select the format you want.</p>

<p>Hi, two issues are going on.&nbsp; I have OneDrive setup for&nbsp;business with the idea that I can access, and save to files locally that will then sync with my online OneDrive account. However, the files never sync. I end up having to&nbsp;upload them to&nbsp;insure they
 are&nbsp;in the cloud. I don't want the cloud files to sync down, especially those files that are shared with me by others, but I do want to be able to work on a document at home, save it to my OneDrive folder and see it in&nbsp;the cloud tomorrow. What I'm seeing&nbsp;when
 I click on&nbsp;the icon &nbsp;in my taskbar is "OneDrive for business Syncing files 149 remaining" for almost a week now.</p>
<p>If I go to the OneDrive folder locally, what I see are the folders, but when I click on the folders they all appear empty.
</p>
<p>I have gone to settings, told it to sync now, but nothing seems to help. Any idea why this would happen? Plenty of bandwidth,&nbsp;I keep my system on 24/7, fully updated. ? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I would like to explain that we cannot only sync folders or files in our File Explorer to the cloud.</p>
<p>To solve the issues, please try the steps below and let us know the results:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you download the client via the link:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Follow the steps in the article below for generally troubleshooting:<br />

<p>If it doesn't work, you can also take the "Fix it" tool to remove the OneDrive for Business cache after taking the methods in the article.<br />

<p>This really was a mess. I have Office 2013 which comes with Access which I use. My work has Office 365. I uninstalled my OneDrive in anticipation of installing again and trying to get it to work only to get errors that I can't have different versions of
 Office Click To Run. I don't want to lose Access and Visio and my other pro apps so I can use OneDrive. Seems needlessly complicated.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>To further investigate the issue you have met, I’d like to know the following points:<br />
1. About the Access and Visio you have mentioned, could you let us know if you have installed them via Office 365 portal or MSI?<br />
2. May I know the Office 365 subscription you are using?<br />
3. Regarding the Office 365 you are using, is it Office 2016 version or 2013?<br />
4. As you have met the error message when installing OneDrive for Business client, did you install it via the link below?<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984</a> &nbsp;
<br />
5. If it’s convenient, please share with us the error message for our troubleshooting. To upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click the icon of<strong> Insert/Edit Media.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>At work have the Office 365 Business Premium for Nonprofits. We are using Office 2013 version. Yes I tried installing from the link in your post but I get this message about uninstalling One to Click for other versions of Office. However the problem is that
 I'm on my home system which has the full Office 2013 Professional Suite. I also use Visio 2013 and when trying to install the OneDrive syncing tool it wants me to uninstall these other versions. Does that mean I need to uninstall Visio and Office 2013 to use
 this? </p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>It seems that you have installed MSI version of Office on your computer before, so you encountered this issue when installing Click to Run version of OneDrive for Business. Here I’d like to say that Side-by–side installations of MSI and Click-to-Run versions
 of Office 2013 are not supported, for details, you can refer to this article:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2753630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2753630</a></p>
<p>Also we can’t install two different versions of Click-to-Run applications on the same computer just as the following article mentions:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-installed-using-Click-to-Run-and-Window-Installer-on-same-computer-isn-t-supported-30775ef4-fa77-4f47-98fb-c5826a6926cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office installed using Click-to-Run and Window Installer on same computer isn't
 supported</a></p>
<p>So it’s recommended you just install one sort of Office on the computer, Office 2013 Professional Plus suite or Office 365. For now, the OneDrive for Business from the link is Click-to-Run version, we need to install it with Office 365. About the whole Office
 2013 Professional Plus suite, you may install the original version of OneDrive for Business rather than the one from the link.</p>
<p>If this isn’t the truth or this doesn’t work, could you let us know the following information to better understand the scenario you met?<br />
1. As you have mentioned, for work, you are using Office 365. For the home system, you are using full Office 2013 Professional Suite, this issue happened when you tried to install the Click-to-Run version of OneDrive for Business on the home system. Is it right?
 If anything is misunderstood, please correct me.<br />
2. Also it will be appreciated that the related screenshots are provided, with that, we will exactly find and clarify the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>We look forward to any updates.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Kerwin</p>

<p>No you are correct. I have Office 2013 Pro suite on my home computer. At the time I installed the 2013 suite I don't remember OneDrive being available. I think there was SkyDrive, but I didn't install it. And yes I downloaded OneDrive from the link and it's
 not working. It's not syncing. If I understand you I need to uninstall OneDrive from my computer and use the OneDrive for Offcie 2013 Pro, is there a place I can download this? . &nbsp;

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Due to compatibility issues with click-to-run installations, the MSI package of the SkyDrive Pro (now is named as OneDrive for Business) client is no longer available for download via the link. For the Office 2013 professional suite, you may install SkyDrive
 or SkyDrive Pro from the original suite to check the outcome, here I’d like to share with you a related thread for your reference:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/156/t/388369</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work, as you mentioned you can use OneDrive for Business before, may I know where have you installed the OneDrive for Business client on your home computer? In addition, to clarify if there’re any potential issues influencing the work for OneDrive
 for Business, I’d like to collect some corresponding report via the workspace. To collect the information above, I have sent you a private message, below are the steps to access it:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Go to the <strong>Your details</strong> section on the right side of the community site.<br />
•&nbsp; Click <strong>Private messages.</strong><br />
•&nbsp; Click the subject title of the response to read the message.<br />

<p>If you downloaded the software you will need the use the installer program to install.&nbsp; Not all of the software for programs go into the Program folder some of it, the little .dll file, goes into Windows System32 folder.</p>
