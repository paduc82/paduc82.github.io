                    One of my drives has a corrupt Master File Table.&nbsp; It was working fine, then a game, that is on that drive, locked up on me.&nbsp; I had to reboot.&nbsp; When I rebooted, the MFT was corrupt.&nbsp; Window tried to fix it automatically, but failed.&nbsp; I can see the drive
 in "My Computer", but I can not access it.&nbsp; I tried running Chkdsk from the command promt, but Windows can not repair it.&nbsp; Is there anything else I can do?

<h2>            Computer does not Recognise activity from a Gamepad Controller.</h2>
                    Hello! I am having an Issue with a Gamepad I have. Whenever I play any game from
<strong>steam</strong> with a Gamepad Controller, after five minutes my monitor turns off to save energy, the computer is not detecting activity from either the actions on screen or from the Controller's inputs. I am using a
<strong>Rockcandy USB Controller for PS3</strong>. I know there has been a previous post a few years prior but that solution has not worked for me. When I open up
<strong>Device Manager &gt; Human Interface Devices &gt; HID-Compliant game controller</strong> and select Properties. I only get three Tabs:
<strong>General, Driver and Details</strong>. I cannot find the Power Management Tab which I need to interact with. Could someone please help?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be driver incompatibility issue and I would request you to visit the Gamepad's manufacturer's website and download the driver for Windows 7 operating system and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains, install the same driver in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp;Right click the driver installation file and select

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Place a check in the
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for: </strong>box. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.&nbsp;Try installing the driver and check.</span></p>

            Okay I have installed the latest Chipset driver from Acer. But windows Is telling me that my HID-Compliant Game Controller Drivers and all my USB Drivers are all Up-to-date. I'll try running the game again and see if the issue has been resolved.

            I still don't know how to use this software as windows is telling me that all the drivers which correspond to the controller are up-to-date.
<strong>Note: I used internet look up to check if there are any updates for the drivers.</strong> And also the product manufacturer has not given any Driver updates or downloads.
<strong>Note: On the page it says: Intended for PS3, PC</strong> <strong>compatibility is not guaranteed</strong><strong>.</strong> I needed to use a
<strong>Xbox 360 controller emulator</strong> on my system for the computer to register the inputs, but I dont know if that emulator is what is causing the issues. &nbsp;

            Hello! (Again), I am not sure if Xbox will be able to provide much support Since I am using an
<strong>Emulator</strong> and Xbox Aren't the creators of the Emulator. Also There might be a sort of Compatibility Issue with support as I am using a
<strong>Controller intended for Playstation 3</strong> while Using a <strong>Emulator</strong> made for
<strong>Converting Playstation Controller</strong> commands <strong>into Xbox controller</strong> Commands, on a
<strong>Computer.</strong> Also Xbox only has support options for: <strong>Xbox one</strong> (Don't have),
<strong>Xbox 360</strong> (Don't have), <strong>Xbox on windows 10</strong> (I don't use
<strong>windows 10</strong> I use <strong>Windows 7 home premium</strong> and <strong>
Xbox on other devices</strong> which <strong>Requires a Xbox 360</strong> or <strong>
Xbox One Controller</strong> to seek assistance with of which I have Neither, I have a
<strong>USB Playstation 3 Controller</strong>.

    <title>Windows 10 Reinstall Hangs and Recovery Freezes on Start-up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mickchammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Reinstall Hangs and Recovery Freezes on Start-up</h2>
                    <p>After having to hard reset my all-in-one desktop&nbsp;PC after it hung on a system reset involving cleaning the drive, it has been rendered useless without an operating system. I have tried several times reinstalling Windows 10 via USB but after each attempt
 the&nbsp;PC would reboot to either the infinite spinning circles with the Windows logo or would freeze on this screen. Reformatting the drive and deleting old partitions did not resolve this. I then made a recovery drive and attempted to reset Windows 10 using&nbsp;the
 drive. The pc would get up to 100% pretty normally but then freeze on start-up (with a blue HP&nbsp;start-up screen and keys for boot options but these never worked due to the&nbsp;PC being frozen).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't imperative that I have this desktop working as I use a laptop as my daily driver, although it would be a shame to not have it working&nbsp;as I use&nbsp;it as a screen for my PlayStation (it has a HDMI port for it on the left side of the screen&nbsp;- in its current
 state with no working OS audio doesn't come through the PC). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to note is that&nbsp;on one start-up attempt&nbsp;the blue screen of death popped up which suggested using a recovery drive ... which I had already tried ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be much appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>HP Touchsmart 600</p>
<p>Intel Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHZ</p>
<p>4GB RAM</p>
<p>GeForce integrated graphics</p>
<p>1TB HDD</p>
<p>Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7 via free upgrade)</p>

            <p>I did the hard reset around 2 weeks ago. As for why, the PC was having issues with freezing every 15-20 mins after start-up, even back in its Windows 7 days.The issue carried over to Windows 10 so I decided to reset the system and use the clean the drive
 option. It was then where it hung on 42% for 8 hours and was forced to hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC came with Norton and we had McAfee installed on it when it had Windows 7. However I do not recall using those tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8294f445-4c7d-41ef-a5d9-21bcec71a282" title="nick0477">
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. The increased fan speed when these games are played are simply correlated to the hardware stress induced on the Xbox One. Bigger titles with more complex and high quality textures and rendering
 require more of the processing power which causes the console's processor and graphical&nbsp;processing unit(GPU)'s temperatures to increase, to protect the console, the fan speeds increase resulting in them being louder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There shouldn't be any concerns when the fans speed up, as long as the console is in a clean, dust free, ventilated area. It is
<strong>NOT </strong>recommended to use any external coolers because they can actually prevent the console from receiving proper airflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel that it might be a mechanical issue with your Xbox, since you've had your Xbox for less than a year you have the option to get it repaired for free because of the manufacturer warranty.

</p><p><strong>What does Windows as a Service entail?</strong></p>
<p>Since the introduction of Windows Update as part of Windows, Microsoft has delivered updates as way to keep Windows updated and secure. This has always been the way the company keeps commercial versions of Windows on the market current.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing Windows. Taking into account we now live in a mobile, constantly connected world, where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this
 is to keep users current by providing the latest updates&nbsp;as soon&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will do this using three types of service branches for Windows 10:</p>

<h3> megansweeney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flash Drive - &#34;The drive or network connection that the shortcut &#39;Camera.lnk&#34; refers to is unavailable.</h2>
                    <p>I have a dell inspiron laptop. The hard drive recently failed so I had to get it replaced. I backed up all of my files onto a flash drive. I had a folder with all of my videos in it that I edited that were ready for me to upload to YouTube. Anytime I opened
 the folder on the flash drive before I got my hard drive replaced, it would open fine. But now that I have my fixed laptop, which is basically brand new, and I'm trying to put that folder onto the new laptop, it is giving me this message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The drive or network connection that the shortcut 'Camera.lnk' refers to is unavailable. Make sure that the disk is properly inserted or the network resource is available, and then try again."</p>
<p>I had so many videos on there that I spent so much time making that I won't be able to remake so if anyone knows how I can recover this file, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried this trouble shooter both with the USB plugged in, and without. I'm not quite sure what the problem could be :/</p>

<p>OK, it is as I thought, you copied over shortcuts to these items rather than the actual items to the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything with a small arrow in the corner is a shortcut not the original item, hence the error message you are getting
<em>"</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>The drive or network connection that the shortcut 'Camera.lnk' refers to is unavailable"</em>, as can be seen from the screen capture, this is a shortcut, not the actual folder . . .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From your screenshot, the items marked below are shortcuts to the original folder or file, not the actual folder or file!</span></p>

            Thank you. I thought it was that too, however all of the other shortcuts opened fine, camera was the only one giving me trouble. I actually did a remote session with Microsoft the other day and we found out what the problem was. Thank you so much for your

    <title>Skype for Windows Desktop 7.3, unable to sign in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype for Windows Desktop 7.3, unable to sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can someone direct me to a comprehensive list of port requirements for the above mentioned program? I am able to sign into my Skype account using my browser but have been unable to using the standalone program. I note from my firewall log that certain UDP
 packets are being dropped, though the port numbers do not look to conflict with any existing rules I have in place. If I had some way of cross referencing the required ports I think I can get to the bottom of the problem myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help that is forthcoming.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I realize that you are facing multiple issues on your PC. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you make any changes to the PC after which you are facing this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you also have a 3<sup>rd</sup> party security software installed on the PC?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you scanned the PC for the latest virus, spyware, and malware threats?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to run a full computer virus scan to ensure the computer is free from virus. It is not advisable to access the registry before the virus scan is done. Ensure to install any pending updates on the computer
 and remember to restart the system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A fast way to check whether your PC has a virus is to use Windows Defender. This malware protection is included with Windows and helps identify
 and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. Once this is done you may also check for any pending updates and install the same to see if that helps.</span></p>
<p>

<li>I haven`t made any changes whatsoever on my computer before this thing happened</li><li>I am using the computer for school work,gaming and video/audio editing</li><li>I wast not using a 3rd party antivirus program</li><li>I scanned my Personal Computer and no viruses found</li></ul>
<p>So you can say that my computer was pretty clean before this happened</p>
<p>how this happened? Well.....i don`t know how it happened.I was on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>YouTube&nbsp;</strong></span> and i was watching videos like always.I got bored so i went on
<p>All of my apps,programs and drivers got deleted by <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>MICROSOFT WINDOWS DEFENDER&nbsp; </strong></span>as of right now i reinstalled a CLEAN copy of Windows 10 on my PC.It seems that it works with no problems but just like before all of this windows defender thingy happened again and again and again and i haven`t
 found a fix for it yet.You guys at Microsoft implemented this piece of S**T Windows Defender in the new windows 10 that i cant even disable it(or at least for ever) i want to know if there is a possible way of removing it completely.(Believe me i tried everything
 with no success)</p>

<h3> robertmitchler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer does not work</h2>
                    <p>Not at all happy with Windows 10 and the lack of a solution for the Windows File Explorer problems that have been occurring. &nbsp;File explorer (manager) and any right click functionality is virtually non existent. &nbsp;For months Microsoft had pop ups show up on
 our computer screens insisting that Windows 10 is the best ever Windows of all time. &nbsp;I can now say that Microsoft Windows 10 is the worst Windows I have ever used. &nbsp;The lack of File Explorer should have been already been fixed or an alternate version of the
 software made available. &nbsp;I have viewed and read many of the discussion threads dealing with the problem and have seen some attempts to provide instructions for customers to repair this themselves.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has there not been a downloadable fix available to fix this problem instead of turning Microsoft customers into repairmen who are not comfortable with terminology and procedures to correct this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Windows 10 able to be downloaded again with the correct and functioning version of the program on available? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p><span>Hi Robert,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you are facing issues accessing the File Explorer on your Windows 10 computer. This issue might have been caused due to corruption in the system files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to reset the Windows explorer and check if it helps to resolve the issue. Please follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc
</strong>and locate for <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Right click on the <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> and click on
<strong>End task</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>On top of the Task Manager click on
<strong>File</strong> and click on <strong>Run new task</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Type <strong>explorer.exe</strong> inside the box and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further try running a <strong>System File Checker</strong> scan and check if there are any system files missing or got corrupted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the&nbsp;steps provided,&nbsp;in the link below in order to run SFC scan on your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></a></strong></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 i7 processor Version - Wifi Connectivity Issues and others</h2>
                    <p>Machine Details:</p>
<p>Surface Pro 3 - i7 Processor, 256 Gb HDD,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preordered it on 05/20/2014. Waited so long for the tablet and this is what I get :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar to the reports from other users, I have had network connection issues with the one day old Surface Pro 3. So, I contacted Answer Desk agent and was asked to install the firmware upgrades which I did. But the problems have compounded after the updates.
 Here are my issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Breaking internet connection, and no this is not an issue with internet service, I have checked by connecting to the same wifi network with another dell laptop at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Internet speed goes to a max of 1Mbps whilst my internet connection &nbsp;&gt; 50 Mbps.&nbsp;speedtest.net results were a shabby 1.34 Mbps on Surface while it gave me around 60 Mbps on a dell laptop connected to the same wifi network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When I put it for sleep (close the lid) and reopen, it can not find network drive&nbsp;and hence can not connect to internet<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When running only chrome and skype, with a 7% CPU usage and 34% RAM usage, it emits very high fan noise thus disturbing my skype call. Trust me when I say this, its not a minute level of noise. The problem is compounded by the fact that microphone is
 close to the fan slit. I can understand if its a CPU intensive process like a high end game, but come one, Skype with 7% CPU usage!&nbsp;Whats the point of an i7 processor if the system cant support 10% of its power. oh and then there's the over-heating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Online Chat Support:</p>
<p>Chat support worked well yesterday but when I tried to connect to support again, I can not find a link to chat support for surface.</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us/</p>
<p>takes me directly to&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us/call-us</p>
<p>And a direct Chat link given by the agent doesnt work either. It shows a page with a blue load ribbon which is on an infinite loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the error logs in web console.</p>
<p>- Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 (Service Unavailable) https://sas.css.microsoft.com/SupportAggregatorService/scripts/json2min.js<br />
- Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 (Service Unavailable) https://sas.css.microsoft.com/SupportAggregatorService/scripts/SasSurface.js<br />
- Invalid App Id: Must be a number or numeric string representing the application id. all.js:54<br />
FB.getLoginStatus() called before calling FB.init(). all.js:54<br />
- Uncaught ReferenceError: ViewModelFactory is not defined</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did they per chance limit Surface chat support, so only those coming from Surface devices are accepted? It could be an issue with my workplace internet settings, but Windows Chat support worked from the same network.</p>

            <p>My question is if this is a common problem or not? Will an exchange get me a Surface Pro that works correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We purchased a Surface Pro 3 (i7-256GB) this past Friday to use and evaluate the system for a further project outlay. There are many things to like about the Surface Pro 3, but unfortunately the Wifi device inside the tablet seems to be seriously malfunctioning
 as you also described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our system is repeatedly resetting the connection, losing all connections, and is running at extremely slow transfer rates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a number of screenshots and video showing a laptop wifi status screen and the Surface Pro 3 wifi status screen on either side of a desk. The Surface shows 1.0Mbps, but the laptop (a 2005 Dell Vostro) is experiencing no issues and is running at 130
 Mbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The test network was a Verizon FiOS setup using the Actiontec MI424WR-GEN3I router in 802.11n only mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Surface Pro 3's lot number/date is 1428.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized this could be a minority problem, however, and therefore sent an email to our MS Corporate sales rep, but received no response as of now. I also called MS technical support on the telephone and the woman offered me a REFURBISHED replacement in
 the mail. I said I would return the product to the MS store before I accepted a refurb Surface for something I bought 3 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post is my last resort, before I head to the MS store for an exchange or to simply return it.</p>

</span>My Pro3 i7 256gb was fully updated out of the box, except for a small update to Windows 8.1 – which I still have not performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for MV010, did you update before experiencing issues.&nbsp; I know you were asked to update via your support call, but curious if problem exists due to an earlier updating.</p>

            <p>Hi MV010,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting the Surface Community. I appreciate you taking the time to reach out to us. I am very sorry that you have multiple issues regarding the Surface Pro 3 i7 processor Version. I understand that the WiFi connection keeps dropping, the
 internet speed slows down, your device can't connect to internet after waking up from sleep, the fan runs loudly when on Skype and Google Chrome with a high CPU usage, and you are having trouble connecting to the support page. I would like to help improve
 your experience with the new device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, I would like to work with you by focusing on a few problems at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>First and foremost, please confirm that you have all Windows updates (as of 8/8/2014, the latest update was released on 7/16/2014). If you do, please check to see if any of them has failed to install.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1. Breaking internet connection</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are you consistently getting an unstable internet connection?</li><li>Does this happen after the device wakes from sleep?</li><li>I see that your laptop is securely connected to the same network with no problem. What do you have to do to get the connection back, or does the connection automatically come back?</li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2. Internet speed slows down</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has this always been an issue, or did it start happening after the latest update?</li><li>I have found some Community threads that you might find helpful. Although they are posted under a different Surface Pro device (Surface Pro 2), it's still worth taking a look at.</li></ul>

            <p>I will chime in and answer your questions. &nbsp;I just bought the surface pro 3 i7 256GB myself and I am experiencing the same problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The internet connection speed performance is constantly intermittent. &nbsp;It will vary from 2mbps to 150mbps running multiple back to back bandwidth tests. &nbsp;I notice it most frequently exhibits poor performance when coming out of sleep.</p>
<p>-It periodically fails to find the AP. &nbsp;This happens with multiple manufacturers.</p>
<p>-I attempt to enable/disable Wi-fi. &nbsp;The AP will then disappear from the list. &nbsp;The only way to see the AP again is to reboot the Surface. &nbsp;This happens with multiple manufacturers</p>
<p>-The connection to the AP will degrade to limited connectivity for no reason. &nbsp;I try to disable/enable the wi-fi adapter and it still shows limited connectivity. &nbsp;This is only solved with a reboot.</p>
<p>-I am running the latest updates as of 8/8/2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to do the following to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Stay up to date with all updates</p>
<p>-Enable/Disable Wi-fi</p>
<p>-Hard Reboot</p>
<p>-Re-install wireless drivers from Device Manager</p>
<p>-Adjust power settings to maximum performance in power options for the wi-fi adapter and PCI Express bus</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe this supposedly premium device was released with such blatantly obvious bugs. &nbsp;I also cannot believe that the QA team did not find a significant issue with the wireless adapter prior to the product release. &nbsp;I hope that Microsoft has a fix
 really, really soon or I am definitely returning it before my 14 days are up.</p>
