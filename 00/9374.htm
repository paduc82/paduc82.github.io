    <title>Mission Control doesn&#39;t work well with Office 2011 apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob_637  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mission Control doesn&#39;t work well with Office 2011 apps</h2>
                    Back when Mac OS X Leopard came out and when Office 2008 was the current Mac version, there was a problem with Spaces wherein if you opened say Excel 2008 and for example, say you had previously assigned Excel to Space 4, as desired Excel would open in
 Space 4. &nbsp;However, with Excel still open if you are next sitting in, for example, Space 1 and you now open yet another Excel document, that document would open in Space 1 instead of Space 4... &nbsp;This got fixed later such that in Mac OS X Snow Leopard and still
 Office 2008 and later with Office 2011, ALL office documents, both the first and subsequent documents, would open in the correct space...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But now, in OS X Lion and using Office 2011 SP1, that old problem is back... &nbsp;If you open say Excel and say you have it assigned to Desktop (now what Spaces are called) 4, it will open in that space... &nbsp;So far, so good... But now, while sitting in some
 other Desktop, say Desktop 1, you now open a subsequent Excel document, the system quickly moves over to Desktop 4 but then immediately switches back to Desktop 1 and opens the document in that Desktop... &nbsp;That's wrong... &nbsp;It's pretty much the old Leopard/Office
 2008 problem replicated again, at least that's how it appears to me... &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was just getting used to having that utility (Spaces/Desktops) work correctly with Office and now it's broken again... &nbsp;Any hope to get it fixed any time soon???</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks...</div>

<h2>            browsing images online</h2>
                    <p>Hi all id just like to know what 'all saves' mean when I'm looking at images on my phone, it appears in a box with a tick in the box displaying all saves, for example I was looking at images of a car chassis, I scrolled down and the all saves icon appears,
 I'm wondering whether this is the reason my phone storage is low im sure I haven't saved anything or maybe I've pressed something by accident.</p>

<p>Hi Joe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back, I have a Microsoft Lumia 550 android bing was the search engine and I can't really take a screen shot as the all saves icon only shows very briefly when scrolling down, I asked my teenager to sort it out for me but apparently my
 phone was once used by tutankhamum haha, I think my best bet is to take it to a store and get them to explain as I'm not very tech savvy, Il obviously post what they tell me so everyone will know what I'm on about.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you managed to resolve this problem. I realise this is an older thread now, but I have a similar problem. I don't think this is specifically phone related, but more to do with the way that Bing images are stored. I tried to save a Bing
 welcome screen wallpaper (on my PC) and followed the image trail. In the end I found the image - you can't right click&gt;save, but have to click a 'Save' button under the image, at which point it tells you it's been placed in 'All Saves' ... well that's nice
 as 'All Saves' seems to be a mythical place that's hidden from mere mortals. So I suspect this could be a hidden system folder or something similar. I found this thread when Googling its location, but there doesn't seem to be much about it. Thanks.</p>

<p>My problem was with sync-eu.exe.bid popping up every few minutes trying to call home in Nuremburg.&nbsp;&nbsp; I upgraded Malwarebytes to 3.0, preserving my premium features, and that solved it.&nbsp; I was warned to have my ID and key handy, but they weren't necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to FranzD who reassured me.</p>

<h2>            How do I downgrade from Office 365 Small Business Premium to O365 Business&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My subscription ends in 4 days and I want to downgrade from O365 Small Business Premium to O365 ,</p>
<p>as I have no need for the online services in O365 Essentials and O365 Business Premium.</p>
<p>In the Admin Centre I clicked on Learn about the new plans link and O365 Business is listed&nbsp;as an option.</p>
<p>However when using the Renew button, then See other renewal options, it is not there to select.</p>
<p>So how do I change to O365 Business plan? </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This expected when you renew your Office 365 Small Business Premium subscription, you’ll move directly into a new plan, either Office 365 Business Premium or Office 365 Business Essentials.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Renew-Office-365-small-and-midsized-business-subscriptions-afa5dee4-091d-4152-b849-6aef8463ca9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Renew-Office-365-small-and-midsized-business-subscriptions-afa5dee4-091d-4152-b849-6aef8463ca9c</a></p>
<p>You need to directly purchase Office 365 Business plan under Purchase services in the Admin portal.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>I have installed Office 365 and tried to use the shared calendar option but it is greyed out on a windows 8.1 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mail account I am using is an Exchange ActiveSync account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm if this only works on accounts that use Exchange Servers. If this is the case, how can I publish to Webdav server. I have tried using this option, but it is asking me to which location I want to publish to and gives me the following example
 http://adatum.com/calendars - so what location do i enter ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried contacting Microsoft technical support for help but I kept on being disconnected and I have searched on Google but I cant find anything conclusive.</p>

<br />
</span>When you configure Outlook.com account as Exchange Active Sync, you&nbsp;account cannot share calendar. Only account configures as Microsoft Exchange can be shared calendar. Outlook.com is migrating to Outlook(Preview) once it is done you can configure your
 Outlook.com account as Microsoft Exchange Account. I suggest you to login to <a href="http://www.Outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.Outlook.com</a>&nbsp;and check if it is showing as Outlook(Preview), if yes follow the steps provided in below thread to configure your account as Microsoft Exchange.

<h2>            Deleting Auto-Save File Also Deletes Manually Saved Versions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was working on a document in Word then saved the document to my hard drive. &nbsp;I was working in the car (with a loose battery so I knew it was only a matter of time before my laptop shut down so I was saving frequently). &nbsp;Sure enough the laptop shut down.
 &nbsp;I restarted then when I opened Word it asked if I wanted to use the auto-saved version. &nbsp;I selected no because I knew I had just saved and I was thinking the auto-saved version might be older than my manual save so when I selected no it said the file would
 be permanently deleted, thinking this was just the auto-save file that seemed ok (I also figured a version would be in the recycle bin if worst came to worst). &nbsp;To my dismay the auto-saved version AND the manually saved version are gone. &nbsp;I go to open recent
 documents and a pop-up comes up saying the file cannot be found There is nothing in the recycle bin and in the save location there is nothing but .tmp files where the file should be). &nbsp;Am I totally out of luck? &nbsp;As a follow up if this is how auto-recover works
 did I read something wrong? &nbsp;If not, this is something that should likely be changed in a future update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

Click Start and All Programs. It will list everything.</p>
<p>Maybe to you it doesn't mean that but if they are there they are usebale.</p>
<p>The Office trial is just that, a time limited trial.</p>
<p>You can get&nbsp;the cheaper option but beware, Product Key Cards are severly limited in scope.</p>

            That suggests your H1, for example, is not using one of Word's Heading Styles. In that case, you may need to bookmark your headings in order to be able to cross-reference them.

            Hello MikeHoward1 5
<br />
<br />Here a possible solution to your request:
<br />
<br />1. Press  + R and put regedit in Run dialog box to open Registry Editor  Click OK.
<br />
<br />2. Navigate here:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office16.0\Common\General
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3. In the right pane of this registry location, right click and select New -&gt; DWORD Value. Name the newly created DWORD as NoTrack. Double click the same DWORD to modify its Value data:1
<br />
<br />4. Put the Value data equals to 1 to hide total editing time. If you again want to show total editing time, put the Value data equals to 0 or simply delete the NoTrack DWORD which we created in step 3. Click OK, close the Registry Editor and reboot to get results. If you hide total editing time, the counter sticks to zero value.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if it helps !
<br />
<br />best regards !!

<h3> scottou71  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I uninstall just some Office 2007 Ent components and Frontpage 2000&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My old Dell laptop is seriously choking down under a lack of hard disk space.&nbsp; 18.6 GB drive with only 160MB free as of now.&nbsp; I have already uninstalled a few programs, but when I went to run some MS Updates such as SP3(?) for my Office 2007 Enterprise Edition,
 the updater appears to have uploaded the necessary files but then failed - due to a lack of disk space I presume.&nbsp; So my hard earned free disk space was eaten up rather quickly and to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;need to uninstall some more apps and since I do not use some of the Office apps it seems a rational idea to uninstall those apps I do not need.&nbsp; The problem is that none of the Office 2007 components&nbsp;are listed individually under "Add/Remove Programs".&nbsp;
 There has to be a way though.&nbsp; Maybe a command line instruction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have Frontpage 2000 on this laptop and would like to remove it as well.&nbsp; Once again it is not listed under "Add/Remove Programs".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to uninstall Groove, Info Path, One Note, Publisher, Power Point &amp; Access in addition to Frontpage 2000.&nbsp; Also any temp files &amp; folders which may be hiding out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate your help in giving my laptop some breathing room.&nbsp; For example, it has taken me&nbsp;close to an&nbsp;hour to create a Microsoft Account and post this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have a new, larger capacity harddrive for this laptop but need to do a few things before I start the upgrade.&nbsp; I am also shopping for a new laptop and will be turning this machine over to a computerless friend once it is updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running XP Home Edition SP3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scott</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if I posted this in the wrong forum.</p>

</a><br />
Here are some general suggestions for dealing with a filled-up hard drive.<br />
<br />
<p>There are a number of things you can do to --
<b>temporarily</b> -- free up disk space.&nbsp; The only real solution, however, is to get a larger internal hard drive (or a second
<b>internal</b> drive).&nbsp;A desktop or tower probably will be able to accommodate a second internal drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A laptop or “all-in-one” (computer built into the monitor) probably will not.</p>
<p>You can move data to an external drive, but if it is data that you use frequently, the slower access times may annoy you.&nbsp; Therefore, I don't recommend that you
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">move your My Documents folder</a> in its entirety to an external drive, although you certainly could do that by following the linked instructions.&nbsp; Moving My Documents to a second internal drive
 is OK.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can run Disk Cleanup (Start &gt; Run &gt; cleanmgr &gt; OK) [See NOTE below]</li><li>You can reduce the size allocated to System Restore to about 1 GB (right-click My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; System Restore &gt;Settings)</li><li>You can turn off Hibernation (if you don't use it) (right-click empty spot on desktop &gt; Properties &gt; Screen Saver &gt; Power &gt; Hibernate)</li><li>You can disable Disk Indexing, which will also speed up your computer a bit (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp</a>)</li><li>You can reduce the size of your Internet browser cache (varies depending on which browser you use)</li><li>You can remove most of the $NTUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders following the directions here:<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Hotfix_backup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Hotfix_backup.htm</a><span>&nbsp;
</span>(read the caveats in the grey box first)</li><li>Also see: </li></ul>
<p><span><span>«<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reclaim disk space on Windows XP and Windows Server 2008-based computers?</a></p>
<p><span><span>«<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750370.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Forty Ways To Free Up Disk Space</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; By default the Disk Cleanup utility does not delete files accessed in the last seven days.&nbsp; You can either go directly to the Temp directory (Start &gt; Run &gt; %temp% &gt; OK), and select all of the files and delete them (except one or two that will be “in
 use”) or alter the LastAccess value in the registry, to configure the Disk Cleanup utility to delete all the files in the Temp folder regardless of the last accessed date. Here's how (it would be prudent to backup your registry or at least create a Restore
 Point first): </p>
<ul>
<li>Open Regedit (Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit &gt; OK)</li><li>Navigate to<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\VolumeCaches\Temporary Files</li><li>Locate and double-click the LastAccess value</li><li>When you see the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, change the Value Data setting from 7 to 0 and click OK</li><li>Restart Windows.<br />
</li></ul>
But none of the above will really gain you significant amounts of space for very long.&nbsp; The only long term solution is a bigger hard drive.<br />
<p><br />
In the meantime, download and run <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
JDiskReport</a>, which will graphically show you what files are taking up the most space and thus suggest what files you should move to another drive.&nbsp; An alternate utility (also free) is
<a href="http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TreeSize Free</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to move an application to another drive (either external or internal), you'll have to uninstall it and then reinstall it specifying the other drive as the install location.&nbsp; You can't simply move the files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Even so, many applications will place some files on the system drive (i.e., the drive where Windows is located).</p>

<h2>            Adding up figures by mouse clicks in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>Until I upgraded to the latest version of Mac Excel (2016) it has never been a problem to add up figures by writing "=" and then clicking one cell after another. This basic feature seems to have gone. When I click the next cell, it does not add it, but changes
 the reference of the first cell only. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am forced to write the "+" sign manually. Progress? I don't think so. Or is there some way to reactivate the old, more than useful feature again?<br />

 1 hour,and still no deleted messages in my inbox or anywhere else,but&nbsp;I see that they are no longer in my list of deleted messages,so maybe somebody could tell me where I might find them.&nbsp; Thanks. Russell&nbsp;</strong>

            <p>Hi Russell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Outlook.com, you can recover email that might have been accidently deleted from your inbox. This is also helpful if your account has been hacked, because hackers often delete all the messages in an account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>To recover deleted email </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the left pane of the Outlook.com window, click the <span>Deleted</span> folder. At the bottom of the window, click
<span>recover deleted messages</span>. </p>
<p>Outlook.com will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your <span>
Deleted</span> folder. If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means they are permanently lost.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>When the recovered messages are back in your <span>Deleted</span> folder, you should move the important ones back to your inbox or personal folders because the
<span>Deleted</span> folder gets cleaned out periodically. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi - Yesterday I asked&nbsp;you guys a&nbsp;question,and your answer did not help me,so I will try again. When I had Outlook.com, I had the option&nbsp;to recover deleted messages,but ever since I was automatically switched to Outlook (preview) (which is worse) that
 option&nbsp;is no longer anywhere on the page.&nbsp;The only thing that I see is the wording "need to recover".WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN???? &nbsp;I tried clicking on it, but nothing happens,&nbsp;so again&nbsp;I am&nbsp;asking you the same question ---How do&nbsp;I recover deleted emails
 in Outlook(preview)???????????????&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a screenshot of the page,but it looks like I can't send it to you .If anyone has an email address where I can send the screenshot, please let me know.&nbsp; Thank You.&nbsp; Russell.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. I understand that you are having difficulty in displaying your contacts list when emails. I know that you are comfortable with the old Hotmail interface and we surely want you to feel the same way with
 the new interface. Let me provide you additional information on how you can get a better online experience with Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For starters, <font color="#333333">everyone will soon be upgraded to Outlook.com and reverting</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> back to the old interface is not available. If you like, you can go to our

 The upgrade is gradual to ensure a smooth transition of all Hotmail users. To know more about this, please refer to the link below.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/when-i-log-in-i-am-seeing-outlookcom-instead-of/be3fb8d7-01b3-4aee-aac1-64d078d575de"><strong>When
 I log in, I am seeing Outlook.com instead of Hotmail</strong></a></font></span></span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your issue about displaying the contacts, I have simulated the instructions provided by the Community moderator and&nbsp;I need you take note of the following to clear up some things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>To </strong>field automatically display your frequent contacts when you click
<strong>New </strong>or <strong>Reply</strong>&nbsp; to send a message, so the instructions to click it twice would not display your contacts list. That action would only revert back to displaying your frequent contacts. A single click on the
<strong>To</strong> link above the address box should suffice in showing your entire contacts list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To <strong>CC &amp; BCC</strong> are not automatically displayed so opposite the <strong>
To</strong> link so clicking it should display separate boxes for the CC and BCC. The BCC box is often hidden by the frequent contacts that were displayed on the drop down list in the CC box. Hence, you should click the mouse pointer to other parts of the page
 to hide the frequent contacts and be able to see the BCC box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to populate either CC or BCC, you either link once to show the entire contacts list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps. If you have clarifications, feel free to post back anytime.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>This is the error message that I just started receiving after having my computer powered down for a week. First time that I have ever seen such message:</p>
<p>"Cannot open your default e-mail folders. The server is not available. Contact your administrator if this condition persists."</p>
<p>I searched online and haven't found an adequate&nbsp;fix. I CAN open in safe mode. I am not really technically proficient so some hand holding is in order please.</p>
<p>I'm on Outlook 2007. Running XP Pro 64 bit. Thanks!</p>
