            <p>Hi MK44, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand your phone is unable to start beyond the LG splash screen. Did this issue happen after an update was performed or did it just happen on it's own?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few different steps you can try for an issue such as this. If this issue happened after an update, you can try restoring the phone by putting it in to download mode. You can find these steps at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484</a>, but I'll copy them here for you too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Stuck at OEM splash screen</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>During the phone startup sequence, a series of splash screens are displayed for the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), mobile operator, and for Windows Phone.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span>If your phone seems to be stuck at the OEM splash screen, you may have disconnected your phone during an update before it successfully completed.</span><br />
<br />
<span>You will have to put your phone in download mode to restore your phone from backup and then retry the update.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>To restore your phone by putting it into download mode:</strong></span></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Turn off your phone.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<b>Note</b><span>&nbsp;</span>If your phone is currently stuck at the OEM splash screen, you may have to remove the battery to turn it off.</li><li>Disconnect your phone from the USB cable.</li><li>Hold down the camera button.</li><li>Continue holding down the camera button and connect the USB cable between your phone and your computer.</li><li>Continue holding down the camera button until the connect-to-computer mode screen appears.<br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fLibrary%2fImages%2f2512773.jpg" /></div>
</li><li>Release the camera button.</li><li>If it is not already running, start the Zune software on the computer.</li><li>The Zune software should automatically prompt you to restore your phone.</li></ol>
<p><br />
<span>After you complete the restore process, you can then retry the phone update.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<b>Important<span>&nbsp;</span></b><span>When retrying the phone update, make sure that you let all steps of the update to complete before disconnecting your phone from the computer. Some steps of the update process can take a long time to fully complete.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If these steps are unable to restore the phone, you may need to try a hard reset. This does delete everything on the phone, so anything that isn't backed up will be lost. You can perform a hard reset by pressing and holding both
<strong>volume buttons + the camera button + the power button</strong>, then follow the on screen instructions for performing the reset.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If a hard reset isn't able to restore your phone to a condition that will power on, you'll want to contact your mobile operator about repair or replacement options.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please let us know what you find out. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards, </span></p>
<p><span>Nate W.H. </span></p>
        </p>

            <p>my lg e900 was stuck on the "lg" screen for 2 or 3 months.. it wouldn't recharge, wouldn't do anything.. i took it to 2 telus stores and they both said the phone is now a brick..</p>
<p>
</p><p>i was able to get to the hard reset screen, emergency download screen and the computer connect screen holding various buttons down, but nothing further, it always came back to the "lg" screen with nothing happening.. tried connecting to zune.. zune saw the
 phone, but it would restore only up to 11% then get stuck on the "lg" screen again.. gave up for some months..</p>
<p>
</p><p>a wk ago i bought a new battery just to make one last try to save this phone..</p>
<p>
</p><p>battery arrived yesterday, so i decided to try again to get the computer connect screen as recommended above, and connect to zune thru my pc.. zune saw the phone and prompted me to restore again.. but it got only 11% done and then the phone got stuck at
 the "lg" screen again.. so i disconnected and retried the process.. did the zune restore about 30 times.. every time it got stuck at the "lg" screen..</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i gave up with zune and just plugged the phone into my wall charger.. it stuck on the "lg" screen on my wall charger, so i held camera button down to get the computer connect screen while it was charging.. and just let it try to charge.. it went back
 to "lg" screen about 3 or 4 times last night while trying to charge, but i kept changing it back to computer connect screen.. this morning i woke up and i had my normal windows phone screen and fully charged battery (finally after months of trying) but the
 phone said the sim card was missing or invalid..</p>
<p>
</p><p>connected phone to zune.. this time the restore process worked successfully.. but phone said sim card still missing or invalid.. installed all updates to bring phone up to date, but sim card still invalid.. called telus, and the tech guy there said the sim
 card had not been used in so long that it became deactivated.. but he was able to activate the sim card for me and the phone is now working again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>loads of threads on line about this problem with lg e900 getting stuck on "lg" screen.. many people say it was a problem with circuit board.. i tried to open the phone but couldn't get those tiny screws out.. fortunately for me.. the tech guy said the problem
 was a software problem, not hardware.. anyways, my phone has been brought back from the dead! don't know whether the new battery helped or not.. but multiple attempts thru zune to restore phone, and wall charging with computer connect screen definitely did
 something.. hope this helps someone out there..</p>

            Right click on the My Computer icon and select Properties. I think it's under the Hardware tab. Again, I suggest you connect your device to another PC so we can determine where the problem is.

            It sure sounds at first glance that it is a cable problem since it had been syncing fine.&nbsp; Have you powered off your device (reset) then turned it back on and tried to connect?&nbsp; I assume you have rebooted your PC since this thread has gone on for a few
 days.

            Yes, I called the support help line but no one was willing to assist. All they say is to go MS Answers and there seems to be a lack of support here as well. I have raised multiple issues in these forums and there has been no official answers forthcoming.
 I regret leaving GMAIL!

<h2>            Windows excel 2010 compatibility with Mac excel 2010 for Visual Basic coding</h2>
                    <p>Dear developers/experts,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently created a live market feed to my excel spreadsheet on my PC using VB coding. It downloads from the Yahoo Finance website. However, when I open my spreadsheet on a Mac with microsoft 2011 I get a bunch of error messages throughout the coding
 script. Can anyone take a look and see if it is possible to write a script for the same functions that is compatible on both PC and Mac? I believe part of the problem is because the Mac does have the available reference Microsoft WinHTTP Services, Version
 5.1 and so the GET URL function of the code does not work... Below is the coding script:</p>
<p>
Private Sub btnRefresh_Click()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim W As Worksheet: Set W = ActiveSheet<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim Last As Integer: Last = W.Range("A1000").End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Last = 1 Then Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim Symbols As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim i As Integer<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For i = 2 To Last<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Symbols = Symbols &amp; W.Range("A" &amp; i).Value &amp; "+"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next i<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Symbols = Left(Symbols, Len(Symbols) - 1)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim URL As String: URL = "http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=" &amp; Symbols &amp; "&amp;f=snl1hgc6m3m4m5yr"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim http As New WinHttpRequest<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; http.Open "GET", URL, False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; http.Send<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Values = Split(sLine, ",")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; W.Cells(i + 2, 2).Value = Split(Split(sLine, Chr(34) &amp; "," &amp; Chr(34))(1), Chr(34))(0)<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; W.Cells(i + 2, 6).Value = Replace(Values(UBound(Values) - 5), Chr(34), "")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; W.Cells(i + 2, 7).Value = Values(UBound(Values) - 4)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; W.Cells(i + 2, 8).Value = Values(UBound(Values) - 3)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; W.Cells(i + 2, 9).Value = Values(UBound(Values) - 2)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; W.Cells(i + 2, 10).Value = Values(UBound(Values) - 1)<br />

            <p>Yes, you are correct, the Mac does not support the WinHTTP services. You will have to do this with a web query on the Mac. You can search this group for Web query to get several suggestions. You can make the code work on both platforms by using conditional
 assembly or run time platform recognition. Something like:</p>
<p>if left(application.operatingsystem),3)="Mac" then</p>
<p>&nbsp; your mac code goes here</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>&nbsp; windows code here</p>
<p>end if</p>

            <p>Thank you very much, do you think if i could leave my PC script as it is and then create the web query and code for the mac, putting them in the conditional assembly? or will i have to chop part of my PC script? I am new to VBA coding so its the small details
 that cause me problems....</p>

            There is no reason why you would have to change your working PC code. Create the Mac web query and code and use conditional assembly if you want a single code base. Otherwise 2 separate applications will also work.<br />

            Do as Charles said, copy the files to your HD BEFORE trying to open them.<br />
<br />
The message you are getting indicates you are trying to open a file format that is either very old or not native to Word.<br />
<br />
I installed "everything" and I don't have that file. I do have a mswrd832.cnv. It may do the same thing.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Their pop up showed up when I had problems loading brand new Office 2016.&nbsp; &nbsp;They represented themselves as Microsoft and offered to help me for a fee anywhere from $200 to $800 for "lifetime" protection.&nbsp; Luckily I thought it sounded fishy and told them
 I had to think about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I called Microsoft Support, they said that I Connect was not part of the corp.&nbsp; Meanwhile, IConnect took over my computer: named themselves as "Administrator", showed up under Support&nbsp; and in Special Permissions as MSN Tech Support.&nbsp; They also co-opted
 my auto fill info as owner of my computer and added their&nbsp; phone info to my task bar as tech support.&nbsp; ADDITIONALLY, even after Microsoft has ridden them from my system, they still have my phone number and have made at least 40 -50 phone calls to my cell in
 the last month.&nbsp; STAY AWAY!</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Can they sell me lifetime MS products and security for my computer?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>All depends on what they mean by "lifetime"? There is no such thing as "lifetime" for subscription based products. When the word is used to refer to "perpetual" licenses, means your license apples to the lifetime of the specific product with no option to
 upgrade to a new version without purchasing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for anyone selling "lifetime" support - my own personal general reaction to any vendor offering "lifetime support for 3rd products regardless of the vendor involved"&nbsp; is "good luck with that". For full disclosure, have not any experience with this company
 and do not know them at all. The previous comment would be applicable to any "support" vendor offering "lifetime support services".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing that caught my eye was the "one time fix" option under pricing plans which only applied to Mac Book - just seemed very odd.</p>

<h2>            How to check my video before an interview on Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a skype interview in a few days. I rarely use skype and when I do tend to stick to audio mode.</p>
<p>I’m nervous about the video aspect and would find it helpful to find a way of previewing how I appear to the caller.</p>
<p>On Apple Facetime you can see yourself on screen when you enter the app and play around with it until happy with postion, angle etc.</p>
<p>On Skype can I only see myself onscreen after the call starts or is there a way of checking how a caller will see me, or is there a preview setting I can use?</p>

<h3> julianclayton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Just a quick note</h2>
                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I very often scribble things into a notebook which I then have to carry around with me everywhere. This little book very quickly becomes quite messy and I keep having to replace it with a tidier one.&nbsp; I thought it would be quite useful to have some sort
 of notebook on my computer which I could access from my phone when I am out and about. A quick look at 'Windows Store' showed me that I already have just such an 'App' already, quite aptly called 'Onenote'.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Aha! (I thought), how clever of Microsoft to give me this free software.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>So I began typing into my 'Onenote', so easy on a desktop computer with a nice wide keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Later that day, I went out with my 'Smartphone' and looked for a reminder of what I had typed earlier on.&nbsp; Well, to my dismay, I had to type in my email address and password on a tiny 4" wide keyboard (constantly having to press extra keys to get to numbers
 etc.) Then I had to type in my alternate email address so that an email could be sent to me to confirm that I was indeed me. Then I had to access my (alternative) email and get out my notebook to write down the code I had been sent so that I could enter that
 into the web page (which was somewhere) and which would allow me to see the note I had written to myself earlier.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Then I thought of how simple it was to look at the notebook which was already in my hand and read messages from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you find that sometimes computers hamper rather than help with simple things?</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />I am sorry not to bring good news here. As per Microsoft "Skype Numbers and subscriptions are associated with the Skype account used to make the original purchase. Therefore, it's not possible to transfer these from one Skype account to another.

<br />I understand it's probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope you'll at least clarify it.
<br />If you have any further questions, I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great weekend!

Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community Forums.<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the outlook.com prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
The issue might occur if you have disabled the option ‘Group messages by conversation’ and enabled the option ‘Show messages individually’. I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
a. Open outlook.com.<br />
b. Click on Click on the Gear symbol and click on Options.<br />
c. Under ‘Reading Emails’ Click on ‘Group by conversation and pre-load messages’.
<br />
d. Select the option ‘Group messages by conversation’.<br />
e. Click on Save Changes.<br />
<br />
Let us know the update after you try the above steps.</span>

    <title>A5 paper size option not available in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paullaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            A5 paper size option not available in Word 2010</h2>
                    Many people have asked this question over and over again.&nbsp; Why is the A5 paper size facility not available in Word 2010 etc.?&nbsp; Blame is levelled at the printer driver in some cases but this is false as other programs provide the A5 facility so we narrow
 it down to a Microsoft failure to include this size in the list of option in Word 2010.....&nbsp; At least, when setting up the custom size to enable A5 printing, there should be the facility to store the information for immediate recall not change it every time
 you wish to use the size in this program.&nbsp; Come on, Microsoft, get your act together and listen to your customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;No wonder other programs are taking over this vital role for printing and layout requirements!!!

            I think A5 is not commonly used among people so they didnt have the option but your idea that microsoft should keep the value of A5 as in A4 whenever needed once user sets the value and demands again in future is good.

<p>Thanks naseebdangi, it's nice to know that someone can see sense.&nbsp; Let's hope Microspft could learn from your example, a small software patch would meet the objective.</p>

<h3> jp2018cm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Now using Office 365 - email delivery receipts confirmations are now individual, instead of consolidated.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Our company just migrated emails. I was using Outlook 2016 and now Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>***My apologies in advance if my references are incorrect. It appears I am still using the Outlook 2016 version, but am told we are now migrated to Office 365.***</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2016, when I sent an email to multiple people, I requested both a return read receipt and a delivery receipt confirmation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not having any trouble with the return read receipts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2016,when I received the delivery receipt confirmation, it was a consolidated format. Meaning, if I sent the email to 10 people. I would receive a delivery confirmation showing all 10 peoples emails that received it - but in just one email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in Office 365, I receive an individual delivery receipt confirmations for each of the 10 people in addition to the 10 individual return read receipts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is a setting I can modify, so I can receive the delivery receipt confirmation in the consolidated form as I did prior to switching to Office 365. I looked around in setting but can't find anything that addresses it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My inbox is a bit overwhelming with this format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>JP</p>

<p>Hi JP2018CM,,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand based on your description, do you mean that you want to receive only one delivery receipt confirmation after everyone reads the email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, it is not feasible to achieve your intention in Outlook. You can only receive delivery receipt confirmations separately after you successfully send emails to multiple recipients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you can track the sent emails by following these steps: in sent items folder &gt; double click the sent message &gt; click Tracking</p>
&nbsp;
<p>For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-track-email-with-read-receipts-b8606b2c-259e-40c9-8ac5-37cfbed33cd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-track-email-with-read-receipts-b8606b2c-259e-40c9-8ac5-37cfbed33cd8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for receiving a consolidated delivery receipt confirmation after sending emails to multiple recipients, it is not feasible to do that. While I totally understand your concern to have this feature included. I suggest you submit your ideas via the following
 link:</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, here's the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1- I receive the error sometimes when I open Outlook 2013</p>
<p>2 - The email account type is a POP account, which accesses att.net/yahoo email.&nbsp; Other than that there are no email applications (I do have some archive rules set up for certain email folders).</p>
<p>3 - This is a standalone system, no network or other computers associated with it.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 and Office 2013 with Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>I hope this info is helpful.&nbsp; And I thank you again for any help you can provide.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried the suggestions mentioned in the thread link provided by Anula?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not try the steps to restart computer in Windows Clean boot and check if there is any third party application that is causing this error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also open Outlook in its application safe following these steps before performing the clean boot
</p>
<p>Click <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Programs,</span> go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Run</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">Outlook /safe </span>(note there is a space between<span style="font-weight: bold"> Outlook
</span>and<span style="font-weight: bold"> /</span></font>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Options.</span> </li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add-ins.</span> </li><li><span>Clear all options.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <title>Sometimes in Mail Merge a leading space gets inserted in Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sometimes in Mail Merge a leading space gets inserted in Word</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>
I am merging fields from Excel into Word with Mail Merge.</div>
<div>
The &nbsp;Excel fields contain entire sentences.</div>
<div>
For a number of these fields, a leading space gets inserted while the last character - usually the "." - is truncated. For a number of other fields it all works fine. Can't figure out why for some it is working nicely and for others not.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I have double-checked the fields in Excel, and they all look fine: no leading space and a "." at the end.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Does this sound familiar to you?</div>
</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Hope you can help me.</div>
                </div>

            Tammy,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Following your guidelines it turned out that the error is in the Excel data.</div>
<div>I have a spreadsheet with a lot of worksheets, and the results I have summarized in 1 worksheet which I called MailMerge.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This MailMerge sheet contains 1 data row loaded with references to the other sheets.</div>
<div>For testing purposes I have copied &amp; pasted the values: problem solved…</div>
<div><br />
<div>But… I need the references.</div>
<div>Hence I have solved my problem by adding a row above the one loaded with references, and before running the Mail Merge I copy &amp; paste the values in the MailMerge sheet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My problem is solved, although I believe there is a bug somewhere.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if you want more details for bug fixing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks very much for your help.</div>

<h2>            Importing MS Project 2013 to a Gantt Chart in Visio 2013&#58; SS lag dependency problem</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue when importing my MS Project 2013 workplan into a Gantt Chart in Visio 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my Project file, I have specified several Start-Start dependencies with lag built in. When I import the data into Visio, these connectors do not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I just tried this for myself and there does not currently seem to be a way to remove it. I tried tapping and holding, but no menu appears to remove this incorrect e-mail address. I also tried clearing IE's history, restarting the phone and performing a battery
 reset, but&nbsp;none of these&nbsp;had an effect on clearing the e-mail's autocorrect list.</p>
<p>If no one else has an answer, then I think this would be a great feature request for those times that we do accidentally type in an incorrect address.</p>
<p>Anyone else have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
David<br />
</p>
<p>PS - At this time, the only way I can think of removing it is to perform a reset of your device (blank it out and return to factory settings - meaning you lose whatever is not sync'd). But I'd wait first to see if there are any other replies before trying
 something so drastic.</p>

<h2>            Unable to sign in to Outlook.com account on  Android App</h2>
                    I have a child account for my daughter and she is coming of the age where she needs to start to keep her own calendar and contacts. I was hoping that outlook would be friendly enough. The Windows 10 systems from the beta are amazing and all work flawlessly.
 The Android app is something different however. It simply will not allow me to sign into her account to use it on her Android device. Why is this and is there a way around?

    <title>Not receiving very important emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> umeshagm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not receiving very important emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Today I noticed that I have not been receiving emails sent from my company into my outlook.com email account.</p>
<p>I left my previous company a month back. I had not received Full&amp;Final communication, experience letter and few other documents. I enquired multiple times and they were mentioning they have sent already. I did not receive offer letter of the company for
 which I have cleared interview. I checked with them; 2 days back they tried sending the email multiple times but it didn't reach me. I received those emails into my gmail account without any issue. Later I noticed that I am receiving few emails but missing
 many.</p>
<p>I have completed basic troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. Checked that email id is correct.</p>
<p>2. No rules created.</p>
<p>3. No blocked senders.</p>
<p>4. Email has been sent from sender (Because I have received them in gmail)</p>
<p>5. I do not have any client software that might delete emails automatically.</p>
<p>6. I do access emails from my android phone but that doesn't delete messages.</p>
<p>7. Checked in Junk folder and deleted folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please help with this. It's really troubling a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Umesha G M</p>

<h2>            What is the difference between &#34;Preview&#34; and non-&#34;Preview&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have two email accounts hosted on Outlook.com (both with custom domains). When I use the web browser interface to access one of them a big black bar at the top says in reverse letters "Outlook Mail (Preview)". When I use the web browser interface to access
 the other one the big black bar at the top says "Outlook Mail". What does the "Preview" mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p><strong>There</strong><strong> is in progress an update to Outlook.com</strong> that lets you make the most of the moments that matter to you—featuring a refined inbox, an upgraded calendar and more.
</p>
<p>The update being rolled out in <strong>Preview</strong>,&nbsp; is the first of many innovations coming as Microsoft
<strong>upgrades</strong> Outlook.com to a new Office 365-based infrastructure.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no returning to what was.</p>
<p>With time &amp; more information we will have to get used to it <strong>if we wish
</strong>to continue using this free web based email service...</p>

                    What are you doing to my e-mail???? I cannot get in to check on my business and anything else.! I checked everything and it tells me it's up and running fine no problems. I am not able to go to e-mail. Get this fixed ASAP or I am going to another e-mail
 site and never use your again.&nbsp; I didn't ask for it and now I'm paying for it.
