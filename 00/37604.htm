<h2>            Blue screen crashes</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my PC's motherboard, CPU &amp; RAM. Ever since I've been getting constant blue screen crashes. Sometimes my PC will refuse to even post unless I start it stop it over and over until it finally posts. Others it will blue screen in games etc,
 or even some times for no reason at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed this form&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983</p>
<p>
</p><p>My results where that it restarted and to my surprise posted for the first time (normally in a restart it will turn off and some times not re-post) seems to be working well and then instantly before I go to the log in for windows it blue screened crashed
 with an error along the lines of drover verification invalid&nbsp;<br />
I tried to take a picture but it was about 1 second before it restarted its self and did the exact same error, after that it restarted again but then did a system diagnostics and a system restore by its self, this whole time I hadn't even touched the key board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas<br />

            Sounds like you may have a hardware issue if this did not occur before the hardware was installed. 
<br />
<br />Start your PC then just as Windows loads - press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a shut down. Do it 3 times. You may only need to do it twice, but on the third start Windows will boot into the recovery environment.
<br />
<br />You can also hold shift &gt; press restart in the start menu to do the same
<br />
<br />1:
<br />Go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Option &gt; Startup Repair
<br />This will try to make Windows repair itself.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helps. 
<br />
<br />You may need to flash your BIOS for the latest drivers as well.

            We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.

            Hi I apologise for the late reply, I followed your steps and after telling it to do a start up repair it turned its self off and then didn't re post until this morning, when it re posted it continued with it's start up repair, after doing a diagnostics
 it told me it couldn't do the repair and linked me to a log file where to find the crash report which I couldn't find. But apparently I have 3 .dmp files generated one this morning 2 yesterday so I can add them here.

            Related to Either Avast or Anti Cheat. Quite Probable that Avast drove Anti cheat to crash.

<br />Uninstall Avast and see if the issue persists. Also if you have not disabled verifier, do so.

            I'll try that, but easy anti cheat is what some steam games use to prevent cheaters. So I'm unsure what to do with that. Also some times my computer will experience these issues when launching a game&nbsp;

            Avast would have been my first step to uninstall and use WD in its place. If it still crashes try reinstalling Easy Anti Cheat.

            I uninstalled Avast and during the restart it took 20 minutes for it to re post, its weird because it will give no post. Then a post and turn off again, then a full post. I've just reinstalled easy anti cheat in every game that has it. When I didn't wipe
 my SSD or HDD then when it crashed a lot I wiped my SSD but not my HDD so I'm going to try wiping my HDD, also I used an app called Driver Booster 5 which checks all drivers and updates them. I'll add another reply when I've wiped my HDD

<p>So I tried to do a system reset just for my HDD and for some reason it got to 30% then gave me an error and wouldn't let me, so I then told it to reset all drives including my SSD which in theory should clean up any possible driver or software issues, it
 seemed to be working okay and launched fine then when I restarted my PC it then again wouldn't post for like 5 minutes of me turning the PC on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't blue screened yet but I assume the issue not to be fixed.</p>

<h2>            Drivers will not load and hardware will not work</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Drivers will not load and hardware will not work? HELP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right so the laptop was working fine earlier on i turn it off and then a couple of hours later i return and turn it back on. What happens? Wireless and Audio drivers have completly stopped working. So i check the device manager the hardware shows up but
 i get a load of yellow exclamation marks going down the side "base structure" "wireless" "sigmatel audio drivers" etc etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i unistall the drivers and install them again after downloading them all from there appropriate websites and still the same after restarts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>more yellow exclamation marks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now i am left with a laptop with windows 7 sat there doing nothing and there is no clue as to what can be done to resolve this as most other people have different problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's always the same error code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several causes of Code 39 errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A required device driver is missing. </li><li>A required binary file is corrupted. </li><li>There is a problem with the file I/O process. </li><li>A driver that is referencing an entry point in another binary file is unable to load.</li></ul>
<strong>Recommended resolution</strong> <br />
<br />
Reinstall the drivers for this device.<br />
<br />
<strong>Uninstall and reinstall the driver</strong> <br />
<br />
Uninstall the driver from Device Manager, and then scan for new hardware to install the driver again.<br />
<br />
You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for
 the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.
<ol>
<li>On the device Properties dialog box, click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, and then click<strong>Uninstall</strong> . Follow the instructions.</li><li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Open Device Manager, click <strong>Action</strong> , and then click <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> . Follow the instructions.</li></ol>
<p>And it still has not fixed this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clues would be grateful thanks.</p>

<p>Try to do a restore to a restore point from just before this happened. If you are able to do that, and the same thing happens, then I'd suspect a malware or a hardware problem. It's quite abnormal for a number of devices to quit working all at the same time
 for no apparent reason.</p>

                    <p>Sorry if this is the wrong place to post.</p><p><br /></p><p>For the last couple of months now, I have been working on the achievement "20 Day Roll" on the free game ROBLOX. I have already achieved 10 Day Roll, which is logging in consecutively&nbsp;for 10 days. Since then, I have logged on multiple times a day at different hours of the day to get this achievement, but still have not received this achievement. That means I've logged on several times a day for two months without getting this achievement.</p><p><br /></p><p>At first, I thought, maybe it was something I was doing. So I began to set alarms, and mark it off on a calendar each day that I log on. I've been doing this for at least a month, and still, no achievement.</p>

<p>Hi WeebleM,</p>
<p>Before following the method below make sure you unplug any external devices attached to the computer except the mouse and the keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Perform <strong>System Restore</strong> from the installation disc adn see if that can make any difference.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more information on this;</p>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: As the the Startup Repair option does not resolve the issue, you must troubleshoot more steps manually, use the
<strong>Bootrec.exe tool</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: See if you can boot the computer to<strong> Last Known Good configuration</strong> by following the steps below.<br />
<br />
1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer by clicking the Start button , clicking the arrow next to the Shut Down button , and then clicking Restart.</p>
<p>2. Do one of the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp; If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by shutting down and restarting
 your computer.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start, and then press F8.</p>
<p>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Last Known Good Configuration (advanced), and then press Enter.</p>
<p>4. If your computer has more than one operating system installed, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system that you want to start by using Last Known Good Configuration, and then press Enter. Windows will then resume starting normally.</p>

            <p>Uninstall McAfee (a good move) from from Control Panel-&gt; Programs and Features. It might be worth downloading the removal tool before you start in case anything gets left

<p>This should generate an error in Security Centre that you have no AV which will link to the option to enable Defender.&nbsp;It will almost certainly need updating.</p>

            To enable Defender, search Defender in the Control Panel.&nbsp; Open the link that comes up and go to Settings.&nbsp; Go to Administrator and check the box that says Turn on Windows&nbsp;Defender.&nbsp; Then go to the Real-time Protection tab and check the box there.&nbsp; Restart
 your computer after uninstalling McAfee and after enabling Defender.&nbsp; You made a good decision to use Defender over McAfee;&nbsp;I have seen people mess their computers up so bad while trying to do an update with McAfee installed that they could not even reload
 the disk.&nbsp; Also, I use Defender and have never had a problem.

            I don't think this works w/Windows 8. After you search Defender &amp; click on the Defender App, you get a message that says "Windows Defender has been turned off &amp; isn't monitoring your Computer."

<p>Thank you for your response. However, there is no technical problem with the Kindle reader. I can read books fine using the Kindle reader in Windows 10. Kindle simply does not support reading newspapers and magazines in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, Nook doesn't seem to be interested in supporting Windows 10. The current version of the Nook app is for Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is a Windows 10 question and not a Nook or Kindle question. How can I read newspapers and magazines offline using Windows 10?</p>

            I need an e reader for windows 10. The Kindle app doesn't allow&nbsp;me to &nbsp;access the table of contents , cover, other bookmarks.&nbsp;I would give it a 0. &nbsp; I just got the Surface Pro 3 and reading books on this tablet/laptop falls short of the IPad.&nbsp; Glad I still

<h2>            Can&#39;t run Sysprep on Windows 7 if it was installed as an Upgrade</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Windows 7 Enterprise machine that was installed as an "Upgrade" from Vista because the manufacturer is MIA and we can no longer get a few of the drivers. (I despise hardware manufacturers that refuse to allow us to download drivers directly and
 force us to go to the OEM.)&nbsp; Anyway, trying to run sysprep on one of these generates an error saying that it can only be done on a 'clean install'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody know if&nbsp;there is anyway around this?</p>

    <title>Intermittent WiFi after Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aleksaslegainskas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent WiFi after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS N551VW laptop with an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265 adapter. Prior to the Anniversary Update my WiFi connection was relatively stable throughout the day with minor hiccups here and there. However, right after the update the connection is
 practically unusable due to its instability. Also, even though the connection is very intermittent and even if my browser cannot open webpages, the wireless indicator shows "Connected. Secured." 100% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a tech savvy person, I did some research on my own and have done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going through Network Troubleshooter and resetting the wireless adapter seems to work only for a small period of time.</li><li>Reinstalled the wireless driver multiple times. That includes versions from Microsoft, ASUS N551VW driver list and even Intel's latest drivers.</li><li>Tried fiddling with my router (Netis WF-2411) which included changing the channels, bands, etc.</li><li>Tried fiddling with adapter properties as well to no avail</li><li>Chatted with Intel support for 2 hours and came to a conclusion that it's not the adapter's fault</li><li>To confirm this I ran a LiveUSB for Ubuntu, pinged Google for 10+ minutes with 0% packet loss.</li><li>Windows Tech Support wasn't able to help me as well.</li><li>Installed a fresh Windows 10 with Anniversary Update on a completely separate partition to confirm that something didn't go well on my main update. WiFi still intermittent there.</li></ul>
<p>During all of this, I noticed something in the Event Viewer. Checking Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\WLAN-AutoConfig\Operational logs I noticed extremely weird behavior: during the WiFi hiccup/outage, it starts spewing out loops of "Wireless
 security stopped/started/succeeded." events with respective IDs of 11004/11010/11005.</p>
<p>This happens around every minute and lasts from as little as couple of seconds to minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other devices (2 phones) using the WiFi connection are working properly, even when the laptop's WiFi is broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for trying some steps in order to get the issue fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to update the router firmware as it may include some settings for the router so that it works flawlessly with the anniversary update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if you still face issue with intermittent WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            <p>The firmware was up-to-date. Nevertheless, I've turned in the original router for repair, bought a new one and it works like a charm. I guess the router was indeed emitting a faulty signal.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried ALL the steps in that support document and none of them worked. When I run the
<strong>netsh wlan show wlanreport</strong>., I do see a lot of instability in the wifi connection and info that I don't understand. I can see the connection come and go with some sort of "capability change" listed in the the report whenever it loses connection.
 If helpful, I can try to get more of that info here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But none of the steps worked...I truly did them all.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Gateway ping is fine (for the short time that the wifi stays connected). All other devices in my household work find on wifi or wired</li><li>Driver for network adapter is at latest. Checked 3 times at computer manufacturer (Lenovo) support site, and using windows auto search for latest driver.</li><li>Can't roll back driver; that option is grayed out for some reason.</li><li>Network troubleshooter will restore the connection for about 15 seconds; then it drops again and stays gone</li><li>None of the winsock reset, ip reset, release/renew ip address, or dns flush helped at all. Even after rebooting as prompted within each step</li><li>Turned off Windows Firewall &amp; Windows Defender (only software firewall &amp; virus scan I have installed at the moment) with no change.</li><li>Network reset did nothing</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>THE ONLY THING</strong></span> that fixed my wifi connectivity:
<strong>UNINSTALLED ANNIVERSARY UPDATE.</strong> I used "Go back to a previous build" in Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery to&nbsp;roll back from&nbsp;the anniversary update. Wifi now&nbsp;works just fine and as stable as can be with no issues, just as before I tried
 with W10A update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So either, W10A update is not-compatible with my network adapter driver (and a ton of other adapters), or something is very broken in the W10A networking architecture. Even with the patch to W10A today, I'm not sure I want to even update and try it.</p>

            <p>Same symptoms as jp_drums_4evr. &nbsp;Same events in the log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on at least 4 WiFi routers I use frequently, 2 work and 2 home, all of which were trouble-free before the Windows 10 Anniversary update (and have no problems with non-Windows devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn off WiFi, and instead use the Cellular connection on my PC, I experience similar network connectivity problems, so perhaps the problem is not specific to WiFi. &nbsp;Have not tried wired Ethernet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 Pro version 1607 build 14393.51</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-4600 8GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would revert to pre-Anniversary update, but am told that because it's been &gt;10 days since I installed, I can't go back to an earlier build. &nbsp;So now I am extra envious of a fix for this bug.</p>

    <title>Schlechte Erfahrung mit dem Microsoft &#40;Store&#41; Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yondervoice8786  say:</h3>
<h2>            Schlechte Erfahrung mit dem Microsoft &#40;Store&#41; Service</h2>
                    <p>Hallo, </p>
<p>nach einem sehr interessanten Gespräch mit der&nbsp;Microsoft Service Hotline, möchte ich hier meine Erfahrungen kundtun, damit vielleicht Andere 2x Überlegen bevor Sie im MS Store einkaufen.
</p>
<p>Zur Vorgeschichte:</p>
<p>Am 20.12.2015 kaufte ich als Geschenk für meinen&nbsp;Schwager einen&nbsp;Xbox360 Controller, da dieser sehr gern FIFA am&nbsp;Computer spielt. Im Oktober letzten Jahres kontaktiere er mich, dass die&nbsp;Schultertasten leider nicht mehr richtig funktionieren würden (was ich persönliche schon als große Schande empfinde - 10 Monate Kauf quasi Defekt). Ich versuchte daraufhin, den&nbsp;Controller zu reklamieren, merkte jedoch schnell, dass das gar nicht so einfach ist. Da für jeden&nbsp;Supportauftrag ein&nbsp;registriertes Produkt vorliegen muss (So zumindest wird es suggeriert wenn man den&nbsp;Weg wenn man über die Kanäle von Microsoft geht - Man landet nämlich genau im Xbox Service Center bzw. hier:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/devices</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daraufhin habe ich meinen Schwager erneut kontaktiert und um die Seriennummer gebeten. Ein Auszug aus der Skype Konversation ist hier zu finden:&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffs5.directupload.net%2fimages%2f170118%2fyhmdk3b5.png" /></figure><p><br /></p>
<p>Man achte auf den&nbsp;Zeitstempel. </p>
<p>Diese hatte ich anschließend vergeblich versucht auf der Microsoft Website einzugeben. Hauptgrund war eigentlich, dass wenn man dem offiziellen Weg für eine Reparatur folgt immer wieder auf die Seite für die Produktregistrierung geleitet wird und dies den Eindruck erweckt, dass eine Produktregistrierung notwendig ist,&nbsp;um das Produkt reparieren lassen zu können. Die Microsoft Seite sagt hierzu explizit:
</p>
<p>"Müssen Sie eine Reparaturanfrage stellen oder einen bestehenden Auftrag überprüfen? Besuchen Sie das Xbox-Online-Servicecenter. Hier können Sie auch ein Gerät registrieren und Garantieinformationen erhalten."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Tja Pech, dass dies nur für Endgeräte, jedoch nicht für Zubehör gilt. Als eine Registrierung&nbsp;auch nach 3-4 Versuchen nicht funktionierte, gab ich verzweifelt auf - Email oder telefonischer Support wurden an keiner Stelle erwähnt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Der Chatsupport war geschlossen. Ein Twitteraccount besitze ich nicht und eine Reparaturanfrage über ein Forum gibts anscheinend auch nur bei Microsoft. Nun zu diesem Zeitpunkt bin ich auch noch davon ausgegangen, genug Zeit zu haben den&nbsp;Reparaturanspruch anzumelden.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Heute </p>
<p>Doch heute wurde ich eines besseren belehrt. Nach Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Chat-Support wurde ich darauf hingewiesen, dass meine Rechnung vom 20.12.2015 stammt und somit außerhalb des Garantiezeitraumes von 12 Monaten liegt. Mein Hinweis, dass der Defekt bereits vor Ablauf der&nbsp;Garantie vorhanden war und ich auch bereits vor Ablauf der Garantie einen Antrag auf Reparatur zu stellen und das lediglich, die mangelhaften Beschreibungen auf der Website sowie die fehlenden Kontaktmöglichkeiten dies verhinderten, wurden gekonnt ignoriert. Es ist nicht so, dass dies mein erster Versuch einer Kontaktaufnahme war und auch nicht dass ich mich erst 6 Monate nach Ablauf der Garantiezeit gemeldet hätte, siehe den entsprechender Browserverlauf um den 1.&nbsp;November 2016:
</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffs5.directupload.net%2fimages%2f170118%2fn5zj42j2.png" />
<p>Außerdem legte ich deutlich klar, dass der Defekt bereits vor Ablauf der Garantie&nbsp;bestand und dass ich dies auch wenn benötigt&nbsp;beweisen könnte. Deshalb bat ich darum, ob man nicht auf Basis der gesetzlichen Gewährleistung eine Reparatur durchführen könne - Auch dies wurde ignoriert und mir versichert, dass mein spezieller Fall zwar ärgerlich aber nicht zu ändern sei. Man gab mir jedoch die Möglichkeit mein Problem nochmal telefonisch zu erläutern. Hierzu wurde mir eine Telefonnummer gegeben.<br />
</p>
<p>Diese angerufen wurde mir schnell gesagt, dass es sich hierbei um die falsche Telefonnummer handelt und man mich weiterleiten würde. Nach 20 Minuten in der Warteschlange legte ich entnervt auf und suchte im Internet nach der richtigen Telefonnummer, welche ich anrief und innerhalb von 2 Minuten jemanden an der Leitung hatte. </p>
<p>Diesem&nbsp;Herrn erklärte ich ebenfalls mein Problem und auch hier wurde lapidar gesagt - Keine Garantie, keine Reparatur. Als ich ihm erklären wollte, dass ich ein solches Gebahren 12 Monate und 26 Tage nach Kaufdatum (nicht mal 13 Monate) mehr als kundenunfreundlich empfinde und ob nicht auf Grundlage der vorhanden Tatsachen eine Abwicklung über den gesetzlichen&nbsp;Gewährleistungsanspruch bestünde, legte dieser einfach auf. So etwas habe ich persönlich noch nicht erlebt und ist auch der Grund warum ich diesen Beitrag schreibe.
</p>
<p>Mir geht es weniger um den&nbsp;Controller oder&nbsp;die 25€ die dieser gekostet hat, sondern um das generelle Geschäftgebahren von Microsoft /&nbsp;dem Microsoft&nbsp;Store. Der Controller war ein Geschenk für einen ganz normalen Durchschnittsspieler, der das Gerät vielleicht 1-2x die Woche nutzt. Das so ein Controller einen Defekt haben kann ist ägerlich&nbsp;kann aber&nbsp;vorkommen. Der Umgang mit dem&nbsp;Kunden sollte jedoch in keinster Weise erfolgen, wie er hier stattgefunden hat. Desweiteren bedarf die Microsoft-Seite umgehender Überarbeitung, da nirgends erwähnt wird, dass Zubehörartikel nicht registriert werden können und ein Reparaturauftrag nur über den&nbsp;Chat möglich ist (Aussage des Chat-Mitarbeiters&nbsp;wie ich heute erfahren durfte).
</p>
<p>Abschließend möchte ich sagen, dass hätte ich dieses Gerät einfach bei MM oder Saturn gekauft, wäre eine anstandslose Rückabwicklung innerhalb von 24 Monaten für das gleiche Produkt möglich gewesen. Hier wird einem nach nicht mal 13 Monate nach Kauf die&nbsp;kalte Schulter gezeigt.&nbsp;Ich hatte damals im Microsoft Store gekauft, da ich glaubte, der Hersteller wird soviel vertrauen in sein Produkt haben, dass ein Kauf noch sicherer ist. Hier scheine ich wohl nach all meinen Erfahrungen falsch zu liegen. Microsoft glaubt weniger an die eigenen Produkte als die Reseller. Wie erklären sich sonst die&nbsp;verkürzten Garantiezeiten und jegliches Fehlen von Kulanz? Ob das zerstörte Vertrauen eines langjährigen Kunden mehr wert ist als ein&nbsp;Artikel der in der Herstellung vielleicht 5€ kostet sollen die Leser dieses Artikels selbst entscheiden. </p>
<p>Ich für meinen Fall werde&nbsp;meine Schlüsse aus den Erfahrungen ziehen und die Servicewüste Microsoft-Store mit seinen stark ausbaufähigen Kontaktmöglichkeiten&nbsp;gänzlich meiden. Leider sind wir nicht alle 13,&nbsp;Hipp und Trendy und nutzen Twitter.
</p>
<p>Mit freundlichen&nbsp;Grüßen, </p>
<p>Max Th. </p><p><br /></p><p>P.S. Ich bitte die übergroßen&nbsp;Bilder zu entschuldigen</p>

            <p>Ich verstehe Deinen Unmut, aber lass mich Dir kurz erklären, wo Du leider ein falsches Verständnis von Garantie und Gewährleistung hast.&nbsp;</p><p>Du hast den Support gefragt, "ob man nicht auf Basis der gesetzlichen Gewährleistung eine Reparatur durchführen könne".</p><p>Für die Gesetzliche Gewährleistung (die wie Du richtig sagst zwei Jahre beträgt), ist aber nicht Microsoft der Ansprechpartner, sondern der Laden, von dem Du den Controller hast - also der Händler, mit dem Du den "Kaufvertrag" geschlossen hast. Das Problem ist aber, dass nach 6 Monaten eine Beweislastumkehr stattfindet. Das bedeutet, innerhalb von 6 Monaten geht der Gesetzgeber davon aus, dass es eindeutig ist, dass der Defekt schon beim Kauf bestand. Nach den 6 Monaten musst Du als Käufer dem Geschäft beweisen, dass der Defekt schon beim Kauf bestanden hat.&nbsp;</p><p>Bezüglich Garantie: Das ist eine FREIWILLIGE Leistung, die ein Unternehmen anbieten KANN, aber nicht muss.

<p><br />
Two separate issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What virus was it? How did you know you had it? How did you "delete" it? You normally can't get rid of a virus by deleting it; you need to get rid of it with anti-virus software. My guess is taht you are probably still infected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The missing "top layer" is not a problem; it's just a mode that Task Manager can run in.&nbsp; It<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">'s called "Small Footprint Mode." To change back and forth from this mode to regular mode, just double-click
 on the border.</span></p>

<p>You say Windows 7 Home&nbsp;Premium. Is this a branded OEM Cd/DVD or&nbsp;is there a copy of the operating system&nbsp;in a a recovery partition on the hard drive?</p>
<p>Have you ever installed&nbsp;a program called Process Explorer? This programme is freeware and performs many function peformed by Task Manager?</p>

    <title>Games unable to detect screen resolution options - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Games unable to detect screen resolution options</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; I'm having an unusual problem I can't find any documentation for.&nbsp; Several of my games (but not all) have become unplayable.&nbsp; Near as I've been able to diagnose, the issue seems to be that they are either not able to query the screen resolution options,
 or the data being returned is invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games I've been able to replicate with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechwarior online: The default windowed configuration loads, but when you go into the settings menu, the screen resolution options are blank.&nbsp; There is nothing there to select from.&nbsp; Attempting to save ANY settings change will write the blank screen resolution
 value into the config and crash the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Homeworld Deserts of Kharak: Game starts to load.&nbsp; Colors flash on the screen, and the music acts like it has loaded the splash screen, but you can't see anything.&nbsp; Near as I can tell it trying to render to a 0x0px, or 1x1px screen resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Having more than one failure confirmed this is not a game specific issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>System is a Lenovo Y500 Lapotop with a GT 750M graphics card (just the single one, not the second optional one).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstalling the games (no change)</li><li>Installing video drivers direct from Nvidia (no change)</li><li>Removing and re-detecting video and monitor components</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The one weird thing I found when digging around in settings is that under the display adapter it lists resolution/refresh options for both 59 and 60 HZ at every resolution.&nbsp; However, I can't access the 59 HZ setting through the Nvidia app.&nbsp; No idea if this
 is related to the issue, but it is the only other thing I've found that seems out of place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to look into this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p />

<p><em>"acts like it has loaded the splash screen, but you can't see anything. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the image is corrupt, or because objects such as buttons you would click on to get into options, etc are off screen ?</p>
<p>If the latter, R/click on the games shortcut or .exe and in Properties &gt; Compatibility select -
<em>Override high DPI scaling behavior</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- A quick search shows that Mechwarrior online <em>does</em> indeed tend to have a problem with resolutions.</p>
<a href="https://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/175981-cant-change-video-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;From the top of the list -
</a>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Do you have the same problem when running the problem games on the Intel HD4000 integrated graphics ?<br />
- Do you install Nvidia's Geforce Experience ? If so try uninstalling it. The Experience does cause issues for</p>
<p>some users now and then (don't know if it includes your res problem though).</p>
<p>- Did this problem begin after installing the 1709 update or the 'meltdown/spectre' patch&nbsp; ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Do the games have configuration files that the user can alter ? If so you may be able to set the res there</p>
<p>(may have to change the file to Read Only if the res you enter gets changed again when you launch the game).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the problem were due to driver corruption or gpu, it should happen in all games. If other games are working
</p>
<p>properly there may be something in these games that is conflicting with a software, or perhaps a Service ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Installing video drivers direct from Nvidia (no change)"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have not reinstalled the driver provided by Lenovo it would probably be best to do so.</p>
<p>With laptops it's best to use only the driver provided by the mfg.&nbsp; While Lenovo seem to have stopped driver support</p>
<p>after the one token Nvidia Win10 driver they released in 2015, this is probably still your best option.</p>
<p>- Nvidia do have a disclaimer in their release notes regarding possible issues on laptops if you use their generic drivers,</p>
<p>due to the laptop mfg's implementing the gpu's in non default ways, which can cause conflict with generic Nvidia drivers.</p>

<p>Update:&nbsp; MWO is working again.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I tried a bunch of stuff, so I don't know for sure which thing I did was the fix.&nbsp; The thing I think most likely helped though was I went into the device manager and removed both the display adapter and monitor

    <title>Can I Reuse My Product Key and USB Windows Installer after Upgrading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xsitruc13x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Reuse My Product Key and USB Windows Installer after Upgrading Parts of my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm making some significant improvements to my PC and replacing the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and adding a new M.2 SSD (which I plan to install Windows 10 on).&nbsp; I purchased a Windows 10 product key which came with a USB flash drive for installing Windows 10
 back in 2016.&nbsp; I activated windows and still have my product key and USB Flash Drive that I used for activation and installing the OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the product key is only valid for 1 active PC at a time but my concern is that because of all the hardware changes my product key won't be accepted when I do a fresh install of Windows 10 on my new SSD.&nbsp; Is there a way to remove the activated
 product key from my existing OS/MS account so I can move it to the new SSD when I do a fresh install of Windows 10? If there isn't a way to transfer the product key... will the fresh install active when I sign into my MS account since it is supposed to be
 tied to that as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read through several articles on the website and it looks like I might have to contact MS Customer Support since I'm changing all of this stuff out... but I wanted to see if anyone else had gone through this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Sitruc.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can move retail Windows anywhere you want.  If you have a DIgital License linked to your MS Account now you can even move it to the new hardware following this guide:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>.  
<br />
<br />What does it say under Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation at the top under Activation Status  and Edition?  If it says activated with Retail Product Key then you can remove the product Key by typing CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Admin to open Command Prompt, type slgmr /upk and press return.  This removes the Product Key from the old install so you can add it to the new one.  
<br />
<br />Then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it doesn't activate after install with the Product Key, try running the Activaiton Troubleshooter.  If it gives a Try again later message this means the activation servers are overloaded so either give it a few days or...
<br />
<br />If any problems activating the new install contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,<br /><br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. <br /><br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. <br /><br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: <br /><br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.<br /><br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.<br /><br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call Microsoft Support.<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone

            Hi xSitruc13x
<br />
<br />You have a retail Windows 10 Licence, that entitles you to transfer to a new Motherboard or PC any time you need to.
<br />
<br />The Activation troubleshooter rarely works to resolve activation issues
<br />
<br />Your best option it to contact Microsoft Support on a weekday and ask them to re-activate your Windows 10 for you . . .

Then you would need to use an available </span><span>XP</span><span> license you have, or buy a new
 one and install it on your computer. Insert the install disk into the computer, reboot, and start the install. During the install process you can format the Windows 7 partition then continue installing Windows. You'll have to backup your files and reinstall

 a normal installation of XP with a few exceptions: only uses a single CPU core, only has access to USB and serial ports, DVD access is read only, limited to 16-bit graphics (3D games don't play well). It will allow you to install most (but not all) programs
 that wont install in Windows 7 but worked with earlier versions.</span></p>

<br />
<br />Was this the Fall Creators Update version 1709?  Check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About.
<br />
<br />If so you can roll it back to the older version following this tutorial and then hide it:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />
<br />If it is still an older version and you had regular Updates cause problems you can uninstall them at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update&gt;Update History and then hide them using the Hide Updates Tool here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />Otherwise you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            In addition you can first try to update the sound driver to latest from the PC or Device Maker's Support Downloads webpage. 
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough then try uninstalling the Sound driver in Device Manager on the Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall it.  
<br />
<br />Run the Sound Playback troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.

            Greg , thanks for the input . I'm in pro audio , and the prompt says I'd have to reinstall from disc a bunch of programs , hours worth . I'm thinking without the codex installed for .CFX files , it'll be the same thing after all that . The company has
 changed hands since this version and ( surprise ! ) the new owners no longer support older versions . A Google search for the codex turns up absolutely zero , like it doesn't exist . That was the correct update number , but I've had it running since then .
 I ran the compatibility trouble shooter , but it was working for a time in W10 . I'm familiar with a range of music software , but this is baffling .

<h2>            Autoadjust feature malfunctioning and .jxr problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Photogallery's autoadjust feature is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I click 'autoadjust', the top left hand corner of the photo is the only part of the image that remains intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a sample of a photo (before and after) - hope you find the image amusing! (the problem, however is not amusing!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the .jxr prompt repeatedly showing up, despite having windows photo gallery set as the default for all images. I looked at some of the solutions offered under that thread and they all seem rather complex to execute....mentioning it here in the
 hopes that a simple solution is offered and/or it is part of the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.....thanks so much!!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8fc88c6-272d-4b6c-b944-1da8dac5fa14" /></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delayed response. I understand that you're having some problems with Photo Gallery regarding the auto adjust feature and the prompt informing you to use the program in opening some file types. May I ask if this issue still persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, may I know what troubleshooting steps have you already done in trying to rectify this issue? I have actually simulated your concern regarding the auto adjust and it seems to be working fine on our end. Did you try to adjust the settings for this
 option and does the issue still occur?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your concern about the .jxr prompt, please perform the following steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you encounter the message, tick the check box stating <strong>Don't show me this again for these file types</strong> then click
<strong>No</strong>.</li><li>Run SFC from this <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</li></ul>
<p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't recall the fixes I tried before.......I'd given up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The jxr problem seems to be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the SFC from the link and it reported no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run antivirus scans from several sites and I am subscribed - nothing found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The autoadjust problem still persists per the image I submitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Lenovo's help line (I paid for premium support) and they said to wipe my hard drive and reinstall everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely not going to do that!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other programs are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help? Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In addition, this issue might be caused by your version of Windows Live Essentials. You may fix the error that you've encountered if you update the program to its

<p>4. I have not tried another program to edit the photos</p>
<p>5. I didn't make the changes Lenovo asked me to do.........even I know you don't wipe your hard drive to remedy a software issue with one program!

    <title>Low bandwidth on Windows 8.1 computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Low bandwidth on Windows 8.1 computer</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Slow Broadband</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 3 PC's in my house: 2 x Win7 and 1 x Win 8.1. My broadband provider advertises 150meg service. Using wired connections direct to the modem&nbsp;in all cases, one Win7 PC&nbsp;gets me&nbsp;the advertised 150meg,&nbsp;the second gets me&nbsp;about 100meg and the Win8.1 (the
 newest) gets me only 40meg. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have followed the steps advised by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a36fb140-0f9e-469f-896a-576bc18f0eff">
<font color="#0072c6">Mohammad _ Imran</font></a>&nbsp;in the following thread:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/windows-8-slow-broadband-speed-both-wireless-and/413c6850-2466-4d0a-b192-eecf8d3cc50b">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/windows-8-slow-broadband-speed-both-wireless-and/413c6850-2466-4d0a-b192-eecf8d3cc50b</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>.... including Troubleshooting, Safe Boot and Clean Boot without success. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>(Note when I get to "<strong>Step 2: Enable half of the services" </strong>
I actually disable all services and then try a speed test, again without no improvement in broadband speed. I have assume there is no point in continuing the recommended steps after that)</em></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The problem appears to relate to a PC system setting (especially&nbsp;on my Win8.1).
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The gpedit.msc solution mentioned elsewhere in this thread is not available on my PC and I'm not convinced it would bridge a 100meg gap anyway.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone advise ?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Sean.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to Flush the DNS cache and check if that makes any difference to the Internet Speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Right click on the Start button and select Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>- Type <span><strong>IPCONFIG /FLUSHDNS</strong></span> and press enter.</p>
<p>- Restart the computer and then check if the speed varies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, uninstall and reinstall the latest network drivers from the computer manufacturer website and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the drivers from the computer manufacturer website and save it on the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Type device manager in search charms.</p>
<p>- Browse Network adapter, right click on the network driver and click on Uninstall
</p>
<p>- Restart the computer and install the drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Thanks Kevin.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Still no improvement on my Win8.1 -&nbsp;gets only 40meg versus ISP verified 150meg.&nbsp;So far and including your instructions,&nbsp;I have done the following with:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows troubleshoot (no issue detected)</li><li>Safe boot (no change in speed)</li><li>Clean boot (no change in speed)</li><li>Flush DNS</li><li>Update network adaptors/drivers, restart</li><li>Uninstall network adaptors/drivers, restart and then reinstall*</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still I get under 40meg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*The only caveat to this is that when I uninstall the network adaptors I see them disappear from my Device Manager. When&nbsp;I restart but
<u>before</u> I reinstall, I notice they appear again in my Device Manager. Maybe I have not properly uninstalled them in advance of fresh install. Not sure if this is a factor though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further advice you can offer would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sean.</p>

            <p>Sean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Which antivirus is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would suggest you to uninstall the antivirus and check.</p>
<p><em>Note: Make sure you re-install the antivirus once done with the troubleshooting.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows automatically tries to install the drivers when it detects the new hardware on the computer. Since you have uninstalled the drivers and restarted the computer, Windows will delete the drivers before the restart but as soon as it restarts it finds
 the Network adapters with no drivers. It installs the built-in drivers and also checks for the new driver updates via Windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please visit the computer manufacturer website and download the latest BIOS update as well as the Chipset drivers (motherboard) to check if the issue persists.</p>
