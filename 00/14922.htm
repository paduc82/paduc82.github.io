    <title>Internet Explorer not displayed in Windows 10 TP 10041 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet Explorer not displayed in Windows 10 TP 10041</h2>
                    <p>This is what happened:</p>
<p>I had the slow build immediately prior to 10041.</p>
<p>I switched to fast and was upgraded to 10041.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the first unusual thing happened:</p>
<p>Because this is a dual-boot computer, I have always had three boot options since entering the tech preview program:</p>
<p>WIN 8</p>
<p>WIN 10</p>
<p>RESTORE EARLIER WINDOWS.</p>
<p>As soon as I had upgraded to 10041, the third option disappeared.&nbsp; This should have warned me, but I thought nothing of it.&nbsp; That was about a week ago.</p>
<p>Today, I was notified of an unsuccessful upgrade attempt to 10049.&nbsp; I was about to sign on to the internet and noticed that my quicklaunch IE icon was missing.&nbsp; I then tried to search for IE on the Start Menu.&nbsp; That was unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried a directory search, including hidden files, and found my way to iexplore.exe.&nbsp; When I tried to launch it, I immediately got the response "this app won't run on your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed firefox using a memory stick transferring the file from another computer.&nbsp; It installed and worked with no problem.&nbsp; I went to Microsoft.com and tried to download IE 10 from there.&nbsp; It refused to do so, saying that I had to have Windows
 on my machine to download IE.&nbsp; Apparently, it searched for something in the system it couldn't find.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, I couldn't get to IE that way, not am I confident that it would install correctly as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried running Windows Update again to see if 10049 would install this time.&nbsp; Well, it almost did.&nbsp; I got all the way to setting up Settings (30% on the meter) then simply hung for five hours.&nbsp; I powered off, restarted, and it unwound the installation
 back to 10041, and the same IE problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am.&nbsp; No IE, and no way to restore to an earlier version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not a huge problem.&nbsp; I can simply reinstall Win 8 from a disk, but before I go through all the hassle, it would be nice to see if the problem could be solved in place.&nbsp; What if something like this happened to a user after the product goes into general
 release?&nbsp; So before I reinstall from scratch, I would be open to trying a few suggestions.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Class not registered error</h2>
                    
<p>When trying to save as a documen (doc1.docx) in the My Documents - folder fails with a 'class not registered' error. There is no additional information in the popup nor in the event list. The problem does not occur when saving the file in, let's say, c:\temp.</p>
<p>I am using a Windows 7 operating system and tried to uninstall-reinstall the Office software several times. The problem does not disappear after the fresh install. My ultimate step is to format and reinstall Windows 7 ... but I'll hope I will get an answer
 here.</p>
<p>thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>I tried using another account but that didn't solve the problem.&nbsp;Finally&nbsp;we've installed Windows 7 from scratch followed by a new installation of Word. Afterwards we could not reproduce the problem. Probably it wasn't a Word-specific problem but a corrupted
 Windows 7 ...</p>

<h2>            Graphics acceleration buggy in Autodesk software on current build</h2>
                    <p>I am running build 14393.726 and am trying to run Autodesk Inventor 2017, but it seems that the hardware acceleration is completely broken. Look at the screenshot and notice how the right toolbar and box are just gray rectangles. Those should be regular
 buttons. If I go into the options and toggle between any of the settings, the icons are fixed and I can use them. However, the actual drawing/rendering of the model to the display does not seem to be using hardware acceleration no matter what option I pick.
 Autodesk claims this is not an issue on their end.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mobile - How to access messaging history stored on OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmdeq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile - How to access messaging history stored on OneDrive after transition to non-Windows 10 Mobile device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Now that Microsoft has chosen to eliminate support and security updates for Windows Mobile, is there any chance OneDrive will make a gracious change to permit access to messaging backups? My text messages, group text messages, and their associated attachments
 are apparently all backed up on my OneDrive account because I configured the phone to do that, but except for restoring them to a Windows Phone, there is no user interface for accessing these. There used to be a backdoor to go to "Messaging History" and alter
 the URL, but I think that backdoor has been closed or I cannot find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As one of the Lumia 950XL diehards, I'm unhappily contemplating my transition to a non-Windows mobile device, and would like Microsoft to create a UI on OneDrive (or some other system) to not lose these.</p>

            To be clear, I'm not asking Microsoft to figure out how to make these backups be restorable to a non-Windows smart phone, I would just like to be able to browse the folders including the messages and attachments, or download the XML, or have everything
 packaged up in a ZIP file.

    <title>Combo box not working in Form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dittmaytoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combo box not working in Form</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I've inherited an Access form (that I believe was created using 2003), that tracks people who are interested in our program. I've made some changes to the form, namely adding new combo boxes (Table/query, value, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's where the trouble begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Though the Combo Box exists in the form, I am unable to select an option from the dropdown menu on the Form View.</p>
<p>- I then discovered that all the new fields I have created (five in total) are not showing up in the field list, and despite numerous attempts to add them I haven't successfully done so yet.</p>
<p>- I tried to update the control source to see if that would work. However, I'm unable to add the Control Source needed for each field because of the issue above (I think), and keep receiving the error "Control Source Does Not Exist" when I try to add one
 through the Expression Builder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched several Access help forums for an answer, but it seems like everything I have tried has not fixed the issue. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>--</p>

            <p>A form has a Record Source property that can be set to a table/query name or an SQL statement like: SELECT FieldA, FieldB, FieldC, ... FROM [YourTableName].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forms have controls such as Text Boxes, Combo Boxes, Check Boxes, etc that can be bound to fields in the form's Record Source. If the field isn't in the Record Source, it can't be bound to the control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the field you are looking for is not in the drop down of the Control Source property then you must change the Record Source property of the form to include the field.</p>

            <p>Tried what you're explaining, Record Source is correct. However, went I went to Query Builder and tried to locate the fields I had created to include them, they are not there. As I said, they are present on the Form that I edited when in View, Design, or
 Layout, just not showing up in anything else. Using the Build function doesn't help either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be an issue stemming from the form's creation with a legacy Access product and going to 2013?</p>

</p><p>Check the table where you added the new fields. Are they in there? Perhaps you added them to the wrong table. If they are in the table you should be able to add them in the query builder view. That should make them show up in the field list as soon as you
 add them to the query.</p>

            Always start by adding fields to tables. You can then modify Record Sources of forms and reports to include the new fields.

    <title>Missing arrows on scroll bar in MS PowerPoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> map1033  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing arrows on scroll bar in MS PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased MS Office Professional Plus 2016 on my Surface Pro 4. All forums that I have found so far only discuss scroll bar issues with Word and Excel. In PowerPoint, the single and double arrows (up and down) are missing. It's not a huge issue,
 but rather inconvenient at times. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already confirmed that the drivers are up-to-date. I've included an image herein&nbsp;as to&nbsp;what I see within PPT. Is anyone aware of a resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Using MS Word 2016, how can I edit MS Word 2003 files created using - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m. j. howes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using MS Word 2016, how can I edit MS Word 2003 files created using the Word 2003 &#34;forms toolkit&#34; &#40;either locked or unlocked via Word 2003&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to a new system and installed MS Office 2016. When in MS Word 2016, how do you edit MS Word 2003 files that were created using the "forms toolkit" in Word 2003?</p>
<p>(a) I am unable to unlock the form fields in order to edit these files. Form fields&nbsp;had been formerly&nbsp;locked via MS Word 2003. How do I&nbsp;unlock these fields using Word 2016?</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Also, in the case of forms which I have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
unlocked</span> using Word 2003, I&nbsp;am unable to edit the information contained within the&nbsp;forms fields using Word 2016. I can delete it, but cannot alter it. Information outside the form fields can be edited just fine. How can I edit the information within
 these form fields?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other MS Word 2003&nbsp;files can be opened and edited in Word 2016&nbsp;just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for some guidance. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Since you're dealing with Forms protection (and not the several other kinds of protection that are available), the simplest way is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to File &gt; Options and choose Quick Access Toolbar in the left-hand column.</li><li>Set the "Choose commands from" dropdown to "All Commands".</li><li>Click on the Lock command, and click the Add button in the center of the dialog.</li><li>Use the Lock button on the Quick Access Toolbar to toggle the forms protection on and off.</li></ul>
<p>The alternative is to click the Review tab of the ribbon, and click the Restrict Editing button in the Protect group. That opens a pane in which you can stop and start protection, or choose a different type of protection (in documents that don't use form
 fields).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A form document must be protected for forms in order to make the content of the fields editable. It must be unprotected in order to make the fields' Properties dialogs available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all versions of Word from 2007 onward, there is a Developer tab that's hidden by default. If you need to add fields to the form, first go to File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon and put a check mark next to Developer in the right-hand column. Click OK, then
 go to the Developer tab. The form fields (now called "Legacy Form Fields") are in a dropdown menu from the Legacy Tools button in the Controls group (the one that looks like a black toolbox).</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Stefan, I'm an independent advisor trying to help. 
<br />
<br />You tried to execute it from different browsers and clean the cookies: they are small files that websites transfer to your computer to store information about your preferences, however, some may interfere with operability. I add an article related to the mail merge, indicating step by step the configuration of this process.
<br />

<br />
<br />If you follow the steps of the previous link, and the process is successfully concluded, but the problem persists, we can rule out the operation of the tool, through a repair, more details here:

<br />It is a pleasure to help you, I hope that the shared information will be useful to solve your problem.

<br />Have a good day

<br />
<br />Are you using Outlook desktop software? You cannot mail merge to Outlook on the web - you need to set up the account in Outlook desktop. 
<br />
<br />(Outlook on the web doesnt have an Outbox - mail goes into Drafts and is sent.)

<h2>            &#35;EXT&#35; users</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I too am interested about these #EXT# users. We have some showing up as well and not knowing who asked these users in, or what they are sharing, is a concern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hear that SharePoint and OneDrive are two of the Office 365 modules that can create #EXT# users. What about Skype for Business, or other 365 modules that are out there? I would like to get a handle on where these external users come from so I can address
 security concerns appropriately. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings up another question. It sounds like default sharing permissions are quite open. Are there permission settings for every module, or is it a global setting? If its both, can a global setting lock it down and then use individual module settings
 to allow for exceptions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

            <p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check the Sharing history in <strong>Portal &gt; OneDrive &gt; Site settings &gt; Access requests and invitations
</strong>to check Access Request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you can disable end user sharing in <strong>Site Settings &gt; Site permissions &gt; Access Request Settings
</strong>then untick <strong>Allow members to share the site and individual files and folders</strong>. If you just untick the second one, all the access request need to go through Admin.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39dd8849-65b3-468f-a204-a53e4f8d98c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39dd8849-65b3-468f-a204-a53e4f8d98c8" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, you can turn on Start recording user and admin activities through the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Go to portal.office.com and sign in with an admin account.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Security &amp; Compliance</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Go to <strong>Reports &gt; View reports</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d049a13-2fb3-485a-a1ae-1ffd25d6220c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d049a13-2fb3-485a-a1ae-1ffd25d6220c" /></a></p>
<p>4. Click <strong>Office 365 audit log report</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38a3474f-4b46-4b53-9fd9-5ac398503e3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38a3474f-4b46-4b53-9fd9-5ac398503e3c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Click <strong>Start recording user and admin activities</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed38a165-068d-45b7-9beb-b3b2690dc9c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed38a165-068d-45b7-9beb-b3b2690dc9c2" /></a></p>
<p>6. Tick the contents in <strong>Sharing and access request activities.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d121b491-dde0-4e7b-b76d-21f2ae4883aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d121b491-dde0-4e7b-b76d-21f2ae4883aa" /></a></p>
Then you can check who granted the request of an external user.

<h2>            2013 Word Calendar Wizard</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to find the "calendar wizard" in Word 2013 which I have used for over 15 or so years. I am looking to create calendars at will....either by month, three months or whatever given time I need as they were available for as long as I had to create
 calendars - and not dictated calendar versions. Please help. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition I have the same issue as already posted by someone where the months from the 2003 word calendar wizard version opened in word 2013 are overlaid on top of each other. I will try the suggestion.....there has not been a reply from the user at this
 time. <br />

            <p>There is no calendar wizard, or any kind of wizard, in Word 2013. Microsoft abandoned the wizard concept after Office 2003. In truth, they were only templates with macro code that many independent developers could create.</p>

<h2>            Change account back to a Microsoft account from a standard one</h2>
                    I changed my account type to a standard account from the Microsoft account that I have been using all along on the Technical Preview. I did this to try and get back the choice of receive preview builds on the fast ring. For some reason my preview builds
 are stuck on slow ring. I want to change my account back to a Microsoft account but can not do it. I don't want to add a Microsoft account I want to change my existing standard account back to the Microsoft account that I have been using all along.

    <title>Excel date format from MS Project export - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisstevans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel date format from MS Project export</h2>
                    <p>Howdy, all!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using <strong>MS Office Professional Plus 2013</strong> and <strong>MS Project Standard 2013</strong>. I often export data from Project into Excel using Project's built-in wizard, but have found that the date data contained in some of the Excel columns
 from the export are in an un-useful format, e.g. "September 8, 2017 12:00 AM". I have tried countless methods of re-formatting the date columns in Excel to something more useful like "9/8/17", but none of the re-formatting ever takes. The files &amp; sheets are
 not write protected in any way, nor are there any other sort of protections or passwords in place. Date formats in the source Project files is set to the form of "m/d/y".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insights, thoughts, help, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Chris,</p>
<p>Unfortunately exporting dates from Project to Excel has always been an issue because all data is exported as text. This means that dates in text form need to be reformatted with a formula (e.g. DateValue) or some VBA once the data is in Excel. That's one
 reason I always use VBA to export data and never the wizard. Export using VBA is much more flexible as it can manipulate the data and format it exactly like the user needs/wants (e.g. custom Excel report format).</p>

            <p>So when that happens it usually is because of the cell signal (even though it might appear to be strong). See if you can try it in an area where your signal is strong AND you have a Wi-Fi signal. In conjunction with both it will generally work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that you are always in in a Wi-Fi area when you use the phone but you are just testing to see if it finds it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just took out a device I have not used in over a year. I inserted my SIM and tried to Find my Phone and it could not find it. I did have a cell signal so I had the Find my Phone program RING my phone. It took a few seconds but all of a sudden my phone
 was ringing and it showed on the Map. Give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that in some countries this feature does not wok,</p>

<h2>            OneNote Quick Access Toolbar Automatically Resets</h2>
                    <p>I just got OneNote 2010 and have been trying to customize the quick access toolbar.&nbsp; When I right click the icon I want and add it to the toolbar, it adds it but then when I exit out of the program and go back in, the toolbar goes back to the default icons.&nbsp;
 If I go to the quick access toolbar customize page and add icons from the list, it does not add them and the default icons remain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to I keep added icons on the quick access toolbar without it going back to default?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Found a workaround<br />
<br />
Change the Registry value that controls customization roaming. <br />
To do that, set the following value:
<p>Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Toolbars<br />
Value: CustomUIRoaming<br />
Type: DWORD<br />
Data: 1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to add the key and Dword value to the registry.&nbsp; Better be sure you know what you are doing first.</p>

                    <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
I'm am trying to open Access 2013 so that I can customize my webapp, however everytime I try to open it, Access comes up with the following error:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sorry, but Access has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Access will need to be closed as a result.</p>
<p>Would you like to repair now?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The options are 'Repair Now.' 'Help.' and 'Close.' I've tried repairing and closing it but it automatically shuts down and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to fix this?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Also, I recently updated my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does this error occur when loading up the Access program, without actually opening a web app or accdb file ? &nbsp;have you tried doing a Compact and Repair Database function after opening one of these files ? &nbsp;I've never created a web app before, but I use Access
 2013 to develop a billing software in a accdb file, and sometimes run into errors that I have a hard time finding answers for. &nbsp;I am considering upgrading my Win7 to Win10, &nbsp;(and possibly upgrading my Access 2013 to Access 2016, when released), but after reading
 your original post, I am re-thinking that idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the errors that I sometimes see, are not accompanied by instructions on how to fix the error, which is a little frustrating, since Access has been around for quite awhile, and many companies supposedly use it for their front-end, like
 what I am striving to eventually see happen once this project of mine is put into production.<br />
</p>
<p>I have never seen that specific error before, but since you're coming up with it, most likely, someone else has seen it also. &nbsp; I have noticed that answers can sometimes be found on stackoverflow.com, or bytes.com. &nbsp;These are sites by programmers for programmers.
 &nbsp;They are somewhat strict on not being too "wordy" and to the point.</p>

<h3> davidgibsoncnd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using CONCATENATE formula as LOOKUP value un VLOOKUP formula. Works if number typed in but CONCATENATE formula resulting in same number gives error</h2>
                    <p>I am using Excel to manipulate and combine data from several sources into an upload sheet for a database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a common reference number attached to all my sources that allows me to reference each of them and target data from that source using VLOOKUP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that the reference number I am using is created by combining a date reference (i.e.) 20150305 with an integer in sequence (i.e.) 0001,0002,0003, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two are combined using CONCATENATE in a cell to achieve a sequenced reference number 201503050001,&nbsp;201503050002,&nbsp;201503050003</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a VLOOKUP referencing the cell that contains the CONCATENATE formula I get an error "NA#".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I delete the CONCATENATE formula and manually type in the exact same number 201503050001 then the VLOOKUP returns the desired value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can one not use a cell containing a formula to reference the Column_Number_Index value in VLOOKUP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>

<h2>            Block users of a subdomain from contacting other users</h2>
                    
<p>We currently have SFB online and have brought up our primary domain (domain.edu) and our student subdomain (student.domain.edu) &nbsp;The problem is students can freely contact staff and faculty without having to first send an invitation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to change the contact rules for a single subdomain on the same tenant? &nbsp;I would like to be able to deploy these changes system wide so students on the sub cannot contact staff/faculty without the staff adding them as a contact first.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could create one if you don't mind a bit of dabbling with VBA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Waring: I'm not familiar with textjoin() but wrote this code based on the description. Not extensively tested.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open a blank workbook</p>
<p>2. Press ALT+F11 to open the VBA editor</p>
<p>3. In the Project window on the left, right-click on the workbook name and choose Insert -&gt;Module</p>
<p>4. Paste this code in the resultant window</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Option Explicit<br />
Function TEXTJOIN(delimiter As String, ignore_empty As String, ParamArray textn() As Variant) As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim i As Long<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For i = LBound(textn) To UBound(textn) - 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Len(textn(i)) = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Not ignore_empty = True Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TEXTJOIN = TEXTJOIN &amp; textn(i) &amp; delimiter<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TEXTJOIN = TEXTJOIN &amp; textn(i) &amp; delimiter<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; TEXTJOIN = TEXTJOIN &amp; textn(UBound(textn))<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Save the workbook as an add-in type (.xlam)</p>
<p>6. Load the add-in into Excel (File -&gt;Options -&gt;Addins)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usage is the same as the real textjoin function except that text1 is also optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. TEXTJOIN(delimiter, ignore_empty, text1, text2, ...., etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Murray</p>

<h2>            No Internet Connection notification on Android</h2>
                    <p>I am running the Microsoft Outlook app on my Galaxy S5, it was all working fine until a few days ago now I keep getting a notification on the Outlook screen " No Internet Connection" but have full wirelss coverage. Everything else seems to work fine and
 I&nbsp;can send/receive emails on other devices &amp;&nbsp;apps.&nbsp;I just can't send&nbsp;receive any emails through Outlook at all due to No Internet connection which is frustrating. Any ideas as to why this is happening?</p>
<p>Cheers Rob</p>
