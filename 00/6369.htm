<h2>            Troubleshooting spam and junk mail folder efficiency</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Hotmail and now Outlook for many years and now have a very large list of spam emails and domains that I have set up to automatically go to the Junk Mail folder.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some good emails end up organically going into the Junk Mail
 folder as well, so daily, I have to sort through a lot of junk emails looking for anything that shouldn't be there.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping there is a way to use a different folder (other than Junk Mail) where I can send all these spam emails and domains in my list to.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, let's say I get a spam email from some mortgage site.&nbsp; I never want to see an email from that sender again so I add the email/domain to my spam filter list and it automatically goes to the Junk Mail folder in the future.&nbsp; However I still have
 to spend time in the Junk Mail folder sorting through all these spam mortgage emails looking for good emails that accidentally made it there.&nbsp; That seems to kind of defeat the purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, I would like to have everything on my spam list go to another folder, maybe even the Deleted Items folder. I have no need to see anything in my spam list, ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;This way only a few emails will be picked up organically by the Junk Mail filter and
 sent to the Junk Mail folder.&nbsp; It will be easy to scan it quickly and look for good emails that accidentally made it there.&nbsp; &nbsp;If necessary, I can just routinely empty the folder where all my spam list emails go without having to even open it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this issue, or have some suggestions/workarounds on how to get closer to solving my issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>To
 help us identify the cause of the issue and then find the proper resolution for it,
</span></span>I'd like to know more about this concern. To get started I would like to ask if what are those good emails that you're referring to? Is it an email coming from the domain that you've blocked? Also, have you set any rules on your Outlook.com? For
 more information regarding Inbox rules, you may check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you heard of the Spam Fighters program? If you're subscribed to this program Microsoft will send you copy of a message that was sent you and ask you to vote on whether it is a spam. Microsoft will compare your votes and will help improve the Junk mail

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook filter makes decisions as to what is spam or not.&nbsp; It send those "spam" emails automatically to the Junk Mail folder.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, some of those emails it picks up are not spam and shouldn't be there.&nbsp; Perhaps there are words or phrases (like "free")
 in the email that triggers Outlook into thinking they are spam.&nbsp; So I may have 100 emails in my Junk Email folder, and two that are not spam or junk and shouldn't be there.&nbsp; So daily I have to go through the Junk Email folder looking for emails that Outlook
 placed there that should not be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blocking the emails still results in them being sent to the Junk Email folder.&nbsp; I can't change the default folder for Blocked emails (like to the "Deleted Items" folder), so the Junk email folder just keeps getting filled up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experimented with the Inbox Rules again.&nbsp; I can create a rule that will send the selected spam email to a different folder such as "Deleted Items".&nbsp; The problem is that while it is easy to apply the Rule, it is not easy to edit it to just the domain.&nbsp;
 Right now I can create a Rule, click on the spam email and apply the Rule.&nbsp; But the Rule uses the entire email and I can't easily edit it to just use the domain only (which seems strange since it is easy to do with Blocked Emails).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a ton of emails from the same domains but with different sender names.&nbsp; For example I will get a spam email from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I will apply the rule to it, but the next email will be from bbbb.mortgage.com. I think they are random email generated
 names.&nbsp; &nbsp;So unless I can block all emails from mortgage.com, I will continue getting spam email from them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround I have found is to go into my Blocked Email list and edit the email there to domain only, and then copy and paste it into my Rules list.&nbsp; That works but unfortunately I have 100's (maybe 1,000's) of spam email addresses I would need to
 do that for.&nbsp; It is inefficient and would take days or weeks to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that makes sense, but if not, please ask for further clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>What you ask won't work.</p>
<p>Microsoft processes inbound emails by classifying them as spam or good. Spam goes straight to your Junk Email folder and all processing for that email stops. You will not be able to setup your own rules to do otherwise.</p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; Do you know if there is a way to turn off spam filtering altogether?&nbsp; I am thinking I can experiment by just using blocking to send spam to the Junk Mail folder, and not have to worry about Outlook sending good emails there.

<p>Well, that is disappointing.&nbsp; The Junk Mail filter is not foolproof, so one would think Microsoft would allow users enough control to make it work for them.&nbsp; I understand they want to suppress options so everyone will have to pay, and if they had a monopoly
 on email services, they could do it.&nbsp; But they don't have a monopoly and it just drives consumers to other free services like Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all the responses clarifying the situation for me.&nbsp; It was frustrating but at least I now understand the root of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I've seen that when sharing documents between Word v.X, Word 2004 and Word 2011 (I never bought Word 2008, so I cannot say). Somehow the document's&nbsp;language attributes transfer over, but when you spell check you get an immediate "The spelling check is
 complete" message, even though you know Word should question a few terms.
<div><br />
<div>In my experience, as of Word 2004, language has not properly transferred between versions.&nbsp;I suspect that's because v.X considered "<i>(no proofing)"</i>&nbsp;as a language, at the top of the language choices, whereas later versions did away with that in favor
 of a separate language attribute controlled through "Do not check spelling or grammar."</div>
<div><br />
<div>For instance, in Word v.X macros a text would have <i>Language = English</i>&nbsp;<u>or</u>
<i>Language = NoProofing</i>. In later versions, these respectively became&nbsp;<i>English</i>
<i>plus</i>&nbsp;"<i>NoProofing = False"</i>&nbsp;<u>or</u> <i>English plus "NoProofing = True</i>."</div>
<div><br />
<div>The solution I use: Select all text (<i>Command A</i>) and reapply the language through
<i>Tools &gt; Language </i>(you may have to do this every time) or save the document in the newer .docx format.</div>

<p>Hi deNdroN,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I advise you to check your internet connection with your operator or Wi-Fi provider. Once you have access to the internet, please perform a soft reset on your device: type *#7780# on the keypad. The default lock code is12345.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then try setting up your e-mail account again. It may also be a problem with Google's server. So if the issue persists, I advise you to contact Google.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on and feel free to post any other questions you may have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can't log-in to any of google's services then are you able to log-in to Google's mail/services&nbsp;using a computer?</p>
<p>Did you create the Google account via a computer or via the phone?</p>
<p>Before resetting the phone you could try using all captials in the username or all lowercase; sometimes Google&nbsp;may add the first letter of a username/password as uppercase. Also with Google you log-in using&nbsp;an email address (usually Google email address)&nbsp;rather
 than a username so make sure you're doing that, another thing to check is if there are any letter I or 1 or 0 or&nbsp;O in the username/password &amp; to make sure you're not confusing them.</p>

<p>Very strange, my next suggestion would've been to log out of Google on the computer then try to log-in via the phone but I successfully logged in on both computer &amp; phone &amp; was logged in on both&nbsp;at the same time. If you visit Google via your

<p>Further to my reply I tested &amp;&nbsp;I've also successfully set up my Google email on my phone so I can only suggest that you try changing your password &amp; see if you can log-in on your phone.</p>

<h2>            Eliminating dotted line at bottom of the page.</h2>
                    At the bottom of each page I have the name of my book on the left hand corner and the page number on the righthand. But there's also a dotted line under all of those things. I seem to be able to get rid of the text and page number in the footer area but
 not this line. Even when I've gone through the motions to eliminate, the Word program looks as if it's "okay" with the changes, yet the line remains. (It prints out the dotted line as well.) I've spent so much time trying to fix this. I'm at a complete loss
 because nothing in the "format" or "footers" portion of Word is helping. (And even cutting and pasting a 350 page word document into a new file on a new version of Word hasn't helped. I need to get rid of this dotted line before I submit! Ideas? Please?

            I agree with Rich that this sounds like a <span style="font-weight: bold">Paragraph Border</span>, but it could have been applied

<li>Double-click into the <span style="font-weight: bold">Footer</span></li><li>If there's more than one <span style="font-weight: bold">¶</span> use <span style="font-weight: bold">

<br />
See if that removes it. You may have to do the same in each section where the Border was applied.<br />

            Excel 2010 can take advantage of the SUMIFS() function introduced with Excel 2007.<br />
<br />
=SUMIFS(B:B, A:A, "15390415", C:C , "&gt;="&amp;DATE(2012,1,1),&nbsp;C:C , "&lt;"&amp;DATE(2012,2,1))<br />
<br />
You need to determine whether the&nbsp;<i>15390415</i>&nbsp;is a true number or a textual representation of a number. Use&nbsp;<i>15390415</i>&nbsp;for the former and
<i>"15390415"</i> for the latter.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/sumifs-function-HA010047504.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUMIFS function</a><br />
<br />
If backwards compatibility to Excel 97-2003 is desired then the less efficient SUMPRODUCT() may be used,<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT((B2:B5000)*(A2:A5000="15390415")*(MONTH(C2:C5000)=1)*(YEAR(C2:C5000)=2012))<br />

<h2>            MDB copy or backup problems</h2>
                    I have an application that uses a mdb database. For some reason you cannot copy it. When you do and open it on another computer, or even in another folder, the data is old. It is actually picking up an old copy from somewhere. Even though all other copies
 have been deleted and purged.

            The data is produce by an application that we purchased to keep up with clients we assist with food and utilities. We never had this problem until we went with Windows 7 computers.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>We are not using Access, but the database in the program is an mbd database.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried to backup, copy, rename, change file&nbsp;extensions&nbsp;before moving the data, etc. I will only give me data that is like two weeks old. It does this when I move it to my desktop and will even do this if you try to copy it into another folder on
 the laptop's hard drive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was leaving the laptop at work and bringing the database home to use on my desktop but I can no longer do that. I need a reliable backup more than I need to copy and move the data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried everything I know. It did this once before and the writer of the application told me to rename the original file and move it and I lost weeks of work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope someone can help.</div>

            I do have Access 2007 but I don't know if it would corrupt the file if I tried to open it with it. Is there some kind of tutorial or something out there that might help? I feel it is a Windows 7 security issue since I was not have this problem on any XP
 machine. I have tried altering the folder's security. I even went into the registry and deleted the keys on the VirtualStore. But none of that has helped.&nbsp;

            <p>Well, since the copy is already questionable, I'd suggest making a copy and opening the
<em>copy</em> in Access2007. Press F11 to display the navigation pane, select Tables. Do the tablenames have a little blue arrow to the left? If so, they're linked. If they are, hover the mouse over one of the table names. It should display the path to wherever
 the copy <strong>thinks</strong> the data should be.</p>
<p>I agree, though, that you really need to talk to the vendor of this application. They may well have some sneaky code that we're not going to be able to figure out from this distance!</p>
<p>I'm pretty certain it's not a security issue; if it were, then you'ld not be able to open it at all, or get error messages. Security won't just silently change the contents of your database!</p>

            Thanks, there are no links. It carried over the tables, the forms, the queries, but did not carry over the reports. I don't know if this thing was written with Access or VB. I have tried to get the vendor to let me know what is going on but they don't
 know either. They tell me they are working on it. This copy was made last night from the file in the application. The latest data was posted in it on 2/17/2012. Yet what I just opened in Access the latest date is 12/27/2011.

            <p>How are you determining the latest date? In a Query (which might not be sorted chronologically), on a Form (which is almost certainly filtered), in the Table (which will have records in some arbitrary order)? Try sorting the table (in the copy of course)
 in descending date order.</p>
<p>If it's a .mdb file then yes, it's Access, not VB. There might be a program (either an&nbsp; .exe or a .dll) originally written in Visual Basic and using the .mdb as a data store, but the .mdb itself is inherently an Access construct.</p>

            I did sort the table, it is just not copying the original table or it is pointing to a "ghost" table that has been saved somewhere. The problem has to be on the laptop because I have deleted every .mdb with the same name I could find on the desktop and
 then pasted or restored the original back to the desktop from the laptop.&nbsp;

<h2>            Excel Copy Paste - Mouse Button Not working</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I&nbsp;am having trouble with the mouse button in excel when I copy paste. In short when I repeat a 'paste' action by pressing the mouse button, there is no response to actually do a paste. This
 in only an issue with Excel and it is only an issue with the mouse button that is part of the mouse pointer (the mouse in the middle of the keyboard). I will need someone to call me to discuss and so that I can fully explain. My laptop is a Dell Latitude 7450.
 I have already contacted Dell and have downloaded a new mouse driver. This did not solve the issue. However, because it is only happening in Excel and not other apps like Word, I believe this is a MS issue not a Dell issue. My tel number is +61 414 754 377.
 Thanks</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since this issue occurs only in Excel 2013 and not in any other Office 365 or other applications, let us open Excel 2013 in the Safe Mode and check if the issue resolves
 while working in Safe Mode. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To open Excel 2013 in the Safe Mode follow the steps as shown in the following Microsoft Resource article.</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong> - The above article lists steps for all Office 365 applications, however follow the steps to open Excel 2013 in the Safe Mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you are able to copy and paste normally while working in the Excel Safe Mode. If yes, then continue with the Add-Ins troubleshooting steps mentioned in the same article
 above to completely resolve the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            PWA Default Assignment Owner Show all tasks in My Tasks</h2>
                    Is it possible for a nominated person to see all the tasks for the team they lead in order to do the task updates? I thought that I could do this with&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Default
 Assignment Owner but it still doesn't seem to bring in the tasks that are assigned to others in their team. Those others have the lead as the default assignment owner.</span>

</p><p>The person designated as the Assignment Owner for a task is the person who will see the tasks on his/her own Tasks page in PWA.&nbsp; If your example above, if Jack is the Assignment Owner for Peter, Paul, Jane, and John, Jack would see all of their tasks on
 his Tasks page in PWA, and the other four would see NO TASKS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond this, you need to be aware that there are two fields that control this behavior.&nbsp; The first is the Default Assignment Owner field which is set for each resource in the Enterprise Resource Pool.&nbsp; The second is the Assignment Owner field, which is set
 for each task assignment in every Microsoft Project schedule.&nbsp; If a new project is created AFTER the Default Assignment Owner has been set for every resource, the Assignment Owner for every task assignment in that project will be set according to the Default
 Assignment Owner value for each resource in the project.&nbsp; If a project was created BEFORE changing the Default Assignment Owner value for every resource, then the Assignment Owner value for every task assignment will be the name of the assigned resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the latter is the situation you have.&nbsp; To correct this, the PM would need to open the project in question, apply the Resource Usage view, temporarily insert the Assignment Owner column, and change the value to the new assignment owner.&nbsp; The PM
 would need to save and publish the project as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>If your work computer&nbsp;has Outlook (possibly installed as part of Microsoft Office), you can download
<strong><em>Outlook Hotmail Connector</em></strong> from the Microsoft.com website and install it on your work computer prior to going away. This will sync Outlook on your computer with your Outlook.com account, so that whatever change

<h2>            Seeing Hotmail folders on my Lumia 950</h2>
                    I just bought a Lumia 950. When I go into Outlook to see my Hotmail account, I don't see the folders I've created or the emails that are in those folders. I want to be able to file emails into my folders and have access to them from my phone but haven't
 found a way of doing it yet. I am a new user so maybe I'm missing something obvious.

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I'm looking for the "Evaluation of the formula" tool in Excel: mac 2011, which, according to the work of Faiza Moumen Piasco, "Accounting Management with Excel," Eni Editions, 2012, is in the Formula tab&gt; Audit formulas&gt; Evaluation of formulas. It evaluates
 the &nbsp;formulas progressively controlling each element on which it works. This is a much more sophisticated tool that the search history and very useful!</p>
<p>The problem is that the above-mentioned book does not specify the excel version for which it is designed, I think this tool was in the 2007 version from the Microsoft site:</p>

            That's correct, both the Evaluate Formula tool &amp; the Watch Window are components of the Formula Auditing group but only in the Windows versions of Excel. As JE pointed out, they do not exist in the Mac versions.<br />

<p>Hello MikBai,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, if you block devices that aren’t enrolled in MDM for Office, it will not block the laptops your organization you are using. Mobile Device Management for Office 365 can help you secure and manage mobile devices like
 iPhones, iPads, Androids, and Windows Phones used by licensed Office 365 users in your organization.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, if a user’s device isn’t supported by MDM for Office 365, it’s better to disable the ActiveSync so that the user cannot access your organization’s emails on the mobile devices. But it depends on your requirement.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to the request “Is it possible block devices, from enrolling in MDM, unless they are explicitly permitted?” Based on my experience, it is not feasible to block a specific device from enrolling in MDM. However, you can remove
 it remotely. You can see this article for reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/wipe-a-mobile-device-in-office-365-9d727c7d-8b47-4499-bf24-d046b449214c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Wipe a mobile device in Office 365</a>. </p>

    <title>Import an old .pst file without creating a new account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david j. m. park  say:</h3>
<h2>            Import an old .pst file without creating a new account</h2>
                    <p>I had to do a System Recovery and then reinstall Outlook (it's actually 2010)</p>
<p>I had my old .pst files backed up. </p>
<p>My problem is that I had to create a new account in the Account Settings.</p>
<p>This always creates an account in the form emailaddress(n).pst and shows up as a second account on the left hand pane.</p>
<p>This did not create a new .pst file in the Documents Outlook folder.</p>
<p>This is always the active account. Even though the old one is set as the default.</p>
<p>I followed Ben Schorr's advice and copied all the material from the new account to the old one and then Removed the new file account.
</p>
<p>But now I can't send and receive email because there is no E-mail account. I can look at the email in the old file but can't use it.</p>
<p>Even though in the Data Files it is set as the default. It's the only one there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is: How do I create an active E-mail account that uses the old .pst file?</p>

<p>So the question is: How do I create an active E-mail account that uses the old .pst file?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hard to follow this without knowing more of the background - specifically in relation to what Ben recommended for your specific environment in terms of type of email accounts being configured. In future, would suggest adding questions in the original thread
 (i.e. the one where Ben provide the advice you're referring to)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basic question is - what kind of email account are you referring to - IMAP or POP3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's IMAP - you cannot designate an existing PST file to be used for the email folders. That PST file will always get recreated and then sync'd with the server - hence it will contain the same data as the one you originally backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other PST file related to an IMAP account (Outlook Data File) would contain your default contact/calendar folders. Add the old one to your profile, make it the default data file (Account Settings --&gt; Data File tab) and then remove the newly created one
 (assuming you're starting with a fresh Outlook profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a POP3 account you're referring to - then it's just a matter of indicating that you want to use a pre-existing PST file instead of having Outlook create a new one.</p>

            <p>Thanks Karl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using POP3 and this is the problem that occurred. I'm using SpamArrest. They pick up the mail from Comcast, filter it and then forward to me. So I had to use the following settings in setting a new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Account Type: POP3</p>
<p>Incoming mail server: mail.spamarrest.com</p>
<p>Outgoing mail server (SMTP): smtp.comcast.net</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when testing the account settings it connected to the incoming mail, but could not make a connection to the outgoing mail (Comcast). Maybe I'm using the wrong name there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried outgoing settings of: mail.comcast.net and imap.comcast.net. (with the account type POP3). They also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was able to use the option to deliver new messages to the existing Outlook Data File.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I go to Mail in the Control Panel and then Remove the existing Outlook profile and then add a new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I don't want an IMAP account. I want POP3 but I don't know how to change that. When I use POP3 in the settings I can no longer connect to Comcast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is SO difficult!</p>

<p>
</p><p>So to confirm - the original question has been resolved and you now have a new question regarding the settings required to connect to your email - does that sum it up? Would suggest you start one thread per specific question since this no longer has anything
 to do with the original subject of the thread. Much more likely to get more eyes on your question from people who may be familiar with your particular scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - You are going to need to confirm your Comcast settings with them but pretty safe bet that mail.comcast.com and imap.comcast.com are not correct - outbound server for them is smtp.Comcast.com unless it's been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - As for anything to do with SpamArrest - not familiar with config requirements with that in use
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that your original system (pre System Recovery) had Outlook configured using an IMAP email account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What you have to go to Comcast for are the exact settings to configure a POP3 account - the email&nbsp;client makes no difference since all email clients use the exact same settings. Once you get the required information from them - it's up to you to configure
 Outlook correctly.</p>

            <p>Hi Shelly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance you'd be able to share a link to your Sway so I can take a look?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, Sway does not allow you to specify where to place content in the layout.&nbsp; This allows Sway to provide a layout optimized for whatever size screen/device the reader views it on.&nbsp; There are some things you can do to indicate things like section/group
 endings which can affect where content is placed though, but this depends on the layout you have chosen, the size of the content, and the content around it.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Ahhh, I see.&nbsp; Sway will place content next to text like with your second Tweet, if the text is long to run the height of the Tweet.&nbsp; So if you take your Sway as it is and make the window really narrow, it will cause the text before your first Tweet to wrap
 to more lines and you'll get the first Tweet next to the text like you want.&nbsp; Conversely, if you were to make your window wide enough to avoid wrapping the text before the second Tweet, you could probably get that Tweet to display below the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I can see why this might be confusing so I'll talk to our layout people and get their thoughts to see if there's anything to improve here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, to help you get the layout you want, you could do something to make the text before the first Tweet longer (like adding some blank new lines after that text, before the Tweet or maybe even move the "Other Upcoming Live Events" text card contents
 up into the first text card).&nbsp; However, this won't necessarily result in the content looking good on all devices.&nbsp; Let's say you do the blank line trick - you may get it displaying the way you want on your screen, but then if someone views it on a phone, the
 content won't ever be next to each other because it's such a small screen&nbsp;and then there will be a big gap from all the blank lines.&nbsp; Definitely play around with it now that you know the cause, but also consider that Sway takes the content you give it and
 will try to produce a layout optimal for the screen it's shown on and you can't always predict how people will view it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<br />Unfortunately you can not install Office 2016 in versions prior to Mac OS X version 10.10, it is a prerequisite that the operating system is updated For the best experience.
<br />
<br />In the link below you will find more information about the requirements that are required to install Office 2016

<h2>            Inserted PDFs not searchable - OCR problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using OneNote for Mac version 15.13.3 and I don't think the OCR function is working for me. &nbsp;I am trying to use this to take notes at school so not being able to search is a big problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I am doing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will download the file for the class as either PDF, Word or PowerPoint. &nbsp;If it is anything other than PDF, I will "save as" a PDF file (or print to PDF for PowerPoint) then insert PDF Printout to my new page in OneNote. &nbsp;Then I can draw on the document
 (with my iPad) or type on it as needed. &nbsp;But when I try and search for something, it only is returning results for notes that I have typed on the page, but is not seeing any text on the PDFs that I've inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong and/or how do I fix this? &nbsp;It appears to be loading the PDFs as a picture (on my iPad I have to tap 3 times to be able to type on the document itself) but the OCR function is not catching any of the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide because if I can't figure this out I'll have to switch to Notability or another program.</p>

            Even if the pdf file loads as a picture it supposed to catch on text. To test can you try searching for a specific word in pdf. You can also insert a image which contains texts to test if ocr is working. At the same time you can reset onenote on the iPad
 from settings.

            <p>Right, it is supposed to catch the text but it's not. &nbsp;I loaded a picture earlier to test and it didn't catch that either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I reset OneNote and do you think that would help? &nbsp;I am using OneNote to study on my iPad, iMac, and MacBook Pro and nothing is searchable on any machine so I don't think it's iPad specific.</p>

            <p><span>Hey Karl,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I work with the engineers on the OneNote enrichments team and wanted to let you know we’re looking into this issue right now.&nbsp;To understand better, is your notebook stored on OneDrive (personal)&nbsp;or
 OneDrive for Business (work or school)? If you’re on OneDrive for Business, unfortunately we don’t support OCR in the cloud yet for that (but it’s coming soon). If you’re on OneDrive then it should be working, and we’ve indeed verified there is a bug with
 this process and we’re actively trying to get it fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, I do have a workaround you can use on your Mac to get your PDFs into OneNote and have them be searchable.&nbsp;If you install the OneNote clipper (<a href="https://www.onenote.com/clipper/onenote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>),
 you can use that to clip online PDFs to your notebook (the clipper now supports selecting the section that you clip to, as well).&nbsp;Using the clipper to add PDFs to your notebook will result in them</span><span> being printed out in
 your notebook as searchable images.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!<br />
Liz</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the info Liz! &nbsp;I assume I am using OneDrive for business because I am in medical school and sign in to Office 365 using my school email address and my username says (student) after the name of the school. &nbsp;So hopefully OCR comes to OneDrive for
 business soon because when it comes time to study for boards, being able to search will be vital.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip on clipping, some of files online are Word documents so I'll still have to insert those the old way but I'll try clipping the PDF files and see how that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Well turns out the web clipper is not as useful as I had hoped. &nbsp;The problem is that I need to be able to load the notes, then highlight them, or draw on them, or whatever. &nbsp;But when I clip the web page it &nbsp;just loads the PDF as a file attachment and a link.
 &nbsp;I'll try and attach two screenshots to show the difference between how I use it and how the web clip loaded. &nbsp;The top one is what happened when I clipped the web page, the bottom one is when I inserted a PDF Printout. &nbsp;Problem with the bottom one is that
 I cannot search the text of the PDF, I can only search the notes that I type on the side.</p>

Arne,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed in one of your screen shots the notebook is in the process of syncing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, Onenote wants to sync all content before it gives the "text from picture option".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure your updated notebook is fully synced with Onedrive before trying to use this option.</p>

            nobody knows the release dates for new firmware so you will just have to keep checking<br />
you can try restore to original settings with a factory reset<br />
type in *#7780# security code is 12345

<h2>            Can I print only the 1st page of multiple pages in OneNote</h2>
                    I have a "page" that prints 4 pages, three of which are blank.&nbsp; How do I print only the one I want.&nbsp; Most print options in other programs give multiple page, selection, etc options to print (in my case, for instance, I would want to print page 1 -1)

<p>I assume you talk about <strong>OneNote for Windows 10</strong>, which indeed surprisingly (annoyingly) has no page range option.</p>
<p><strong>OneNote 2016</strong> (I'd like to say: naturally) has this in its Print dialog.</p>

<h2>            Open as a copy command has disappeared</h2>
                    What has happened to the "Open as a copy" command in Word 2016 (Microsoft Office 365)?&nbsp; I can no longer see the commands that were there last week.

<p>Open as Copy is certainly available here, in the classic Open dialog box (File | Open | Browse) in Word 2016 (Office Professional Plus 2016, version 1710, build 8625.2139). Have you made sure to update Office?</p>

<p>Hi Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the "Open as a copy" command, do you go to Word&gt;File&gt;Open&gt;browse to choose a document&gt;expand the

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Besides, please help to confirm the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Office version. Go to File&gt;Account&gt; capture a full screenshot of <span style="font-weight: bold">
Product Information</span>.</p>
<p>2.Does the issue happen to a specific document or all documents?</p>
<p>3.Where do you store the documents? In local computer or online location?</p>
<p>4.What did you do before the change happens? Update Office or your operating system?</p>
