<h2>            Groove Music and Streaming from OneDrive not working. &#34;Sorry, this item is no longer available.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently ripped one of my CDs to my OneDrive Music folder. I am unable to play these files using Groove either on my phone (Groove for Android), iPad (Groove for iPad) or in my web browser on my PC (Internet Explorer of Chrome).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can download the file from my OneDrive and play it normally on my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted my Music folder on OneDrive and recreated it with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously I had ripped the CD using Window Media Audio (.wma). As a test, I re-ripped a track off of the CD using MP3 &nbsp;and I was able to play that in my Web Browser though I am still having trouble with my phone and iPad (it seems it is not syncing the
 changes yet, I will try again later on those items) **edit** I was able to successfully play the MP3 file from my OneDrive on my phone. I still cannot play the WMA files, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions why WMA might not be working while MP3 does?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi WMA files are very large files (or can be) so you don't want to stream music that is 174MB if you have a small data limit, for this to work it is only workable if you synchronize your OneDrive folder via file explorer. Go to OneDrive.com and download
 the app. Then sync your music folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When ripping you need to change the audio quality so then you could play it on your phone/tablet.
</p>

Hope that helps 😊</p>

There is so much wrong with this post, I had to respond. 



First, the size of a file is irrelevant when streaming. THAT is the primary reason for streaming! Connection speed is your only concern. You can stream gigabytes of data, and often do with video, the total size of the file is purposefully irrelevant. 



Second, If I synchronize my OneDrive folder to the device I want to play my music on, WHY DO I NEED GROOVE? I can simply use the device's media player. The purpose of Groove is to stream my music from the cloud. 



Third, you rip your music how you want. I prefer to be able to listen to it, not be insulted by the quality of it. My entire library is ripped at the highest quality WMA. Again, streaming is NOT affected by the size of the file. 



Last,  "Sorry, this item is no longer available." implies the song is, well, NO LONGER AVAILABLE. Not that it is too large to play. 



Thanks for playing our guessing game. Is there ANYONE from MICROSOFT who can answer this question? I truly a

            <p>... that's kind of mean...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I was combining the total of 3 songs of that quality that equal that amount of Megabytes. (WAV files VS WMA. ) So my file sizes that are ripped are about 30MB's or higher. (including how long the song is.) And it seams that WAV files only are playable
 if you have a PC that has the OneDrive app connected to file explorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5c4e03d-9bc4-41c7-9809-ff5b9fceb670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5c4e03d-9bc4-41c7-9809-ff5b9fceb670" /></a></p>
<p>Now I only have 3 songs that have this issue and they are all WAV files. and can only be played if the onedrive folder is synced (which means that your Music folder would need to be synced)</p>
<p>Now all of my WMA files and Mp3 files are playable streaming on groove music. (WMA files have to buffer more though--30MB WMA VS 8.5MB Mp3)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also WMA files are around 30MB's also in size. (normally less-- but I do rip VIa Zune on my windows 7 PC so that could cause the major file sizes.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes you can also just use Windows Media Player for syncing your music folder but you would have to go through file explorer every time to play them.</p>
<p>Sorry for trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At OP: have you attempted the groove music reset under settings? it could solve the issue when it re add's all the music.</p>

<p>1) file size can be a factor...&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) if your file sizes are only 6-8MB's then it's not the highest quality under the WMA format.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A .WAV file is uncompressed which is why it is so large, and why digital music was impossible before good compression techniques were developed like... .MP3, .MP4, .WMA, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A normal length song, (not an hour of house or techno,) should only be about 6-8 Mb at 192kb sampling. If you are sampling at a higher bit rate, good for you, but you are wasting space on everyone's hard drive. If you have 30MB .WMA files, then your song
 is very long, your bit rate is too high, your compression is too low, or you simply don't have a good ripping program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>REGARDLESS! The size of a file has nothing to do with how it streams, and I'm not going to try to explain this to you anymore. Streaming, by definition, sends down one to n packets at a time depending on the transporting protocol and other factors, NOT the
 whole file. You buffer, because the stream is slower than the song playing, and this is totally dependent on your connection speed and bandwidth. It has NOTHING to do with the total file size. You can stream an unlimited sized file (like a live feed) just
 fine. We do it all day long. Podcast anyone?</p>

 through media player perfectly. It does NOT play through Groove, because this brain dead application says&nbsp;"Sorry, this item is no longer available." which is clearly incorrect. I am asking for someone from MICROSOFT to chime in and explain this ridiculous
 erroneous error message.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word crashes when using equations</h2>
                    <p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I've had many issues with Microsoft Word 2016 Mac. I have the newest version 16.15. Word crashes when I insert a math equation, and specifically when a type a symbol such as theta, alpha etc. When trying to open Word again it keeps saying "Word
 is not responding". I then have to restart my computer in order to open Word. Sometimes, if I wait 2-3 minutes Word succeeds in opening after the crash - but this is also annoying..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help with this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,

<br />A workaround, if Word is otherwise working for you, would be to get MathType's free trial. The old Equation Editor in Word was based on an abbreviated version of the commercial product MathType.
<br /><a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the free 30-day trial. If you let the trial lapse, you will be left with the equivalent of the old Equation Editor.

<p><span>INSTALL UPDATES</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I think the first troubleshooting step to take is:
<strong>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</strong>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes unless you also update your add-ins to the latest update. Install updates for these programs if you have them.

<p>Hi <strong>Elizabeth</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’d like to know more about your concern. Please answer these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Outlook are you using? Is it the <strong>Outlook.com</strong> or the <strong>
Outlook desktop application</strong>?</li><li>If it’s the Outlook desktop app, which version of it are you using? See this:
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What version of Outlook do I have?</a></strong></li><li>Are you getting an <strong>error message</strong> when trying to copy and paste emails in to the BCC box?</li><li>Does the issue occur using a <strong>different account</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, here are some of the initial troubleshooting steps that you can try depending on the Outlook version that you’re using:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it’s <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outlook.com</span></strong>. I’d suggest that you
<strong>use another web browser</strong>&nbsp;and try it from there. Then, you may clear the browsing history, cache and cookies of your browser. Refer to this article for the instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10607/microsoft-edge-view-delete-browser-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here"><strong>View and delete browser history in Microsoft Edge</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17438/windows-internet-explorer-view-delete-browsing-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here"><strong>View and delete your browsing history in Internet Explorer</strong></a></li></ul>
<p>Note: If you're using a different browser aside from the ones that were mentioned above, you may reach out to their support team for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it’s the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outlook desktop app</span></strong>. I’d recommend that you run an
<strong><span>Office repair</span></strong>. This is usually being performed if an app isn’t working accordingly as it should be. See this:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Blank screen but system is still responding externally - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blank screen but system is still responding externally</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Dell Inspiron and I decided to put the Insider updates on it as I had been running them on my previous laptop, mostly without any problems.&nbsp; This issue could be the machine but I suspect it isn't.&nbsp; Quite randomly I come to the laptop to find
 that it will not respond to keyboard or mouse however from my other laptop I can ping it and also get a directory listing so networking is still operational.&nbsp; At the same time I know from the logs on one of my apps that it has stopped running applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a difficult thing to diagnose as the only recovery is to force power it off - pressing the power button doesn't make it shutdown as it would normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any idea how to get more diagnostics?</p>

            OK, so the problem isn't a blank screen, it's that it has stopped responding locally.&nbsp; I turned off the power option to turn the screen off and this time everything just froze except the cursor was still moving, I could ping it from another machine, trying
 to VNC into it prompted for the password but didn't go any further, psexec tried to start but couldn't and psshutdown said it was going to shutdown in 20 seconds but it didn't.&nbsp; Given that it is still partly responding I can't see that this is a hardware problem
 as I would expect a complete lack of response to anything.<br />

<h2>            Transfer &#47; Reactivate a Windows 10 Education Product Key</h2>
                    <p>BLUF: I need to reactivate windows after a new installation with a Windows 10 education product key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been running Windows 10 Education on a virtual machine on my iMac, but there are a few things that I need to do that aren't supported in a virtual machine, so I want to reinstall Windows in a bootcamp partition. So I removed the product key from the
 virtual machine, and removed the license key using&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 1)">slmgr /upk.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Expectedly since I had already activated this product key once, it did not automatically activate when I installed windows via the bootcamp method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have called and chatted with Windows support several times now, and each time the agent states that Microsoft does not provide support for Microsoft Windows 10 Education, and in most cases tell me that I need to talk to my university.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did talk to my university IT department, and they confirmed that they have nothing to do with windows 10 education that is acquired by students for their personal computers.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I received my Windows 10 Education Product Key from&nbsp;<a href="https://onthehub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onthehub.com/</a>. I contacted their support staff, and they confirmed that they do not provide support for reactivation of a windows
 10 education product key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through numerous articles indicating that windows 10 licenses/product keys acquired separate from a computer are transferable, and that windows 10 education product keys should be transferable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked Microsoft support staff numerous occasions for help letting my transfer my Windows 10 education product key to a new installation numerous time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Should I be able to transfer my Windows 10 Education product key to a new computer, or is it only good for one installation one time?</p>

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your clarification. There is no option to remove a participant while the group call is on-going. As a workaround, you may try removing the participant from the chat group before you  initiate the call. 
<br />
<br />If you would like to see this improved, I recommend you send in feedback to the engineers.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46e3605b-63c6-41fc-996e-33359f84f1f6?upload=true" />

<h2>            Error while trying to set-up external IMAP&#47;POP on outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I've been looking for answers on this, but so far all I've found are topics regarding using outlook.com as an SMTP server on some app like Mail, while my question goes the opposite way.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I'm helping out my friend set-up some e-mail inboxes for his project. He chose Zoho, using his own domain. However, he's always used hotmail/outlook.com for his personal e-mail, and we're trying to have him read his Zoho e-mails on outlook.com.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I configured Zoho's SMTP, POP and IMAP settings, yet when I configure the login and server info on Outlook.com (Inbox&gt;Options&gt;Your email accounts&gt;Add a send-and-receive account), it then says</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">This account cannot currently receive email. Click Details for more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">You can send email from this account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">12:25 AM We couldn't get your messages: There was a problem connecting to the other server. If you've been seeing this message for a while, consider checking your account settings or contacting your other email service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Everything points towards Zoho being the issue, but we managed to set everything up on his mobile phone, the Mail App and even tested using Gmail to retrieve from the POP server. They all worked, so it seems everything is working fine on that end, and the
 only part of the puzzle that does not work is outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be thankful for any ideas or comments that may come up!</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.zoho.com/topic/pop-email-setup-with-outlook-com-not-connecting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.zoho.com/topic/pop-email-setup-with-outlook-com-not-connecting</a>, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal opinion is that each service is interpreting the connection protocols a little differently and that one side, the other, or both are not flexible enough to handle the differences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a post at Zoho that said the person was able to get the connected account on the Outlook.com side to work if it's a send-only account and then they are forwarding their Zoho mail to their Outlook.com address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that POP access is enabled on the Zoho side (it is enabled by default) if you want to use POP or that IMAP is enabled (it is enabled by default) if that's how you want Outlook.com to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to test this out. I created a Zoho address for myself. I had to specify another non-Zoho address as well for security reasons. I then had to verify the Zoho account by logging into that other non-Zoho mailbox to click a verify link. After that,
 I created the connected account in Outlook.com using manual configuration (Advanced configuration). Outlook.com was able to connect to Zoho well enough to verify that my username and password were good, but it could not make the POP connection. It could, however,
 make the SMTP connection, so I was able to send mail from Outlook.com using my Zoho address and the messages appeared in the Zoho Sent folder and arrived at the destination address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the problem is with the POP transaction between Outlook.com and Zoho, but not with the SMTP connection.</p>

            <p>Thanks! I had not found anything similar, but I guess I should have actually typed "Zoho" on my search. Read all posts, including the ones linked from one, to the next and the one after... it seems like Outlook.com's support just types a single, not really
 useful reply, and when more people pop-up with the same issue, they just vanish from the conversation. Almost like they were aware of the issue and just playing dumb. I know... I need a tinfoil hat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>POP, IMAP and SMTP are enabled, so I guess I just won't have a fix for the issue... tried the Send Only + Forward workaround and it works, only setback is when replying to a forwarded message, Outlook will by default reply to the Zoho reply (makes sense,
 it's replying to the one who forwarded the original message), so you have to manually replace the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish Juzar had taken at least the time to read my original message before writing his... seems to be a standard saved reply that they just paste anywhere without even reading. Thanks for taking all that time to read, find an answer and verifying it, Brian!</p>

            I had decided to just let it go, but since I got an e-mail from the system asking me to post an update, I'll just do exactly that: issue is not solved. We're currently thinking about using other product; in the meantime Brian's workaround has been very
 helpful.

            Hi Elaine,<br />
<br />
May I know which Outlook 2011 version are you using? Is it latest updated? Please provide us with the detailed information about this.<br />
<br />
How did you set up the mailbox on the Outlook 2011 desktop client, via <strong>Exchange, POP
</strong>or <strong>IMAP</strong>?<br />
<br />
Are you able send/receive email via using webmail client without any issue?<br />
<br />
If you are not using Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox, please contact your ISP to get your account information
<em>(such as Port settings and the address of your Incoming/Outgoing mail server).</em> Or contact your network/email account administrator to get the exact information to check this issue.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you may try to check this issue via creating a new identity to see whether the problem still occurs. For your reference:

 investigation, I found no Microsoft Office products that list my operating system.&nbsp; Can it possibly be true that Microsoft did not support this operating system with a version of Microsoft Office?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or am I missing something?&nbsp; Open Office runs OK, but I wanted
 to see if a Microsoft solution would do a better job of managing very large spreadsheets.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any experience you may be able to share!<br />

            <p>Hello Jon,</p>
<p>Sometimes logic is hard to find. It seems that Microsoft does not supply a 64 bit Office version for Their 64 bit XP operating system.</p>
<p>When you will settle for a 32 bit Office version you can install it using the compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Right click on the setup.exe file</p>
<p>Choose properties and go to the compatibility tab.</p>
<p>Select Run this program in compatibility mode for:</p>
<p>Windows XP</p>
<p>If you now run the setup.exe it should complete the installation. </p>
<p>It just did the trick for me.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Will</p>

<h2>            Where are Revisions &#38; Comments &#40;Tracked Changes&#41; to text in text boxes available in VBA&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Normally the VBA expression</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">ActiveDocument.Revisions.Count</p>
<p>was able to give me an accurate measure of the <strong>total number of Revisions</strong> within the Tracked Changes in the document, and
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">ActiveDocument.Comments.Count</p>
<p>provided an accurate record of the <strong>total number of Comments</strong> within the Tracked Changes in the document.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently found that when I make Tracked Changes (Revisions) to <strong>text in text boxes</strong> within a Word document (Word 2013, saved as *.DOCX or *.DOCM), although the changes
<em>are indeed tracked</em> (visible annotations and redline), and although they <em>
are indeed able to be correctly counted</em> by Word (shown in the Reviewing Pane), they are
<strong>not included</strong> in either of the above two expressions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>By tinkering about, I found some Tracked Changes stored in </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">ActiveDocument.Shapes.Item(j).GroupItems(i).TextFrame.TextRange.Document.Comments.Count<br />
ActiveDocument.Shapes.Item(j).GroupItems(i).TextFrame.TextRange.Document.Revisions.Count</p>
<p>but these seem to manifest duplicates (or, rather, many replicates) across the GroupItems [<em>i.e</em>. counts from different GroupItems cannot simply be added together], and furthermore many of the Tracked Changes are still not accounted for in these two
 new expressions.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Prima facie</em> it seems like a bug for all of the Tracked Changes not to be represented in the first pair of expressions, but leaving that aside, how can the correct total number of Tracked Changes in a given document be obtained through VBA code,
 given that some or all of the Tracked Changes (Revisions and Comments) can be for text in text-boxes?</p>
<p>

            <p>Dear Doug, </p>
<p>&nbsp; thanks for your quick and helpful reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of fact, I had previously come across the page that you linked to (which I'd once implemented in a script for customised word-counting, almost a decade ago).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, this needed a few changes for my application, mostly swapping from Find and Replace functionality to interrogating parameters such as
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>myStoryRange.Revisions.Count</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In implementing this for counting or enumerating Tracked Changes, there are a few extra things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some types of Story cannot (ever) contain Comments.&nbsp; Notably wdTextFrameStory (StoryType = 5) cannot.&nbsp;
<br />
I am not sure if there is a listing anywhere of which types of Story can contain Comments, and which cannot (ever).&nbsp; I could also not see a neat way of querying this at runtime (<em>e.g</em>. a hypothetical Boolean property like ".acceptsComments");&nbsp; it could
 be addressed either with a conditional statement or else by error handling. That is, if it were needed — although it probably isn't needed, because....<br />
</li><li>....Comments are replicated in the first StoryRange of every Story type to which Comments can be attached.&nbsp; Hence, iteration is not required for Comments — they can be accurately obtained directly from
<strong>ActiveDocument.Comments.Count</strong>.&nbsp; Care must be taken not to count these same Comments more than once.&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>An alternative to explicitly referring to the first StoryRange [prior to the "Do While Not (myStoryRange.NextStoryRange Is Nothing)" statement], it is possible to alternatively include one instance each of
<strong>ActiveDocument.Revisions.Count</strong>.&nbsp; <br />
This is because the first Story will be of type wdMainTextStory (numerical value = 1).<br />
An advantage of querying ActiveDocument.Revisions is that the code executes much faster than accessing via StoryRanges [as alluded to on the WordMVP page].&nbsp; Of course, this does not have much practical effect when only dealing with Revisions.Count, but it provides
 a big advantage when dealing with Revisions.Item(<em>r</em>).TextRange.Text, and Revisions.Item(<em>r</em>).Type. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Note that the exact same document comments and revisions can likewise be queried through other syntax (including myStoryRange.Document.Revisions.Count and&nbsp;ActiveDocument.Shapes.Item(<em>j</em>).GroupItems(<em>i</em>).TextFrame.TextRange.Document.Revisions.Count),
 so care must be taken not to count these same Revisions more than once.&nbsp; </li></ul>

            <p>Addendum:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the topic of types of Story, the WordMVP article states:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">There are <strong>11</strong> different types of stories that can be part of a document, corresponding to the following WdStoryType constants:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>wdCommentsStory, wdEndnotesStory, wdEvenPagesFooterStory, wdEvenPagesHeaderStory, wdFirstPageFooterStory, wdFirstPageHeaderStory, wdFootnotesStory, wdMainTextStory, wdPrimaryFooterStory, wdPrimaryHeaderStory, and wdTextFrameStory</em>.</p>

            Like Jack said, you can sync a lot of different phones to the same My Phone account, but you will most likely get duplicate information because My Phone seems to get confused.&nbsp; I've got lots of phones and tried doing it and after awhile I had so much duplicate
 phone doesn't have any PIM data on it, create a new partnership and sync it to My Phone.

            No it will sync but I urge caution.&nbsp; Sometimes duplicates start appearing (at least that was my issue).&nbsp; It will work, give it a try and see if you have have issues.&nbsp; Hopefully you will not.

            You don't. The way language packs work was changed with Word 2010. Older language packs are not compatible. Your best bet is to retain Word 2007 and use that for documents that require the old language pack - though you may still need to retain components
 of 2003 to do that.<br />
<br />
In my own case I have the Office 2003 language pack which I occasionally use for spell checking Greek text, and I use that in Word 2007 when the occasion arises. I use Word 2010 for everyday requirements.<br />
<br />
Using multiple Word versions requires some preparation - see <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Dear Misha,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Microsoft Teams is part of Business subscription and can use files from the account that you are using Teams ( which should be your Office 365 Business account ). If you want to share the Notebook on teams you can
<br />1. Log to your personal OneDrive and find that Notebook and open using your OneNote 2016 on your work PC (of course if your group policy allows to use personal accounts) and make a local backup
<br />2. Add it to your OneNote 2016 where you have your Business account and you will be able to add it to teams.       
        </p>

<p>As noted, I do not have OneNote 2016. I have OneNote for Windows 10. Is there any way to make a local backup of OneNote for Windows 10? From what I'm reading, the answer to that is "no."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your attempt but, due to differences between OneNote 2016 which I do not have and OneNote for Windows 10, this information does not seem to apply to me.</p>

            Dear Misha, 
<br />
<br />From your verbatim I understood that you are using OneNote 2016 on device that runs Windows 10. If you have Office 365 for Business you can actually download nad use OneNote 2016. You can use this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-or-reinstall-onenote-2016-for-windows-c08068d8-b517-4464-9ff2-132cb9c45c08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/instal...</a> You will find a link for OneNote there. It has more features and functionality.

<p>Thanks anyway. Hubby was able to get OneNote to open from Teams (something I hadn't been able to do - maybe because the OneNote there didn't have content? I'm not sure I tried again after I added content to it.) and we were able to copy each section over
 from my personal OneNote to the OneNote in Teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help. Maybe that info will help someone else with a similar issue. :)</p>

            Dear Misha, 
<br />
<br />Glad to hear that it was resolved.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I do encourage you to install OneNote 2016 and see how much more convenient it is. Personally, for me I prefer it much better than OneNote for Windows.
<br />
<br />I also hope that other users will be able to find help with the suggestions. Have a nice day and good luck!

    <title>How to save an MS Word 2010 document WITHOUT the extraneous XML - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r. keith howard  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to save an MS Word 2010 document WITHOUT the extraneous XML proofreading&#47;editing tags</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>When you edit a Word document, Word records in XML tags various editing actions by the user. For example, when you press backspace, Word records this. See below, where I undertook the following steps:</p>
<p>I created a&nbsp;blank document.</p>
<p>I typed the text "This is a test."</p>
<p>I click in between the "e" and the "s" in test.</p>
<p>I pressed backspace.</p>
<p>I typed "e".</p>
<p>The result, which you can see at the bottom of this posting is:</p>
<p>This is a te&lt;/w:t&gt;&lt;/w:r&gt;&lt;w:bookmarkStart w:id="0" w:name="_GoBack"/&gt;&lt;w:bookmarkEnd w:id="0"/&gt;&lt;w:r w:rsidR="00290A2D"&gt;&lt;w:t&gt;st.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is a load of extraneous XML tags between the e and s in test. Is there a setting in Word to prevent Word from saving these editing actions in the XML? The reason I am asking is that we use a powerful text editor (i.e., not from
 inside Word) to search for text patterns in Word documents. These extraneous XML tags prevent the text editor from finding patterns, which is highly problematic for us. We have spent a bunch of time and effort trying to strip out these unnecessary tags, but
 it would be so much better if Word had a built-in feature to eliminate them (or prevent their creation).</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            I don't believe there's anything you can do to prevent Word from saving that batch of XML tags, but you can arrange to put it where it won't get in your way.<br />
<br />
The reason those tags are there is to enable the GoBack command (Shift+F5) to take you to the last editing position when you reopen a previously saved document. The command works by moving the selection to a super-hidden bookmark named _GoBack, which Word inserts
 during the Save operation. Neither the Bookmarks dialog nor VBA (macros) can see that bookmark, so there's no way to delete it.<br />
<br />
To get it out of your way, you could manually move the cursor to the end of the document, insert and delete a space character, and then save. The resulting XML looks like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;w:body&gt;&lt;w:p w:rsidR="004E1F19" w:rsidRDefault="00C84D1F"&gt;&lt;w:r&gt;&lt;w:t&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">This is a test.</span>&lt;/w:t&gt;&lt;/w:r&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;w:bookmarkStart w:id="0" w:name="_GoBack"/&gt;&lt;w:bookmarkEnd w:id="0"/&gt;</span>&lt;/w:p&gt;&lt;w:sectPr w:rsidR="004E1F19"&gt;&lt;w:pgSz
 w:w="12240" w:h="15840"/&gt;&lt;w:pgMar w:top="1440" w:right="1440" w:bottom="1440" w:left="1440" w:header="720" w:footer="720" w:gutter="0"/&gt;&lt;w:cols w:space="720"/&gt;&lt;w:docGrid w:linePitch="360"/&gt;&lt;/w:sectPr&gt;&lt;/w:body&gt;<br />
<br />
To automate this, write a couple of short macros into the template for the documents that need to be searched:<br />
<br />
Sub FileSave()<br />
&nbsp; With Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .StoryType &lt;&gt; wdMainTextStory Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Characters.First.Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .EndKey Unit:=wdStory, Extend:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TypeText " "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TypeBackspace<br />
&nbsp; End With&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Save<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Sub FileSaveAs()<br />
&nbsp; With Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .StoryType &lt;&gt; wdMainTextStory Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Characters.First.Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .EndKey Unit:=wdStory, Extend:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TypeText " "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TypeBackspace<br />
&nbsp; End With&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp; Dialogs(wdDialogFileSaveAs).Show<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Jay,</p>
<p>Thanks for the&nbsp;response, which was interesting and&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p>However, the problem seems to be deeper than just that one specific bookmark that helps you go to the last editing position.</p>
<p>When I click at the end of the document in question, then save, then look at the document XML, here is what I see:</p>
<p>This is a te<strong>&lt;/w:t&gt;&lt;/w:r&gt;&lt;w:r w:rsidR="00780C2C"&gt;&lt;w:t&gt;</strong>st.</p>
<p>So, the _GoBack bookmark is gone, but there&nbsp;still remains annoying residual "gunk" after the "e" but before the "s" in "test". I need to get rid of the these extraneous XML tags, so that, for example, I can search for the word "test" (not searching in Word...but
 in a text editor).</p>
<p>Do you have any further ideas on how to approach this problem?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>Keith</p>

            <p>This post helps me understand why my Word H&amp;S 2010 creates &lt;w:bookmarkStart w:id="0" w:name="_GoBack"/&gt;&lt;w:bookmarkEnd w:id="0"/&gt; in odd places. Though a slightly different&nbsp;code&nbsp;from that above, on reopening a document Shift=F5 does take me to the last edit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as I have turned tracking off, I wonder why this remains and whether it can be turned off. The Document Inspector moved the code to the start of the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my ignorance,&nbsp;I have just deleted the code from the doc.xml file in Notepad. Word doesn't seem to mind!</p>

            Track Changes and the associated rsid tags have nothing to do with the _GoBack bookmark, except that they're both in the XML file.<br />
<br />
Every time you save a document, Word will insert the _GoBack bookmark in the XML to enable a return to that location if/when you reopen the document. It can't be turned off. That's why my earlier reply explained how to move the bookmark to the end of the text
 in the XML, to get it out of the way.<br />

            Thanks! I apologise for editing my post. I guess I must accept the code or remove it after the last save.
