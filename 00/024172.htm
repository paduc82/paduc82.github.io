<h2>            Lumia 950 WiFi Slow vs 930</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So going from stable Lumia 930 running 8.1 to buggy 950 running 10 has been frustrating as a big Windows Phone fan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My latest woes are all about WiFi speed or so I thought. Just mega slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to pit my 930 against my 950 using same WiFi, settings, etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've determined that storing APPs on my SD card significantly slows the 950. Its ability to utilise the SD card read write performance is very poor. I'm using a SanDisk Extreme 64GB (SDSDQX-064G-U46A) &nbsp;80/50MB/s read/write speed which is very quick in my
 Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you store APP's on the SD card performance available on not just WiFi but 4G drop and get capped to the phones max speed to interact with an SD card is seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put this in context if you use the speedtest.net app installed on phone not SD card, then turn off 4G and connect to your WiFi - run a speed test. Note the results. Now do the same but install speedtest.net on the SD card. Compare the results. You should
 see performance drop. Results will vary depending on how fast your WiFi and SD card is. If you want do the same two tests with WiFi off and 4G on. Again you'll see similar results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case speed drops like this;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi 5GHz Virgin Media Super Hub Router</p>
<p>Speedtest.net loaded on the phone storage;</p>
<p>PING = 31ms</p>
<p>Download = 90.51Mbps</p>
<p>Upload = 6.63Mbps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speedtest.net loaded on the SD card;</p>
<p>PING = 94ms</p>
<p>Download 29.47Mbps</p>
<p>Upload = 3.50Mbps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar drop seen with 4G too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This drop translates into Facebook pages loading slow, downloads of pictures or 'Adding final touches' process after taking a picture to be very slow, etc, etc if you're storing on the SD card. Change these APPs and settings to internal phone storage and
 speed is as expected - mega quick!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly the processing power is capable based on APPs using internal phone storage but when processing via the SD card it just performs a lot less quick! So it seems another bug in Lumia 950 firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - Please get this fixed. What's the point of having the ability to use a 200GB SD card for APPs, data files, continuum, etc&nbsp;if SD storage performance is this bad. Or tell me what SD cards your tested successfully to obtain expected performance?
 Of course I could be wrong too so if you want me to try any other diagnostics, feel free to suggest - happy to do them!</p>

<p>I've done a factory reset using the Windows Device Recovery Tool which showed newer firmware for my 950. I'm not sure if I should have gotten this through the phone's update function but checking it said my phone was up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then updated the phone to the latest OS 10.0.10586.164 and reset the phone to factory defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It detected my SD card and used the phone's format function to prepare it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated settings and re-loaded my APP's to match previous (didn't use a backup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone is notably quicker now, the most common lag - Facebook main feed refreshing loading much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However my speed issue still exists. WiFi / 4G speeds affected if APP's / data are stored on the SD card. Not the case if you use internal storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It genuinely looks like the WiFi / 4G speed is throttled down to the phones ability in reading / writing to the SD card. With least APP's running (fore/background) and knowing the SD card max write speed is 50MB/s and WiFi is 90Mbps, to get 30Mbps which
 is 3.75MB/s is disappointing. Instead of WiFi&nbsp;using internal storage speed which equates to 11.25MB/s.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a notable difference in end user experience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to be wrong on this and my SD card be faulty or wrong model for my 950. If Microsoft support can confirm SD card speed should be closer to internal storage and then recommend an SD card model to use, I'll buy, re-test and post results..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over to you Microsoft..</p>

<h2>            Inbox - Empty all of a sudden. How to recover emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Regrettably, for the 2nd time since having an outlook.com email account my Inbox has suddenly appeared empty. This is incredibly frustrating and there appears to be no explanation. When it happened the first time, some months ago, I lost many important messages
 and regrettably Microsoft were unable to recover any or offer any explanation as to why they had disappeared. Since then I do tend to file important messages, but that said, once again the inbox is empty!!! Please can you explain why this has happened? I have
 attempted to recover deleted messages but it recovers those that I have intentionally deleted and the others from my inbox are not there. If someone can please help I would be very grateful. I am losing trust in the system and I'm concerned I will need to
 stop using my account.<span>over them or give me</span></p>

<div>If your data is important it is prudent to back it up, especially if it is in the cloud and not under your control.</div>
<div>
<p>When you signed up for the email account there was (in the fine print) the Terms of use which clearly said that the user is responsible for the data and not Microsoft.</p>

</p><p><strong>Unless</strong> you have a back up made of the important email data it will be unlikely that you will be able to retrieve anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The possible reasons why e-mails suddenly disappear.</span></strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or were moved or deleted due to your account filter settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Messages were deleted due to account compromise issues where a hacker might have gained access to your account and deleted the emails.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>You are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account.<br />
This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>The account was marked as “Inactive." Accounts become inactive if you don’t sign in via web browser at least once a year.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>If the feature Conversation Threading feature is turned on.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> If you use Sweep to schedule a cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>If you rename your</strong><strong> </strong><strong>account to @Outlook.com
</strong>a prompt would have asked you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account.</p>

            <p>If you have a field that uniquely identifies the records in the query, or a combination of fields that together uniquely identify the records, it is possible to create a calculated column that returns a sequence number.</p>
<p>But this is not very efficient; with large numbers of records the calculations will slow down the query noticeably.</p>

<div>However, consider the following example, also posted on the other question, i.e.:</div>
<div>
<div>I have a query returning results from union of 3/4 similar tables as:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>SELECT DISTINCT Inter.*</div>

<h2>            Cannot Connect to my Companies Local File System in Microsoft Flow</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago, I was attempting to test Microsoft Flow for my company. Originally, I had an issue where I couldn't get Microsoft Flow to collect a Microsoft Form response and input that into an Excel output in our local file system. Microsoft flow said
 i'd need to enable a Data Gateway, so I finally received permissions for that gateway from the higher ups here. Now that I have a gateway however, I can't seem to find that connector that connects Excel documents in our local file system to Microsoft Flow.
 Is this no longer possible in Flow? What am I missing here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ahead of time,</p>

    <title>Band 2 warranty let-down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prestondubose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Band 2 warranty let-down</h2>
                    <p>After charging experiencing the same charging problems discussed on these forums --at first randomly shutting down, then eventually not holding a charge at all-- I sent in my Band 2 for warranty fix/replacement. Well, it came back with a nice little note
 saying they wouldn't replace it due to "substantial damage." Given that the watch itself was in decent shape, I don't know how to take this other than that there's internal water damage. However, the letter didn't
<em>say</em> water damage and I've tried to be careful about exposing it to water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leads me to believe MS is tightening down on honoring the warranty because Band 2 is no longer in production, the device itself has soooo many hardware problems, and warranty stock is dwindling. My Surface Pro 3 really turned me into a MS fanboy, but
 this experience with Band 2 (lack of) support has eroded all that goodwill. My wife dropped $250 for a present in January that was dead by October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those of you who have sent in your Band 2 in the last 2-3 weeks, is it just me and you had better luck? Or are we all hosed?</p>

            <p>hello :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you completely as I am about to turn from fun boy to really disappointed customer :(</p>
<p>I am in the middle of switching from apple products and ecosystem to MS' one and I am having second thoughts now...</p>
<p>I am living in France and year ago I bought MS Band2 that recently got strap problems (it was broken on both sides without any physical intervention or cause).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My product is still under warranty but MS charged me EUR 200 for replacement?!</p>
<p>I'll try to get some explanations from MS but really don't like the approach and discrimination (found on Internet that some journalists got the same problem but MS swiftly helped and replaced the product) :(</p>
<p>So, it seams it is not just you or bad luck... :(</p>

    <title>Lumia 720 Screen problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donnl720  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 720 Screen problem</h2>
                    
<div><font color="#0000ff">My Nokia Lumia 720 has been behaving strangely for a few weeks now. I can turn on the phone but then when I try to enter my PIN number the screen will not allow me to. The screen jumps around erratically.
 I've tried doing a soft reboot &amp; a hard reboot with no real success. I've done some research on the internet look on Nokia forums to find a solution and I've come to learn that other people are experiencing the exact same problem. Last week I had an accident
 with my phone, it fell out of my hand and cracked the screen. It was a very small crack on the corner of the screen (the black part of the screen) The phone still works apart from the issue I had before the phone fell. I've just gotten back from a Nokia Care
 Centre in Bellville, Cape Town called Cellectro. The technician of the store had a look at the phone and suggested i have the phone's screen replaced at a cost of R1900 (One Thousand Nine Hundred Rand) before he can check if the phone's hardware is faulty....That
 don't make much sense to me because I had the problem before the phone fell. Please advise what I can do to fix the problem.</font></div>

            There is nothing you can do yourself to fix it, all you can really do is appeal to the care centre and hope that they will believe you as there it no way of proving when the damage occurred.<br />
<br />
Care centres are not owned or run by Nokia so if you feel they are treating you unfairly you need to contact Nokia in your country and make a complaint.

<p>Thank you psychomania, I appreciate the feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've raised my concerns with Nokia Care and they say it's a misuse issue. If it's a misuse issue, why do i read posts of people having the exact same issues with their phones when they have brand new phones right out of the box. That just don't add up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my second Lumia 720 in six months, the first one packed up a few day after i received it. It switched off and couldn't be turned on again. My service provider was quick to swapped it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Care will be receiving another email from me very soon.</p>

            There is a bulletin on out on the erratic behaviour of the 720 display. If you've turned down the sensitivity of the touch then it needs to be repaired under warranty provided there is no signs of physical damage

<p>Had the exact same problem with my Lumia 720 screen — the tiniest conceivable crack in the corner, and terrible screen jitters predating that. Went to Nokia Care and they told me the same thing they told you: broken, therefore out of warranty. And they quoted
 a fantastic price for part replacement. They wanted to replace the LCD and the digitiser. What I've been told to try, and I will just now at an independent repair shop (regardless of whether it voids the warranty, of which there's four months left), is to
 replace just the digitiser, because the LCD itself appears to work fine. This is much cheaper. Will tell you if that works — but in the meantime, what did you do with your 720 ultimately, and did it work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I have my Lumia 720 screen cracked but my touch is working well....but there are some areas appearing on the display where the colours are slightly giving the shade like there is some damage to the display too....but still at those areas everything is
 visible clearly......is this because of the pressure of glass pieces on the display....will they disappear when I replace the touch sreen digitizer...what shoud I do

    <title>Search malfunction in Outlook 2016 under Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sm0417  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search malfunction in Outlook 2016 under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Back in January – after an update – I started receiving an error message when I searched in Outlook email. It said “something went wrong” but the search was fine and I got all the correct answers. After a month, I called Microsoft to see what was going on
 and went up to Level 2 support. They said there was a problem with Outlook and I should wait until the next update and all would be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few months, and a number of updates, the problem was still there, so I call up again and they said I still needed to wait for the next update of Outlook and then, for sure, it would be fixed. Since the searches were still working, I waited another
 few months, but the error message persisted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As summer was coming to an end, I called tech support again and after getting up to level 2 support they came onto my computer and “uninstalled” all of Office and did a full reinstall. This successfully got rid of the error message, but now search became
 completely broken – giving no search results at all. &nbsp;Level 2 then decided it must be my “index” so the tech got onto my computer and started a “rebuild” of my index. The “rebuild” process was extremely slow, but partial searching started to return – getting
 only answers to the most recent emails. Each time the techs would call back, the number of items “indexed” was only marginally more than before. After over a week of “indexing” there were only around 30,000 items indexed (where it was over 80,000 before the
 rebuild).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time the Level 2 tech set up a “process” on my computer (with assurances it would fix the problem), they gave me a time (2-hour window) when they would call back. FIVE times they called 5 – 10 hours later than scheduled so I was not near my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are now in October and the last Level 2 tech now says I must “repair” Windows. She directed me to download the .iso of the Windows install and said she would call back the next day – which she didn’t – so she could do the “repair”. It has now been a few
 days, so I called tech support and (after she tried to get Level 2 support for 30 minutes) she put me “in the queue” directly. After 2 another hours (really, I hung in there), I got disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI – I exported ALL of my emails out of Outlook on my main computer and imported them to Outlook on my laptop and, despite the fact that the .pst file was over 10 Gigabytes, it was searching perfectly after the “index” grew to over 200,00 items within less
 than 2 hours. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there anyone out there that can help me with:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Fixing this “search” problem;</li><li>Understanding why (on a fast Intel 7 processor with 32 Gigs of memory) the “indexing” process could be so slow; and</li><li>How can I get Level 2 support to call me back so they can complete what they said they were going to do. The tech support people one gets when calling 800-642-7676 insist they cannot get a message to Level 2 support to call me back. They just put me in
 the queue that does not answer and finally disconnects after a few hours. &nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft personnel are monitoring this, my case number is 1399585633. Please help. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a multi-computer Subscription to Office 365. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert - thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I am using a POP3 account for my email &amp; Exchange accounts (on Outlook.com) for my Contacts and Calendar.</p>
<p>2) Outlook is part of my Office 365 - Version 1708 - Build 8431.2079 Click to run</p>
<p>3) I am running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit - Version 1703 - Build 15063.674</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>What is the size of your original pst-file? (so not the exported one)<br />
File-&gt; Account Settings-&gt; Account Settings...-&gt; tab Data Files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you already ran scanpst.exe against this pst-file?<br />

<p>There are a couple of reasons for indexing for Outlook data being slow;</p>
<ul>
<li>Corruptions within the pst-file.</li><li>Slow hard disk and/or high bad sector count.</li><li>Processor or disk activity of background or foreground tasks.</li><li>Many other data locations needing to be reindexed as well.</li></ul>

<p>The file size is 12 Gigs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the tech ran scanpst.exe, but I ran it again and it corrected some errors. The search, however, remains non functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine is quite fats and when I look at Task Manager, there is very little CPU activity; less than 25% Memory usage; and very little Disk activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Index says it is "complete" but only has 11,569 items. I know that it was over 80,000 items when we started having this problem. When the index has been "rebuilt" (done a few times now) it was going incredibly slowly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I moved the entire Outlook data over to my laptop (folder by folder), the index size shot up to 217,000 items - quickly -and works great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think I have to rebuild Windows? We have already uninstalled Office 365 and restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, do you know of any way I can get the Level 2 tech call me back like she said she would?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help appreciated.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked if there are any update in the Nokia Store for your YouTube app that you use? YouTube has made numerous changes in their API's over the last year or so, so a lot of application developers have scrambled to update their apps to accommodate YouTube's
 backend changes.....and some developers also have not. if this is the case, then you can try searching for other YouTube apps that you can use, and it might pay to check that you also have a good condition SIM card, that your network carrier data settings
 are correct, and that your data plan is still activated.<br />
<br />
Foolproof way to test it all, is by using a WiFi connection.

<h2>            stop Track Changes from re-appearing in Word for Mac 16</h2>
                    I can't figure out how to turn off Track Changes 'permanently' - even after I accept/reject the changes and turn it off in a given document, it reverts to the 'Track Changes' display (showing all previous deletions and comments) whenever I re-open the
 same document. It's VERY frustrating and I can't find an answer on the message boards that works for Word 2016 for Mac.&nbsp; Help!&nbsp;

<p>The <strong>Display for Review</strong> &amp; the <strong>Markup Options</strong> controls in the Tracking group determine display choices only, they
<em>do not</em> remove markup from the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choosing <strong>No Markup</strong> does not create a "clean copy" for anyone other than the user currently viewing the document with that choice selected. IOW, it temporarily
<em>hides</em> the existing markup. Furthermore, neither of those options travel with the document. They are
<em>viewing</em> preferences specific to the local installation of the software being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When opening any document that contains Comments &amp; Tracked Changes existing markup will display regardless of the settings which were in place when the document last was closed using a different installation of the program or the same one. More explicitly,
 the <strong>Markup Options</strong> remain in effect for that installation of Word until the user changes them, but have no influence when a document is opened in a different instance of Word; the
<strong>Display for Review</strong> settings are not at all persistent even on the same system for the same document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to create a <em>clean copy</em> is to follow this 3 step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn <strong>Track Changes</strong> OFF</li><li>Use the <strong>Accept</strong>/<strong>Reject</strong> tools in the <strong>
Changes</strong> group to finalize the document &amp; the <strong>Delete</strong> tool in the
<strong>Comments</strong> group to remove any Comments</li><li><strong>Save</strong> the file</li></ol>

            I'm seeing this too and I suspect this may be a video driver issue. When I first installed Windows 10, my AMD catalyst App complained that&nbsp;no driver was loaded. I suspect once AMD (and other makers) have updated drivers for the preview this should work.

<p>I'm running Windows 10 on the HP Envy 15 3200 CTO.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Here's a screenshot of what is happening:&nbsp;http://cl.ly/image/110b140h3R0p<br />
And it's consistent across all the modern apps. Everything else is fine. Very weird problem.</p>

<p>I had the same issue after upgrading from Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 last July 29.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to request the Hotfix from MS but after two attempts &amp; the replies haven't arrived in my email for quite a while, I tried this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure that you have the latest AMD's Catalyst Control Center installed (mine's v 15.20-150602a-184724E).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open the Catalyst Control Center &amp; go to Performance tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Click on AMD Radeon Dual Graphics (or, whatever AMD graphics card you have).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Under this tab, make sure that you have a&nbsp;radio button on 'Enable AMD Radeon Dual Graphics' and a check mark on ' Enable AMD Radeon Dual Graphics for applications that have no associated application profile'</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. The enabling the check mark on the latter in step 4 was the crucial step. This was what fixed my problem (minimize, maximize &amp; close buttons disappeared)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that this will also fix your problem.</p>

<h2>            Saved Microsoft Word Document to OneDrive but it does not appear in OneDrive Folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi-</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened three times now.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone can help.&nbsp; What is happening is that I saved a Word Document into my business OneDrive and then I exited Word.&nbsp; When I went to reopen the file it was missing from both my Online OneDrive folder as well
 as when I tried to access it via File Explorer.&nbsp; The document name shows up in my recent documents in both the online Microsoft Word application and my Desktop application but in the Online version it gives me an "Error 404" and in the Desktop version it says
 "Sorry, we couldn't open 'FILE-NALE'.&nbsp; The file name is also the web access point for the file i.e. https://mywork-my.sharepoint.com/person/name_mywork-org/documents/file folder/file name.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequently, Microsoft&nbsp;upload center keeps failing every time I open or save a file.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is relevant&nbsp;or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled and read many of these message boards with similar problems but they were not helpful.&nbsp; Please let me know if you have any idea how to 1) recover old files and/or 2) stop this from happening again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.<br />

<p>Hi Savlee,<br />
</p>
<br />
Could you provide the following information?<br />
<br />
1. How did you open the document in your OneDrive for Business before saving it? From your OneDrive for Business in the browser or from the local synced folder?<br />
2. Have you checked the recycle bin of your OneDrive for Business?<br />
3. Screenshots of "it gives me an "Error 404" and "in the Desktop version it says "Sorry, we couldn't open 'FILE-NALE'". &nbsp;<br />
4. About "Microsoft upload center keeps failing every time I open or save a file", is there any error message? Can you provide a screenshot of the symptom.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James

<p>James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files (there are three this has happened to) were saved in the local syned folder originally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the recycle bin on my computer, on OneDrive and also the 2nd recycle bin on OneDrive.&nbsp; I have also checked every folder on my computer and in OneDrive.&nbsp; I even searched Delve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached the screen shots&nbsp;requested.</p>

            Hi Savlee,<br />
<br />
Just as the error says, we will see the error when the file is deleted/renamed or moved to another location on your computer. Please search for this document on your computer to get it back.<br />

<h2>            Conversation history in Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>While I have Conversation history in android app in Skype for business, I can't have the same with my windows application.</p>
<p>I press "find previous conversations" on a contact and the program tries to open and install Outlook account (which I dont want, I use online Outlook for my emails). However, I opened Outlook app once and installed the account, and I was able to see the
 history. But I prefer history be showing into the Skype as I find it more intuitive than looking to another (!) app for history.</p>
<p>I deleted the sip folder but no change.</p>
<p>Why this happens and how can I fix it?</p>

<p>Hi YannisDran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, Skype for business instant messages are saved in the conversation history folder of Outlook. To find a previous Skype for Business conversation, you can refer to the article below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-a-previous-skype-for-business-conversation-18892eba-5f18-4281-8c87-fd48bd72e6a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-a-previous-skype-for-business-conversation-18892eba-5f18-4281-8c87-fd48bd72e6a2</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is not feasible to view the continuous Skype for business chat history between different devices. We can only go to the conversation history folder in Outlook to view all the chat history. While I totally understand your concern
 to have this feature included. I suggest you submit your ideas via the following link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a really seriously problem and i really need to recover my contact phone number.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>exact same issue here. I lost a substantial number of mobile and landline phone numbers from my contacts and they don't show up on my Windows Phone (8.1), People on the Web and Outlook (Web and Desktop) any more. Other people reported the same issue and
 said that it may have to do with the latest Skype update on Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a serious issue since I lost a lot of business phone numbers a s well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please look into this since this puts the Outlook service in serious question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>

            How can this be done without switching to the Page Layout option? &nbsp;I prefer to use the Normal view, and use the freeze panes option. &nbsp;I don't want to switch to Page Layout.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the top and side rulers can only be enabled on the <strong>Page Layout</strong> option because it's only after you change the view to
<strong>Page Layout</strong> does Excel have a physical basis of comparison, which makes the ruler more useful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<p>Wow, you guys don't make it easy for us to enter information. &nbsp;I wrestled with logging into Microsoft network for about 20 minutes, and had to reset my entire password, through a series of events that rivals homeland security. &nbsp;I would have been impressed
 if it appeared secure, however it didn't it just appeared to be an extreme hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's very strange you don't allow your users to see a rule except on one view. &nbsp;It's quite "normal" for users to want to view a ruler in normal view - this is, after all, a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you could consider changing this in a future version of excel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does make sense. In the past version, in Normal View users were able to use Excel for text - the ruler was used to change the alignment or distance between words INSIDE a single cell, thereby creating text similar in formatting to a multi-level
 bulleted text in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By removing the ruler from Normal View, Microsoft deleted this useful feature that existed in previous versions of Excel. This is pretty bad for anyone using Excel for creating large text-intensive files</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is impossible to use the ruler in Page Layout view for aligning the text contents within a singular cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alignment tab only allows Wrap text or left-right-center content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully support the above- expressed user request to&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;activate the ruler in "Normal View"</span></p>
