<h2>            Charts Not Updating When Linked In PowerPoint from SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to setup a Linked Chart in PowerPoint so that when an excel file is updated, the chart will update in the PowerPoint deck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PowerPoint is located on a SharePoint Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several charts in the deck that get updated when the ppt file is opened.&nbsp; But 1 particular chart does not update and in fact disappears from the deck whenever I try to update it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The charts that update fine, the source xls is located on a shared drive, not on sharePoint.&nbsp; These charts all link and update just fine when the PPT is opened and&nbsp; "update links" is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the chart that has the source XLS located on sharepoint will not update, no matter what I do.&nbsp; It seems crazy to me that SharePoint would be a limiting factor when setting up linked charts in PowerPoint, but that is the only difference between the
 ones that work ok for updates, and the 1 chart that will not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can simply move the file to my shared drive and I am sure the link will work, but my longer term plan was to get rid of the shared drive and have all files on sharepoint.&nbsp; If linked charts won't work from 1 file on sharepoint to another, I'll have to rethink
 that I guess.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how I can get this to work?</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Average density formula for different quantities of materials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jvtrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Average density formula for different quantities of materials</h2>
                    Greetings!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I'm attempting to do in Excel is calculate average densities of alloys while knowing the densities of each metal component and the mass of each component.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I currently have it set up to calculate average density with up to 6 components and the formula looks like, where B values are masses and C values are respective densities:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=SUM(B2:B7)/((B2/C2)+(B3/C3)+(B4/C4)+(B5/C5)+(B6/C6)+(B7/C7))</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It works fine if I have values for all 12 cells (for calculating average density of a 6 component alloy) but I'd like it to work if I only enter data for 2 rows, or only 3 rows, etc. (ie- calculate the proper result despite #DIV/0 errors if any of the
 later rows are empty)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suggestions?</div>
                </div>

            <p>This only works properly when if you have unused entry in C you also have no value entered in B on the same row.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUM(B2:B7)/(IFERROR((B2/C2),0)+IFERROR((B3/C3),0)+IFERROR((B4/C4),0)+IFERROR((B5/C5),0)+IFERROR((B6/C6),0)+IFERROR((B7/C7),0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each one of the IFERROR() statements says do your divide by math and if it doesn't create an error, use that value, but if it results in an error (presumed to be #DIV/0!) then just return 0 for that part of the whole formula.</p>

            <p>You didn't specify, but I assume column B has component mass (say, in grams) and column C has component density (say, in grams per cubic centimeter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think using a helper column is the simplest solution:</p>
<p>In column D, place the inverse of the value in column C, e.g.,&nbsp; D2=1/C2</p>
<p>Then your average density =sum(b2:b7)/sumproduct(b2:b7,d2:d7)</p>
<p>As long as at least one row has a value in both columns B and C (and assuming all values entered are non-negative) this formula will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's probably a way to do it with an array formula, but my first attempt was unsuccessful, so I gave up on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(On a scientific note:&nbsp; your formula is valid only if the volume taken up by the alloy is the sum of the volumes taken up by the components individually, e.g., that the atoms of 1 metal do not fill in the empty space between the atoms of the other metal(s).&nbsp;
 I'm not sure this is generally true.)</p>

If you are truly using Excel 2003, as your original posting indicates, or you require Excel 2003 compatibility and, in either case, you cannot use IFERROR, you could do the following:<br />
<br />
<b>=IF(SUMPRODUCT(B2:B7,C2:C7)=0,0,<br />
SUM(B2:B7)/(IF(C2=0,0,B2/C2)+IF(C3=0,0,B3/C3)+IF(C4=0,0,B4/C4)+IF(C5=0,0,B5/C5)<br />
+IF(C6=0,0,B6/C6)+IF(C7=0,0,B7/C7)))</b><br />
<br />
The IF(SUMPRODUCT(B2:B7,C2:C7)=0,0,...) is needed in case all of C2:C7 are zero.&nbsp; Using that test instead of the more obvious IF(SUM(C2:C7)=0,0,...) ensures that you have at least one
<u>paired</u> mass and density input in columns B and C.&nbsp; Thus, the formula continues to return 0 while you enter values into columns B and C in any order.<br />
<br />
However, that formula is somewhat unwieldy and even more so if you ever want to increase the number of alloys.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, try the following formula, which must be <u>array-entered</u> (press ctrl+shift+Enter instead of just Enter):<br />
<br />
<b>=IF(SUMPRODUCT(B2:B7,C2:C7)=0,0,<br />
SUM(IF(C2:C7&lt;&gt;0,B2:B7))/SUM(IF(C2:C7&lt;&gt;0,B2:B7/C2:C7)))</b><br />
<br />
When entered correctly (ctrl+shift+Enter), you will see curly braces around the entire formula.&nbsp; We cannot type the curly braces ourselves.&nbsp; That is just how Excel indicates an array-entered formula.<br />
<br />
The latter alternative also corrects a technical flaw in the form of your formula, repeated in the first alternative above, namely:&nbsp; the latter alternative returns the correct average density when only mass is entered in some rows in B2:B7 and the corresponding
 density is empty (effectively zero).<br />

            <p>joeu2004's reply pointed out one caveat with my solution:&nbsp; In order to work, all the density cells (e.g. C2) must have a value so that the reciprocal (1/C2) does not return a #DIV/0! error (say if you wanted to allow for 10 components, but for a specific
 alloy there are only 3 components).&nbsp; Two ways to fix this:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Enter anything for the density for the remaining rows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no mass associated with the density, it will not affect the average density result.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Adjust the reciprocal formula:&nbsp; D2=IFERROR(1/C2,0).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, if a component doesn't have a corresponding density, then you shouldn't be entering a mass on that row, either.&nbsp; (The solutions given so far (mine and joeu2004's) will give an average density assuming an infinite density for that component if
 you do make that mistake.)</p>

Speak for yourself!&nbsp; While entering data (and for other reasons as well), density might be empty while mass is not.&nbsp; I explicitly address that issue with the

Until all the data is entered, the state of the result shouldn't matter (it's not correct if it's not based on all the relevant data).&nbsp; I am making the assumption that whatever components are present have a non-zero density--seems reasonable to me but I guess
 JVTRAIN will have to decide.&nbsp; However, if a component has a density of 0 (the value, not just a blank cell), then the average density is mathematically undefined (because the volume of the component is undefined), so the formula
<u>should</u> return a #DIV/0! error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;your formula, when the density is 0 (the value or a blank cell)&nbsp;the average density returned is&nbsp;essentially based on the erroneous assumption that something divided by 0 is 0.&nbsp; Try this to verify what I'm saying:&nbsp; Enter masses (however many you want)
 and densities for each mass except one and use your formula to calculate average density.&nbsp; Enter 0 for that density (you should get the same result).&nbsp; Now enter&nbsp;a small number (greater than 0) for that density (maybe try 0.1, 1e-4, 1e-8, 1e-20).&nbsp; The average
 density will get smaller as the particular density you enter gets smaller, but it will not get closer and closer to the average density calculated when you put in 0 for the particular density.</p>

            Hoss wrote originally (emphasis added):<br />
<blockquote>In any case, <b>if a component doesn't have a corresponding density</b>, then you shouldn't be entering a mass on that row, either.&nbsp; (The solutions given so far (mine and joeu2004's)
<b>will give an average density assuming an infinite density for that component if you do make
<u>that mistake</u></b>.) <br />
</blockquote>
<br />
That is the comment to which I responded:&nbsp; "Speak for yourself!".&nbsp; My second formula does
<u>not</u> effectively "assume an infinite density" if a row does not have a corresponding density.&nbsp; Instead, it ignores that row, notably any non-zero mass, in calculating the average, treating it as incomplete information.<br />
<br />
Hoss wrote later:<br />
<blockquote>if a component has a density of 0 (the value, not just a blank cell), then the average density is mathematically undefined (because the volume of the component is undefined), so the formula
<u>should</u> return a #DIV/0! error.</blockquote>
<br />
I would agree with that, although that really is up to the OP to specify.&nbsp; So my second formula could be changed as follows (again, array-entered):<br />
<br />
<b>=IF(SUMPRODUCT((B2:B7&lt;&gt;"")*(C2:C7&lt;&gt;""))=0,"",<br />
SUM(IF(C2:C7&lt;&gt;"",B2:B7))/SUM(IF(C2:C7&lt;&gt;"",B2:B7/C2:C7)))</b><br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 won&#39;t accept my email password when trying to sync an account</h2>
                    <p>I have an exchange email with my employer and am trying to sync it with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When setting up, a Windows Security window prompts me for my password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use exactly the same password I use to access my emails through the Outlook Webmail App. It does not say it is incorrect but keeps prompting me for the password. How do I get past this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI I have Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email comes from an Exchange server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have successfully been able to sync @hotmail.com emails.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am told that, because the website I used to access my emails remotely has OWA in the URL, it must be using Microsoft Exchange 2010. Does this answer your question?</p>

<p>Hi Paolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there are 'no generic credentials.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when prompted for the password and I tick remember password, it still repeatedly prompts me for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to set it up manually as IMAP and '<strong>Logon to incoming mail server (IMAP)</strong>' gets a green tick and marked as '<strong>Completed.</strong>'</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, '<strong>Send test email message'</strong> is marked as '<strong>Failed.'&nbsp;</strong>I get the error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Send test email message: Outlook cannot connect to your outgoing (SMTP) email server. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP)</strong>.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried putting 'smtp' in front of the Outgoing mail server name. I have cycled through Outgoing server numbers 25, 465, 587 and encrypted connection types SSL and TLS in the Advanced Setting, all with the same error above.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers,</p>

            <p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>

<h3> daniel haxton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Selects an Incorrect Cell &#40;usually a handful of cells above&#41; when I select a specific cell to edit&#47;add text to.</h2>
                    <p>Excel will not select the cell I am clicking on, always selects a couple of cells above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this issue for coming on nearly a year and all of Microsofts workarounds have been pathetic if I'm truly being honest.</p>
<p>Update the software, move this file here, uncheck this box,.... The list goes on but none of it has worked and this is infuriating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue came about in March/April of 2018 and was present for approximately a few months before magically the issue stopped. I had approximately 6 solid months where not once did the issue occur. Then today, out of the blue, the issue comes back and is
 now occurring even more frequently than previously. My only workaround at present is to save my file, close excel and re-open and I've now done that about 45 times in the space of a couple of hours! Simply an atrocious workaround for a Microsoft paid product,
 given there is no permanent solution or fix from what I have been told.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone at all has any suggestions (other than the usual updates, restarts, zoom levels etc which I have already done) they would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Microsoft Excel version:&nbsp;16.21.1 on a 2016 Macbook Air with the latest OS. Also happy to provide a video of what is happening if anyone is unsure what I mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me get this resolved and thanks in advance for any responses!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. Open any Office application</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any add-ins such as WebEx, Mendelay, EndNote, Zotero, TypeIt4me, etc<strong> it is essential that you install the latest updates for your add-ins</strong>. This includes font management add-ins, such as Suitcase. If you use Suitcase, you
 should have at least version 9.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get version 16.23 by joining Insider Fast. These are pre-beta builds that have fixes in testing and sometimes new features to try out. The builds are weekly. To join Insider Fast go to the Help menu in Excel and choose Check for Updates to launch
 AutoUpdate app. In AutoUpdate click the box to join the Insider program, then click the pop-up and switch it to Insider Fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very annoying bug, so it might be worth it to get the latest build.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before starting the troubleshooting steps just a few quick questions:</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is the version of Adobe reader installed on the system? Ensure you have installed the latest version/updates for Acrobat.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does Word crash only when you check the option
<b>Create bookmark </b>using<b> heading</b>? Save a Word file as PDF without checking the option and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Also provide us the event viewer logs for Word crash. Refer the link mentioned below to check the event viewer logs:</span></p>

            <p>Hi Bakasan90,<br />
<br />
</p>
The issue may be caused by the reason that you don’t have Send on Behalf permission or Send As permission to the mailbox. Please let the user grant you one of the permissions to try to resolve the issue. For the detailed information, you can click the following
 link for help:
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2518898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2518898</a><br />
<span>Also please try the steps below to see if there is any improvement:</span><br />
<span>Delete autocomplete and retyping the email address. For deleting autocomplete, please go to File
</span><span>→</span><span> Options
</span><span>→</span><span> Mail
</span><span>→</span><span> click Empty Auto-Complete list under Send messages.</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I’d like to collect the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1. I have sent you a private message to collect the entire NDR message for further check. Here is the link to access the private message.<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list</a><br />
2.Where are you experiencing the issue, in the Outlook client or OWA (Outlook Web App)? Does it work fine in OWA?</p>
<p>3. Based on part of the NDR message provided, it seems the email you were trying to forward wasn’t sent to your own mailbox, right? If so, please further check if you’ve been granted Send as or Send On Behalf permission of that mailbox.<br />
4. Could you forward any other emails from the affected mailbox successfully?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

<p>I am having the same problem. I am trying to Skype call someone and it immediately goes to Call Ended. No error message. I followed the instructions above to Reset the application and am having the same problem. No change.</p>
<p>Version of Skype: 12.1809.217.0</p>
<p>I'm on broadband and have tried calling the person on my iPhone via Skype. That appears to work.</p>
<p>This problem occurs only on one connection/person that I know of. The others are working. The person I'm trying to call is on Skype for Business. I am not.</p>
<p>I need to call this person on my computer so he can view files with me.</p>

    <title>Outlook keep prompting for password with Federated MFA enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook keep prompting for password with Federated MFA enabled</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone encounters that Outlook will keep prompting for password when a federated identity with O365 with MFA enabled?
</p>
<p>For Skype for Business, I can see the federated login page and subsequently the MFA prompt. However, for Outlook, all I see is a flash of a blank screen and then it fails and said in the status bar it need password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At times, I can sign out of Skype for Business and then re-login, it'll work for Outlook, but after some time (random), the password will be prompted again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi aL-G,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For keep prompting for password, please try following steps to clean your credential to check the outcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Type "<strong>Credential Manager</strong>” in the search box of computer &gt; Click “<strong>Credential Manager</strong>”.</p>
<p>2. Click “<strong>Windows Credentials</strong>” &gt; “<strong>Generic Credentials</strong>”, you will most likely see the entries about the email account of the user.<br />
3. Delete them.&nbsp;<br />
4. Restart outlook, you should type your password /app password again and select the option to remember it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after you tried above, please try to create an app password for your Office 365 account that enabled MFA. If you are an end user, firstly, you should contact your Office 365 admin to enable "<strong>Allow users to create app passwords
 to sign into non-browser apps</strong>" in Admin Center.</p>

            Hi,<br />

One of the possible reasons why you are having this error is when the recipient's mailbox has been moved and the Outlook recipient cache on the sender's computer is not updated. To resolve this issue, follow the troubleshooting steps provided on this

    <title>Cannot receive calls from landline telephone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john voltz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot receive calls from landline telephone</h2>
                    Dialing my Skype number from my work phone (landline) results in "Your call cannot be completed at this time". My phone (CAT S60) is connected to the office WiFi and the Skype app is running. My coworker can call my Skype number from his mobile phone,
 and it works fine. Is this a typical issue? I was hoping to use Skype inside the building because the cellular signal in here is terrible. I may just cancel my account if this won't work.

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking the account you have used in signing in to the community, we found out the Skype Number and had tested a call from a landline&nbsp;which pushed through. In your case, it is likely that your company&nbsp;put on&nbsp;restrictions on using the specific landline
 in reaching your Skype Number. I&nbsp;suggest that you try first and consult&nbsp;this with your IT&nbsp;Department in order for them to verify and double check any restrictions in dialing any landline/mobile numbers outside the company.

</p><p>The Skype Number should still work as long as you are connected to the internet even you are out of the country. We verified&nbsp;and checked the account you have used in signing in to the community and found out the Skype Number you reported. We also tried to
 test&nbsp;a call to that number using a landline and it appear to be ringing. With this said, you might want to let them call again the Skype Number again&nbsp;including the country code on their phones.

</p><p>yes, my problem is solved. There were two problems and I am not sure now when I posted. My first problem was with a Skype number I’d had for awhile. Evidently it had been disconnected from my identity and no longer received calls. We then set up a new skype
 number associated with my account, &nbsp;and with that new number, the inability to receive calls was a simple misdial problem: the caller had a digit wrong. It works fine now. Thank you!</p>

            Sometimes, it takes upto 24 hours for subscription to reflect in the account.
<br />
<br />1. Can you login to Online Onedrive and confirm back to me whether you don't see your increased storage there?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a>
<br />
<br />2. Also login to your MS Account and see whether you see your purchased subscriptions under Subscription
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/</a>
<br />
<br />3. If subscription is not activated and 24 hours have passed, I would recommend that you should contact Microsoft Support to get this resolved. Use below option to reach out to Microsoft Support.
<br />
<br />By Phone - You can talk to support by picking up appropriate country

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hello. I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.<br /><br />In order to check the upgrade for your OneDrive account, please Log out and Log In back to your account, then click in the Configuration Icon &gt;&gt; Options &gt;&gt; Management Storage, in case didn't show you the storage you paid for it, some times it takes 24 hours after you make the payment to reflect the upgrade in your account. <br /><br />In case after 24 hours didn't show the upgrade, I suggest you to contact Microsoft to check your account and the status for the Upgrade you paid. <br /><br />Best Regards

            Thank you for your help so far. In OneDrive live, it does reflect the new storage and says I have used 259MB out of a 1TB allowance. However, every time I try to upload and sync my files, OneDrive says I am over the storage limit and the account will be
 frozen.&nbsp;
