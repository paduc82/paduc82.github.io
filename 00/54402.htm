<h2>            Windows 7 Spinning Blue Circle on portions of desktop</h2>
                    At times, part of my Win 7 64-bit desktop will freeze, showing the spinning blue circle busy icon. Clicking on the program shortcuts in that area does nothing. If I move the cursor to&nbsp;other parts of the desktop, the normal cursor appears, and the program
 shortcuts work. I've seen on this and other forums attempts to deal with this or similar&nbsp;issues using "guess work" suggestions, such as running malware scans or perhaps system scan. I'd like to know if someone actually knows what causes this specific problem.

            From your response, Amrita, I assume that you don't know the answer to the question I asked. Chances are, if I reboot, even a regular reboot, the problem will be gone, only to reappear, most likely, another time. It would, most likely, take me a couple
 of months to do reboots and add various programs back into the mix, then wait for days to see if the problem&nbsp;occurs.&nbsp;The approach you suggest simply is not practical. I use a large number of programs, and all my programs, with the possible exception of Internet
 Explorer, seem to work fine. (Since&nbsp;IE is&nbsp;a Microsoft product, it's not surprizing that it has problems.) I keep six or seven jobs going all the time, in various states of completeness, so my PC stays on most of the time. Rebooting takes too long and is a
 serious impediment to the way I work.&nbsp;Is there anyone at Microsoft who actually understands how these machines work? I mean, what would cause a part of the desktop to just quit working while other parts continue t

            <p>When you say part of the Desktop freezes with the spinning blue circle , is it on the Internet Explorer window only?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This is usually an indication of a application hang. It therefore usually only effects the window of that application.
</p>
<p>What causes it is not easiliy determined given the vast possible combinations of both software and hardware that any individual computer is comprised of.</p>

            <p>It's 2012 and I have been having the same problem. New windows 7 64 bit&nbsp;computer and have had virus protection on it since day one. I went to my task manager and started elimiinating one process after another as their were no applications running. My little
 blue spinning cursor circle would spin intermittantly and it was driving me buggy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok I cam on rundll 32 exe and wondered what the heck was that for on my 64 bit machine. There were two processes with essentially same name and little reading I did says that's not unusual. After deleting them both my spinning circle problem has gone away.
 Now I'm just waiting to see what I might have "messed up". If I don't need that process and it is the source of my spinning circle then how can I stop it from initiating each time I boot up?</p>

            <p>I have to agree with RevGilm above. I bought a new Samsung high performance (Interl Core 17) labtop last April with Window 7 and IE 9. I use Google about 80+ times a day. About 10% of the time, when I open the Google page there is no problem, but after I
 type in my query and hit enter, I get the spinning blue circle and IE freezes. I have not seen this problem before.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't do games, just normal MS Office and Adobe applications, with McAfee security. No doubt there is some solution out there, but this was the first page that poped up when I googled the question. The proposed answer from Amrita is not very helpful to
 me.&nbsp; I have no idea what "clean boot state" is and how I would know I had the state even if I could obtain it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep looking for answers, but it is an irritation.</p>

I have been blaming MS for months now.&nbsp; In that time, I tried every possible method I could find to solve the VERY annoying problem.&nbsp; I have a wireless Logitec keyboard and mouse and because the mouse cursor was stopping, I finally received a new wireless USB
 device. WOW.&nbsp; No more blue spinning circles, no more stoppages, no more having to reboot.&nbsp; What a difference.&nbsp; Hope this helps someone.&nbsp; I had had the wireless combo for 9 months and it has acted up nearly the entire time.

            It's not just IE.&nbsp; I use Firefox and this happens at least once a day also!&nbsp; The circle spins and I can't do anything -- not even to stop processes (CTRL-ALT-DEL) and I have to turn the computer off manually.&nbsp; I just got a new moust (not wireless).&nbsp; Maybe
 it's the mouse....<br />

            I was having the same problem and came across a website saying if you don't use iTunes or any apple products, to uninstall them.&nbsp; Worked like a charm.&nbsp; No more blue circle and computer stopped acting up.&nbsp; I only did this an hour ago, so if the problem
 returns, I'll post it.&nbsp; So far, so good.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;one Exchange 2010 SP3 RU10 on-prem mailbox and&nbsp;two Office365 mailboxes that I use on a regular basis.&nbsp; If I configure all 3 of these accounts in the Windows Mail app, the "Service Host: Local System" process continuously uses 20-30% CPU.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the Exchange 2010 mailbox, utilization returns to normal.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted on the status of the issue. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the few things we would want to know in order to identify the issue.&nbsp; Please follow below.</p>
<p>1. Have you install any recent Windows updates on your computer?<br />
2. Have you made any software changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
3. What is the name of Antivirus program installed on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now refer to the below recommended methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if the issue is being caused by a third party application/software. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A.</span></span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>B. To disable any 3<sup>rd</sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
</span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue may happen due to system file corruption. I suggest you to run System file checker. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Kindly follow
 the below given steps:</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press

<p>I've set feedback and still have simular issue. &nbsp;I have to screen shots now of what happens, and that's hard to do because when it doesn't load completely I have to in through pictures to open up paint to put screen shot in. &nbsp;The window does not work but
 if I right click options come up to get things like shut down. &nbsp;Some times it does not shut down and have to hold button and then reboot. &nbsp;I think something is hung up but can't find way to get into history to see if there are updates that didn't load right.
 &nbsp;Been over a month now so we need to find a way to fix. &nbsp;All the other computers are fine with upgrade but the Dell all in One 2330 64bit system that upgraded from Windows 7. &nbsp;On the old laptop I got the fixes here so as always I look to the Community and
 Microsoft for help. &nbsp;Hopefully you can see the pictures of the screens that I get. &nbsp;when it happens edge is only black and ie has top but no picture, it's set for bing, just grey screen</p>

            <p>I've already downloaded these with no success .</p>
<p>Too many hardware problems to think it's not software , could there be a bus problem ?</p>
<p>Sorry I should have indicated I'm in Ireland , Europe , and went into the Toshiba Europe site , I've run the diagnostics on the computer and checked for updates .
</p>
<p>I now have the dreaded X in the red circle on the speaker icon , got rid of it before trying to get the sound back .
</p>
<p>I was getting a 'screen flicker' , googled , and found that it's a problem with laptops and reinserted the&nbsp;screen connection , it was after this that I lost sound .</p>
<p>I also used a 32Gb SDHC card in the reader with 1080&nbsp;HD footage from a GoPro 2 HD camera around the same time , the recommended hardware spec for download is higher than the laptop spec . I had downloaded successfully from this card with 17Gb of 1080 and
 can still play1080 HD&nbsp;&nbsp;mpeg4 direct from the camera through the USB2 connection , with no sound .</p>
<p>I have also upgraded from Vista to 7 , thinking that the drivers would update as well .</p>
<p>Probably something very simple , I'm very stuborn lol , and get great satisfaction researching and finding solutions myself . This is the first 'cry for help' , so next step ( which maybe should have been the first lol ) will be to take it to a professional
 . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for any help . </p>

                    <p>I am trying to use Windows Movie Maker to take a photo and add music from an mp3 file. &nbsp;Movie Maker only loads 7 seconds of the music file and there is no sound. &nbsp;Do you know what could be wrong? &nbsp;I'm pretty surprised. &nbsp;This music file plays fine on WMA.
 &nbsp;Movie Maker version is 2012 16.4.3508.0205.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to play a movie in Movie Maker. &nbsp;Again no sound. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never tried Movie Maker on Window 8.1. &nbsp;Is there an issue with this combination?</p>

<p>So i am 22 years old, and about to be 23. I have played xbox for 3 years with no problems... until I got an xbox one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When i bought the xbox i couldnt live stream on twitch, the reason why i bought the console in the first place, but i cant do that because it says i am to young to do so. I have contacted xbox support a number of times and did NOTHING!, to help. I have also
 talked to Xbox Ambassodors, and they helped way more than the "custom support employees."</p>

<p>I need this fixed right away!&nbsp;</p>

            That has been in Windows 10 since version 1511. Its called Windows Spotlight and provides information about the dynamic lock screen images that change. 
<br />
<br />If you don't want to see it, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen
<br />Click in the Background list box
<br />Choose Picture instead of Windows Spotlight

<h2>            Losing internet connection briefly and packet loss</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
<p>Hi, I have an annoying problem with my internet connection. It's mainly noticeable while playing online games or talking on skype, where constant internet connection is essential. I keep losing connection to the internet, while still maintaining connection
 with router. The connection loss lasts only a few seconds, and happens every minute or so. I tried reinstalling my WiFi drivers along with any other network related drivers, but no help. I tried resetting the network adapter, turning off any power saving features
 that could get in the way of my connection, but nothing works. I would like to point out that I tried it on different networks, and the problem persists, and only on my laptop. I tried doing a simple ping test in command prompt, pinging at google.com and there's
 packet loss (request timed out) followed by a brief spike in ping (1000-3000ms), before going back to normal (30-45ms). Packets lost account for ~4% of all pings, and seem to come randomly. They also happens precisely when the internet lags happen. I have
 not tried connecting via Ethernet cable yet, but I need to point out that WiFi connection is essential for me.
</p>
<p>Please help, I'm running out of ideas.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem as you earlier. What I did to solve it was to take off the wireless wi-fi adapter and use an Ethernet cable instant. In my case, the adapter was always crashing because it was too old and not compatible with the other components of
 my pc and now it's working really well :).</p>
<p>I hope my answer will help you.</p>

            Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, if you read my question, I said that wifi is essential to me. I cant have cable connection because I need to connect to various networks in various places. I will wait for a more technical solution, if there is any.

<h2>            MP3 player and KB 928439 fails to install - Error code 80070005  </h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have recently got a problem with Vista Home Premium SP2 suddenly refusing to recognise my Creative Zen MP3 player although the player is being charged when the device is installed.<br />
<br />
When I plug the Zen in to a USB port it says 'installing device driver software' then informs me that 'Device driver software was not successfully installed - MTP Device'. This is regardless of whether I am using a USB hub or one of the motherboard USB ports.<br />
<br />
In device manager under&nbsp;Portable Devices is&nbsp;an MTP device with a yellow exclamation mark and I am told 'This device cannot start (code 10)'.&nbsp;I am offered the possibility of checking for solutions with Microsoft. This does not&nbsp;produce anything -&nbsp;neither a result
 nor anything else for that matter!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
From searching the net and this forum I have found and tried a&nbsp;number of soilutions, but to no avail. However there is&nbsp;one thing&nbsp;I have not managed to try namely Fixit. However this requires Windows&nbsp;Power Shell and when&nbsp;I try to install this it requires KB
 928439 and this patch consistently fails to install&nbsp;with the&nbsp;error code 80070005.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for solving the original problem&nbsp;with the&nbsp;MP3 player or the installation of Windows&nbsp;Power Shell would be greatly appriciated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Martin&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>scenario 1:</strong> <strong>This device cannot start code 10.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I recommend you to update the graphic drivers and see if it makes any difference. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, locate the device, and then double-click the device name.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now try to follow the below provided link to Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly and check for the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Visit your hardware manufacturer's website to get the latest drivers for the device.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>scenario 2:</strong> To troubleshoot the issue "KB 928439 fails to install with Error code 80070005"<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Reset windows update components and then try to install the updates and see if the installation completes. Open the below link and click on the Fix it button.<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If this does not help you try the next method.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong><br />
<strong>Try to download and install the updates manually. Visit the link and enter the KB number</strong>&nbsp;<strong>for the updates and download the same.</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</span></a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Try all the steps suggested from the below link.</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822798</span></a><br />

<h2>            If a sell a computer after free Win10 upgrade, does the license go with the computer or is it tied to Microsoft Account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a tablet that came with Windows 7 Pro OEM license that I want to sell.&nbsp; Clearly Windows 10 is a better touch experience than Windows 7, so I would prefer to upgrade it to Windows 10 and&nbsp;show that the device is fully compatible before selling it to
 a user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I read that a signature of your device is somehow saved in the Windows store (or other online data store) to show that a device qualifies for Windows 10 as long as you performed the free upgrade from a genuine version of Windows 7/8.x, and that
 this was how you could perform a clean install of Windows 10 later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, does the Windows 10 license fully transfer with the device&nbsp;when I sell it, or is it somehow associated with my user account?</p>

<div>I don't know how long you have owned your computer, but I think that you should contact the manufacturer and get whatever hardware problems sorted at your earliest convenience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>BTW, Microsoft do NOT recommend Regworks. The webpage advert just looked like it did. You need to uninstall Regworks. If it will not uninstall, do a manufacturer destructive recovery, and do NOT ever install it or anything like it again..</div>

<p>Yes, the computer was like this from new, it was bought some month ago in sweden, however&nbsp;I&nbsp;live in the UK now.</p>
<p>if i have to have them repair anything, it means i have to ship the whole computer back to sweden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it has a small amount of bluescreens to start with, but became worse 3 weeks ago. with regwork, it is not as bad, so i think it might be windows 7 causing it.</p>
<p>i have used windows since 3.11 and seen many bluescreens. but this has been far the worst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you have an advert like that? what can it cause to my system?</p>
<p>i spend £33 on it, and have now canseled it. and will try to get my money back.</p>

<p><span>Were you provided with any disks identifying the motherboard make and model? With a problem a problem of this type you routinely check for updated motherboard and graphics driver.
 It is often best not to rely on Microsoft for updated drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Mike has suggested checking RAM and this may uncover the problem. However, testing RAM does not always reveal defective memory. If your computer was in the manufacturer’s workshop
 replacing existing memory with new memory is often tried with a good outcome. This is most likely not practical in your situation so you need to bear this in mind as you may need to return the computer to Sweden for repair.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are there any signs of overheating? Are the fans working? Is the inside of the casing free of dust? With a laptop this is not easy to check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Were you provided with a User Manual providing practical advice on maintaining the hardware component in your computer?</span></p>

Hope this helps, Gerry Cornell

<p><span>Thanks to everyone so far, the RAM test ran for some 3 hours, both on basic and advanced, and with no result.</span></p>
<p><span>We are talking about a stationary, and it has a coolermaster tower, with loads of huge fans, so overheating isent the problem as far
 as i know.</span></p>
<p><span>The only fault is the SQL database, that is a microsoft office small business</span></p>
<p><span>Check below for the test and what i bought</span></p>

            <p>Hi ShariKB,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the exact error message in device manager?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How long have you been facing this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any security software installed on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to follow steps from the Microsoft article and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>No sound in Windows</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/no-sound-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/no-sound-in-windows</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with
 your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the
 Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data
 available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

<h3> o0 darklotus 0o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Basically, I lost my account several years ago and since then it's been haunting me. The gamertag (only part of the account I remember) was A1phanoob. With this information I need to find a way to recover the email address associated with the account. With
 that info, I would be able to get my account back. I don't need some personal hacker or anything, I'm confident that I could recover the account if I only had the email. The account was lost years before two step verification was implied. So my question is,
 how do I get the email address from a gamertag? And I needed the email... not *******l@****.com that's useless. I've called Microsoft for (almost hundreds of) hours about this and have been no closer to a solution for nearly ten years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can understand your frustration I too have an account that I can not remember the email to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to think of it this way though:</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS takes account security seriously say you beat someone in a game and they get mad (all they have is your gamertag) and decide they want to mess with your account so they call MS and say hey this is my gamertag and I forgot what email I had associated with
 it can you give it to me. I know I personally would want MS to verify that it is me calling before they give out any of my account information.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Basically, I lost my account several years ago and ... I've called Microsoft for (almost hundreds of) hours about this and have been no closer to a solution for nearly ten years.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several years ago, hackers managed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
social engineer</a> untrained support personnel in giving access to other people's account. The hackers provided "enough" personal information, to make it seem that the hacker is indeed the rightful owner of the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent that from happening again, the support is now more careful, and needs more information to be able to get your account back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, that if you forgot your email, and used fake information for birthdates, or home address or don't have access to other security info put into the account like secondary email addresses or phone numbers, then the chances are very slim that
 the support will believe you that the account was yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please use email accounts that you actually use regularly. Microsoft does not spam you and does not sell your email to advertising companies (unless you give them permission to do so for marketing purposes by setting a checkmark, or adding your email
 to their marketing list).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if support or the instructions at&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/forgot-microsoft-account-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/forgot-microsoft-account-solution</a>&nbsp;don't
 help, I'm afraid you have now lost your account.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you cannot open Mail due to the error you are receiving. What I can suggest is for you to follow the steps provided on this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-signin/windows-live-mail-fails-to-launch-error-unable-to/9c3763ad-312f-4994-9fef-ab6bf21c06a8">
<strong>post</strong></a> and update us afterwards.</p>

            The fix in the linked post did not work for me. &nbsp;After I removed the suggested file, Windows Live Mail still would not open. &nbsp;Upon attempting to open the app, an immediate window opened, prompting 'Checking for a solution and closing program.' &nbsp;A more
 comprehensive folder describing how to fix issues with Windows Live Mail would be appreciated, a link perhaps, in case I missed it (which I would guess that I have.)&nbsp;

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c4d984d6-a7b6-451e-86e8-e76e5d447fa6" title="pyne">

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here and sorry to hear that the steps provided in the link didn't work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate if this issue is not caused by any corrupted files in your system, we request you to repair Windows Essentials on your PC. To do this, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the
<strong>Windows</strong> button + <strong>R</strong>, input <strong>AppWiz.cpl</strong>, then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Search for
<strong>Windows Essentials 2012</strong> on the list and then select it.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
Uninstall/Change.</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> </span>
</li><li><span>Click <strong>
Repair all Windows Essentials programs</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>If issue persists, kindly try to repair Mail.MsMessageStore file as this file&nbsp;may be corrupted. You can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Restart the computer (This is to ensure that Live Mail is fully shut down, and that none of its components are in use when the computer starts).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Click the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button then&nbsp;type <strong>CMD</strong> but do not press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. You will see cmd.exe in the search results, right-click on it and select <strong>
Run as Administrator</strong> (Type your admin password if asked, and if UAC pops up asking premission, allow it)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. You should now see the command prompt, with the following displayed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>C:\Windows\system32&gt;</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Copy the following (Press <strong>Ctrl+C</strong>):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>esentutl.exe -d "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Mail.MSMessageStore"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The "" are necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Right-click in the command prompt window, and select <strong>Paste</strong>, so you now see the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>C:\Windows\system32&gt;esentutl.exe -d "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Mail.MSMessageStore"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Press <strong>Enter</strong>. esentutl will now defragment the Live Mail database file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Once done, you can close the command prompt, and restart the PC again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please get back to us with the results after following the steps above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Glenda</p>
