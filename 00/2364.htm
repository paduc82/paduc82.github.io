<h2>            How can I disable &#34;You should only open attachments from a trustworthy source.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_other/how-to-disable-the-warning-on-opening-any/ec5a281d-33e0-476f-b0f8-c41a472b8967</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works for several hours or perhaps one day, then reverts back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, numerous people have been trying to solve this for many weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 Pro, Office 2016, all updated to latest on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this sounds like hyperbole, but this behavior is DESTROYING productivity over here - there's a dozen people processing hundreds and hundreds of emails as a full time job, and every single email contains a pdf attachment (part of an offsite workflow),
 and every single pdf needs to be opened and saved. It's driving everyone absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can someone please (PLEASE!) help me find a way to make this prompt go away permanently? Trust / security is not a problem - we are willing to accept any solution regardless of necessary permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks, however as stated, that doesn't work. At least not permanently - only for a few hours or a day or two at most. This is the reason for my post in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a permanent...or at least semi-permanent solution that doesn't have to be re-implemented across all the machines on a daily basis.</p>

            <p>OK, the problem seems to have subsided for now. I literally did nothing whatsoever except use outlook as normal, just as I have since install - no further troubleshooting or attempts to fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been two weeks and the problem seems to have disappeared (for now?). It had been going on across my personal computer, as well as all the machines at my family's shop for months and months, then it simply stopped doing it within a week of my posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost as if Microsoft reached in and fixed something (I wonder what's in all that "telemetry data")!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, all's well that ends well I guess, but I did not receive a solution here so that's why I'm not marking it as "answered".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all the same to everyone for trying though.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 - cannot connect - the server you are connected to is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> choco_859  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - cannot connect - the server you are connected to is using a security certificate that cannot be verified</h2>
                    <p>
Please help. I set up my domain email on Outlook 2016 successfully recently, but when I open Outlook now, I am getting the following popups:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1040684" /></p>
<p>
I pressed View Certificate, resulting in the following tabs:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1040685" /></p>
<p>

<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1040687" /></p>
<p>

<p>
So then, I pressed Install Certificate:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1040691" /></p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1040692" /></p>
<p>
The installation was successful, but nothing changed. When I restart my PC and Outlook, the same message (picture 1) popped up again. I am no longer able to send/view new emails in Outlook, and my signatures are not automatically displaying when I press compose
 new messages either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Please advise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks!</p>

            Hotmail doesn't change the format. It will be exactly the same as it was when you attached it. If the recipient is clicking athett achment and it is opening in Wordpad then the recipient has Wordpad associated with the paricular file format in Windows
 rather than Word. The recipient should either re-associate the file type with Word (repairing Office should do that) or preferably save the dcoument to the hard drive and open it from Word. That way the recipient will not join the endless queue of users who
 report here daily that they have worked on downloaded documents and lost them when they close Word because they have been saved to temporary locations.<br />

<p>HI,</p>
<p>I need to prepare an application for Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone (320x240). I have that emulator and also displays the application when I debug my project. But I am unable to change the design view of Form at Visual Studio 2005 of that emulator.
 It still shows the previous emulator skin of 176x220. </p>
<p>Please guide me how to change this to my target emulator. So that I can design perfectly in both manner i.e. screen wise &amp; control wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            A comma will often be used as a&nbsp;<em>delimiter</em> to split text into two or more cells. A
<em>tick</em> (aka <em>single quote</em>) that starts a value is used by Excel to explicitly note that the value in the cell is text. This can be used for part numbers, etc. that are a long string of digits that have no mathematical value. A company's DUNS
 number is one example that comes to mind as it often has leading zeroes to accommodate the mandatory nine digit DUNs identifier.

<p>
</p><p>For the past few months, my Hotmail account freezes numerous times while in use.&nbsp; Every single time I use it, which is often.&nbsp; It ends up crashing and I have to log back in and finish what I was doing.&nbsp; If it doesn't crash, it freezes and takes forever to
 type a simple email.&nbsp; Any one having these issues and/or know of a resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 and use hotmail on Chrome.&nbsp; I've tried to use hotmail in Edge and Internet Explorer with no real improvement.&nbsp; I've cleared my cache, etc. etc.&nbsp; I believe it's something with my hotmail account.</p>

<p>***UPDATE***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got frustrated enough to send in a support ticket to MS. Here is their response to my extensive testing on myriad OS's and browsers!! As you can see, I didn't call out Chrome as a browser that I tested (which I did test
 by the way with similar results) so their advice was to install a different browser as well as disabling my antivirus and any add-ons. Not very helpful in my opinion! Maybe someone else can suggest other solutions?</p>

<br />
I'm Harold and I'm sorry to hear that your account is freezing but don't worry I'll be here to help you out. Let's investigate the concern.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your efforts in doing some troubleshooting steps at your end and I would suggest that you try using a Chrome browser in accessing your account because usually these kinds of errors are caused by the browser and you haven't mentioned Chrome in your
 list of browsers but I'm not sure if it's in the "etc."<br />
<br />
That being said, please use Chrome just to test it out.<br />
<br />
If you don't have Chrome then click here to download and install it: <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I would agree as there is some correlation to when the issue started and when the format changed to include the "Upgrade to Premium" and ad window. I guess all good things must come to an end.....at least the "free" ones :(

    <title>Classification and Label options missing in O365 E5 trial - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Classification and Label options missing in O365 E5 trial</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5 to set up a test/dev environment and it seems that many options under classification and labels are missing. For example, when you create a label and edit it, the Encryption, DLP, etc. tabs are not there.
 It's also missing the Sensitivity and Retention tabs at the top of the screen when on the main Labels screen. Does anyone know why that may be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

&nbsp;Hi Jimminy,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
According to my research, the Classification an Label options don't contains the items you mentioned such as Data Loss protection. To find Data loss prevention within Office 365, please refer to the following link:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/prevent-data-loss-in-office-365-6a888faa-c114-4395-b20d-a5b8ebd1ac0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/prevent-data-loss-in-office-365-6a888faa-c114-4395-b20d-a5b8ebd1ac0c</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following picture shows the classification and label options on my side, would you please help compare it with your to check the difference? You can also attach a screenshot to give
 us a better understanding of the scenario you meet.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. Here's a screenshot of the label page our existing O365 environment:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86b282fb-be43-45b8-bd42-0159b88d47e0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86b282fb-be43-45b8-bd42-0159b88d47e0?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the label properties:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cce2da4f-cb00-4afd-95af-f92287c191f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cce2da4f-cb00-4afd-95af-f92287c191f4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here are the same screens in my trial. Labels:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87c54522-6f55-4936-bf8b-d80a76545770?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87c54522-6f55-4936-bf8b-d80a76545770?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Label properties:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14910b8d-62f6-4c68-9cd3-6509391fb0a7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14910b8d-62f6-4c68-9cd3-6509391fb0a7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice the missing Sensitivity and Retention tabs in the 1st screenshot, and the number of side tabs missing in the second. Very odd, feels like something is not enabled that would show those options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>After doing some more research, it looks like those new options may be part of a later release that we get because we're on the Targeted Release track, rather than the Standard. For anyone who is having the same issue, go to Settings, Organizational Profile
 in the Admin console - the option to change that is in the "Release Preferences" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've switched the test environment to targeted now. No way to force the update so I'll have to wait a bit to confirm this, but it looks pretty likely.</p>

                    Is anyone else having trouble with the data usage app on Windows Phone 10? I have a Lumia 950. It is very inaccurate. Is there a way to reset it so that it works properly? Also, the live tile only displays Wi-Fi usage. And not cellular data. Microsoft,
 please help.

<p>Weird. The app works fine for me. Try removing your sim card and see the app again. Try a soft reset(Vol. Down+ power) and see if the app works.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Outlook 365 Notifications</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the Outlook 2013 client with Windows 10. New mail notifications are showing up in the Action Center. However when I click on one of the new&nbsp;mail notifications I was&nbsp;thinking the message should open up in the Outlook client. Instead clicking the
 new mail notification simply dismisses the message and removes it from the list. Is that the expected behavior?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, however I have checked all of the above and there is nothing wrong that I can see.&nbsp; I have no junk mail, no blocked addresses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have never had Hotmail so these settings all appear to be about Hotmail.&nbsp; Maybe you are telling me that once I joined Outlook I then became a Hotmail user.&nbsp; Is that correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have/had Verizon for my email.&nbsp; I am receiving email from two accounts it appears fine.&nbsp; It is from my main account that every day I get the message that there is problem with getting email from this account.&nbsp; The details say:&nbsp;
</p>
<li>You can send email from this account.</li><li>1:35 AM We couldn't get your messages: Please wait for a moment. The problem should be fixed soon.<br />
<br />
Trying to communicate from a bulletin board is not my idea of help.&nbsp; This just turns into going in circles.&nbsp; I will look for another email program that is functional.&nbsp; Have never&nbsp; had these problems in the past and no reason to be having them now.&nbsp; If two accounts
 are working and set up the same way as my main account that defies logic. <br />
<br />
When these things are happening we need someone from Outlook to actually view the same thing we are looking at and resolve the issues.&nbsp; That would save a lot of this back and forth.&nbsp;

            <p>After more research, it is my understanding now there are two different Outlook email programs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one you register at Outlook.com and the one you set up through MS Office 2010.&nbsp; They appear to be two entirely different things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this correct?</p>

            My problem is <u><b>all</b></u> my Verizon mail (not my just my contact list) that I always had coming into my MSN mail, was not coming into my Outlook.com mail since Microsoft changed me to Outlook.com.&nbsp; I would get something a day later, sometimes not
 at all.&nbsp; I checked everything.&nbsp; All the settings were accurate... pop addresses, etc.&nbsp; I waited until yesterday to delete my Verizon and then added it back into Outlook.com.&nbsp; So today I got 8,000+ e-mails in my Verizon folder. That was the reason why I waited,
 but figured it was my last option.&nbsp; I have been testing it since day one by sending myself a test e-mail.&nbsp; It seems there is no problem when I send an e-mail, but getting my e-mails from my Verizon account is ridiculous.&nbsp; I sent myself a test from Outlook.com
 to my Verizon address at 10:51 this morning and am still waiting for it to come in.&nbsp; It is on my Verizon site.&nbsp; I left it as unread, and I keep checking Outlook for it to come in.&nbsp; Almost an hour later, and still nothing.&nbsp; This morning I finally got the tests
 I sent during the day yesterday.&nbsp; My MSN e-mail comes through immediately.&nbsp; I sure hope this can be resolved really soon, as it is becoming a job to get to my Verizon mail.&nbsp; Please Help!!! Thanks!<br />

            And that is exactly why I switched to Thunderbird.&nbsp; No problems, no issues.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I fought with the Outlook Program long enough with no resolution.&nbsp; It takes an actual person to really look and see what's going on because there are far too many who have experienced the issues we speak of.&nbsp; I simply don't have time for it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Word 2010 VBA - Select just one picture in the header</h2>
                    <p>I've written some code to&nbsp;run when&nbsp;a document is printed and ask the user&nbsp;if they want to hide the header image before&nbsp;printing (depends on whether they are printing on pre-printed stationery).&nbsp; Anyway I&nbsp;managed to get it working by using the following code
 that makes ALL pictures in the header invisible which is ok in this instance.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I had two pictures in the header how would&nbsp;I edit the code to select just one of the pictures please?<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Sections(1).Headers(wdHeaderFooterFirstPage).Range.ShapeRange.Visible = msoFalse<br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions very welcome. Many thanks</p>

            The IMEI number which starts with 35 is the serial number.<br />
<br />
You can also get the number by dialing *#06# on the phones mains screen.

<p>Does this occur only when using IE8 or does it occur on all screens including the desktop?</p>
<p><span><span>Try reviewing the following article:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Tips for solving problems with Internet Explorer
<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-Internet-Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-Internet-Explorer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't resolve the problem, then try the following two procedures in the order presented:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Troubleshooting and Internet Explorer’s (No Add-ons) Mode [Applies to IE7 &amp; IE8 in all OSS]<br />
</span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/25/678113.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/25/678113.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Does the behavior persist if you Reset IE Advanced settings (RIES)?<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hopefully, one of these procedures will resolve your problems with IE if that's the cause of the problem.&nbsp; If the problem persists, then chances are good that
 IE is not the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>If these don't resolve the problem, then I would suggest you udate you video card and monitor device drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type
 device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further
 details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you do for your video card and monitor), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows
 Update as follows: </span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:

    <title>Office 365 - Desktop Excel co-authoring problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 - Desktop Excel co-authoring problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I`m on Office 365 E3 trial and having some issues with desktop excel co-authoring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When 2 users are editing an Excel file, one in desktop and other on web, it`s possible to co-author and edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, when both users are on Desktop Excel, I have a message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This file is locked for editing by user X".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening the Excel file direct from sharepoint and opening with local sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw this posts and verified all questions: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-co-authoring-in-Office-bd481512-3f3a-4b6d-b7eb-ebf9d3626ae7?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is a single issue: Office Version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of PCs have 1711 and other 1705, but I downloaded both today and OS systems are windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone can help?</p>

    <title>How to save multiple sorting orders for same spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marchoshovsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to save multiple sorting orders for same spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>If you have a spreadsheet that you need to have repeatedly sorted by different sequences, here's a simple trick. For example, let's say you have a spreadsheet with three columns in it: Animal, Size, and Color. For Purpose 1 (like sharing with your partners),
 you need to sort it by first Animal, then Size, then Color. For Purpose 2 (like to your friends), you need to sort it by Color, Size, and Animal. And you'd like to save these sorting orders so you can use them on your spreadsheet whenever you need to, depending
 on the purpose at hand, rather than re-creating them every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a new column for each sort order. In that column, add a formula that concatenates the information from the columns you want to sort by. If Column A is Animal, Column B is Size, and Column C is Color, and you want it sorted in that order, your formula
 in Column D would be +A&amp;B&amp;C . Column E could be used to sort by Animal (A), Color (C) and Size (B), so the formula here would be +A&amp;C&amp;B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Copy the formulas for all rows in your spreadsheet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When you need to use a specific sort order, sort on the concatenated formula column.

            <p>On the surface, Excel is somewhat lame when it comes to sort order. It only allows you to save one sort order in the spreadsheet.

A view can contain information such as which rows and columns are visible, row height, column width, formatting characteristics, sort order and window size and position. You can define and store several views of data in a worksheet.</span></p>

Sorting text is such a day to day activity that it always surprises me why Excel hasn’t provided a simple spreadsheet formula for doing it. Of course you can use the sorting menu command (menu &gt; data &gt; sort) but this requires manual steps (or VBA). Most of
 the times we get raw textual data from various sources and we need it to be sorted. While fooling with the

<p>Have another trick for sorting, which doesn't require any formulas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet I work with daily that requires me to sort back and forth depending on my need (usually just 2 different ways), but it has cell color sorts, and about 6 layers of sort criteria, so nothing overwhelming, but enough of an issue to sigh
 every time I had to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was clear all the filters, then click Developer tab &gt; Record Macro.&nbsp; Performed my custom sort (just highlighted all cells by clicking the arrow next to the 'A' and above the '1' to make sure a range isn't restricted), custom sort, did my normal
 sort criteria, click ok, then click stop recording on the developer tab.&nbsp; This will capture the range you are sorting (whole sheet in my case) and sort based on your criterias.&nbsp; You'll be able to use a keyboard shortcut (example: ctrl+m) or can make it even
 easier with the extra below step:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did that for both sorts, then I inserted a rectangle on my header row (so it's always visible) named something that tells me which way I'm sorting.&nbsp; Then right click the rectangle and 'assign macro.'&nbsp; Now when I want to sort a different way I just click
 the rectangle and it performs the macro of me sorting, and no more going through those lengthy steps! Yay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>very annoyingly, the photos I've imported into my Word document (Windows 10) are flashing and make it impossible to edit the page, the order of photos, captures etc.&nbsp; Why is this happening and how do I stop them from flashing all the time? They are in jpeg

<p>First, it's a good thing you couldn't call the phone number in the first reply you got. It's a scammer trying to get you to pay for "support", not Microsoft at all. That profile has been reported for abuse.</p>

</p><p>There are no other reports of flashing JPG pictures that I can find, so these are just questions to try to isolate possible causes and some troubleshooting suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the version and build numbers of your Word installation? You can find these by clicking File &gt; Account and looking under the "About Word" heading on the right side.</li><li>How are you inserting the pictures in the text boxes -- by clicking Insert &gt; Picture and selecting a file, or by copy/pasting them from another program? If from another program, which one?</li><li>Do pictures that you insert in regular text or in tables also flash? (Note that you can make a table "float" like a text box by right-clicking the table, clicking Table Properties, and clicking the Around button.)</li><li>Are you adding captions or other text to the text boxes besides the pictures? Are you resizing, cropping, or otherwise editing the pictures?</li><li>Try going to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display and changing the setting of "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" -- that is, check it if it's unchecked, or vice versa.</li><li>At File &gt; Account, click Update Options &gt; Update Now to make sure yo

<h2>            Zune Software Error C00D11CD &#40;C00D1063&#41; on all music in collection.</h2>
                    
<p>Running Windows XP SP3 with latest Zune Software.&nbsp; I had an error message from windows stating that I had a corrupt user profile.&nbsp; I fixed that but now I get the above error code.&nbsp; This appears to affect all music files in the collection.&nbsp; I've never purchased
 from the zune marketplace, and most of the music is DRM free.&nbsp; Both WMP and iTunes will play the content that Zune will not.&nbsp; I've uninstalled and reinstalled the Zune software already, done a DRM reset.</p>

<h3> george alder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Seem To Play .wpl files or add animations to them in PowerPoint &#40;Office 365 ProPlus Version 1807&#41;</h2>
                    I've just purchased a new Surface Pro and using when using PowerPoint Version 1807 when I try and add a .wpl playlist I can't apply/add any of the animations -- the area is greyed out.&nbsp; This is something I've been easily able to do with other/older versions
 of PPT -- I'm just wondering if I'm missing a setting or something.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance of any insight/assistance.

<p>Hi George,</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the files in private message, first, we'd like to explain that in PowerPoint 2016, you need to use the add-on to insert the playlist, for more information, you can refer

<p>3 Windows 10 machines all have the same problem</p>

<p>Similar issue with WIN 10 and 8.1 machines only. WIN 7 are just fine. Excel macro will not export to csv file. I tried the online repair and my Office installation was deleted. What's the deal with that? I'm seeing some other issues with Excel on '16 office
 too. Any other suggestions? Maybe run anti-virus and reboot. &nbsp;</p>
