<h2>            Lost files after changing administrator</h2>
                    <p>Gave laptop to my husband but had to change him to administrator so that my 'microsoft' account stopped changing his desktop/etc. &nbsp;Once I did that the files he was working on are no longer under his account or even under my account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I do go and change us both to administrator but still don't see our old files!!! &nbsp;HELP!!</p>

            <p>Thanks for any assistance you can give, Ruth! &nbsp;</p>
<p>The laptop was originally under my microsoft account. &nbsp;My hubby now uses the computer for golf stats. &nbsp;He was using it under my id, which we didn't realize. &nbsp;When he signed in under his microsoft account, that's when he realized he didn't have the files
 he was updating. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed my hubby to be administrator because he didn't like the fact that when I changed my laptop (font; display/etc.) it would show up on the computer. &nbsp;So I deleted my id and, as stated, made him admin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Windows 10 very much and can understand the syncing to our microsoft accounts...but I don't know how to find my old files now! &nbsp;Even if I add myself I don't see them .</p>
<p>And under the FAQ's the 'users' doesn't show up under the computer managment . &nbsp;I get some error about a snap-in??</p>

            If you deleted your ID then you probably deleted the user files.

    <title>Turtle Beach headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerrudz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turtle Beach headset</h2>
                    Bought a new Turtle Beach Stealth 600 headset, got back to my house, and remembered that my pair button on the side of my xbox is broken. Is there a way to pair the headset without the pair button? I can plug my controller in and pair them, but the headset
 doesn't seem to do the same. I've tried looking it up but can't find any answers. Let me know! Thanks.

<p>Hey there Tyler!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you have found yourself in this predicament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the pair button on the console was originally and to my knowledge only designed to work with controllers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing as that is the first headset designed by Turtle Beach advertised to pair directly to the console, I would suggest talking to them directly and ask if there's any other method or troubleshooting steps that could help connect their product to the Xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give them a visit at <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/pages/contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Turtle Beach support </a>and let us know how that helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Unless there is an USB port somewhere on the headset (it uses a USB charging cable), the only other thing I could think of using is a Cronus MAX, but I don't think that would work with headsets, only controllers.&nbsp; You may need to get the console repaired
 to get the headset to work if the USB cable won't pair it.

            If somebody has the Xbox One controller wireless adaptor for the PC, maybe they can check if that works on the Xbox One? It's a long shot, but hopefully somebody can try it out and get back to you. The adaptor has a pair button on it.

<p>Hello Amin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to manually replace Bluetooth drivers if you install an updated Bluetooth mouse driver. To help you better, can you tell us if you're encountering any error messages? If so, can you please specify?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can manually uninstall device driver from the <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Device Manager
</span>is an application that allows you to manage devices and drivers on your system. You can use Device Manager to uninstall devices and driver packages with some limitations.<span> To do this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Start Control Panel, click <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Expand the node that represents the type of device that you want to uninstall, right-click the device entry, and click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Confirm Device Removal</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong> to start the uninstall process.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the uninstall process is complete, remove the device.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em> With some devices, you might have to restart the system to complete the uninstall process. The device might continue to function until the system has been restarted.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Deleting a Driver Package from the Driver Store</strong></p>
<p>On the <strong>Confirm Device Removal</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong> option to delete the driver package that was used for the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the possible cause of Bluetooth errors are the following: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Problems arising due to the Bluetooth device itself</span></span>&nbsp;</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A newly installed program or software that causes conflicts</span></span>&nbsp;</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Inappropriate operations performed that result in these issues</span></span>&nbsp;</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Outdated or missing Bluetooth drivers</span></span>&nbsp;</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Disabled Bluetooth Support service</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, to resolve errors when using Bluetooth, kindly refer to this support article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Bluetooth problems in Windows 10: FAQ</a></strong>. It would be best also to keep your
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device drivers up to date</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Hi Carlo, Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the troubleshooting<strong>&nbsp;DOES NOT work</strong>. This topic is 5 months old and you've been only posting those stupid troubleshooting intended for people that don't even know how to turn on the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is the outdated driver "<strong>Bluetooth Low energy GATT compliant HID device</strong>" which stopped working since the update to 1703 on Windows 10. Troubleshooting doesn't fix it. Is a software problem. The solution is someone at microsoft
 finally working on solving what they have previously broke.</p>

<p>I searched and found that problem started from version 1703 (exactly: 10.0.15007) when Microsoft&nbsp;updated bluetooth&nbsp;API.</p>
<p>So, to solve this problem Microsft should take action, just that.</p>

    <title>Unformatted external HDD issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petarisawesomeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unformatted external HDD issue</h2>
                    
<p>sorry in advance for a lengthy post, but wanted to include as much detail as possible to get better feedback...I have a 250GB external HDD on my 360. The HDD is at least 2 years old. Roughly 1-2 weeks ago boot up the 360 and it needs a system update. Update
 downloads just fine, system starts up fine, everything works fine. However, I notice that each time I turn on the 360 it is taking a long time to boot up and get to the dashboard menus. Other than the long startup time, no other issues, everything works just
 fine. A few days I turn on the 360 and when it finally loads up my profile is not logged in and it says the external HDD is unformatted. I restart the 360, long load time, but HDD works just fine and games play just fine. This morning the 360 starts up fine
 after a long load time, but when I start playing a game (from HDD not disk) I notice load times are long, audio isn't working properly, and finally the game freezes. I then spend the next hour having to make multiple restarts of the 360. Sometimes it boots
 up and says the HDD is unformatted, sometimes the starts up just fine, but I still have the in-game issues. I finally decide to transfer my profile to the internal HDD and the game saves to the cloud and then reformat the external HDD. After reformat the 360
 boots up just fine, load time even seemed more normal, but hard to tell. I re-download the one game I am currently playing, but had to leave for work so allowed the download to continue with the 360 turned off. So the question is what on earth is going on
 with my external HDD? My initial thought is that its heading for video game heaven, but because sometimes the 360 was booting up like normal and recognizing the data on the HDD maybe there was some corrupted data on it that is now cleared? If it is dying,
 will the reformatting help it get by for a few extra weeks? I just need this thing to last long enough to finish the last few levels on Hitman Absolution and then I was going to upgrade to XBONE. Appreciate any thoughts on this.</p>

            <p>Hey there PetArISawesomeo!</p>
<p>It does sound like the best course of action would be to reformat. For additional information and help, there's a handy troubleshooting guide all about <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 Storage</a> â€” if you scroll down on the article, there's information on how to reformat a storage device at the bottom.</p>
<p>Additionally, we recommend using another storage device if you're able to and see if that helps any.</p>
<p>Let us know how it all goes!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Try rebooting the console without the external HDD. &nbsp;Is it quicker? &nbsp;There is a possibility that the drive is failing. &nbsp;As you said it was quicker??</p>
<p>You could use a USB stick temporarily if you do not have another HDD. &nbsp;this would preserve what is on the drive for transfer. &nbsp;And you can complete your game.</p>
<p>I have a slim with an internal drive that fails continually so only use the external HDD. &nbsp;So the reverse is highly possible - its starts with wanting to be formatted frequently.</p>

    <title>How to reinstall Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firefury  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reinstall Bluetooth</h2>
                    For whatever reason, Bluetooth has completely vanished off of my computer, when I was using it the same day it disappeared (error code 45). I tried doing some research, and I was told that one solution to this is to completely uninstall all Bluetooth-related
 software from the Device Manager settings, and that it would reinstall on its own after the computer was restarted. I uninstalled everything and restarted my computer several times. Bluetooth did not reinstall, and now I am 100% without Bluetooth. How do I
 reinstall Bluetooth?

<h2>            How can in reinstall Win10 after the change of hardware &#40;Hard Disk&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a notebook which currently seems to have an issue with the hard disk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning to change it though and then I looked into the forum concerning re-install of Win10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously I purchased Win8.1 Single Language and then got a free upgrade to Win10.
</p>
<p>One of the forum mentioned that If there's a change in hardware then I have to re-activate the Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's say I manage to change a hard disk and then re-install Windows from disk (8.1) so I have to install Windows twice as from 8.1 to 10? or there is another way to do this like download it from another source?</li><li>So how can you manage a back up (cloud perhaps) so I don't have to actually re-install every settings I've done.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking forward to your kind assistance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reinstall Win 10 directly without installing Win 8.1 first, but you will lose any programs that were preinstalled... Some may be available from the computer's manufacturer to reinstall... here is the link to create a Win 10 Flash Drive or download
 a ISO for a DVD...&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be of the most recent Creators Update... You will need to run a tool that downloads\installs from the website..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to maintain your settings would be to create an image of your current HDD to a external drive, and then reload it onto the new one...</p>
<p>Saving the image to the Cloud would most likely not work due to possibly being unable to access it when needed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 can create an image, but the drive must be the same size or larger...</p>
<p>You would need either a Windows Recovery CD or bootable installation media to reload the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be a bootable 3rd party imaging\cloning tool... I believe Macrium Reflect has a free version...</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB2920189 Downloads but Will Not Install</h2>
                    My PC came with Windows 8. &nbsp;I updated to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I was offered Windows 10 but the download/install failed. I continued running 8.1 but began noticing the fan on the HP Pavillion bursting on and other slowdowns, etc. &nbsp; I eventually restored the computer
 back to the factory settings which took me back to Windows 8 (after hours on remote control with Microsoft support and five different support people that did who knows to my PC without fixing the problem). &nbsp;After the restore, I proceeded to install all Windows
 Updates so that I could get back to Windows 8.1 and then on to Windows 10. &nbsp;WELL, I am able to install every Update except KB 2920189. &nbsp;In addition to giving Microsoft remote control of my PC and everything they did, I have tried to following: &nbsp;Disabling the
 Windows Firewall, Disabling Norton, disconnecting from my home network and running off of my Verizon hotspot, running the Update Troubleshooter, Doing a clean boot, Resetting Windows Upda

            <p>For those having this extremely issue (regular users of technology that know enough to be dangerous but are not technology geeks or IT professionals), I was finally able to download that Update by running the update troubleshooting and then disabling secure
 boot. &nbsp;However, I am still not able to successfully install Windows 8.1 even though that was the last important update to install. &nbsp;So here we go again.</p>

<p>All photos and videos on the top left of the Navigation pane,</p>
<p>The on the Home section click on the Text search in about the middle of the toolbar,</p>
<p>Type copy in the box.</p>
<p>It should list all of these pictures with the text on the ends of the names,</p>
<p>Windows explorer does a better job because you can click on the first file and scroll down the page to the last file and hold down the Shift key while you click on it and all of the files between the clicks will be selected,</p>
<p>wpg you will have to click on each file as you go very much a pain in the rear end.</p>
<p>Notice what is listed on the ends of the files names and type this as an example "copy" or "(3)" using windows explorer.</p>
<p>Click the start button and click on your User name listed near the top,</p>
<p>Enter the above search "(3)" in the box at the top right, search user folders.</p>
<p>Or there are a bunch of third party utility to do this with side by side comparison,</p>

<h2>            Dont have access to anything</h2>
                    <p>So recently I had a game file in which I could not access because I did not have privileges. So I restarted and came back. I could not access my task bar and all of my local disk drive. I have tried nearly everything. I tried going in to the security tab

<h2>            Bluetooth on Dell Studio 1555 not working despite driver being correctly installed</h2>
                    I have installed Windows 8 professional (64 bit) on my Dell Studio 1555. It has a Dell Wireless 370 mini card for bluetooth connectivity. However, I couldn't get the driver supported by windows 7 to be installed. "This driver has compatibility issues"
 kept being thrown at me each time I tried, even in compatibility mode. But then I read somewhere online that "Network_Application_VY4F2_WN_12.0_A01" will work fine in my situation. So I tried installing this one and it did get installed. Now, my the bluetooth
 device shows in the device manager. It also says that the driver has been correctly installed. I can even see the bluetooth icon in the system tray. However, whenever I try to add a device, the computer says no device found. I tried connecting the laptop from
 my phone. The Phone searched for the laptop alright but couldn't connect to it. It kept showing "Unable to pair with Dell Wireless 370 mini card". Can anybody please help me out with this. I have&nbsp;scourged&nbsp;the web for so

            Hey Niyamath
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the prompt reply to my query.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are the answers to your questions:</div>
<div>1. I downloaded the driver from here-&nbsp;<a href="http://ftp1.dell.com/folder00865420m/1/Network_Application_VY4F2_WN_12.0_A01.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp1.dell.com/folder00865420m/1/Network_Application_VY4F2_WN_12.0_A01.EXE</a></div>
<div>2. Yes, I have tried connectioning a phone, a&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;headset and another laptop. None of them is found by my computer. Both &nbsp;my phone and head set are discovered by another machine which is a Dell XPS with Windows 8.</div>
<div>When I try connecting my laptop from the phone, it goes as far as asking the pin. But there is no pin displayed on the laptop. So I am in a fix as to what I am supposed to type in there. I tried a&nbsp;couple&nbsp;of entries (0000, 1234) but nothing happened apart
 from the appearance of a dialog box in the phone saying "unable to pair up with your device".</div>
<div>3. The visibility option is enabled on all the devices.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as method 1 is concerned, there is no such thing called Bluetooth Devices under Hardware and Sound in Control Panel. However there is an option called "Allow a Device to Connect" when I right click on the&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;icon in task bar. However, this
 text appears grey in colour and can't be selected. I have already selected "Allow&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;devices to find this computer" in Bluetooth settings (accessed by right clicking the&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;icon in task manager).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding method 2, Bluetooth Services is already running.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope I have answered all your questions satisfactorily. Please let me know if there is something else. Hoping for a quick resolution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

            <p>Finally got my Bluetooth on Dell Studio 1555 with Windows 8 Professional (64bit) to work with the Dell Wireless 370 mini card.&nbsp; This is what worked for me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloaded the Windows 7 driver from dell <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/04/driverdetails?driverid=804J8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>R226750.exe</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This extracts to C:\Dell\Drivers\R226750 and tries to install but that fails - incompatible BUT</p>
<p>Go to the sub folder <strong>C:\Dell\Drivers\R226750\R226750\Win64</strong></p>
<p>Sort the files by type there is 5 applications and 1 windows installer </p>
<ul>
<li>BtwMM.exe</li><li>Inst.exe</li><li>instmsia.exe</li><li>instmsiw.exe</li><li>Setup.exe</li><li>BTW.msi</li></ul>
<p>and now <strong>right click </strong>on each then<strong> click properties</strong> select
<strong>compatibility</strong> tab and set </p>
<p><strong>Compatibility mode&nbsp;</strong>to <strong>Windows 7</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Privilege level</strong> to&nbsp;<strong>run as administrator</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then open <strong>Inst.exe</strong>&nbsp;to install the x64 driver</p>
<p>It will do all the bits including updating the firmware, when it is done the Bluetooth logo will be in the system tray and under
<strong>Open Settings </strong>you can set allow discovery</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/688dcbf0-dc84-4d0e-a34d-a7ba9e539e80" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under <strong>device manager </strong>you can now see <strong>Bluetooth</strong> category
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/693d71bb-ee80-4e7d-8399-189f204c521e" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and under Windows 8 right edge menu <strong>Settings</strong> then <strong>Change PC Setting</strong> you can see Bluetooth toggle under
<strong>Wireless</strong> and add under <strong>Devices</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/916043da-c0c4-475f-9d1f-a4d34a0dbcc8" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most frustrating experience to find this solution but I am glad it is now working and I was able to pair my phone.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp; Oh last thing in Control Panel type Bluetooth and it now also lists some options:</p>

<p>Windows 8 Pro x64</p>
<p>Bluetooth Dell 370</p>
<p>Installed program: widcomm version 6.2.0.9600 from the Win64 folders</p>

<p>Bluetooth Service (widcomm)</p>
<p>Bluetooth Support Service (windows)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Device manager: </strong></p>
<p>No Bluetooth category at all?</p>
<p>What about an unknown device listed under other "Other devices" or "Human Interface Devices"?</p>
<p>Look for something describing itself as "Port_#0003.Hub_#0009"</p>
<p>If you find it, you may have to try "update driver" or search for the hardware "scan for hardware changes" from the menu in Device Manager or delete it and the search for new hardware</p>

<h2>            I get a bluescren with an error code 0x00000027 .</h2>
                    I'm working on a basically-new Del Latitude that is BSODing on mrxsmb10.sys. &nbsp;It dies at some point, while saving (MS Word or Excel, for example) to the network share (doesn't die saving to the laptop itself). &nbsp;I've tried to hotfix to the latest version
 of mrxsmb10.sys unsuccessfully (that is, no change. &nbsp;We're still BSODing). &nbsp;That was KB2727324. &nbsp;I've had windows check for any system file updates from command line (sfc /scannow). &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp;It's a new box and is all patched up. &nbsp;It's virtually identical
 to mine, which BSOD'd a few times as I was setting it up for the network, and then stopped. &nbsp;But, I can't back into what else is different (though I HAVE noticed that my version of mrxsmb10.sys is just two months "younger" than the failing laptop. &nbsp;Funny that
 the more recent version could be problematic...maybe...if it's the problem at all. &nbsp;Sadly, I can't just switch out the file. &nbsp;I tried booting up Windows 7 professional with the CD, but wasn't able to get to the place to be able to do a switch on that file).
 &nbsp;I can't link the BSODs to a particular software or hardware upgrade. &nbsp;And it's been going on long enough that I don't have a fall-back restore point.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh, and the network share is a 2003 Small Business Server. &nbsp;Part of me suspects SMB1 vs SMB2 could be problematic. &nbsp;Bugcheck is 0x00000027 and mrxsmb10.sys, ntoskrnl.exe rdbss.sys and tcpip.sys are in the stack at dump-time. &nbsp;Bug check string is RDR_FILE_SYSTEM.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<div>Any ideas? &nbsp;Thanks and best regards, Mike </div>

    <title>Game Icons not showing up for XBLA games in My Games list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> entexman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Icons not showing up for XBLA games in My Games list</h2>
                    
<p>XBLA Game icons are randomly not showing up for many games I own, but show fine if I go the Browse games store . I have tested this on 3 XBox 360's in my house. This problem did not start until the past week and it is getting really annoying. I like to see
 the pictures of the box art for my games. I believe this is a service issue with XBox Live since like I said I can see the box art in the store portion of XBox Live for the games missing icons. I also tested on 3 different XBox's so I know this is not an issue
 with my XBox 360.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please fix this ASAP Microsoft. I paid for these games and I would like the interface to work consistently.</p>

<p>So that issue is slightly different. The picture shows the green XBox Live logo for games not showing box art. My issue is the grey background with an game controller icon. I had the green XBox Live logo back in July the same time the original poster started
 that thread. That problem went away within a couple of days. The current problem is still happening for over a week now for me and others.</p>

<p>The problem appears to be fixed now. No clearing of the cache needed I think. I noticed icons were all displaying on one of the XBox 360's in my house so I went to my primary XBox 360 and sure enough all game art icons are displaying for me again without
 me making any changes on the XBox 360. This proves to me the problem is with the XBox Live service itself. This issue with XBox Live needs to be investigated and fixed. The easiest fix I can think of is to make it so all of the images get downloaded to the
 XBox 360 so the image can always be loaded regardless of being connected to XBox Live. I don't think that should be hard at all to fix myself.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned by <strong>'theo7west' </strong>

 -100 thumbnails load and then it stops.&nbsp; If I try to open one of the pictures after this, some will open, but most will give an error message saying that the picture file is either in the wrong format or the path to the picture does not exist.&nbsp; The same thing
 happens if I look at the folder in Details view.&nbsp; Dates and details start to load and then stop.&nbsp; In List view all of the names load and I can open any picture.&nbsp; After attempting a thumbnail or detail view open, I also have problems with the Safely Disconnect
 Hardware thinking that the device is in use and cannot be disconnected.&nbsp; When I look at the folder in List view then Safely Remove Hardware lets me disconnect.&nbsp; I have connected this

<h2>            Volume icon doesn&#39;t respond to clicks&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So among other wonderful bugs and issues I'm still having with win10 I've ran into a pretty annoying one. The little Volume shortcut on the taskbar is visible, movable and it even shows my output device when i hover my mouse over it. BUT. if i click it,
 nothing happens, if i right-click it nothing happens and i switch audio output devices frequently so it's pretty inconvinient. Not sure if it's related but Solidworks won't open random windows for me anymore(Render window being one of them).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running an AMD fx8xxx processor with an ATI 290x graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this problem, or found solutions to it?</p>
