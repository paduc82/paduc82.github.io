            <p>Should you?&nbsp; Tell us why you want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS defaults to installing 32 bit Office, even on 64 bit Windows. They do this because many software makers, INCLUDING MS!, have simply not bothered to create 64 bit versions of their addon tools. So if you switch to 64 bit you could potentially lose functionality!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In real world tests, no significant (user perceivable) performance improvements are visible after upgrading to 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS only recommends upgrading to 64 bit when:</p>
<ul>
<li>file size is approaching 2GB on disk</li><li>application is using approaching 2GB of RAM when file is open</li></ul>
<p>Most typically this limits are approached in Excel when downloading large data sets from the internet (or mainframe computer)&nbsp; or you have complex spreadsheets with many formulas.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade process itself is simple. Uninstall Office 32 bit using the Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features.&nbsp; Then log in to the MyAccount site and select the (hidden) 64 bit install option.&nbsp; I can provide more specific instructions if you still want to
 go ahead.</p>

<p>To help you—and only you—get back into *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, we need to verify that it's yours.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I haven't had access to this account for about 2 years now, but it's until now that I really need it. My friend signed me out of facebook and I need this hotmail to get my password back so I can sign into facebook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
&nbsp;so i follow the recovery options and use an old email address to get the recovery details, so my first MSG didn't have enough info apparently so i try again and same thing, so after adding everything i could possibly think of i get an error MSG saying oops
 there was an error or something and we couldn't process your request so i fill out the forum a few more times and eventually it just say's i hit my 4 times a day limit and have to wait 24 hours.<br />
<br />
after this i figured hey i'd try resetting my password by sending a reset code to my phone, so i change my password using the code sent to my phone and same message persists.<br />
<br />
after waiting over 24 hours i tried again and still received the same error saying I'd used my 4 attempts for today and need to wait 24 hours to try again. So i didn't bother for another day, after this i created a new email and attempted the process again
 and on my first attempt i got the reply email saying I'd submitted my request and it's take up to a day to process, 3 day's later i grew impatient because there was no reply email like before so i tried again and this time i didn't even get a response email
 saying I'd submitted my request.<br />
<br />
so after reading into it a bit more i noticed on the site it said i can recover my account by adding a phone number and verifying myself with a phone code that way so i select the option and it asks me to log in, so i do and it takes me back to the original
 "It looks like someone else might be using your account" page, which makes no sense since it was suppose to take me to a page to validate my account by adding a phone number? that and i already have my phone number attached to my account because i previously
 used it to change my password.<br />
<br />
any help would be appreciated on this topic.</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Disable Driver Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sinan yuce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Disable Driver Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm using Build 10051 and windows update tries to update drivers with Windows Update. But there is an issue related to RealTek Driver and as soon as It installs this update, I get a blue screen of death :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable driver updates in this build? I know this was available with build 9926 as It did have disable specific updates button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft should bring back this disable option for at least third party driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I installed build 10061 and I still get blue screen of death as soon as I installed third party driver updates through Windows Update. Microsoft should bring back the hide updates option for third party driver updates at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Only workaround I found is disabling Windows Update alltogether. Just Google disabling windows update using Group Policy :(</p>

    <title>Lumia 920 overheating immediately following WP8.1 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nourishingstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 overheating immediately following WP8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    Although I stayed away from the WP 8.1 developer preview for my Lumia 920, but this evening I received a notification from the phone that an update was available, which updated it to 8.0.xxx.166 (from 8.0.xxx.155).<br />
<br />
After some time I was prompted again for an update which was the WP8.1 update. When the update installed I noticed the phone was hot, which I chalked up to the upgrade and charger being plugged in, but the phone just kept getting hotter. After the update it
 asked me to look at some new settings, but the phone rebooted twice while I tried to do that, I'm guessing due to overheating.<br />
<br />
Seeing how how the phone was getting very hot near the top right quadrant, I turned it off and let it cool down before I tried again. I got through the updated setting and app updates, but I haven't been able to use the phone because it starts overheating as
 soon as I turn it on!<br />
<br />
Phone has been working fine for a long time without overheating with WP 8.0...any suggestions what I should do to solve the overheating problem with WP8.1? Thanks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As has been mentioned here several times now, this is normal. During the update process the phone will remove apps as required to make room for the update files. Immediately after the update completes and the temporary files have been removed the apps are
 re-installed. This process will keep the phone CPU running for a prolonged period of time and this cause more the average heat to be generated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the process is fully completed and alls aps have been re-installed the phone will cool down again.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I left the phone turned off all night and have been using it today with no major issues so far, which seems to match up with what you said about the overheating behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I did not read anywhere during the installation that overheating can be expected, only that it might take 15-30 minutes and reboots to complete the upgrade.&nbsp; The temperature of the phone was beyond anything normal and it literally rebooted twice
 while it was guiding me through updated settings way after the upgrade process had completed.</p>

<p>The phone is not overheating, it gets very warm yes, but it's hardly doing any damage. The update is a very resource intensive process so obviously the CPU and possibly other components will get rather warm.</p>

            The MyPhone team is considering an upgrade in storage capacity, but there is no guarantee that such a feature will be released in this, or future releases of MyPhone.<br />
<br />
I'd advise you to watch our public Blog, which announces any new features or upgrades to current functionality the moment it becomes public.

 the way images look across a Save?<br />

            Also, save the file instead of Drag and Drop then insert the file as a Picture.<br />
And also if you can avoid doing so don't save as a jpg file. Jpeg is a Lossy format which means, each time it is opened and re-saved you lose detail.&nbsp; Save as .png format which is not a Lossy format you can open and save as many times as you wish and it will
 not lose detail. Except when you reduce dots per inch) (DPI) or pixels per inch(PPI) in that case you will but once done you'll not lose any more.<br />

<p>Hi, Lawrence,</p>
<p>

            It's a different user on the same LAN network with a different Microsoft account and a different device. When the cursor is placed on the Bing daily picture, the icon does not appear on the screen with the Bing daily quiz questions relating to the picture
 on the second device. Therefore no Reward points can accumulate to that user from their device.

            Yes, that is my experience to and that is the reason for identifying this problem. It does not make sense to me that network laptop users should be deprived of the ability to earn points as desktop users do.

            If it is a limitation on network use, that when one network user earns his/her points, other network users can not earn points, that signifies a problem to me. I don't know if that is what occurs, but I suppose it's one possible scenario. I cannot conceptualize
 that using a desktop vs laptop should make a difference. It is a problem that I would like Microsoft software engineers to look into resolving.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're getting same prompt even on other browsers, then perhaps resetting the browser settings could help. And also, clearing the browser's cache &amp; cookies could get rid of the said prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset Internet Explorer, follow the steps from this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change or reset Internet Explorer settings</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how this turns out for you?</p>

<p><span>Hi Marque,</span></p>
<p>The problem I have is definitely not related to Safari, or Google Chrome or Internet Explorer or Android or even to Apple OSX or Windows operating systems. Also, not related to my modem or router or PC or network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using several devices, which contain these softwares, such Mac desktop, Macbook, iPad, iPhone and Sony desktop, and still have not managed to access my hotmail account after login and get it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your info, my wife's outlook account does work when using the devices that contain the softwares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, after all the above unsuccessful checks and trials, it seems my problem is certainly due to some "bug" in my Hotmail account, which can only be reset by someone from Microsoft Support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope all the above is clear and will be of help for you now and look forward to get a resolution soon.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Marque,<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you very much for getting back to me and looking into my case.<br />
</p>
<p>I did eventually found out that I could access my mailboxes on outlook.live.com. without clearing the cache and browsing history of the browser.<br />
<br />
I would be really, really interested why there was this access problem with my account, and why it took several weeks to fix it and what was done to fix it so I do not get subjected again to this inconvenience.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you again, and your team for looking into my case and offering your suggestions on what to do to resolve my case.<br />

            Ok, so I proceeded with the factory settings and the software is now back. I proceeded to see the video, although is for an HP and I have a Surface I figure it shouldn't be any difference. when I click on "Microsoft Office" I am presented with a screen
 that says my device includes Microsoft office 365. I click to activate and after I signed in&nbsp;it presents me with a screen on which I can select install (similar to video). the problem is that on my account I tried office 365 trial (one month) and it still
 is there. so if I click install will it install the trial version or will activate the one that comes with the surface?

 row appears in the data sheet, how can I configure it so that the new information appears automatically and in the same format as on the main sheet?&nbsp; I know this is confusing but please help!

            You will need to us a macro - why - because you said "in the same format".&nbsp; Formulas don't pass formats.&nbsp; To get a macro you are going to have to give us details regarding the sheet layout and what goes to each sheet.

<p>Thank you for answering.&nbsp; Just to get it clear then, Microsoft Camera&nbsp;still takes pictures at both 5MP and 16MP?&nbsp; Why has Nokia Camera been kept?&nbsp; I prefer the Nokia Camera app for the dial options for white balance, iso etc but Microsoft Camera has burst
 but the settings is less intuituve than Nokia Camera.&nbsp; I suppose it is nice to have the option of either/or.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, what is the Microsoft Camera app you talk about?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked and Nokia Camera is Still Nokia Camera it seems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am guessing that you refer to the stock Camera app for Windows Phone as 'Microsoft Camera'. This app has no support for Pureview so I would guess it only takes 5MP images. Not sure though but on my 1020 it does..</p>

<p>On the 1520 you can select Microsoft Camera or Nokia Camera in the photo settings.&nbsp; I, like you, can only assume that Microsoft Camera is low res only.&nbsp; Burst only appears on Microsoft Camera, with smart sequence only on Nokia Camera.&nbsp;</p>

            hi Thorfrost,<br />
<br />
the fellas are correct in saying that Microsoft Camera is the renamed version of the default camera. what you get with Nokia Camera is of course a different UI, and also you lose the post-processing that you get with Nokia Camera for the images.

    <title>Downloading IMAP emails to .pst - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuhin94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading IMAP emails to .pst</h2>
                    My email service is shutting down at the end of this month and I would like to download all my emails locally and in their respective folders before that happens. I tried to set up POP3, but that does not allow me to have all my folders downloaded and
 emails sorted into them. I found on WikiHow it is possible to download all emails locally using IMAP. However, I am not sure of how to proceed once I have set up my email account in Outlook. To reiterate, I would like to download all emails (sorted into their
 respective folders) locally that I can access later on through Outlook. Can I get some help with this please?

            And another question. The .pst file is now 1.4GB, but my email client says I've used 1.92GB of storage on their site. Is this normal? I don't have any other files besides emails on their server.&nbsp;

<p>If you have both Folder sets visible in MS Outlook only you can compare the two to check the content on the pst data file</p>

<h2>            Opened Tabs not syncing correctly between phone and PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me with this. I have my settings set to sync opened tab from internet explorer between my Nokia Lumia 520 and my Windows 8.1 PC. It has synced and refreshed the tabs open on both devices and yet my computer still
 registers a tab I had closed on my phone days ago. Is there a way to get my computer to register that this tab is closed (which it is)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Thank you to anyone who can help me with this.</p>

            if there is nothing available in the Nokia Store, then unfortunately there is nothing that can be done. your device wil not receive any more firmware updates due to its age, and the fact that active support for it has now ended.

            <p>I had same issue...decide to try re-creating VHD instead of doing it in Windows 7 I used Windows 10 and that let me use the Powershell script&nbsp;.\Convert-WindowsImage.ps1 which showed instead of the Skus: Preview and Consumer it showed a SKU fro Professional
 using the exact same ISO. I used Professional and created the VHD in Windows 10...transferred it to 7 and reset up the dual boot and the Licenses worked falawlessly this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like its much better to creat the VHDs in at least Windows 8...to get correct skus.</p>

<p>ich stehe vor dem folgenden Problem: Ich habe in einer Excel 2010 Tabelle zwei Spalten mit Datumsangaben und Zahlen daneben.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nun suche ich nach dem Wert in Spalte B, dem das letzte Datum des Jahres 2012 zugeordnet ist. Ich habe es mit der folgenden Formel versucht: =VERWEIS(2012;$A$1:$A$9;$B$1:$B$9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Komischerweise liefert mir diese Formel den Wert 7118,9, also den Wert der Zeile 7.</p>
<p>Ich denke, es hängt damit zusammen, dass ich nach der Jahreszahl suche, aber in der Spalte Datumsangaben stehen. Vielleicht ist VERWEIS oder SVERWEIS gar nicht die richtige Formel für mein Ziel.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Danke schon einmal im Voraus für Eure Hilfe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gruß</p>

<br />

On the Pocket PC tap Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Connections &gt; Manage existing connections &gt; Proxy settings tab &gt; make sure there is no checkmark in the box next to "this network uses a proxy"<br />

I don't know if this will help, but you might check out this version of Windows Live that is posted on Microsoft's website:<br />

What cellular provider do you use?&nbsp; (I have read that TMobile may block access to these services).<br />

<h2>            How do I stop Not Responding in MS Access 2010</h2>
                    <p>I am running MS Access 2010 on a 32 bit version of windows 7. The VBA works fine until I call a subroutine from within a Do Until EOF. I am working with 2 records.</p>
<p>I have also tride this on a 64 bit version of windows 7 with the same outcome</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I call a subroutine (Not Responding) is added to the file name and I have to use ctrl+break to stop it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same process works in MS Access 2003 and XP without a hitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I need to do in MS Access 2010 to stop this.</p>

    <title>Onedrive as simple backup&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdubxxl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive as simple backup&#63;</h2>
                    Hi All!&nbsp; Please excuse my ignorance...&nbsp; How can I use Onedrive as a simple backup?&nbsp; I want my hard drive to be the authority, and Onedrive to be a carbon copy of my hard drive at all times.&nbsp; I never create anything new or revise anything on the cloud.&nbsp;
 I don't want Onedrive syncing backwards to my hard drive.&nbsp; I recently spent hours reorganizing my pictures and today I see that Onedrive put everything back the way it was.&nbsp; I also get Onedrive creating hundreds (if not thousands) of duplicates so that my
 total picture storage is twice what it should be.&nbsp; Is it possible to use Onedrive as i'm describing?&nbsp; Thanks!
