    <title>Update for Windows 10 is too large to download, needs to be in smaller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update for Windows 10 is too large to download, needs to be in smaller packages.</h2>
                    I cannot load the Win 10 update because I do not have enough memory. The upload took 4 days over my slow satellite connection&nbsp;and then said it required an additional 4.5 GB.&nbsp;I used the "fix" and cleaned everything there was to clean, but only MBs were
 removed (I have only owned this lap top less than 6 months). When I looked at my programs, the total space they use is only 2.5 GB so there simply is not enough hard drive on this Inspirion 14&nbsp;to run this update program. It suggested I get an additional 10GB
 of memory to plug in. Seriously? Is it Microsoft's purpose to limit who can upgrade their products? I suggest Mircrosoft split this download into smaller packages that can be readily uploaded without all the extra steps and frustration.

<p>You are not talking about "memory" (=RAM) but about disk space. These days disk sizes are 500 GBytes or more. Your requirement of 4.5 GBytes represents 1% of the usual disk capacity. To find out what is going on I recommend you launch the Disk Manager (diskmgmt.msc),
 then use snippingtool.exe to take a snapshot. Save the snapshot to your desktop then attach it to your reply.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the response. Note the message I'm getting is that I need 4.8 MORE GB to install the update. The download took 4 days but it then went to "preparing to install" and that is where it stops about half-way across the bar, another window opens and
 offers a "fix" button and then a smaller window opens to "clean up." &nbsp;This partial install to clean up to not enough space happened 4 times. I contacted the Live Chat and he 'took control' and looked over a few items and determined I need to upgrade my system
 (capacity?) and to call Dell to purchase that. This machine shows 500 MB so if you know a different source for this problem I would appreciate the help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line you should run a DiskCleanup with Administrator privileges.&nbsp; Hit the &lt;windows-key&gt; and type in "disk", Disk Cleanup should appear in the search results.&nbsp; &lt;right-click&gt; on it and select "Run as Administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Dell and Microsoft are busy pointing fingers at each other for responsibility, perhaps an appropriate response would be to trim the **** out of both their bloated&nbsp;installs.&nbsp; Uninstall with extreme prejudice anything that says "Trial Offer" or similar
 from Dell's bundled apps, and you can get jiggy with the default Windows apps by using appx under powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There really isn't any reason you shouldn't be able to run Windows 10 comfortably in 32GB, as long as you aren't using any heavy software suites, or have decided you simply must have every cat video on the 'net saved on your disk drive.</p>

<p>That does seem prudent but I am timid about removing things when I don't know what they are. I get to the Disk Cleanup -&gt; more options -&gt; seems like I am at the familiar uninstall programs page. I don't want to buy the MS Office program so I use Open Office,
 is that just the one item and I can remove it? That is 930 MB and the largest item on the list. What are those multiples of Microsoft Visual C+ ... 2008 Redistributable ... followed by a 2012 (same listing but different icon)? Would a copy of that page be
 of value and not compromise my lap top security? I have only had this thing a few months and there isn't all that much on it. I don't see any "Trial Offers". At the bottom of that page it says I have 34 programs using 2.27 GB which still won't get me the suggested
 4.8 additional to finish the install if I removed everything (which I do know enough to not do - Ha). I liked your comment about the cat pics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your snapshot confirms my worst fears. Until about 2005 the standard hard disk was around 20 GBytes. Since then technology has moved forward at an amazing pace. These days most disks come at 500 GBytes, some even at 1000 or 2000 GBytes. When I recently saw
 a netbook for sale with just 30 GByte I could not believe that manufacturers would sell such a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how hard you try in cleaning up your disk, this will always be a tight fit. To solve your current problem you need to get an external hard disk or a flash disk, then set your download folder to that disk.</p>

            <p>This lap top was purchased for me just a few months ago direct from Dell and came with Win 10 installed. Granted it wasn't really expensive but I would have assumed it was "manufactured" this year so certainly newer than 2005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st, how big is this update? Is it more than 30 GB? How do I purchase this "external hard disk" and how much do I need, is this like a thumb drive?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which takes me back to my original question.&nbsp;<br />
Since I am only short less than 5 GB, I think Mircrosoft should package their updates in smaller sections so it would take less time as well as be accessible to people like me. This is not some "elective" app, this is a system upgrade so I can stay current
 with their software and they should want me to have it.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. How do I express this frustration with the actual Mircosoft Corp?</p>
<p>Happy Holidays</p>

            <p>Well, you could try some bigger guns...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 3rd party cleaners : since <strong>Advanced Disk Cleanup </strong>wasn't sufficient, CCleaner is a standard, as is Wise Disk Cleaner (in both cases be&nbsp;vigilant during download and installation so you don't end up with a 4th party hitchiker app)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- after uninstalling pointless apps from the OS - <strong>Settings&gt;System&gt;Apps&amp;Features
</strong>- remove them from the disk using get-appx and remove-appx in the environment of an elevated Powershell. (a bit of research is required... basically you just need to list the packages on your system, and remove the spam ones.&nbsp; If you don't use Internet
 Explorer, that can be removed as well.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- give Dell's forums a shot, see if entering your computer model, "windows 10", "update"&nbsp;and various curse words brings up any useful&nbsp;results</p>
<p>
</p><p>- do a fresh install of Windows 10.&nbsp; You'd probably want to visit the manufacturer's forums first, to get their driver package, as well as looking up "clean install" here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Linux, which is perfectly happy running under far less than 32GB storage and 2GB memory.&nbsp; Laptops are sometimes a pain to run them on because of proprietary drivers.&nbsp; Again, a search using your computer model and "Linux" could prove useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As far as actually getting aholt of Microsoft directly, Feedback is supposed to work.</p>

<p>-&gt; Yes, I know. It belongs to the breed of new low-cost netbooks that have a solid state disk drive chip on the motherboard. Quite fast but extremely limited in size.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1st, how big is this update? Is it more than 30 GB? How do I purchase this "external hard disk" and how much do I need, is this like a thumb drive?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Sorry, don't know how big the update is, maybe 2 GBytes. You only have 1.77 GBytes free. A 16 GByte flash disk would do nicely and costs very little.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Since I am only short less than 5 GB, I think Mircrosoft should package their updates in smaller sections so it would take less time as well as be accessible to people like me.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Or Dell should not offer netbooks for sale whose capacity is so clearly inadequate. A 30 GByte disk is ridiculous in 2016. I run a tight ship on my machine and keep all my personal files on a disk other than the system disk, yet the system disk
 requires 30 GBytes for Windows and for the various applications.</p>

<h2>            Surface 3 and virtualization results in very high CPU usage due to system interrupts</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface 3 LTE which I like a lot for office work while not at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to also use Android Apps, I have installed AmiDuos, which workes quite well, gven that the surface is not really a dual-use Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, that AmiDuos needs the virtualization to be turned on. Since the Surface UEFI does not give this option, the trick is to launch AmiDuos, play around with it a little bit, close it and then reboot the Surface. When rebooted, you can see that
 virtualisation is turned on in the taskmanager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, that then, CPU usage is at a constant 25-35% even when idel, all used up by system interrupts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So obviously, the Surface has a big problem with virtualisation. I wonder if this is the reason, why MS has not given this option in the Surface UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts welcome.</p>

 book if you really really want a solid virtualization platform.</p>

            <p>thanks for the reply. However I am not sure if that is a chip problem. The Android Apps run really well on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem lies in Win10 in connection with the S3 UEFI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the problem persists go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            One specific WIFI network is not appearing in the available networks</h2>
                    I use two WIFI networks in my home: one for work via a Verizon Jetpack hotspot and one via a router connectect to home internet. The list of available networks shows my home network but no longer has the Verizon network listed. I can't figure out how to
 get it back and I don't know why it disappeared in the first place. I am able to recognize and connect to the Verizon Jetpack from other devices. Thanks in advance for the help!

<p><span>From the description, I suspect that the issue seems to be temporary. Try to shutdown your computer, wait for a moment, and then restart it back to see if it sort out the issue. Also try
 to restart concerned network hotspot once&nbsp;to see if it makes any difference.</span></p>

            Thank you for the reply. I didn't find anything here that helped. This issue has persisted for about a month, through updates to the computer and several restarts. I have been able to connect to my home wifi and from my smart phone wifi, however my Verizon
 hotspot just doesn't show-up in the list of available networks. I've tried the network troubleshooter which doesn't find any problems. I've also read many postings from computer help websites/billboards but I can't find anything that has helped. Is there a
 way to reset/refresh all the connectivity settings that could help? One strange thing is that the network I'm trying to reach does still show-up in the list of known networks under the windows 10 settings-see attached screen capture.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecba9d88-bac0-47cd-8125-98072d7628b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecba9d88-bac0-47cd-8125-98072d7628b8" /></a>

As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

            Great effort, but all those avenues and more have already been tried . . . no go! Again, it recognizes I have a scanner,&nbsp; icons etc. appear on my desktop. The "trouble shooter" will run the scanner, but still scanning is a no go?

The Media you choose to install from will depend on certain factors, such as the Boot Scheme used by your computer (BIOS, UEFI) in addition to the storage device (hard disk partitioning layout). Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file. An ISO file is a digital replica of a virtual disc, which users will have to make bootable on a blank DVD, USB thumb drive or SD card.">How

    <title>Printing Pictures through Photo Viewer that are in a Zip file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printing Pictures through Photo Viewer that are in a Zip file</h2>
                    
<p>Our users regularly receive ZIP files, by email, containing multiple images that they need to print. When they open the ZIP file they can see the images listed; when they open a single image it opens Photo Viewer and displays the image but the print option
 is greyed out.</p>
<p>If the user saves the contents of the ZIP to their Pictures folder (or any other) and opens them they can print them without any issue.</p>
<p>Why can't Photo Viewer print directly from ZIP files?</p>

            I do not know if the following setting change is <br />
the fix but it may be worth a try: I'm thinking maybe <br />
it will allow the printer to access the Zipped files.<br />
<br />
Go to... Folder Options...<br />
Start Button / Control Panel / Appearance And <br />
Personalization / Folder Options / Search tab<br />

See the following photo...check the box..."Include <br />

But occasionally we will run into a so called villain who actually isn't a horrible person.
</p>
<p>They're just doing what they think is right.</p>
<p>These kind of characters add complexity to the games and make you think. </p>
<p>Such characters like&nbsp;Saren Arterius from Mass effect and&nbsp;Loghain Mac Tir from Dragon Age: Origins come to mind.</p>
<p>What characters do you know that give out this kind of vibe?</p>

            In Fallout 4, the Institute is treated as the "Bad Guys" for the majority of the game; they replace people with synths to observe life in the wasteland and are not ashamed to do some heinous things (kidnapping, murder, etc) to keep themselves alive. Yet,
 they simply want to keep humanity alive and believe that the way they're going about it is the "best" way. Arguably, their intentions are good, even if their methods are distasteful.

<p>The Institute from Fallout 4 do want what's best for Humanity, but they have redefined Humanity to only include those who were born and raised in the Institute.</p>
<p>they are happy to murder Wastelanders as they don't class them as human. there are terminals within the Institute that contain all the information about this.</p>

<h2>            Require computer to &#34;ask&#34; me or prompt me BEFORE updates kick me out and start downloading automatically.</h2>
                    Recently, everytime I get online with my newer laptop, it starts downloaded new or recent updates for any random program and it does NOT ask my permission to start the download OR the reboot! It simply kicks me off of the page I am on, (EVEN BANKING pages!!!)
 and starts to do its download, then reboots itself WITHOUT asking me if I WANT to do this NOW or later. How can I change this in my computer so that it will ASK me before it kicks me off of something important to do updates??!??

<p>With any of the Automatic Updates options selected, you will only see AU's yellow "Updates are ready to be installed" icon when all of the (approved) updates have downloaded and/or are ready to be installed.</p>
<p>If some but not all of the approved updates have downloaded, you may encounter a "Click to install important updates and then shut down" button when you go to turn off your computer.&nbsp; Doing so will install the already-downloaded updates (see Event Log |

<h2>            Adjusting Music player speed on Windows 10</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 Home and want to be able to adjust the speed of the Groove player, or download some other system that will allow the adjustment. I am trying to learn a language and sometimes need to slow down the speech to understand it. I could do that
 on Media Player on Windows 8.1 but I can't do it now. Any suggestions?

<p>Un saludo!&nbsp;</p>

<p>PD: Sobre lo de desmontarla no es problema, mientras tenga acceso al disco duro para poder ponerle el SSD me vale :)</p>

<p>Asi que a mi haciendo un poco la regla de 3, me sale que el disco duro no tiene mas de 370 gigas. Asi que quiero saber donde estan los 130 que me han tangado, y que no me digan que es para memoria, y demas chorradas porque no me lo creo.</p>

<p>Reserva espacio para actualizaciones.</p>
<p>De todas las maneras para calcular la capacidad del disco duro se utiliza esta formula:</p>
<p>N*10^y / 2^x</p>
<p>N = número que da el fabricante(500).</p>
<p>y = &nbsp;exponente del prefijo en el Sistema Internacional (giga = 9).</p>
<p>x = exponente del prefijo en el sistema binario(Gibi (Gi)30).</p>
<p>N*10^9 / 2^30 = 465 aproximadamente.</p>
<p>500 GB = 465 GiB.</p>

<p>Es lamentable lo que esta pasando en esta generación, interfaz que ni la XBOX original.</p>
<p>XBOX LIVE peor todavía, que ni tiene para mensajes de voz... ¿será el poder de la nube?</p>
<p>Para mi la próxima actualización será crucial, me siento totalmente engañado.</p>
<p>Y no me pasaré a la PS 4 por que esa la iba a comprar dentro de dos años por que no tiene juegos.</p>
<p>Pero vamos, cada día veo más claro que va a acabar la XBOX One como las típicas Wii que se regalan y acaban al lado del televisor como el cenicero de una familia no fumadora que tiene el cenicero más por las visitas que por otra cosa.</p>

<p>XD</p>
<p>Lo que iba a decir, que a mi no me parece penoso que no se vea y que tengan que actualizar para ver "disfrazado" lo que tiene el disco duro que ni ves ni puedes sacar nada claro más que tener una orientación para comenzar a borrar juegos.</p>
<p>Pero es que es tan penoso... tan penoso que una empresa como Microsoft no tenga un software en la consola que te permite no solo ver cada sección, juego instalado de BD, juego comprado en la tienda de XBOX LIVE. Por no hablar de l espacio consumido por los
 clips de video que se graba. </p>
<p>Y podría seguir, pero es que me aburre ya toda esta mania de sustituir, y lo peor sustituir negativamente.</p>

<p>Lo más gracioso de todo, es que el negocio y la especialidad principal de Microsoft son los sistemas operativos, pero el de Xbox One lo han sacado muy verde.</p>
<p>Y todavía siguen sin actualizar Xbox.com después de tantos meses, cuando en otras páginas externas se pueden ver perfectamente los juegos jugados en Xbox One,...</p>
<p>Han tenido demasiada prisa en sacarla, parece que Sony con PS4 empezó a planificarlo antes, aunque hasta que no tenga más juegos, no será interesante la PS4.</p>

<p>Un disco SSD de 750GB te va a salir mucho más caro que la propia consola, dicho eso... no solo se trata de desmontarla y pinchar el disco, sino que evidentemente el disco que lleva de serie va protegido (como ya iba el de Xbox 360) así que para que te funcione
 el invento vas a tener que "trastear" en serio, si lo consigues no dejes de avisarnos!.</p>
<p>Dicho esto... 500GB no dan para mucho y espero que Microsoft empiece a plantearnos soluciones que no pase por cambiar la consola por una nueva de mayor capacidad, eso sería realmente rastrero.</p>

<p>Si que lo ha tenido que hacer mal Microsoft para haberle roto el corazon a NERVIO asi con lo xbosero que era en este foro</p>
<p>O sera el efecto de ver que los juegos Multi corren mejor de momento en PS4,viendo la que se esta liando con el tema del Tomb Raider o lo de los 1080 del metal gear??</p>
<p>Bueno sea como sea una cagada mas de Microsoft ha sido lo del disco duro,eso de no poder cambiarlo libremente es un lastre,que huele a que tendras que pasar por caja y pillar algun externo oficial de microsoft si quieres mas capacidad</p>
<p>Curiosamente en la PS4 ya hay gente jugando en sus casas con discos duros de 2 Terabites de esos que venden sueltos en tiendas y hasta se traga los discos duros SSD en donde dicen que los juegos se instalan mas rapido y todo</p>
<p>Con tantas cagadas de Microsoft se entiende que una consola sin juegos y catalogo tan soso como PS4 le este dando esa paliza en ventas a la One</p>

<p>Yo no me atrevería a ir tan lejos... Microsoft ha hecho algunas cosas bien, y Sony también ha hecho algunas cosas mal. Ambas consolas tienen sus más y sus menos, no hay más que ver la pésima gestión de trofeos de PS4 o lo limitado de su interfaz (aunque
 he de decir que al menos es funcional).</p>
<p>Supongo que aún es pronto y hay que dar tiempo a ambas plataformas para que se vayan estabilizando, somos los primeros interesados en que haya una fuerte competencia entre ambas :-)</p>

<h2>            BUG REPORT&#58; Surface Pro 2 - 100&#37; Disk Space Used Causing Surface to Freeze Due to &#34;Power saver&#34; Being Active</h2>
                    Dear All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have come across a bug recently causing my Surface to freeze, or become very slow. After looking at &nbsp;the Task Manager I noticed that when the "Power saver" battery setting is active as opposed to "Balanced" or "High Performance" it rapidly increases
 from 0% to 100% Disk Usage. This is probably due to poor battery delegation set for the "Power saver" profile. Therefore, I would strongly recommend that you set your battery to the "Balanced" profile until Microsoft come up with a solution (hopefully in the
 form of an update). It may just be me who is having this problem, leave a comment below if you are experiencing this. The more this gets noticed the higher the chance Microsoft will do something about it!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I am having a recurring problem with an error saying "driver_power_state_failure". &nbsp;I've contacted Microsoft an wasted over 3 hours on the phone to them. In the end they decided to send a "new one" to me. Turns out it was a refurbished one that didn't
 even work! I still have the problem now, and have tried:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reinstalling the drivers (especially the network adapter, because the Wi-Fi cut's off before the error occurs)</li><li>Refreshing Windows</li><li>Resetting Windows</li></ul>
<div>Comment also if you are having the same issue.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <blockquote>
<p>Interesting, I own a Surface Pro 2 512GB, so it could just be this model. The way I changed the battery profile was by clicking the battery icon located in the taskbar on the desktop, then selecting "Power saver". Its unlikely this method will produce a
 different results but it may be worth a try.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the response though</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
I had the same issue, 100% Disk 0 Usage,&nbsp;changing from "Power Saver" to "Balanced" corrected the issue.

            Hi. Is the servers for Kinect PlayFit closed? If it doesn't connect anymore, than chances are the servers have shut down.

<p>Hi Maelstorm95,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to the Playfit app for the Kinect on the Xbox, it likely is not working due to the discontinuation of Kinect support in April of 2016 for the Xbox 360 and October 2017 for the Xbox One, which means that the servers are likely no longer online
 for use as previously stated by our Ambassadors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information helps out and as this thread is older, and there is no other solution, we will be locking the thread at this time. We thank you again for bringing this question to the forums and please feel free
<span><span>to come back to the Xbox forums in future should you have any other questions (Do not repost the same question or thread as that
