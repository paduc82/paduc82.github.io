<p>The price rage you have set limits your choices. Just keep in mind when picking up a new tv that:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Your display must support 120Hz over HDMI. While some monitors support 120Hz over DisplayPort, they may not support it over HDMI.</li><li>
120Hz is only available for 1080p and 1440p. If you change your resolution to 4K UHD or 720p, the refresh rate will be set to 60Hz by default.</li><li>
If your console is set for 4K UHD and you change your refresh rate to 120Hz, your resolution will be downgraded to the highest resolution available for your display.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>what frame rate and refresh rate and other things should I be looking for ?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The "best" mainly depends on your priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for framerate and refresh rate: if you're looking for actual TV's, not dedicated gaming monitors (which don't come in 65'' sizes AFAIK), do NOT buy anything according to it's refresh/frame rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since regular TV broadcasts are always sent out with 60 or 50Hz depending on your country, most (if not all) TV makers produce their TV receivers to accept 50/60 Hz, and then they interpolate (i.e. "making up") additional images, so they can advertise their
 TVs having "more Hertz" than a competitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That frame "smoothing" might work for non-interactive stuff like actual TV broadcasts, but is a
<strong>disadvantage</strong> for gaming!</p>
<p>Unless the console detects a "FreeSync" capable display on it's HDMI port, the console will only output it's video with 60Hz during gameplay. And I've yet to see an actual TV with "FreeSync" capabilities. Usually only computer gaming monitors have FreeSync,
 but they don't come in your desired screen size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have a console that outputs "only" 60Hz, like any standard TV broadcast, and the TV has to receive and store several frames to be able to determine what changed from frame to frame, and then calculate the interpolated images to "pump up" the 60 console
 frames per second to the 120 or 240 or 600 Hz refresh rate, meaning you will see images from several milliseconds "in the past" on your screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Black Ops 4, you are standing head to head with an opponent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other person pulls the trigger and shoots. The console will render the muzzle flash, and will send the image to your TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TV stores the image with the muzzle flash, and stores it, waiting for the next 2 or 10 frames. While the TV is storing the images from the console, the bullet is flying towards you, and the console registers that you're hit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, the TV then calculates the interpolated images from the muzzle fire animation, and finally displays it on the TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time you actually see the muzzle fire on your 600Hz TV, you're already dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For gaming, especially competitive multiplayer games like Black Ops 4, make sure that your TV has a dedicated "Gaming Mode", that will turn off all image enhancements and will display your console video feed as quickly and immediately as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please go to your nearest TV/HiFi/electronics store, and look at their selection of 65'' TVs in your price range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask the personell specifically if the TV has a dedicated "Game" mode, or check the manuals in the support section of the TV manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mention you have the Xbox One X:</p>
<p>For $550 you won't get those fancy OLED or Quantum Dot LED TVs in that size which support HDR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if it's only the size that matters to you, get a good quality 1080p TV in that size which might cost even less than $500, and save up for later, when the prices for 4K OLED or Quantum Dot TVs with HDR10/Dolby Vision support have dropped to your desired
 price range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with "only" 1080p, the Xbox One X will internally render a game up to 4K (and sometimes even above), and then downscale the image to 1080p, which will make the image appear smoother than a natively rendered 1080p image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I own the TCL 4K HDR10/Dolby Vision, 120hz 65" tv and grabbed the Roku wireless speakers that are on sale also, I feel like I am gaming in a damn movie theater!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The TV was on sale for $750, the speakers were $150.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is honestly the best deal I have seen on a TV that is from a reputable brand and has what you want (^.^)</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was going to buy a TV I would personally go for the TCL 6 Series 65" TV (Around $800) right now.&nbsp; If you were OK in dropping size you could go to 55" for around $600.&nbsp; If you were being strict on the budget the 55" 5 Series is only about $400 right
 now.</p>

            Did you run the commands from an admin PowerShell prompt? There's also a group policy in Enterprise to disable the Store app (and possibly all apps from the Store as well - haven't checked).

            <p>I found that the GP you are talking about only exists on later builds. We are using Build 10240 and lacks that policy. We don't want to update since it would go to 1607 build which seems to break the functionality of the devices.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The following commands run in sequence from an admin PowerShell should do what you want, unless you ran something else:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-AppXProvisionedPackage -online | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -online</p>
<p>Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that a few apps such as Cortana etc. might still remain, but the majority should be removed for all user accounts
<em>including</em> future ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick question though - if you're going to so much trouble to remove all Store apps then why not use Enterprise LTSB instead of normal Enterprise?</p>

<p>You don't need them, they are not used by the system and are only there for you. &nbsp;When you delete them, they'll spend some time in the Recycle Bin, so you can always get it back there if you change your mind (unless you empty it, then it's gone until you
 re-download it from the original website).</p>

    <title>Mouse scroll inactive windows doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse scroll inactive windows doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, since my last Windows Update, I've found my "scroll inactive windows when I hover over them" function doesn's work on my laptop. I checked the Settings, and the function is "On". I tried to turn it off and on and reboot my laptop several times, but
 nothing works.</p>
<p>I'm wondering is there anyone else has the same problem? How did you solve it. I think this scroll inactive windows function is one of the most fantastic functions in Win10, really want to fix it!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, I've tried my original Dell mouse (my laptop is Dell) and an alternative Microsoft mouse, but it doesn't help to solve the problem. I don't have another Win10 device (all my other devices are win 7), so I'm not able to have a controlled double-check.
</p>
<p>Also, I tried to uninstall my latest windows updates, but the problem is still there. Any other potential solution for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ruby</p>

            <p>Hi again, I have some updates on this issue. I found the problem only exists with MS office. For example, the scroll inactive window function works perfectly if I open two browsers side-by-side, or if I open two system windows. However, whenever I open an
 MS office window-say Word or Excel plus a browser, the scroll would not work. I have tried various combinations, so far the problem seems to be MS office, but I remember it worked fine before my last major windows updates.</p>

    <title>VMware Workstation Player&#58; Windows 8.1 setup disc not detecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danpin  say:</h3>
<h2>            VMware Workstation Player&#58; Windows 8.1 setup disc not detecting hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I recently grabbed a Windows 8.1 ISO so I can install it on a 32-bit VM (using VMware Workstation Player on a Windows 10 host), but shortly after the installation window popped up, it gave me an error message saying that a media driver my VM needs is missing.
 However, I did create the virtual hard disk so I can set up Windows 8.1 on the VM, but the installer kept failing to detect the virtual hard disk after multiple trials, and I don't know what to do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried doing one of the following solutions, all which were unsuccessful:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I tried to expand the virtual hard disk's capacity, but it did not work.</li><li>I compacted the disk but still no luck.</li><li>I tried to defragment the disk, but still nothing.</li><li>I deleted and recreated the VM, this time using either IDE or SATA, but it still failed to detect the hard drive.</li><li>Finally, I created a separate hard disk to see if it can find it, but it still refused to detect the hard disk. To be honest I don't know if the VM was configured incorrectly, or if the program contained a software error.</li></ul>
<p>Is this a bug? Or what? There's got a workaround here somewhere so I can get this thing working.</p>

<h2>            Stuck in auto repair loop, bios is weird</h2>
                    So my computer is stuck in windows 8.1 automatic repair loop and I can't do anything because my bios is strange, I don't know why but it is very different from any bios I have ever seen in a guide or tutorial for fixing computer problems. The only options
 I have in my bios are "Create raid Volume" "Delete Raid Volume" "Reset Disks to Non-RAID" "Recovery Volume Options" and absolutely none of these are helpful titles, especially since I don't know what they do. Someone please help I really wasn't in the market
 for a gigantic new paperweight.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your computer connected to a domain network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows startup files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to&nbsp;<strong>run bootrec commands in the command prompt from Windows recovery environment&nbsp;</strong>and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>",
 do so. If you don‚Äôt see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the <strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don‚Äôt have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click
</p>
<p>"<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>C</strong><strong>ommand prompt</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. In the command prompt, type the following commands one by one and press Enter after each command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec /fixmbr</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>create Windows installation media using the following article:</strong><br />

<h2>            windows 7 laptop not seeing Garmin GPS device since windows update on 17&#47;02&#47;2018</h2>
                    My Windows 7 laptop updated yesterday. Since then when I plug in my Garmin Etrex GPS via USB my laptop hasn't recognised it as an external drive so I cannot download anything to it or interrogate files. Even the Garmin Express software cannot connect to
 the GPS. Also, I had to reinstall the Garmin software, as although it was visible in the list of programs it wouldn't open. Has anybody else had a similar issue?

    <title>Why now I can&#39;t select&#47;highlight multiple chat messages in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why now I can&#39;t select&#47;highlight multiple chat messages in Skype anymore&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Once upon a time, Skype was a nice software, then ended up under the Microsoft umbrella and everything lost its user experience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ctrl+f for the search chat function, in one of the last update was disabled, a very nice and useful command wiped out.
<br />
<br />
Now I got back the ctrl+f functionality, witch by the way does not highlight the word you are searching for (genius...), not sure if because you have hired a not stoned UX designer or because I've switched to WIN 10 Pro, but I've lost the capability to highlight
 the chat and copy paste the content somewhere else, I can only highlight message by message, so if you have 150 messages you will spend your time thinking about the brilliant User Experience Designer, the Product Manager and the rest of the hippie stoned members
 of the team.<br />
<br />
We are in 2018, why, why, why you always find a way to complicate user life.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/86bbdb79-7f9b-4daa-ba06-b73ef0e4ae71" title="Icks13">
<p>
</p><p>The Skype 8 and Skype for Windows has the functionality to select messages on your app. You may refer to the screenshot below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right click on the message, then select "Select Messages".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89487786-964e-48f7-a24a-df0fcab56b7c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89487786-964e-48f7-a24a-df0fcab56b7c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You will have the option to tick the&nbsp;circle&nbsp;on the side of each messages that you want to copy, forward, or&nbsp;remove.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e04a1a41-5ba8-4363-93ee-ba3d8a6cf41f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e04a1a41-5ba8-4363-93ee-ba3d8a6cf41f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have these functionalities on your end. If you don't have, please provide the version of your Skype app.</p>

            Yes I have this functionality thanks, but still the my previous message doesn't change. The UX made a step back.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have 16 messages on my screen, previously was just required:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
mouse click<br />
highlight<br />
ctrl+c<br />
ctrl+v<br />
<br />
now instead:<br />
<br />
right click<br />
select messages<br />
16 clicks<br />
copy clipboard<br />
ctrl+v<br />
<br />
So in my case, a user in the past would have took 4 clicks to get the result, today in the future, and when I think about future I think about improvement, a user need to take 20 clicks... I'm impress...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
what about the old fashion and more effective highlight way that would solve all in 4 actions? alternatives? neither holding "shift" automatically check all the messages...

            Hi Bobbie
<br />
<br />Before running the following method, if you have files in your Downloads folder that you require, please move those to a more permanent location . . .
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete

            You can download CCleaner to clean your computer of unnecessary files to free up space on your computer. I use this program and it helps out a bunch!

 "src" that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly. Do you want to delete this shortcut" src is a file i had. So any help please I have a lot of important .txt and videos from the past 3years in the
 folder and now its gone..

<div>There is no Windows 7 driver for the X5150, and barely even a Vista driver. Full support ended with XP. Do yourself as favour and get a new Win 7 compatible printer..

            <p>That would be for rewards credits. If it has been 96 hours since you redeemed them, they should show as pending on the Rewards site. They will be deposited onto your Microsoft account as currency by the following 15th or 30th of the month after you received them and then you can use the currency towards digital purchases.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi KingDavidIII,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses to the Getting Ready for Windows 7 Community forum.<br />
<br />
<span>What I suggest doing prior to looking for Windows drivers or trying to install Windows Drivers is see if the system has any points of concern that are listed when running the Windows
 Upgrade Advisor.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a></p>
<br />
<br />
Try running the upgrade advisor and let us know what points of concern it presents for you to address.<br />
<br />
Other then that, you could try installing the driver for XP in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Install&nbsp;the driver using compatibility mode (using Vista or XP)<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Navigate to the .EXE (of the driver you downloaded to the folder on the desktop)&nbsp;
<br />
2.&nbsp; (Cont'd) Right click on the .EXE (installer to install the driver) and select Properties<br />
3.&nbsp;Select the&nbsp;Compatibility tab -&gt; "Run the program..."<br />
3. Select Windows Vista or XP, and click OK<br />
4. Try running the installer.<br />
<br />
Please keep us advised involving this issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            King DavidIII:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have posted a link below to the "How to install the Win7 Release Candidate" page.&nbsp; Basically the part that applies to your situation is:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<p>A blank DVD</p>
</li><li>
<p>A PC with a DVD burner</p>
</li><li>
<p>A PC for testing with these system requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 GHz or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor</p>
</li><li>
<p>1 GB RAM (32-bit) / 2 GB RAM (64-bit)</p>
</li><li>
<p>16 GB available disk space (32-bit) / 20 GB (64-bit)</p>
</li><li>
<p>DirectX 9 graphics processor with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
Your graphics card does not have available drivers for Win7 that meet these requirements.&nbsp; The drivers you have cause the problems you are experiencing.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You will have to configure Windows Display adaptor to extend your desktop:</p>
<p>Right-click the desktop, and then click Properties.<br />
In the DisplayProperties dialog box, click the Settings tab.<br />
Click the Display list and select your external monitor. If you do not see multiple monitors listed, your computer hardware may not support Dualview. You can still use MaxiVista to configure a second computer as an additional display, however.<br />
Select the Extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor option. Click Apply or OK.</p>

<p><span>Hey everyone, recently me and my roomate were having trouble getting the xbox one to turn on so we unplugged it so there could at least be tv watched. Now a month later, were trying to get the xbox one back up and running on the tv and are having no
 luck, only the tv comes on now even though the xbox is on after plugging everything back.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>I'm sure the xbox one is okay, it has to be something not being plugged in right. i tried to call best buy to see if someone can come out to look at it and they said home visits are 150$!!! i'm not paying that much for something so miniscule that can

 probably be fixed in 10 minutes or less.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>If you want to use your xbox to control your tv, then you want to plug your cable box or satellite into the hdmi in port on the xbox one. then you connect the hdmi out port of the xbox one to the hdmi in port on your tv(however to watch tv your xbox one
 has to be on for the signal to pass through). I personally do not use the tv function of my xbox one,because I don't want to have to have my xbox on to watch tv. I have my cable box plugged into the hdmi in port of my tv, and my xbox one plugged into another
 hdmi in port. Then when I want to play I just switch the input on my tv.</p>

            <p>Is the Xbox One turning on but there's nothing on the TV? If so, check which HDMI port you used on the back; you should have the HDMI cable to the TV plugged into the port closest to the power supply (HDMI Out) and not the other one.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

            <p>Hey Qorpo, these are great suggestions and you should definitely submit them to the Feedback site:</p>
<p><a href="http://feedback.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://feedback.xbox.com/</a></p>
<p>That website is used by the Engineering Team, and suggestions there have already made it into the console.</p>
<p>In case someone has already suggested these ideas, you can simply upvote them in order to show your support for the idea.</p>
<p>In case these are both new ideas, you should make two separate posts - one for each idea. This is how the team over there prefers posts to be submitted: one clear idea per post.</p>
