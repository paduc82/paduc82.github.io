 my hotmail account, so please email me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** so that I can resolve this matter and get back into my hotmail email account. I need to be able to see emails here as this is one of my primary email accounts. Please help me!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

<p>Thank you for the information you provided. Since you're able to use your email account using the Firefox browser, the issue may be regarding the previous browser you're using. For us to help you with your concern, we suggest that you try to clear the cache
 and browsing history of the said browser. You can also try to update the browser affected and see if the issue persists.

<p>Hi Christe,</p>
<p>I'm Somewhat sure No One Knows about the Error Message. Just a Wild Guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Internet Options do You have <a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www</a><a href="http://www.hotmail.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">.hotmail.co</a>m or
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> as the the Home page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Beyond Unreal change over a couple years ago. Hotmail was "merged" into Outlook I had a similar problem. That merged change/mess has caused many problems for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of Course your Problem is recent? I am probably sure Your Problem</p>
<p>"issue" started about When you Posted about Feb. 28, 2018,</p>
<p>When Problems start/begin is when Many/Most people Ask a Question In Community.

</p><p>We would like to know more about your concern regarding the error you received when accessing Outlook. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have/had this Question asked of me Many Times.</p>
<p>The first part of the Question is Usually When I Post.</p>
<p>The Second Part of the Question Is: I have No Idea,&nbsp; Do Not Know and No Clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Suggestion is made about the "meantime" What the Does that mean? No Clue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Christie, I have a Question. I do not know much about Safari on a Mac.</p>
<p>I Do Know, very familar about Mac.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am Sure&nbsp; Mac on Apple has a Email Service? </p>
<p>You may have/had Hotmail a long time, as many have. Seen many changes. Maybe it may have Something to Do with the BETA Outlook.com Mail?&nbsp; Many thousands are having Problems there. BETA is Outlook.com with Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Firefox on the Computer. It just sits. </p>
<p>

            Yes, the problem remains in place:&nbsp;I can't receive email in either my Outlook account nor my Hotmail account. I've even tried setting up another Outlook account, but the Microsoft system won't let me do that. Unless I can get these working, i will have
 to totally abandon&nbsp;Outlook as an email possibility.

<h2>            Windows 10 insider licence no-longer active after motherboard died</h2>
                    <p>I have been an insider since 21/01/2015 and everything has been great but a couple days ago my motherboard died and I had to replace it. due to the motherboard being old and no-longer manufactured I had no option but to get a new model and now because my
 motherboard is different my Windows 10 is no-longer active. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to get my insider product key reactivated. I tried contacting live support but they said they are not trained to handle insider problems.

            As it is the same hardrive windows 10 was still installed and worked as soon as I booted up on the new motherboard (which surprised me I was expecting to have to do a clean install), I currently have Windows 10 and Windows 7 duel booted.

            <p>The Windows 10 promotion promises a free upgrade license with support for the given device&nbsp;through its supportable lifetime. There is no distinction between the Insider Program or the public concerning this promotion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You received a Windows 10 license, your device received support until the end of its supportable lifetime. There is nothing to transfer or reactivate.</p>

<h2>            From Word 2010 to Word 2016 no default arrow shape</h2>
                    <p>I've developed several .dotx templates for work using Word 2010. I was able to use 'Set as Default Line' to save the formatting changes of size, shape, and color.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That no longer works in Word 2016. The color and line weight appear the same, but the arrow head has reverted to a tiny triangle and I have to change each individual arrow every time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried (as one person suggested) editing the normal.dotm with no success.</p>

            As a workaround, you can format a line the way you want it, select it and create a Building Block (for example via Insert | Quick Parts | Save Selection to Quick Part Gallery) which you can then insert at any time when you need a line with that specific
 formatting/appearance.

<p>Although that works, it takes nearly as long as formatting the arrow. Speed=efficiency.

            Note that you only have to create the Building Block once. After that, you can insert it quickly by making use of AutoComplete. Just start typing the name of the Building Block and press Enter to accept the suggestion made by Word. Or you can type the
 whole name and press F3 to insert the corresponding BB.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 to-do bar not showing end time for appointments&#47;meetings</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just downloaded Outlook 2016 having previously used Outlook 2010. I noticed that unfortunately in OL2016 when I book in appointments/meetings in my calendar and display them in the To-Do bar, it only shows the start time and not the end time of the
 appointment/meeting... This was available in Office 2010 and made it easy to be able to see the exact end time of a meeting without having to physically click into the meeting details or hover your mouse over it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if someone could advise on how i can display the end time of meetings in the To-Do bar in OL2016???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes i have set an end time on all appointments/meetings. Also, I can actually see the end times when i hover the cursor over the appointment in the To-Do Bar entry so its just a matter of trying to make the end time visible without having to move my cursor
 to the To-Do Bar...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other troubleshooting steps ive performed have been to setup an end time view in the Calendar function which now displays the end time when i click into calendar. I was hoping this would fix it but unfortunately it hasnt...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this feature is available.</p>
<p>

<p>HI John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see screenshots below for your reference. I have included an Outlook 2010 calendar along with my Outlook 2016 Calendar. As you can see, the Dentist appointment clearly shows the start and end times in Outlook 2010. In Outlook 2016 however, it only
 shows the start times. Is there any way i can have the end times shown on Outlook 2016?</p>

<h2>            How to create an index of an entire text, i.e. of all words in a word &#40;2013&#41; document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In order to find (missing) keywords, count frequencies etc. I need to make an index in Word documents of the entire text of that document, of every word from 1 letter onward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I tried to work with a concordance file (search and replace to get every word on a separate line) , but that is very unpractical because of all the multiple entries&nbsp;and the fact that they are case sensitive, meaning they all have to be copied with
 a capital letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here and there on the internet&nbsp;I found some references to macro's, but they do not work (at least not in v. 2013). I also found a reference on this site saying that (in word 2007) no macro would be needed, but following the link I found no answer....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help.</p>

<p>Thank you so much, Doug. I couldn't believe it could not be done, and now it can.</p>
<p>Never would have guessed it would be called Word Frequency. Hope this reply solves that.</p>

 need them as well, if only because so many words can have different meanings in various contexts.</p>

<p>OK, so you are able to navigate to the location that the files are stored in, right? That means that the path name IS valid. By elimination that means the file name is probably not valid. Take a close look at the file name, look for "funky" characters or
 even leading spaces.</p>
<p>When you rename the file, do you also rename the extension? I'm guessing not. Rename the extension also.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if the names have some sort of unicode characters that look like "normal" characters, but are different.</p>

<p>same way as you rename the file. In Explorer or any Open/Save dialog box, single click on the file name, press &lt;F2&gt;, you go into filename rename mode. Normally we just change the filename portion.</p>
<p>I see in your earlier comments that you created the file on this machine. I thought you might have downloaded it from somewhere else, where there may have been strange characters in the extension. Obviously that is not the case.</p>
<p>I'm out of ideas for now.</p>

                    Some of the records in my main form have hundreds of records in the subForm. How can I go to a record on the subform by selecting the record from a combo placed on the main form (or on the subform)?

            <p>You can use a filter on the after update event of the combo.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>Me.[SubformControlName].Form.Filter = "Nz([PrimaryKeyField] = " &amp; Me.[ComboName],0)</p>
<p>Me.[SubformControlName].Form.FilterOn = True</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>Note: The primary key of the subform is the same field as the combo's hidden and bound column, and my code assumes that primary key is a number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give the user a reset button to clear the filter.</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>Me.[SubformControlName].Form.Filter = ""</p>
<p>Me.[SubformControlName].Form.FilterOn = False</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 on ATT Not Receiving Long Texts from Certain People</h2>
                    I have a Lumia 640 LTE on ATT that has not been receiving longer text messages from certain numbers. &nbsp;It is always the same people. &nbsp;If they send a message longer than a few sentences, I will never receive it. &nbsp;The one person I know that I do not receive
 her messages from has an iPhone, but there are other people who have iPhones and it works fire. &nbsp;It has been doing this since I got the phone a few months ago. &nbsp;I used to have a Samsung S3 and had an iPhone before that and never had this issue with them. &nbsp;I
 tried exchanging the phone for another Lumia 640 and changing SIM cards and it has not helped. &nbsp;ATT tech support also did not have any more ideas. &nbsp;Love the phone otherwise but if it keeps doing this I will have to switch phones back to iPhone. &nbsp;

<p>Long texts can be multipart SMS or MMS.</p>

If it fails, persist with AT&amp;T for the correct MMS settings.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: printing or saving to PDF from microsoft EDGE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just finished a chat session with the answer help desk of Microsoft and the agent accessed my laptop remotely, and tried fixing the printer but seemed working alright but not working with Microsoft EGDE, then I asked about the save to PDF or send to one
 note features, so I was told that it seems that this feature isn't working properly yet in my country as the EDGE is still a new product and it's still under trial or something like that. I said how come Microsoft miss a main feature like this, it's a print
 option, I am sure it's not that impossible for Microsoft to fix it to have a whole product missing an important feature. I have been told " sorry for any inconvenience" I would like to make sure this information is accurate. Also, I have been told I should
 be receiving an email including the case number and chat transcript and till now I haven't received anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much</p>

            <p><span>Hello Ramez,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which country are you residing at?</span></li><li><span>Do you have the application installed on your PC to open, read and save the PDF file format?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong> option is present in Edge browser?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to have an application installed on your PC to open, read and save your documents in
<strong>pdf</strong> file format. If you do not have the appropriate file extension reader applications installed, you will not be able to open and view the files on your PC. Every file needs a supporting application to open and display the content it holds.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check if the <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong> option is present in Edge browser by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> by clicking on the browser icon pinned to the taskbar.</span></li><li><span>Open the content you want to print and press <strong>Ctrl + P</strong> keys on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong>Printer</strong> option check if you have <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong> from the dropdown menu.</span></li><li><span>Check if you are able to print the web content in PDF format.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick reply, in answering your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am based in Australia</li><li>I do have Adobe Acrobat Reader</li><li>&nbsp;can see the option in the Microsoft EDGE</li></ol>
<p>All those features, the printing and saving to PDF work very good with Google Chrome and internet explorer. After the agent accessed my laptop remotely, I have been told that it seems those features are not supported by EDGE yet, as it is still a new product.
 Which I find that really surprisingly if Microsoft missed something like that. Explaining the issue a bit more, the print preview or save to PDF shows as blank and only 1 page doesn't matter if it's more than a page or not, but just blank and one page for
 all the features like printing, saving to PDF, send to ONE note, XML. I do have latest version of Adobe acrobat reader and Microsoft office 2013. Thanks and looking forward to hearing back from you again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Ramez</p>

<p><span>Thank you for responding quickly with the answers and the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to some of the corrupted app files &amp; folders or missing app files on your PC.
</span><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and sometime will fix to enhance the performance of the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to run the

 check if the issue is resolved if you haven’t tried the method before.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically
 identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I tried the first method but turned out to be having no problems.</p>
<p>Then I created a local account, and once I signed on the windows, I received a notification message saying something about default app for .PDF files restored to default. The EDGE works alright with the local account, I then checked the default apps, it
 was chosen EDGE for the .PDF files as default on the local account. I then went to the administrator account, and I changed it to EDGE as default app for the .PDF files, restarted the laptop but still didn't work. So what am I meant to do now? and also please
 I need to know how come the technician gave me wrong information and didn't even send me an email after the chat ended as normally happens.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for responding quickly with the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue does not persist in the newly created user profile, I suggest you to transfer the required important files from the old user profile to new user profile
 as it is determined to be corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To transfer the files from the corrupted user profile to the newly created user profile, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows logo + E</strong> keys on the keyboard to open
<strong>File explorer</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>This PC</strong> located at the left side panel of the window to open the drives of the PC.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go to <strong>users</strong> folder by opening the
<strong>C:</strong> drive. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>From <strong>users
</strong>folder, locate the user folder you want to move files from and copy only the important files. Copying the whole
<strong>users</strong> folder may corrupt your newly created folder.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After copying the files delete the corrupted user profile.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Do not copy the entire
<strong>user</strong> folder from the corrupted user profile as it may transfer the corrupted and missing files &amp; folders to the newly created user profile causing the issue to relapse.</span></p>

    <title>Outlook 2010&#47;2013 - IMAP connection problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terry haroldson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010&#47;2013 - IMAP connection problem</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up an gmail account in Outlook 2013 using IMAP, but can't successfully connect to the IMAP server. Upon adding the account in Outlook, I get the following message:<br />
"Log onto incoming mail server (IMAP): A secure connection to the server cannot be established"<br />
<br />
The SMTP test succeeds, but connection to imap.gmail.com fails. &nbsp;I have tried many times and quadruple-checked the settings per various sites, including:<br />
<br />
https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en<br />
http://www.howtogeek.com/174837/how-to-add-your-gmail-account-to-outlook-2013-using-imap/<br />
<br />
I am certain the steps I'm using are correct, because I can sucessfully add the same account as IMAP into Outlook on another computer. &nbsp;<br />
Prior to a couple of days ago, I had Outlook 2010 installed and it exhibited the same behaviour. I thought installing Outlook 2013 might help, so I completely uninstalled Office 2010, and ran FixIT before installing Office 2013.<br />
Disabling the firewall does not help.<br />
I can change to pop3, and it works fine.<br />
I don't have 2-step verification enabled and I have enabled 'Access for less secure apps' on the gmail account.<br />
<br />
Any ideas of what I could try next?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mohan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had previously tried disabling Windows firewall which made no difference but, your suggestion of a blocked port led me to look at my antivirus (eset V5), and I came to the same conclusion that is identified in this post....&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/c3590f9f-2dc2-48d4-820a-8a70c2b4fda1/imap-network-problem?forum=itproxpsp</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Eset V5, i unchecked the 'Enable IMAP Checking' option under Advanced Setup/Web and email/Email client Protection/IMAP. &nbsp;This fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Note that I tried adding port 993 and 587 to the option, but it still would not work. &nbsp;Unchecking seemed to be the only fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link above indicates they have resolved this in V7 of eset, but I can not confirm this, and will just leave that unchecked for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            All data files are backed up to Blackbaze's servers on a continuous basis; however, I can retrieve a file that existed at an earlier date. So I tried opening up a pst file that was last accessed one day before I reset Windows 10.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>looks like the Autosave function is not working when you open the file from the onedrive folder. It only works when you open it through Onedrive site</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007&#58; Attempt at &#34;Repair&#34; Fails Apparently Because the &#40;Outlook 2007&#41; Disc Cannot Find the Product Key</h2>
                    <p>I have tried numerous times doing the Outlook 2007 "Repair" on my 64-bit Windows 7 w/SP1 machine.&nbsp; Outlook 2007 has been on this machine for years and, no, I don't want to upgrade.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
<br />
Anyway, regardless of what source I use for the disc (on-board CD/DVD drive; USB-connected CD/DVD drive; on-board HDD), I get the same error which points me to a .chm file which, in turn, tells me that the disc cannot find the Product Key.<br />
</p>
<p>The "Repair" process doesn't ask me for the Product Key.&nbsp; The "Repair" process doesn't ask me where to it might find the Product Key (presumably that would be the same place the Outlook 2007 installation finds it but who knows).&nbsp; The "Repair" process is
 apparently unable to locate it on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get the "Repair" process to find/utilize my legitimate Product Key if it can't find it on its own, I can't tell it where to find it and/or I can't type it in somewhere?<br />
<br />
I'd like to think that there is a drop-dead simple solution that I've overlooked.&nbsp; Even if there isn't...HELP!<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>

            <p>Palcouk:<br />
<br />
Thanks for chiming in.<br />
<br />
Here is what the repair process tells me:&nbsp; "Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 configuration did not complete successfully.&nbsp; Error 1706.&nbsp; Setup cannot find the required files.&nbsp; Check your....&nbsp; For other potential solutions to this problem, see "C:\Users\E...~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Setup000008ac\SETUP.CHM."<br />
<br />
"SETUP.CHM" says, among other things, "Enter your Product Key."<br />
<br />
Like I said in my OP, the "configuration process" doesn't provide me the opportunity to "Enter" my Product Key.<br />
<br />
To your next question, I looked on the page to which you linked, as well as other pages connected to that page and I can't find a page that allows me to have my key verified.&nbsp; If you could provide the specific page, I'd be appreciative.<br />
<br />
And although I've had Outlook 2007 since, well, 2007, and have the original Product Key label, it seems ludicrous to me that I have had an invalid Product Key for the last nearly 10 years.&nbsp; But, I guess stranger things have happened.<br />
<br />
Again, if you can provide the specific page, Palcouk, that allows me to validate my PK, that'd be immensely helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />

</p><p>Hi Silviu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to check, after updating your phone, have you tried performing a factory reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend doing this after every update to ensure that the updates installed on your phone jives with any existing settings on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a factory reset, go to Settings &gt; About &gt; tap Reset my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: We strongly suggest to back up your files before doing this reset as this would wipe out all of the files on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
