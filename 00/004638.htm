<h2>            lumia 920 runs very hot very quick</h2>
                    The last week now my 920 runs very hot. It happens after light game play or web browsing or anything really after about 15 mnutes. I just put it down for about a half hour and it was still warm. Kids corner is off, location services turned off. Anyone
 else having same problem? Anyone know if this is a result of recent update? Have had this issue in past but it was usually temporary

<p>There have been lots of discussions regarding the 920 getting hot during operation</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But some heating is to be expected when using the phone due to its construction and you shouldn't worry too much about it warming up. If you feel that it is excessively hot you should take it to a Nokia care point for inspection.</p>

<p>If by 'hot' you mean warm to the touch then that would be normal and nothing to worry about. If you mean hot as in can't hold it go back to your supplier or contact Nokia Care</p>

<p>I am having the same trouble as of today. I bought my Lumia 920 at the end of March and this problem is something new. It always got hot during use, but it has been warm to hot all day even when it was in my purse unused. I turned it off and checked it a
 half hour later and it is still warm. The battery also discharged very quickly today too.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Berksgal,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!<br />
<br />
How are you using the phone? Are you connected to Internet? Can you still hold the phone? Do you have apps running on the background?<br />
<br />
Make sure that you close the applications once you're done using them. Same goes with your internet connection. For battery saving tips, you can refer to this article;<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/56CF5076-2E4D-4775-84A5-B07EF89B5919">http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-Lumia/Battery-information-and-Tips-for-Lumia-820-and-920/m-p/1617864/highlight/true#M26430</a><br />
<br />
You can also check if there's an update available for your phone. If there is, download it and observe if the issue is still the same. The last option would be, is to take the device to a Nokia Care Point for an assessment.<br />
<br />
Cheers!

<p>if even after a reboot, which should stop any applications that are running except for those authorized, it is still getting hot, then check your background authorized applications and turn some of them off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>settings/swipe to applications/background tasks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what ever is not necessary to have running in the background, even when the phone is in standby/locked, tap on it and tap "block" so that it is not going to run unless you open it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this should also save you some battery life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my device too, since last update seems to be getting unusually HOT during usage and charging.&nbsp; even just using wordament, or monster burner or angry birds, and anything GPS makes it hot and that heat taxes the battery and drains it fast too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>while it gets HOT, it is still holdable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope there will be another update to address this soon.</p>

            Let me get this right... the heat issue is a known issue and Nokia consider it to be acceptable? My Lumia 800 was never like this, the 920's heat issue seems pretty serious, when it's hot I can feel it through the pocket of my pants.

            Cutting off the ability to run in the background some apps has helped. I haven't had the issue again.

            My Lumia 920,encountering the same issue too. It is holdable but the heat is extremely high that everyone will think that it is unusual. When I asked help from Nokia store that I bought the phone from, the salesperson said this is normal. The normal he
 meant was that is a common weakness from the feedback of users. I love this phone so much, so is there anything we can do to solve the problem? P/s I'd already blocked all the background task apps

</span></p>
<p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been recently been prompted over and over again that a threat has been found.&nbsp; The threat being TrojanDownloader:097M/Donoff.&nbsp; I can only access info on the threat only if I click on the notification, which shows me the history and that 097M/Donoff
 has been quarantined.&nbsp; I can't find options to delete the threat though.&nbsp; If I try to look at defenders home screen it show me that no threats have been found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the notifications stop when I exit OneDrive from systray icon.&nbsp; OneDrive just seems to keep Processing Changes, even though nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Malwarebytes, and it has found nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats going on?&nbsp; How do I get rid of this?&nbsp; I did an offline scan and it found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped, help please.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>******* FIXED ******</p>
<p>
</p><p>FALSE POSITIVE</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had switched to having OneDrive make all the files available on my computer.&nbsp; As it synced my files it came across a zip backup of a Wordpress site for a client.&nbsp; The site contained a plugin php file that caused the false positive.&nbsp; &nbsp;I pointed&nbsp; Defender
 to scan that directory and was able to pin point the file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The file was not apparent when it first notified me because the way OneDrive handles syncing... as you can see in the above image.&nbsp; I thought my machine was infected through MS Office... by a Macro.</p>

<div>When I try this link, it navigates me to another page, which says "We are sorry, the page you requested cannot be found"; And the general search in MSDN brought me back to this conversation. Could you please give us the new URL if it is moved to some other

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I did a few more research on finding the right setup, but was not successful. Finally I went back to the same download page, where we can download the SQL Server 2005 feature pack. It looks like, the setup we were looking for has been moved from its original
 link (which I tried before) to this page <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=11988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=11988</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Please look for the file named "SQLServer2005_BC.msi" or "SQLServer2005_BC_x64.msi" depending on your OS. BC - stands for the Backward compatibility, and even though it is for SQL Server 2005, it does work for SQL 2008 as well. All the installation steps
 remain same. And&nbsp;off-course, I was able to run the DTS migrated package in SSIS 2008 R2!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps you.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Emails not downloaded as they arrive with only wifi enabled&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aceofspades25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails not downloaded as they arrive with only wifi enabled&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally I disable the data connection from my mobile network to preserve battery. (e.g. When in my office all day, I have a wifi connection and so I can disable the 3G data connection and still have internet connectivity on my phone)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this happens, I notice that emails are no longer downloaded as they arrive. I really like this option, and it works well over 3G, but the phone doesn't seem to retrieve my mail automatically at all over wifi. It will sync with my mail if I tell it to,
 but it doesn't happen automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug, or is it meant to be this way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to put in a request for this to be rectified with Mango.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Did you actually delete the <i>application</i> or did you delete the <i>Dock Icon</i>? The Dock icon is just an Alias [shortcut]. First, see if the Word program is still in the
<b>Applications:Microsoft Office 2008</b> folder. If it is just drag it to the Dock to create a new shortcut.<br />
<br />
If the program isn't in that folder. look in the Trash. If it's still there, drag it back to the Microsoft Office 2008 folder in the Applications folder.<br />
<br />
If you've emptied the Trash, reinstall from an original DVD... It need not be <i>
your</i> DVD but you will need <i>your</i> Product Key. Follow the instructions on
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2400260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i><b>this page</b></i></a>. You can do a
<b>Customized</b> installation as described in <b>Step #12</b> in order to install Word only.<br />

            Well, you can simply re-install it. &nbsp;You have your product key.
<div><br />
<div>If you have lost the install disk, you can borrow it from someone else: your key will install any legitimate copy of Office 2008.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now: &nbsp;Depending on what you have deleted, you may not even need the product key. &nbsp;When you activated, the system stored a code that activates your copy of Office. &nbsp;So long as you haven't deleted that, Office 2008 will simply re-install without needing
 the product key.</div>
<div><br />
<div>WARNING: &nbsp;Run the update service BEFORE you attempt to run the new installation, otherwise you will live in a world of hurt. Start Excel or PowerPoint, go to the Help menu and run "Check for Updates".</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

    <title>A macro to attach a file &#40;with hotkey&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> êΩÒÇæΩ ú∏ÒÖ∞πªæ≤_947  say:</h3>
<h2>            A macro to attach a file &#40;with hotkey&#41;</h2>
                    Hello everybody!<br />
Won't somebody help me to make a macro for attaching a file dialog in a new letter in Outlook 2007, for I can asign a shortcut for it.
<br />
I know how to create, save and add a shortcut to macro, but almost nothing in VBA programming.<br />
I found a piece of code:<br />
Sub Attach_MyFile()<br />
Set NewItem = Application.ActiveInspector.CurrentItem<br />
NewItem.Attachments.Add ‚Äú\\path\filename‚Äù<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
but it's not what I need, because it takes file from a specified place and doesn't give a dialog to select.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be grateful for help, and I think it will be very useful for thousands of people all over the Earth who are compelled to work with Outlook.<br />
I like Thunderbird very much, and I made shortcuts myself there, but because of the corporative rules in my company I can use only Outlook 2007.<br />
<br />
Thank you
                </div>

    <title>Fix balloon margin when printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nvz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fix balloon margin when printing</h2>
                    I changed my balloon margin to 15cm (under Track Changes - Change Tracking Options). So while I'm working on my document in word, the document text itself and the comment portion is about equal widths (half the page each). However, when I print my document,
 the comments/balloon width reduces automatically. How do I fix the comments/balloon margin to stay wide?

<h2>            Lost emails after upgrading to Outlook.com</h2>
                    I I have lost important FOLDERS in this turn over to OUTLOOK. How can I restore my missing FOLDERS? I am very unhappy with this program design.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been a HOTMAIL customer of Microsoft since the first week of it's creation. THIS and many more weaknesses in the faulty design of OUTLOOK are disturbing and absolutely not user friendly. Microsoft has reduced or abandoned opportunities to contact
 them and provide useful service responses. I am recommending to hundreds of friends and contacts that they, in return, abandon Microsoft OUTLOOK. This has been a very bad business decision by this company and the people that are programming for them at this
 time. </div>

            <p>Hi thetrouphouse49,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response as we are experiencing a high contact volume at this time. I understand that you want to retrieve your lost email folders after upgrading to Outlook.com and you are having problems using the new interface.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">By upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox. However, if your emails were over 270 days old, you may have lost
 them due to inactivity in the account even before you renamed the account. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You can use the recover deleted / lost email feature in Hotmail to bring back your lost emails. However, our system can only restore recently deleted emails and emails that are still available on our server. There is no guarantee that the messages that you
 are looking for will all be recovered. You can refer to the solution article below for the steps: &nbsp;</span></font></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Well if there is no way to correct the updating problem could someone please tell me how to stop windows 10 from continually downloading this update an trying to auto install a failing update. &nbsp;Windows has tried to auto update three times now and I am afraid
 I may miss the message and cause some damage to the existing version when shutting down my PC. &nbsp;I had to wait 10 minutes last night for it to get to the reboot portion to turn the PC back on cause it went into the install mode as I was turning it off and at
 the reboot point the PC shut off.</p>
<p>So who's got the instructions here?</p>

            <p>Couldn't find any help here so I went to Microsoft support help and left my phone number for a call back.</p>
<p>That was yesterday with an estimated call back time of 183 minutes, says the response. &nbsp;I sit around the house for 3.5 hours get tired and leave. &nbsp;This morning around 10:30 I get a call from Microsoft Support.</p>
<p>This dude with a hard to understand dialect from some where in India says that he will tack control of my PC and search out the problem and fix it. &nbsp;He looks and looks all through settings and services and finally go to a Microsoft web site and downloads
 what I thought was the update and does an install.</p>
<p>So here's what I have, an older version of the anniversary windows 10 minus all of the updates after the release and the errors that came with the anniversary release. &nbsp;And Now I CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY UPDATES TO GET ME BACK TO WERE i WAS BEFORE THIS ms WIZARD
 TOOK OVER MY PC.</p>
<p>Is this a great country or what? &nbsp;I can have **** before noon and didn't even get a kiss!</p>

    <title>Using Quick Parts Ref in Header - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanmc783  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Quick Parts Ref in Header</h2>
                    <p>I'm creating a form used to do quaility control checks on applications of clients for our company. We have to use a Client&nbsp;Member Number to run checks&nbsp;in various parts of our system. The form I created as a lot of detail and questions. So, to&nbsp;save some&nbsp;space,&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted
 to have&nbsp;the&nbsp;client's Name and Member# appear in the heading so that our QC reviewers wouldnt have to keep going to the first page&nbsp;of the&nbsp;form where the client's information is located.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the first page of the form has things like</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name:</p>
<p>Member#:</p>
<p>Phone#: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of these is followed by a Text Form Field so that the reviewer can type in the information for the different Member reviews.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ffeef51-6d07-4c8e-a18f-eb38f7458d9d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I named the Text Form Fields, and clicked calculate on exit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a REF Quick Part in the header, using Quick Part found in the Edit Header tab and&nbsp;had them REF the corresponding field above. I locked the document and saved it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/029dc837-a707-43c0-b35a-d4b710c83340" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, whenever the information is entered into the Text Form Field, the Header REF Quick Part doesnt update with the information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I type in, for example, Jon Doe, 456789, 555-555-5555, (tabing out of each as I finish the field) the Header doesnt update with the information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went back, clicked inside the Header and did the Normal Insert, Quick Parts, Ref, as you would in the body of the document, and it still doesnt update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get it to work once, by unlocking the document and typing in the field, then saving it, but that defeats the purpose. I need a blank form, that updates with the information for each individual review that is completed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi rob zeh,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. When you say explorer, do you mean Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;When did you first notice this issue?<br />
<br />
c. Does this happen with any other program on your computer, or just Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>Windows looks at the contents of the desktop shortcuts to determine which program it should use to open the file. It sounds like you have recently used another web browser and
 now Windows does not know which program to use to open Internet Shortcut files (.url).</span></p>
<p><span>1. Navigate to the below location and check if you are able to open Internet Explorer directly without any options.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Internet Explorer (32-bit)</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Internet Explorer (64-bit)</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you tried using Set Default Programs for Internet Explorer within the Control Panel?<span>&nbsp;</span>If not, please follow the steps below in order to do so.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. Click on Start, and select Control Panel</span></span></p>
<p><span>b. Within Control Panel, click Programs</span></p>
<p><span>c. Underneath Default Programs, select Set your default programs</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the Programs list, highlight Internet Explorer and click Set this program as default</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click OK</span></p>
<p><span>This should set Internet Explorer to open as the default.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.</span><span>You may also go through the below link and try the Fixit tool that would automatically fixes the issue you are experiencing:<br />

    <title>Outlook application won&#39;t connect without phone number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boebrauner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook application won&#39;t connect without phone number</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've always been able to use outlook with the same account for many years without any problems until this morning (2019-05-10). Upon opening outlook, I get a prompt asking to confirm my phone number. When I enter my phone number I get the error "The Microsoft
 account doesn't exist. Enter a different account or get a new one." I can click back to bypass this prompt, but outlook does not connect and it shows "Need Password" at the bottom of the window. Clicking Need Password initiates an attempt to connect and requires
 the phone number again... So, I logged into my account online and went to update my contact info. There was no phone number stored there at all, so I go to add mine and receive the error "<span>This phone number is already taken. Please try another."<span>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, the only other Microsoft account I've used in the not so distant future doesn't have the number either, so it must be associated with a MUCH older account or someone else is using my phone number...&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>1. I<span><span>s this some new, not very well thought out update? Why is this stopping me from using outlook now and not before?
<br />
<br />
2. Why can't my phone number be associated with more than one account?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How can I recover my phone number to my current account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. How can I bypass this nuisance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The reply above attempts to mislead you into thinking you are calling "Microsoft online support". The first woman I spoke with, "Ellen", actually posed as Microsoft saying "This is Microsoft", and would not tell me who they really were. She wouldn't do anything
 to confirm this or who they really were, got frustrated, and hung up on me and again the 2nd time I called. I got a different person the 3rd time I called, and the man, "John", admitted that they are a 3rd party named "IT Web Experts, LLC" supposedly in Texas,
 CA. They state they will charge you $50 or $100 for support and can't hide this information when they charge you... but you have another battle at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Tim's "account" and it was created 35 minutes ago...&nbsp;<br />
Microsoft, you may want to implement a cool down period before new accounts can post. Though I don't know if it will solve the problem. They should be upfront about who they are and not mislead people that they are Microsoft. I also ask that you&nbsp;please investigate
 them and perhaps protect some unsuspecting Microsoft customers in the future.</p>

            I've fixed it! When it rejects your phone number, click "Get new account" then, when it opens up the form, click "Back". It then lets you put in your normal password and all is sorted!

<h2>            office 2013 could not be activated</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We deploy office 2013 via click-to-run. Installation is fine, but after installed, it could not be activated.
</p>
<p>ADFS SSO has just been implemented. Before that, activation was ok.</p>
<p>Now, first it didn't support SSO and prompt for email address. After putting in email address, it did not redirect to ADFS and failed with error "Sorry, we can't connect to your account."
</p>
<p>If using different account, it comes with different error as below.</p>
<p>"Another account from your organization is already signed in on this computer"</p>
<p>Is ADFS preventing the activation?</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Lydia</p>

<p>Hi Lydia,<br />
<br />
No, ADFS will not prevent the activation.<br />
<br />
To better understand the issue, I would like to collect the following information:<br />
1. Do all users encounter the problem (can‚Äôt activate Office 2013)?<br />
2. Currently, can you successfully login to OWA (Outlook Web App)?<br />
3. If possible, please clear the cache on the applications and then try to login again (Settings-&gt;account setings-&gt; scroll down and Clear Cache).<br />
<br />
With the detailed information, we will do further research for you. Your time and efforts will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Richard</p>

<p>For some reason, it did activated itself some time without prompting me for the activation. Probably just network issue. But when I check the license copies activated by that user, it showed yesterday, not sure it is UTC date or not. This morning, it was
 still not activated but owa worked..</p>

<p>Hi Lydia,<br />
<br />
I‚Äôm a little confused by ‚Äúit did activated itself some time without prompting me for the activation‚Äù. If it was activated, why will you still encounter the problem? Since you mentioned it could be the network issue, could you please try to connect to another
 network environment to see if the issue persists?<br />
If it is inconvenient for you to switch to another network environment, you may follow the article below to make sure the configurations of your proxy server and the firewall are correct.<br />

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>Thank you for the article. Since it only happens to 1 user so far. I could not figure out what exactly happened. We are still in the early stage deploying office 365. After a few installation, I probably will figure this out.
</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion as myself was confused too. When it asked to activate office, I tried to put in email address and password, it failed. When I switch the network from wireless to cable, then open the office trying to activate. It did not pop up the
 option to active, then I checked the software, it has already been activated before I tried to put in email address.</p>
<p>I will keep close eyes on other machines installation. For now, you can close the ticket.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<br />I saw another site (www.ssemail.com) where you enter the email address and it immediately opened that email without even entering a password!
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />You entered your email where exactly on the "Silver Sound" website? Would be absolutely amazed that they would have direct access to your email account and if they did, that would be a major issue since that would mesn
<br />
<br />#1 - They accessed a breached database containing your email address AND currently active password. Generally, spammers or hackers don't work that way
<br />
<br />#2 - The info you got from LifeLock or HaveIBeenPwned is simply a statement that your email address/password used to subscribe to the site has been hacked. That information could be several years old. The critical thing is properly managing your password use where managing = "don't use the same one on multiple &lt;critical&gt; sites&gt;. FWIW - so far I've rec'd 389 messages over the last few months (as of this morning) claiming to have hacked my email account providing me with the password for the account as proof so I should pay them money via bitcoin under thread of exposing explicit videos - good luck with that. I use a password manager and know exactly what password is active for any given website. In many cases, the information was related to (1) a website that no longer exists or (2) a website I no longer care about but I still change my password on that website just as a matter of course. 
<br />
<br />To recap
<br />
<br />#3 - What you need to ensure is that you don't use the same email address &amp; password combination on multiple websites especially on critical sites like those  mentioned in my previous reply
<br />
<br />#4 - Changing your email address isn't going to accomplish anything since if you use that same new email address/password to subscribe to something, it's quite possible that the database will similarly be breached. Or to put this another way, you'd spend an endless amount of time changing email addresses and letting all your contacts know about that - not to mention all the aggravation associated with linked sites where you've used that address like FaceBook, Twitter, XBox etc etc

<p>I have had my Lumia 900 a little over two weeks now, The first day I took it to work (I charge the phone over night every night) it went down to 39% battery, which I was a little disappointed with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But every day it has got better and better, and just seems like it need to be 'broken in' almost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I use my phone a lot, but seems to keep to the high 70's% time I get home from work now which I am more than satisfied with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My live tiles are switched off, WiFi is off, e-mails is off, well might be easier to say what is on and that is Data connection. Nothing else. Why have anything switched on unless you are using it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OP you said it went down 8% overnight, but then said all you had on was WiFi, you answered your own question there, WiFi is always looking for new connections therefore using battery, simply answer - switch WiFi off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I do stand by what I say and think Nokia need to get some sort of tool bar that is on the main screen to switch these connections of, there too far in the settlings menu.</p>

            Thanks for the replies, but..<br />
<br />
I shouldn't have to set it to flight mode...I might as well just turn it off.<br />
<br />
Wifi is not always looking for a connection. Wifi turns off when the phone is locked.<br />
<br />
My friend has a lumia 800 on a different network and he has email syncing hourly and last time i asked him he was on 60% and over a day since last charge....<br />

<p>Does it really stop in lock mode? maybe misinformed, mind you with the sales person I got I was misled on a lot of things haha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I will add that you can't really compare the 800's battery life with the 900's, one obvious reason is screen size.</p>

            Yeah I don't know where 900 has come from in this thread, I guess I should have said I have an 800 but I don't know why people are assuming it's a 900.<br />
<br />
This is my fourth now 800 now. :/ (recently back from "repair")<br />
<br />
I've had this particular one for a few months I'd say.<br />
<br />
Those battery things are silly. I don't want to turn off all the features of my smartphone. I should be able to have live tiles updating, email syncing and be able to use the phone and still be able to get through a day. What's the point of having it and all
 it's features if I have to turn them off to get through the day.<br />
<br />
Just lost 10% in 10 hours overnight with wifi and data off.<br />
<br />
It has just come back from "repair" but it's no different at all....<br />
<br />
I will go through a few charge cycles before I decide my next step<br />
<br />
Like I said, this is my fourth and I'm getting really annoyed that it's still awful.

 and send them back (ctrl + enter).</p>

    <title>OneNote 2016 Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brisbanebarry  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I'm using OneNote 2016 on my Surface Pro 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every so often the program goes blank and the top ribbon says 'Not Responding'.</p>
<p>This is when I'm taking notes and happens whether or not I'm recording audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At times sections of my notes disappear and I can't get them back, even if I've just written them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is happening FAR too often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have the latest generation Surface Pen and it is inaccurate (squiggly) when taking notes sometimes, especially when I'm writing toward the right of the screen. The pen works absolutely fine in every other program and on every part of the screen,
 except OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the online repair tool for MS Office, still doesn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just the fact that OneNote is a horrible, problematic program and I should find another notetaking program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Brenton.</p>

<p>Hi, I uninstalled and reinstalled and it still plays up.</p>
<p>I then uninstalled and installed the 64 bit version and it is slightly better, although stops responding occasionally.</p>
<p>I'm really starting to regret buying the Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have this SAME issue:</p>

<p>I see that there are A LOT of people with Pen issues.</p>
