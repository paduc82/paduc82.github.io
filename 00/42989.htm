    <title>Immediate closing of threads - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Immediate closing of threads</h2>
                    <p>How come when so many of us are having problems with the updates causing major problems with our pc's, and we come and try to resolve it, we get the stock answer of how to stay updated, then the thread closes. Maybe someone out there has a solution to the
 problem, and you are preventing us from solving the problem. Leave an open thread so we can work on solving the update problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wound up with build 1809, Frankly, it's worse than Windows ME. remember that? Yea, it's that bad. This needs to be fixed, giving us 35 days isn't going to do it. We need the choice to upgrade a build or not. I don't play video games, so I don't need
 Game Bar. So, how about a build that works for different users. Shouldn't be but a few different models, just like cars. It's the same, you don't get told what ca you will have, and the color, or features. That's what communists did. And Microsoft. WHY?</p>

<p>Yea, ok. The updates are perfect, the users don't know how to use them properly. Especially the October update. It's of course the users fault for having a PC online and receiving updates. I understand now.&nbsp; After years of being a tech, I NEVER had a serious
 problem with a PC when I could turn off automatic updates, now that I can't, my system has been basically unusable. Has to be my fault.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel you, I'm not saying anything new either. That's why they pulled the October update, and are SLOWLY changing the update process.&nbsp; Microsoft's actions say it, the updates are a problem. I've fixed more Windows machines by doing nothing more than taking
 off the accumulation of updates. That speaks volumes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you even read my post. I never said I install updates right away. I don't install them , as you assume, It is automatic. And it really is, Microsoft will tell you. It's the new system in place for Windows 10. Google it. That's&nbsp; G O O G L E . It's a search
 engine on the internet. The latest versions for professional testers, and administrators as you put it is part of the Insiders Program, which is voluntary, as is seems you were not aware of, and how early you get what version is dependent on what Ring your
 in.&nbsp; And, Yea, good Idea, postpone the update,&nbsp; postpone the potential problems with said update. (Actually, they can be held off for more than 35 days, but you don't get the security updates, do you?) The sooner the community is aware of an issue the better,
 best to wait, huh? Conventional Wisdom, Like lemmings off a cliff? Yes! By Golly!, sounds like a great idea to maybe let Conventional Wisdom tell us to leave a potentially huge security or performance flaw go for months while Microsoft is working on the next
 set of issues, let a whole update go for months without knowing. BRILLIANT! "Professional testers", and administrators CAN'T find all the issues of most real world users due to the great number of variations of setups on PC's.&nbsp;Actual, real life, Real tech
 wisdom is to not update if you don't need it. Updates are Patches, patches don't always work 100% , If you want you can use the Media Creation Tool to make an ISO of the latest build that would be more stable than a many times patched over OS. And, Think about
 what you say. If You Knew what you were talking about you would know that the image may not roll back the update that has caused the problem. And, if your solution is to roll back whenever you have a major problem, instead of applying yourself, who knows,
 you might learn something. Your post was just to nit pick. Not contribute. Don't be a Troll, keep it to yourself if you choose to be a worthless contributor here. Yes I can see why you refer to yourself as an&nbsp;<span>amateur</span>,
 but don't put everyone on this forum in your personal category, Let them speak for themselves. There are plenty of people here that can at least comprehend others posts better than you obviously can. When you go to School, and work in the industry, and Put
 in your hours working in PC shops at night to support yourself while going to school, Yes, you can call yourself a Tech. Just like when you tell people you mop the floors at Taco Bell, when you actually mop the floors at Taco Bell, Not that you work at Taco
 Bell, wouldn't want to insult the Bell... see how that works?&nbsp;Probably not, being a self classified&nbsp;<span>amateur.</span>&nbsp; My post was a question about WHY the threads get closed so fast about update issues, I didn't ask for
 help at all, it was a question to the moderators who lose the threads so quickly before more people get to join a conversation on the thread, and have the chance to work on these things as a community. READ THE POST. I never said what version I was running,
 or&nbsp; how long I waited before updating. Sorry about your only possession, and your everything. (Don't quite know where THAT came from) Yes, MR.low IQ, His name is spelled that way. I like to let him be him, and I wanted to leave a little distinction between
 us, so I spell it that way intentionally. You obviously don't get that it has to do with individuality,creativity, style, and respect. I used it as inspiration not an outright usage. You did have to Google Mr. Humperdink, didn't you?&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah you did.....&nbsp; &nbsp;The
 only point you've got is to pick on my own take on my nickname?&nbsp; Lame&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi there:</p>
<p>There are many reasons for closing of a thread.</p>
<p>1) An issue has been resolved and a moderator closes the thread.</p>
<p>2) An abuse of the forum or many replies are off the topic.</p>
<p>3) Some of the threads has been created by a moderator, like a Microsoft agent.</p>

<p>I agree. I give up. There would be no other reason to close threads having to do with updates causing problems. As anyone who can get on the internet can see that Microsoft has a flawless record with updates. Especially lately.</p>
<p>I can't even use mine for 3d printing anymore, it's just so slow and trashed, it's not productive. I'm going to restore to the build my laptop came with, that worked superbly, and take it offline till I've blocked updates, I'm close, then I'll leave it on,
 and online 24/7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not going to try resolving this for anyone but myself. I tried, but everyone gives nul answers, or trolls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your prompt and kind reply! I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let me go ahead and check a few things with you:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>How many monitors are you using?</span></li><li><span>What exactly are you using to connect them?</span></li><li><span>Do you disconnect them completely or just change the settings to a single screen?</span></li><li><span>What happens if you turn your Surface completely&nbsp;off after disconnecting the displays? Are you able to change the screen&nbsp;resolution? Or is the screen resolution back to normal once you restart?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I'll be looking forward to your reply! I apologize again for the delay and misinterpretation on my part.</span></p>

<p>

Thanks for the info, but will this work even though my computer has already been scanned?&nbsp;&nbsp; I installed the printer after I signed up for the upgrade--now I'm having second thoughts.

    <title>Offline Game Captures disappearing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avelythdraike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offline Game Captures disappearing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I play games offline more often than online. When I do my Xbox One is NOT connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I play offline and use the Capture feature for either a screenshot or game clip it saves into the On My Xbox (Offline) section of the DVR library, and I can view them whenever I want, as long as I'm offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's my problem; When i connect my Xbox One to the internet and go to the DVR it displays all Capture I've made while online, however, ALL Captures in the On My Xbox (Offline) library have vanished. My capture history say my recent Capture was the
 last online Capture I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL my offline screenshots and clips are wiped and I can never get them back. I've tested and seen it happen by going offline, screen cap, and view it. Then I'd immediately connect online then go back and it is gone. It's not Storage as I have over 100 Gb
 of free storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me whats going on?</p>

<p>Hello !</p>
<p>It sounds like what's happening is that every time you connect back online the console syncs up with the cloud and over rides the local capture saves. I recommend submitting a report.</p>
<p>You can report this problem using the Xbox Insider Hub app so we can investigate it further:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, install the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>Hold down the <strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;on the controller. </li><li>On the power menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Report a problem</strong>. </li><li>Describe the problem in detail, including when it happened, if you saw any specific error codes or messages, and if you were using any specific games, software, hardware, or accessories when you encountered the problem.
</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We have checked the details and video that you have provided. We can now say that the issue is not with third-party software or applications. Since starting in a clean boot state did not change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see this support article below for the steps and guidelines on how to resolve issues with<strong> Windows Kernel event ID 41

<p>
</p><p>If that did not work, we suggest that you reinstall Windows 10 already. It could be that the Operating System on your Windows device is affected. To know more about how you can reinstall Windows 10, please see the link below:</p>

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The first update KB 2552343, you may download &amp; install from this link. Thereafter, check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2552343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Time-out error occurs when you install a Windows Update package that contains drivers on a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
The KB number of the second update does not seems to be the correct one. You may recheck the KB number &amp; manually download and install the update from the Microsoft Download Center.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Debleena,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no time-out issue. Windows update installed&nbsp;them fine. Later I noticed that Windows Indexing Option was not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore which&nbsp;deleted those two recent Windows Updates&nbsp;made Indexing Option functional again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I repeated this process 3 times to see if behavior pattern is same or similar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This establishes that these two Windows updates together or individually were responsible for rendering Indexing Options (Control Panel) non-functional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second Windows Update was a typo. Correct KB 2547666.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Same problem here - just been given a laptop to look at by a family friend... All was working fine until the 1st July, when updates&nbsp;KB 2552343 and&nbsp;KB 2547666 were installed automatically by Windows Update.
<div><br />
<div>Now the machine is unusable, as the explorer bar is hanging, along with a variety of services including Network Location Awareness.</div>
<div><br />
<div>System restore is not an option as for some reason it is non functional on this machine. The updates fail to uninstall via Safe Mode. Now on the verge of a full reinstall, hoping to save user data, although with the way the machine is performing I think
 it is unlikely that I will save anything!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft, what have you done?!</div>

            <p>On my self-assembled desktop computer the situation is as follows:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.KB2552343, KB2547666, KB2545698 installs successfully, <u>no Time-out</u> error<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Indexing Option (Control Panel) <u>stops working</u> - Image 01 </p>
<p><br />
3.Uninstalled KB2552343, KB2547666, KB2545698 (Programs and Features under Control Panel)
</p>
<p><br />
4.Computer restart<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.Uninstallation was successful as KB2552343, KB2547666, KB2545698 can <u>no more</u> be seen under Installed Updates (Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; View Installed Updates on left panel) - Image 02
</p>
<p><br />
6.Indexing Options still <u>not working</u> | Image 03 | Image 03<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.Checked <u>one-by-one each</u> System Restore Point </p>
<p><br />
8.Checking involved selecting Restore Point, Scaning for affected programs, examining each and every entry under&nbsp; "<u>Programs and drivers that might be restored</u>" - Image 04
</p>
<p><br />
When I Restored my desktop computer to a point where <u>none</u> of these three were shown under this area, Indexing Options began to work.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when I Restored my desktop computer to a point where <u>one</u> of these three were shown under this area, Indexing Options did not work - Image 05<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having become wiser with this experience when I ran Windows Updates on my HP Compaq Laptop, first I
<u>hid</u> those three updates and then installed <u>remaining</u> updates, and Indexing Options
<u>work</u> on the Laptop.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>(three different links have been provided for each image - at least one must work - at the time of writing there is some problem with servers which has been reported to web hosting company)<br />

<p>See the other replies you've gotten, and let me add the following. If you are short of disk space, it's likely that there are some files you don't need and you can delete them. But doing that usually save only a tiny amount of disk space and doesn't really
 help with the problem. The only real solutionis to buy a bigger hard drive. Fortunately they are very inexpensive these days.</p>

I would suggest you to update the drivers for your graphics card, here are the steps:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Update, and then, in the list of results, click Windows Update.
<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the left pane, click Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are any available updates, click the link in the box under Windows Update to see more information about each update. Each type of update might include drivers.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Select the updates you want to install page, look for updates for your hardware devices, select the check box for each driver that you want to install, and then click OK. There might not be any driver updates available.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Windows Update page, click Install updates. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />

            Hi Phyllis.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable File History for an external hard drive?  If it's prompting you to reconnect it then you only need to plug it back in via USB.  Then make sure it's detected in File Explorer and files on it are seen.  
<br />
<br />There are problems with File History so if you didn't use it or don't want it then you can turn it off in it's Control Panel by typing File History in Start Search, choose File History, then click configure to turn it on or off and access other settings.
<br />
<br />Because of problems with File History and backup in Windows 10 I recommend using a more reliable and flexible backup program like the experts choice free Macrium:  <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />It also makes imaging easier so you can store a backup image that can restore C in 20 minutes if necessary:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br /><a href="http://reflect.macrium.com/help/v5/how_to/rescue/rescue_a_system_with_the_windows_pe_environment.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://reflect.macrium.com/help/v5/how_to/rescu...</a>
<br /> 
<br />More about backup choices here: 
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up externally if you value them at all because the hard drive can die at any time.
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.
<br />
<br />Or you can sort them into your account's User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc) and drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man</a>...
<br />
<br />You can also turn on File History to keep your files backed up incrementally to external hard drive. <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-wind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-wind</a>...
<br />
<br />
<br />However I would instead use free Macrium which is more reliable external file backup to another drive, and also use one of the other methods above to be safest:  <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/</a>...
<br />The best free alternative is Macrium: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref</a>...
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Youâ€™ll see this message if your File History drive has been disconnected for too long. If youâ€™re backing up to an external drive (like a USB drive), make sure itâ€™s connected to your PC. If youâ€™re backing up to a network location, go to Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Backup and reselect the network.
<br />
<br />After youâ€™re reconnected, wait for the next scheduled backup or start a backup manually by selecting Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Backup &gt; More options &gt; Back up now.
<br />
<br />File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

            If you need to set it up, click on Start, Click on Settings - gear icon, update &amp; security, backup. With the drive plugged in, click on Add a drive. You will get a pop-up with the drives available, click on the drive you want to use. That is pretty much it, you can select more options to set the frequency of backup, the folders you want back up or remove from the backup.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

<h2>            Keep internet connection while screen is off</h2>
                    <p>When I leave my Surface Book 2 untouched for a while (e.g. 15 minutes) it apparently loses internet connection, which leads my ssh session on WSL to close, for example.</p>
<p>My laptop is configured as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Power &amp; sleep</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Screen</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">On battery power, turn off after: 5 minutes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">When plugged in, turn off after: 10 minutes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Sleep</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">On battery power, PC goes to sleep after: 20 minutes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">When plugged in, PC goes to sleep after: 4 hours</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Network connection</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">When my PC is asleep and on battery power, disconnect from the network: Never (grayed out)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is connected via wired connection, using Surface Dock.</p>
<p>How can I deal with this problem?</p>
<p>If any other information is needed, please teach me.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi yk92,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try disconnecting the Surface Dock and connect the Surface to a wireless network? Go to the
<strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong> settings and check if the <strong>disconnect from the network</strong> option is also greyed out. Next, let's make sure that your Surface Book 2 and Surface Dock are running the recommended driver and firmware updates. For the
 Surface, you can use the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. Apart from verifying
 that your software is updated, this tool will check for other system issues that may affect the device's performance. For the Surface Dock, please use the Dock Updater Tool. You can learn more about this and download the tool by going
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023478/surface-update-your-surface-dock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Perform a forced shutdown after running the tools. While the Surface is on, simply press the power button
 for about 20 seconds. Restart your Surface normally and check if the problem will still happen when the screen goes off or when the device sleeps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no changes, let's visit the Power Management settings for the Surface Ethernet Adapter. While the Surface is connected to the Dock, go to
<strong>Device Manager</strong> (<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X </strong>
&gt; <strong>Device Manager</strong>) &gt; expand <strong>Network adapters</strong> &gt; right-click on
<strong>S</strong><strong>urface Ethernet Adapter</strong> &gt; go to the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab &gt; untick
<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong> &gt; click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update the post with the results so I can help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Ruz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>I've checked those things accordingly, and unfortunately I'm still facing the same problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When connected to wireless network, the `disconnect from the network' option is still grayed out.</p>
<p>2. I ran through the Software Diagnostic Toolkit and didn't find any problems.</p>
<p>3. The Dock's firmware was not latest. Using the Updater Tool I updated it, and restarted Surface forcefully, still no luck.</p>
<p>4. Surface Ethernet Adapter properties don't have Power Management tab. I'm running Windows 10 Pro 10.0.17134 Build 17134 on SKU Surface_Book_1832. Surface Ethernet Adapter driver is said to be already the best version.</p>

<p>I think this is by design. In the screenshot you posted, choose "Selective suspend idle timeout" (Think it should be for displaytimeout) and increase it to 60 (if itÂ´s set at 5) and then see if the issue still occurs. ItÂ´s also possible to do some changes
 in registry but itÂ´s just a "workaround"</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. The problem may be specific to the current user account, or it could be the Windows installation. Is your user account part of a domain? In case it's not, I suggest that you try creating a different user account which we can
 use to check if the network setting will be available. Using your current user account, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt;
<strong>Family &amp; other people</strong> &gt; <strong>Add someone else to this PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose<strong> I don't have this person's sign-in information</strong> &gt; <strong>
Add a user without a Microsoft account</strong>.</li><li>Enter a username and a password then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Sign out of your user account and sign in to the one you just created.</li><li>Once signed in, go to the <strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong> settings and check if you'll be able to configure the
<strong>Network connection</strong> setting when the Surface is asleep and on battery power.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I'll look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Ruz,</p>
<p>Sorry for this late response.</p>
<p>I tried that, and when logged in as the new user, the Network connection setting was the same: Never (grayed out).</p>
<p>

<p>I appreciate the update. Based on the screenshot when logged in to a new user account, it shows that some settings are hidden or managed by your organization. Do you see the same error when you sign in using your original user account? If you do, then we
 need to check the privacy settings of the Surface. Is the device or your original user account part of a domain (managed by an organization)? If it is, then please get in touch with the technical team of the organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Surface&nbsp; is not part of a domain, try changing the Diagnostic data configuration of the device. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Privacy </strong>&gt; <strong>Feedback &amp; diagnostics</strong> &gt; set the
<strong>Diagnostic data</strong> to <strong>Enhanced </strong>or <strong>Full</strong>. You may need to restart the device for the changes to take effect. After logging back in, check if the error has disappeared, and if you will now be able to configure the
<strong>Network connection</strong> option in <strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong> settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more help, please let me know and I'll get back to you the soonest I can.</p>

<p>My user account is ordinary Microsoft account, not in domain. Under <strong>Diagnostics &amp; feedback</strong>, the data transfer is already set as
<strong>Full</strong>, and I don't see <strong>Enhanced </strong>option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also let me add that I <em>don't </em>want to disconnect from the network, so the current setting
<strong>Never </strong>is fine. Plus, I'm not running my Windows on battery power, so I'm doubtful this setting's relevant to my problem.</p>

<p>When an option is greyed out on a device, it means that the system does not allow it to be configured according to your own liking. It does not necessarily mean that the selected option is what the system carries out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be a setting that disconnects the network connectivity when the device is in standby, when the screen goes off, or when it enters sleep mode. To check this, refer to these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the search bar, type <strong>gpedit </strong>then open <strong>Edit group policy</strong>.</li><li>On the left part of the screen, you will see <strong>Local Computer Policy</strong>. Under
<strong>Computer Configuration</strong>, you will find <strong>Software Settings</strong>,
<strong>Windows Settings</strong>, and <strong>Administrative Templates</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Administrative Templates</strong> &gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>
Power Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Sleep Settings</strong>.</li><li>Once <strong>Sleep Settings</strong> is selected, you will see a list of settings on the right part of the window. Check the current
<strong>State </strong>of <strong>Allow network connectivity during connected-standby (on battery)</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Allow network connectivity during connected-standby (plugged in)</strong>.</li><li>If both items are <strong>Not configured</strong> or <strong>Disabled</strong>, double-click on each item one at a time, then select
<strong>Enabled </strong>&gt; <strong>Apply </strong>&gt; <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Exit the <strong>Local Group Policy Editor</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After that, revisit <strong>Settings </strong>and check if the error message still appears in the
<strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong> page. Restart your Surface if the message still appears, then check if the network will still be interrupted when the screen goes off or when the Surface sleeps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are left with other concerns, please update the post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Apps crashing on Windows 10 when minimised</h2>
                    <p>It seems that any app that is minimised for more than about a minute will crash. If the icon in the taskbar is clicked the app window opens with the toolbar at the top&nbsp;of the window greyed out. The only way to get the app to respond is to close and re-open
 the app. This affects all apps including Mail, Calendar, Onenote, Reader and the Office suite.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I ran the system file checker as suggested with the following result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not what I expected using a Surface 3. This is Microsoft's latest device and it can't run Windows 10 properly!!!</p>

<h2>            window 10 update on Sunday, December 13, 2015 screen resolution issue</h2>
                    It seems a "major" update occurred on Dec. 13 [over 1 hour to install]. After the update, the icons on my desktop over-spilled the screen. I tried a lot of "tweaks"--nothing worked (from
<strong>within</strong> Windows). I'm using an LG 32" HDMI monitor, using the monitors remote, I was able to obtain a fix. What could the update have done, that could NOT be
<em>undone</em> from within Windows 10?

                    After my download of Windows 10, I delayed the startup.&nbsp; Before the time came up again, I delayed a second time and the message went away giving me the option of starting or delaying.&nbsp; The time that I set came and went and nothing happened.&nbsp; I cannot get
 anything from clicking on the icon in the task bar.&nbsp; It knows that all is downloaded and we are ready to go, but when I click on lets go, the window goes away and nothing happens.&nbsp; Any ideas as to how to get the window back up that gives me the option to start
 the upgrade or delay it again.&nbsp; I am ready to start.

<p>Hello Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with the log file taking all the free disk space might occur due to incorrect OneDrive set up. Let's determine the exact cause of the issue. To get started, we'd like to clarify if you've made any changes to your computer prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern, let's reset your OneDrive. Resetting OneDrive re-syncs all your OneDrive files, which could take some time depending on how many files you're syncing. To do so, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Press the <strong>Wi</strong><strong>ndows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.<br />
2. In the <strong>Run Window</strong> enter the following: <strong>%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset</strong><br />
3. Click <strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The OneDrive system tray icon on the desktop should disappear and re-appear after a minute or two.)<br />
4. If the OneDrive icon does not re-appear after a few minutes,<span> open the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Run</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>window again and enter:</span><span> %<strong>localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have same issue. Trying to delete the latest log-file shows it is locked by&nbsp;OneDrive Setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be related to problems when&nbsp;OneDrive Setup hangs: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/a-process-called-microsoft-onedrive-setup-is/42594f54-fe35-4832-8b96-8b243e4fc23f</p>
<p>There are some hints that this is a bug relating to users with non "standard" letters in the use name, such as Ã¦Ã¸Ã¥Ã²Ã´ etc.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having same problem, with huge (150+GB) sized aria-debug file. Had to kill OneDrive in order to reclaim disk space. Used the steps as described by&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5919de94-e7d3-4e6d-a6c0-6a5b685aa25d" title="Antoneth Ber">Antoneth

<p>
</p><p>Not sure if it is related but just like <span>
AsbjÃ¸rn I have a 'funny' character in my file path, i.e. 'Ã¶'.</span></p>
<p>There is one uninstalled update:&nbsp;2017-09, kumulativ uppdatering fÃ¶r Windows 10 Version 1703 fÃ¶r x64-baserade system (KB4040724)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The aria-debug file has grown to 880MB while I've written this note. Ugh!</p>

<p>Adding some more info... OneDrive will stay off until I understand how to fix this problem</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution by Antoneth Ber unfortunately didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have some large log files (the newest is locked by OneDriveSetup), and just like for GÃ¶sta they are full of:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are also a list of temp files tmpXXXX.tmp, where the newest is locked by OneDriveSetup. Each has a file size of exactly 21.104.875 bytes, For instance tmp8D3.tmp and&nbsp;tmpCB41.tmp
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw: I do have the update KB4040724 installed.</p>

            I am shocked and amazed at Microsoft that you have not provided a solution to this problem of the creation of the aria-debug file.&nbsp; It is in my opinion the most serios problem I have encountered in my 30 years of computer use.&nbsp; At least allow uninstalling
 OneDrive, if that is the cause.&nbsp; Why do you force the presence of unwanted programs.&nbsp; Please fix this asap....I've gotten to the p[oint that I can't use my computer.<br />

<p>Same problem - and I have the Norwegian letter Ã¥ in my user name.</p>
<p>Microsoft, what did you think about - when letting a .txt log file grow to 150 GB.</p>
<p>Someone should look into this - fast.</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Jay</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you using any external storage device to set-up back up? </p>
<p>2. Which is the antivirus program installed on the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. Perform the steps provided and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method&nbsp;1:<span> </span>Check the status of Volume Shadow Copy service</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. Click on <strong>Start</strong>, type<span> </span><strong>Services</strong> in Start Search. When the Services page is open, check for<span>
</span><strong>Volume Shadow Copy service</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. <strong>Right click</strong> on <strong>Volume Shadow Copy service</strong> (VSS) and Check if it is started.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. If it is stopped select <strong>Start</strong> or <strong>Restart.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method&nbsp;2: </span></strong><span>You may also try to <strong>
temporarily disable the third party Security Software</strong> and firewalls and check if you can try backup.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Enable the security software back after resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following link to Disable Antivirus Program:</span></span></p>
