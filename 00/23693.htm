<h2>            Computer cannot find https&#58;&#47;&#47;login.live.com</h2>
                    <p>I have two computers at my house; the one I'm typing this on and a second one (Lenovo Yoga Pro 2 connected via wireless).&nbsp; Currently, and for just the past few days it seems, the Yoga Pro 2 refuses to find<a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 https://login.live.com</a>.&nbsp; The computer I'm typing this message on finds it just fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact message I get from the Yoga Pro 2 when it fails is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This page can't be displayed</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Make sure the web addres <a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://login.live.com</a> is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Look for the page with your search engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Refresh the page in a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Yoga Pro 2 is running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; IE is version 11, but I get a similar problem when I use Chrome.&nbsp; I checked the hosts file, and there are no lines in there that are not commented out.&nbsp; I tried resetting the settings in IE (but of course how could
 that affect Chrome?).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer I'm typing this on has a wired internet connection.&nbsp; It is also Windows 8.1.&nbsp; It can find login.live.com just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on Earth could cause this?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I took the part about <a href="http://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://login.live.com</a> out and just left <a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com</a>, since
<a href="http://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://login.live.com</a> seems not to be a real thing.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, it would seem that the "malware" causing me to be unable to access <a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://login.live.com</a> is none other than BitDefender, my internet security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got so frustrated with this that I decided to refresh my PC.&nbsp; After the refresh, the problem was gone.&nbsp; Then, Windows Update applied like 55 updates.&nbsp; Things were still working.&nbsp; Then, I reinstalled BitDefender, and the problem came back.&nbsp; So I uninstalled
 BitDefender and the problem went back away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started a support ticket with BitDefender on this.&nbsp; I will report back here where it ends up with them.</p>
<p>

 You can do this by going to Settings from the Bitdefender interface &gt; Privacy Settings &gt; Antiphishing tab &gt; switch to off Scan SSL.</span>

                    Ok, Folks, look alive.&nbsp;Here we go, again. <br />
<br />
<strong>Build 10049</strong> is installing as I write this!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Check WU.&nbsp; Although, may be Fast track, only, as yet... I can't be sure about that part.<br />

<div><strong>Known Issues in Build 10049:<br />
<br />
</strong>•If you have Virtual Machines hosted on your PC running Windows 10, you will want to move to the Slow ring and wait for the next build as this build breaks the ability to run VMs.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Umm, &amp; yet, I <em>am</em> running it as VM.&nbsp; Came from WU on a Build 10041 VM so, still, a VM.&nbsp; Go figure...</div>
<div><br />
So, hmmm, do I, still,&nbsp;switch to Slow, one wonders...<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh &amp; good news, the Desktops are now dedicated... that's better, sensible.<br />
<br />
And it has SPARTAN!!<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>OK.&nbsp; Then I am definitely unaffected by that.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; I originally had my external speakers in the Surface's lone audio jack, so that made me wonder if that is what the "Remote" was referring to.&nbsp; However now I have disconnected that and left just the Surface's internal speakers enabled.&nbsp; The Playback
 Test just took a slow count of 16 before I heard it!&nbsp; I think that is even worse response time than I was originally complaining about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW Search is a mess.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it may be because of the emphasis on getting Cortana available.&nbsp; I was originally being set up for Cortana but because of my audio problems had to cancel out of that and am now being told that I don't qualify by location (Canada
 being not USA I guess?)&nbsp; Anyway, I think they have ruined it.&nbsp; In W8&nbsp;I have the BING and Everywhere functionality either disabled or ignored and now can't find a way to do that in W10 at all besides having a much worse UX altogether regarding Search.&nbsp; What
 are they thinking?&nbsp; I had been hoping we would be able to&nbsp;get the equivalent of the possible Search that W7 has:&nbsp; nothing but Programs and Settings.&nbsp; In fact, what I would probably really prefer is Win-w as a default instead of Win-S for Everywhere.&nbsp; I can
 search for Programs using the search in the All Apps view.&nbsp; (Where has that gone anyway?)</p>

            <br />
OK.&nbsp; Then I am definitely unaffected by that.&nbsp; No, me neither, of course.<br />
<br />
Ok, I had understood what you were saying about Sound correctly.&nbsp; I usually use Asterisk and whether 10 or earlier, this Build or not, it's a moment to the 'Boing' but, no longer than any time.&nbsp; So, that's why I asked... I'm not getting and not accustomed to
 such a (big)&nbsp;'delay'.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; Has to relate to the fact that hardware is being 'shared' but, we are both running VMs.<br />
<br />
Now, the rest,,,<br />
<br />
1st I am in Calgary, ergo, the same scenario w/ Cortana.&nbsp; I have not done it myself but, apparently if you set your region as USA, Cortana will work.&nbsp; But, no, it is not available to Canada @ this time.&nbsp; Anyway, aside from Cortana.<br />
<br />
I have to think back to the Search in 7... that it did not show web results or could be both.&nbsp; And then 8 has Everywhere (Web), Files, Apps.&nbsp; Win key plus various.&nbsp; Often, to search was when I'd go to either the Start screen or Apps screen cus I could just
 begin typing &amp; up came Search (results).&nbsp; Ok, now to this Win10 Search.&nbsp; Sort of I may the wrong person cus I don't mind if it shows puter stuff &amp; web stuff... if I was looking for the puter stuff, that's my concern &amp; doesn't bother me the other is there.&nbsp;
 Some (other) time it might be the interest of the moment.&nbsp; So, yeah, this gives both.&nbsp; The positioning of the Start menu over the Taskbar is a bit ____ .&nbsp;&nbsp; Can open it, then have to click to get the Search box to show properly over the Taskbar.&nbsp; The Taskbar
 Search can be Disabled.&nbsp; If Enabled can be either a box or just icon, that then produces Search flyout.&nbsp; As for what you say about Search on the Apps screen... yeah, that's tough since there&nbsp;is no Apps screen.&nbsp; So to search for Programs, either type what you
 seek in a Search Box&nbsp; or one has to scroll the Apps list OR can have an Applications window &amp; Search w/in that.&nbsp; This last method is what I like, used it in 8.1 &amp; have&nbsp;continued in Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the easy find view it offers.<br />
<br />
Not sure the above is help, per se, but, felt like giving you a reply, no matter.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Ed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the reg edit 64 bit, could verify the two keys existed. But when I tried to search for the two keys to delete, they werent there. see screen shots below</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I then tried the work around, see screen shot below. This didn't work either.</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t&#39;t &#39;Clear Formatting&#39; clear the formatting&#63;</h2>
                    For as long as I can remember (over 25 years using Word for Mac) when you highlight some text to apply a Style, it often doesn't apply it correctly unless you first select 'Clear Formatting' in the drop down menu top left.&nbsp; Furthermore, when you select
 'Clear Formatting', there often seems to be some text that doesn't respond to that either!&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; Is there any way to reliably get&nbsp; selected text to revert to 'Normal' so that I can apply the style I want?

            Okay, so it's data that's been pasted in from a source other than a Word document. In that case it's probably caused by some formatting characters that Word just doesn't recognize.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>For the most part Word does recognize current HTML formatting from text in websites but I would imagine that there might be some special formatting that it doesn't.
<div><br />
<div>In any event I believe the best practice is to always Paste Special &gt; Unformatted Text when brining in something from other sources, I prefer that method even between Word documents when I want to make sure my current document holds it styles pure and
 doesn't pickup extraneous ones.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With that said, if Paste Special is not working or Clear Formatting (and what I mean by "not working" is clearing extraneous formatting that you wish wasn't there) then you can also try first pasting the copied text into a Text Editor and then moving it
 from there into your Word document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            <p>If you are having trouble adding any account (FB, Google, Hotmail, Yahoo) and you have tried more than one, than the issue is not with the account. It is with the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the phone it comes down to a) Data b) OS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is a data issue, try connecting your phone to a Wi-Fi Connection and try adding accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the same problem happens on Wi-Fi as well, then you may have to do a phone reset.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can also be caused due to any third party/driver conflict. Hence, I would suggest you to check if they work in safe mode and if it works in safe mode, perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start computer in safe mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 10 IP, hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>

<span>My organization would like to use Office 365 as it works very well with Salesforce. Salesforce for Outlook is what caused us to look into Office 365. Some staff will want to continue to use Gmail, but
 10 users will be using Outlook for the Web and/or Outlook for Mac to use the Salesforce add-in. We've had a lot of trouble syncing our company emails with Outlook... for one, it appears as though only "POP" is offered to us for connecting. This has turned
 out to be a big problem for us. Perhaps I have incorrectly added our users. Can you help me out?</span>

            <p>Hi Caitlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Connected accounts in OWA doesn't support IMAP for Gmail. A TechNet blog post says below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccf47557-ec9f-41db-8fdb-fe3115b974e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccf47557-ec9f-41db-8fdb-fe3115b974e9" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/educloud/2013/05/11/is-there-a-way-users-can-self-migrate-from-google-apps-gmail-into-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Is there a way users can self-migrate from Google Apps Gmail into Office 365?">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/educloud/2013/05/11/is-there-a-way-users-can-self-migrate-from-google-apps-gmail-into-office-365/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the end user cannot use IMAP to connect to Gmail using connected accounts. However, you can ask your administrator to create an IMAP migration batch for you from Exchange Online Admin Center. That way the Administrator will be able to do the
 IMAP migration for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to above, you can submit your feedback to Office 365 team&nbsp;by visiting this link below.</p>

<p>Hi Jelo Formeloza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting us. I understand it would be nice if it's available to download or export conversations in Teams app. But it's not feasible for Teams to achieve this right now. As far as I know, you can try to

<h3> rudolfaigner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 9860 nVidia GPU customize a high resolution fails</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 build 9841 was fine and let me customize a high resolution for my monitor from 1920x1080 to 2540x1440 and even higher without any problems like I could do in Windows 8.1 pro. I use this downsampling technique to get better image quality with Prepar3d
 v2 flight simulator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately with the new build 9860 I can't do this anymore. If I customize in nVidia Control Panel the resolution to 2560x1440 and click "test" I get a black screen and this won't change anymore. I've to restart the PC with the hardware reset button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to solve this problem?</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Rudolf Aigner, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Your efforts to work on this issue is very much appreciated.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur due to incompatible or outdated drivers and missing updates. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>The black screen issue could be related to display drivers and might get resolved by updating the display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may update the Display driver from the Device Manager and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Right click on the video driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Alternatively, you may also manually download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install it to check if this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>May I say again, that with build 9841 the problem didn't occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Point 1. I already had the latest 344.48 driver installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Point 2. To run the installation in compatibility mode didn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add another finding. I f I unplug and plug again the HDMI cable then I don't need to restart the PC because the screen comes back with the standard resolution.</p>

            <p>Well, graphics drivers and control panel etc. are on the newest level. This problem started exactly with the upgrade to build 9860 so the changes must have been there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the HDMI cable sounds a bit strange for me and can't be done because I don't have a 2nd one at hand now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your help</p>

<p>I use excel to print my cheques.&nbsp; Does any have a formula to convert numbers to workd so that when I input the $$ amount of the check it will convert it to words and put it in the right cell. It's really a pain have to type the amount in words every time.</p>
<p>Note: $$ amount in cell M4 (cell formatted as $ 2 decimals)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words appear in cell F6 (cell formatted as text)</p>

<p>Here is something I have posted in the past to the old newsgroups which you might find useful...</p>
<p>Go into the VB Editor (Alt+F11) and add a Module to the Workbook (Insert/Module from the VBA menu) and then paste in all of the code appearing after my signature into the Module's code window. You can call the function from your work sheet like this =NumberAsText(A1)
 where A1 is assumed to hold the number you want to convert. There is an Optional argument you can use to format the results to your liking. Here are some examples to show the options available...</p>
<p>A1:&nbsp; 123.45</p>
<p>In B1: <br />
=NumberAsText(A1)&nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; One Hundred Twenty Three Point Four Five<br />
=NumberAsText(A1,"And")&nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; One Hundred and Twenty Three Point Four Five<br />
=NumberAsText(A1,"Check")&nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; One Hundred Twenty Three and 45/100<br />
=NumberAsText(A1,"Dollar")&nbsp; ==&gt;&nbsp; One Hundred Twenty Three Dollars and Forty Five Cents<br />
=NumberAsText(A1,"CheckDollar")&nbsp; ==&gt; One Hundred Twenty Three Dollars and 45/100</p>
<p>To summarize, using "And" adds the word "and" in front of the tens/units text; using "Check" formats any decimal values as would be written on a check; and using "Dollar" adds the words "Dollars" and "Cents" in their appropriate positions. The code is laid
 out in a reasonably straight forward manner, so if Dollars/Cents is not you native currency designation, you should be able to modify the program accordingly. In addition to the above, for all modes, the Plus and Minus sign can be used and will be reported
 back as a word; commas may be used to separate the numbers to the left of the decimal point but they will not be reported back by the routine and are permitted for the users convenience (however, if commas are used, they must be placed in their correct positions).
 And, finally,if I remember correctly, this function will work with a whole number part up to one less than a quintillion (you can have as many decimal places as desired), but remember to format large numbers as Text values... otherwise VB will convert large
 non-Text values to Doubles (which will destroy the conversion).</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 365 keeps shutting down after a few seconds</h2>
                    <p>I have office 365.</p>
<p>I open the desktop outlook and it stays open until the sync function start and then the program shuts down and says: Microsoft Outlook as stopped working - a problem cause the program to stop working correctly. &nbsp;Windows will close the program and notify
 you if a solution is available. &nbsp;I never get anything from Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted the machine several time both restart and full stop and start</p>
<p>I have done the reinstall (both quick and deep varieties) of Microsoft 365.</p>
<p>I have run the &nbsp;folder scan on each of the three mail boxes - the scan found errors and repaired them on each of the accounts</p>
<p>I have opened outlook mail - web version and there is no problem, all the folders exist and the email seems to work properly without issue.</p>
<p>I have opened it with the google mail app on my phone and it works fine with no issue, all folders and mail are visible and usable</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all of that, every time I open Outlook and after a few seconds, seemingly after the outlook update to each of the mail files completes, it seems to stop when it gets to synchronizing subscribed folders for the jm....@gmail.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have an idea what I should try next?</p>
<p>

<p>Two other things I have tried&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>starting Outlook in Safe mode. &nbsp;Outlook sometimes offers me this when it has stopped. &nbsp;Even in Safe mode, it still stops with the message noted above</li><li>I have moved (via the web program) all of the email I moved to sub folders today back to inbox. &nbsp;Most of the folders I use are under the gmail account. &nbsp;That one was just in the middle. &nbsp;I put outlook and yahoo(sbcglobal) mail into those folders. &nbsp;I have
 done that for a while with no issue. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>All of the email accounts (outlook, gmail and sbcglob/via yahoo) have been in place for months and even worked this morning. &nbsp;Something happened this afternoon to cause this to start to malfunction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help!</p>

<p>Sorry i have already tried this. Microsoft offers two types of repairs, a quick and full. I tried both. The repair full stayed that the software was fully restored. However, this had no impact and the problem persists.</p>

<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled office 365 still crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removed exchange account and added it back in still crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the CAT program, I used it to fix the errors, still crashes.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I work IT for a company and some users are having an issue opening a shared excel file. Upon opening the file they receive the message "We found a problem with some content in "documentname.xlsx" Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can?"</p>

</p><p>The problem is, the error keeps displaying, even after the user saves the file after the "repair." Is there anyway to find out what is really causing this "AutoFilter" error, so that I can possibly remove, in case is a setting that a user set? I've restored
 a back-up of the workbook already, and the back-up was fine for a couple of days, then it started to display the error message again. I'm thinking the users' are setting some autofilter incorrectly and it is causing this error.</p>

<p>This is a picture of the error. Sorry, the error is hard to read but it says "Removed Records: AutoFilter from: /xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml part"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the only Excel file having this issue. It is shared on a network drive. I spoke to the users who access this file and asked them what kind of changes they make to the file. They said they just enter data and they use Autofilter to filter the data.
 I'm wondering if they are using Autofilter incorrectly and it is causing issues.</p>

<p>Hi Sean 629,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I need to confirm if the file can open on another computer, as we need to check if the issue is related to the file.</p>
<p>Besides, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. <span>
The Excel version. (Open Excel&gt;select File&gt;click Account)</span></p>
<p><span>2. The screenshot of the error message, as we couldn’t see the picture clearly.</span></p>

 and inserted the sim card the phone came on, immediately i put the work 'online' on the phone went off immediately. I've tried flashing bt still once a sim card is inserted and the work online is on, the phone wont come on. It is very frustratin as the phone
 cost quite much and i've barely used it. Its in my drawer nw. Pls help

<p>Are you using this E6-00 in a marginal 3G reception area as it is usually constant switching between GSM &amp; 3G which consumes current? Have you tried a new SIM card with it?</p>

<p>hi, i have been using the nokia e6 now since some months, tried almost everything to solve the network problem.. since the first day, i have not been able to help myself out anyway.. this is the last try i m giving., a very weak receptiion is the problem
 in the device..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have pictures taken where the same network company sim on other phones show reception and nokia e6 fails doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now use two phones, all because i cant trust the reception of this device. Guess what..., both the numbers are from same carrier..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can literally talk on the other devices with the same sim card inserted.. a little weak reception means no network on e6, and where in at the same spot.. i can talk with highest clarity on another nokia phone only.. i have been using nokia since years,,
 first one was 5110 the antenna phone.. then 3310 &gt;&gt; 8250 &gt;&gt; 7250i &gt;&gt; N91 &gt;&gt; e63 &gt;&gt; now E6..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems did come in nokia phones in past, but were solved by nokia care, so nokia was the only choice for a phone for me..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have to travel around most of the time. good battery life and a trustworthy phone is utmost important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent about 17500.00 rs buying the phone + extra 2 yrs warranty charges as applicable. which i prefer taking when ever i buy a nokia phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have visited nokia care many times now. there has been no solution to the network problem. they keep the phone for 7-10 days, send the phone to delhi main service center. and it comes back with a comment of repaired and all ok. and as soon as i start using,
 the same problem persists, i have changed the nokia care center also., the problem is there for sure but still have not been able to solve it., finally i have decided to try on web if there is anyone from nokia to see for this problem's solution. i have trusted
 nokia for years and visited the centers many times with the same belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything that can be done now.?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>incase yes. please let me know, or now i will have to forcefully select another company's phone.</p>
<p>phone e6 &nbsp;imei no ***************.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>

            Hi I’m Linnell I'm an Independent Advisor here to help. 
<br />We all get spammed and yes we all hate it. It eats up resources and sometimes it’s a pain to get rid of. 
<br />Smammers can spoof email addresses it may not be your account that is actually sending out the email. I know it’s frustrating I deal with it daily. 
<br />As long as they are going to your Junk mail folder just delete them. 
<br />I would check first that there is no malware on your system just to be sure.
<br />Close out of all your programs download click on it to open, Scan Now. It will want to restart you system when you select clean and repair.

            I suggest as an additional measure to prevent or diminish the identity theft that is really what is happening to you, since you are receiving emails where they impersonate your own address, do the following.
<br />
<br />&nbsp; Here we show you how to handle online abuse and phishing scams or addresses from or sent to Outlook.com accounts.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/es-es/article/tratar-con-el-abuso-la-suplantaci%C3%B3n-de-identidad-phishing-o-la-suplantaci%C3%B3n-de-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/es-es/article/tratar...</a> addresses-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3
<br />
<br />Important: When a message is marked as a phishing scam, Outlook.com displays a warning at the top of the page, but you can open the links in the message.
<br />
<br />You can also report phishing by forwarding email as an attachment to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.

    <title>Excel 2016 O365&#59; Standard Plus Sign Cursor Flickering between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skutrball  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 O365&#59; Standard Plus Sign Cursor Flickering between standard windows pointer and plus sign</h2>
                    <p>How to force Excel 2016 to show only the plus sign when moving over cells? Mine is flickering between the standard windows arrow and the plus sign so fast, its very annoying. I've run a repair on office and a reinstall, neither worked.</p>
<p>Oddly, I didn't notice this until after the Windows 10 Fall Update this week on my Surface Book. And perhaps coincidentally, Skype for Business now has the problem with my mic not working.</p>

<p>That's not all that's changed, apparently. Here's my Font menu in Word 2013:</p>
<p>

<p>Note that I don't have the "Font Collections" flyout, nor are there flyout arrows for any of the fonts in the list (presumably this is to show variants?). Have you had a recent Office update? Windows Update?</p>

<p>I know how to set this. I want to keep POP Peeper notifications, and just disable them from appearing in Notifications area.</p>
<p>I assume it's impossible according your suggestion :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not impossible, but this is something that the developer of that application would need to implement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has included a way to disable the applications that they have control over or set a time when&nbsp;all Notifications can appear. You can also disable all Notifications completely using a registry tweak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond this they cannot control how third party applications interact with the Notification Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set a <strong>Time</strong> when the notifications cannot appear, <strong>Right Click</strong> the
<strong>Notifications Icon</strong> on the <strong>Taskbar</strong> and select <strong>
Hide Notifications</strong> for and click the time <strong>1,3, or 8 hours</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To <strong>disable</strong> the Notifications completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the <strong>WinKey+R</strong> to display the <strong>Run</strong> dialog. Type&nbsp;
<strong>regedit.exe</strong>&nbsp; in the <strong>Open</strong> box and click <strong>
OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Navigate</strong> to the following <strong>Key</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the right side pane, <strong>Right Click</strong> the &nbsp;<strong>UseActionCenterExperience</strong>&nbsp; value and select
<strong>Modify</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Value Data</strong> box, change the <strong>&nbsp;1</strong> (One)&nbsp;to a &nbsp;<strong>0</strong> (zero).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exit the registry editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p><span>Hi Steve,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OLK file extension is a file type of Outlook Address Book. It’s not feasible to import the .olk file to the Outlook 2016 for Mac client. Microsoft supports import Outlook for Windows archive file, Outlook for Mac archive file and Outlook
 2011 data on the computer to Outlook 2016 for Mac client. If you want to import the contacts in the Outlook 2011 for Mac client, we recommend you firstly export them to an .olm file and then import the .olm file to the Outlook 2016 for Mac client. For more
 details, please refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-email-messages-contacts-and-other-items-into-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-6cc48404-a65c-4b8c-a12a-95a905249414?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
