            Word for Windows does not support outline as a font style for regular fonts, but there are some outline fonts - look for Castellar and Colonna MT, for example.

            Select the text, right-click and choose Font, then check the box for Outline in the Font dialog. As Hans suggests, though, you'll get better results if you choose an "engraved" font to begin with.

<h3> cardinal3  say:</h3>
<h2>            WordMacros in Office 2007 versus Word 1997-2003</h2>
                    <p>I have a Word document that has some simple Macros.</p>
<p>I find that &nbsp;if I save the document as a Macro Enabled document in Word 2007, I have to</p>
<p>store the document in a Trusted location folder.</p>
<p>If I save the same Word document with simple Macros as a Word 1997 -2003 document, I do not</p>
<p>need special folders and it appears to run easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why will the macro document work simpler as a 1997-2003 enabled word document.</p>
<p>Is there an advantage&nbsp;saving &nbsp;the document as &nbsp;Macro Enabled format with trusted location folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any help</p>

            What you're seeing in the Word 2007 *.docm format is an attempt by Microsoft to prevent macros (typically in documents sent in email attachments) from running without your permission or knowledge. If you know the source of a document and trust it not to
 damage your data, you can store it in a trusted location. The Word 97-2003 file format doesn't have any such protection -- it was designed before malicious macros became common.

            <p>Back in early 90's the first exposure I had to computer virus's was the Word macro virus". Our Office was being re-infected daily by an outside partner (it drove the LAN admin nuts).&nbsp; That problem was addressed and made way for other virus attacks.&nbsp; Recently,
 macro virus's have been making a comeback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS introduced the new x-file formats in 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were several reasons for the new format:</p>
<ul>
<li>X vs M file makes saving macros in a file very Obvious to users and creator</li><li>the new format is based on an "open standard" controlled by the OSF an entity external to MS, while the old DOC format was owned and "Proprietary" to MS</li><li>the X-file format is text based, making it easy to look into the "guts" of the file, while the old files were a "binary" format, you could compare them loosely to a mini-program that "ran" inside of the application making them effectively unreadable by
 users<br />
</li><li>The x-file text format allows you to easily extract elements like text or images from the file</li><li>the x-file text format in theory makes "file corruption" from external causes less likely</li><li>the text elements of the x-file format are saved inside of industry standard "ZIP" compression to reduce the text file size, usually substantially below the equivalent DOC file</li><li>using "Trusted Folders" is actually intended as a temp work around. The intent of the "Trust"design was to ultimately to have everyone "sign" their macro documents and use recognized "trusted Publishers" so that once you "recognize" a publisher as trusted,
 you no longer see the restriction no matter where the file is located<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Some other side effects of the x-file formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>the x-file text format in practice makes it easier for users to correct "internally created" file corruption, where the program messes up, ie the periodic XML "end tag" error we see. In the old binary format, this would have resulted in a totally unusable
 file</li><li>An unintended benefit of the x-file format is that other "open source programs" like LibreOffice are better at finding, working around and even fixing XML errors that the MS programs are creating &lt;<em>ironic grin</em>&gt;
</li><li>an unintended deficit of the x-file format is the order content is saved. In Word files, the body text is unfortunately saved at the "bottom" of the XML file structure. This makes it susceptible to loss when USB drives are not removed properly from Windows
 computers. From a user point of view it would be preferable to lose almost EVERYTHING else before the body text</li></ul>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong>DOCX vs DOC Formats</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>DOCX and DOTX files cannot contain macros, so you know they are safe. DOCM and DOTM files can contain macros, so you know they
<strong>may </strong>pose a risk. Their icons have a yellow script in the bottom left corner with an exclamation mark in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2007 puts security warnings in a bar below the ribbon rather than in a modal dialog so they don’t interrupt your work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking the Options... button allows you to enable the macros.</p>
<p>The Trust Centre (Developer | Code | Macro Security) lets you change the security settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should digitally sign your code so that you can be recognised as a Trusted Publisher. For testing purposes, on your PC only, you can create a digital certificate, with which to sign your code, using SELFCERT.EXE which you should find installed on your
 PC (probably in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12). For distribution to other people, you should get a trusted code signing certificate from your IT department, if they have the facilities to create one, or from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party such as Thawte
 or Verisign. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You sign your code in the VBA Editor (Tools | Digital Signature...) and then save your document/template. When anyone opens that document for the first time they are shown that the code is signed, can examine the certificate and choose whether to trust it
 or not. The signature proves that the code came from you and has not been tampered with since you signed it. Any attempt to tamper with the code will break the signature and that will be reported to the user. The user can choose to trust all code signed with
 a particular certificate and that puts the certificate into the Trusted Publishers store. Certificates are valid for one or two years. To avoid signatures created with the certificate also becoming invalid at the end of the certificate’s life, you should timestamp
 the signature. (This prove the signature was created within the valid period of the certificate.) There is a registry setting which will cause this to happen automatically whenever you sign code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don’t like having Trusted Locations because that means that any document or template in those folders is not subject to security. I prefer to disable all Trusted Locations and insist on digital signatures on all documents or templates with macros.

<p>Since email upgrade at turn of year I have lost all emails in inbox and in sent file from before the 16th of January 2019.</p>
<p>The account goes back several years.<br />
Can anyone who actually works for Hotmail please advise if their is any way of retrieving some, the bulk or all of said emails in a straight forward way....or better still is there any way I can ask this question to Hotmail directly and perhaps get a meaningful
 reply.</p>

            Dear Mark,<br /><br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.<br /><br />You have posted your question in Outlook.com forum, so I assume you are using it in browser.<br /><br />If you remember title of the emails that are missing or email address or even domain, try use search. In this article you will find all the suggestions and tips how to search for specific email <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search-mail-and-people-in-outlook-com-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search...</a> <br /><br />If you will find those emails, you will see in which folder they are. Also, please check all the folders, especially archive and deleted items <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/working-with-message-folders-in-outlook-com-6bb0723a-f39f-4a8d-bb3f-fab5dcc2510a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://s

    <title>Outlook 365 IMAP Spam Folder Is Empty, But Shows A Number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dittoheadadt1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 IMAP Spam Folder Is Empty, But Shows A Number</h2>
                    <p>When I right-click on the Spam folder I can empty it.&nbsp; But then later in the day a number will show next to the word "Spam" and the number may bear no relation to what is (or isn't) actually in the Spam folder.&nbsp; This has been going on for months now, but
 it's gotten worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, for the past few days a number in the 30s would appear while the number of emails actually in the Spam folder was zero, or maybe just a few.&nbsp; I would click on the Spam folder and even though it showed a number, it would say "We didn't find anything
 to show here" if it was empty, or it would show the number 37 but the actual number of spam emails would only be maybe 6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why it's showing a phantom number, why it's become worse lately, and how to stop it from happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi dittoheadadt,
<br />Who is your email provider? Are you syncing all mailbox content? 
<br />Are their any sync issues? Switch to the folder list (ctrl+6) to check the folder.  
<br />
<br />Is the folder empty on the server? 
<br />
<br />I would start with emptying the folder using web access then sync the (empty) folder in Outlook.       
        </p>

<p>1. Register.com</p>
<p>2. Yes, all mailbox content</p>
<p>3. No sync issues to my knowledge</p>
<p>4. Did CTRL+6. The folder shows sync issues going back to, I think, inception (Dec 2016). I don't know what this means. The sync errors show as having happened all over the place, not just in Spam</p>
<p>5. Yes, the folder is empty on the server. I'd already done that step, to confirm, before posting my question.&nbsp; Just FYI.</p>
<p>6. Even though the folder showed as empty on the server, I still went ahead and "emptied" it, anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Diane.</p>

<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />This is normal. We're only interested in current items - you can empty the folder. Check it again when you notice the issues with the spam folder again. 
<br />
<br />Do you use  3rd party antivirus that installs an outlook addin? (I'm wondering if the addin is affecting the behavior.)

<h2>            Outlook 2016 auto-completes hyperlinks within emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with my Outlook, that when I am trying to add a hyperlink to text, it is auto-completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example I might be trying to link someone to "http://www.example.com/example1/", but in the past I have added a separate hyperlink to "http://www.example.com/example1/example2".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter the first link in the "Insert Hyperlink" box, it will then auto-complete with the rest of the link from the 2nd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also hidden off to the right of the box most of the time, meaning I don't always notice it, and this has already caused some issues with pages I have linked to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way this can be disabled? I have tried disabling the settings under "File -&gt; Options -&gt; Mail -&gt; Spelling and Autocorrect... -&gt; Autocorrect Options... -&gt; AutoFormat As You Type" and unchecking the option for "Internet and network paths with hyperlinks"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

</p><p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your description. Based on your information, when you disable the settings of "<strong>Internet and network paths with hyperlinks</strong>", it mean that when you type a web address, it will stop Outlook from making automatic links. So this setting
 is not match your demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we type a web link in to "Insert Hyperlink" box, this web site will be stored to cache, and when we edit a similar web link to this "Insert Hyperlink" box again, the cache will help us to auto complete this web link. And we have no such official article
 for disabling this setting. For preventing type the mismatched web link, you need type the new or 2<sup>nd</sup> web link completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We totally understand that you are not be convinced this setting, we also would love to hear your thought to out user voice:

<h2>            Random numbers appear in Word</h2>
                    After a friend edited my manuscript, an odd thing happened where a random string of numbers appeared throughout the document, usually right before italicized words. Any ideas what's caused this? Each numerical string is different.&nbsp;

            It sounds like the anchor tag for across reference has become visible for some reason. &nbsp;What was in the italics? &nbsp;Could it be the anchor for a citation?

            You mean what was italicized? Just words. No citations or anything like that, this was just from a novel manuscript. Every single italicized word came with numbers preceding or following.

<br />
I just bought O2007Pro in its nice fancy box. I tried the support route but <br />
it wants a product ID but because it hasn't installed and none of the numbers <br />
on the box work I can't get support without paying - THANKS M$, so hopefully <br />
someone here can offer some guidance. <br />
I had been running 2003 and then installed 2010 Beta and it made me uninstall 2003. Everything was fine and having no problems. But since I can't afford to buy 2010 even though it is really cool I bought Office 2007 Pro instead. So
<br />
I uninstalled 2010 Beta but got an error that it did not uninstall completely even though it no longer shows in the control panel for uninstalls after rebooting. So now when I try to install 2007, I put the disk in and click Autorun but get this error:
<br />
Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have <br />
appropriate permissions to access the item. <br />
So I logged on as administrator but got the same error. <br />
Does anyone know how I can get support? Or fix this problem?<br />
I'm contacting Amazon where I bought it tomorrow but was hoping it was just a glitch from Office 2010 Beta and all I have to do is make some registry changes.
<br />
Thanks</span> &nbsp; <br />

I already tried doing it as Admin to no avail. When I re-installed Office 2003 and opened Outlook my folders were there so there is a trace of old installs left. Is there an article on how to completely remove Office/<br />
Thanks for you help!</blockquote>
<br />
<div>The folders are your data (in your Outlook profile)&nbsp;and they are kept in your *.pst file if you had a pop account. They don't belong to the install/uninstall of Office.</div>
<div>See some information about Outlook profiles:</div>

<h2>            Love my windows phone. Feeling sad no apps - Seriously considering changing</h2>
                    <p>I love my windows phone so easy to use. It has so much to offer apart from Apps. Why? This is a major let down.
</p>
<p>The possibility of changing to an android phone with apps is becoming rather tempting. Especially with the offers in the sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are&nbsp;Microsoft really&nbsp;going to push for apps for windows phones. This is a major priority.

            Good day! The relevant team is doing their best to provide necessary apps for Windows Phone devices. However, the availability of other apps may vary depending on its developer's discretion. If you want a specific app to be available, we suggest contacting
 its developer. Your patience is very much appreciated. ^___^

            <p>I feel it would have been better to offer the same or enhanced versions of many apps already coded for wp 8.1 phones.
</p>
<p>The loss of the Touch screen camera app, photo viewer app variants, refocus app, etc etc is a great shame.</p>

    <title>Hotmail sending multiple copies of emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> njs&#35;1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail sending multiple copies of emails</h2>
                    <p>As with other posts I've read through, my hotmail has decided to send many copies of each email. &nbsp;Not just those with attachments, as seems to be the case with others - all emails. &nbsp;I thought it was just a problem with my phone, but I've noticed it also
 now doing the same with Mail on the mac. &nbsp;It stops when I quit both the app on the phone and program on the laptop. &nbsp;As soon as I open them again it starts resending the email(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous cases, people have been told to look up the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Please check if your Outlook.com email account is creating a copy of your emails. Follow the below steps and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Go to&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.outlook.com</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and sign in with your Microsoft account</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Go to your&nbsp;<strong><span>Inbox</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click on the&nbsp;<strong><span>Gear icon</span></strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong><span>Options&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>from the dropdown list.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Under&nbsp;<strong><span>Managing your account</span></strong>&nbsp;category, select&nbsp;<strong><span>Email forwarding</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Uncheck&nbsp;<strong><span>Keep a copy of forwarded messages in your Outlook inbox</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Done</span></strong>&nbsp;to confirm changes</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Please check if there are existing rules on your Outlook.com account, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Sign in to your Microsoft Outlook.com account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click&nbsp;<strong>Gear icon</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong><span>Options&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>from the dropdown list.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Under&nbsp;<strong>Customizing Outlook&nbsp;</strong>category, click&nbsp;<strong>Rules for sorting new message</strong></span></span><strong><span>s</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the rules are set and remove them.</span></span></p>
<p>Neither of these were the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the hotmail mail account off my phone and reinstalled, but this hasn't changed anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pointers to other solutions would be most welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 bottom of the screen. &nbsp;I switched into flight mode to try to stop it sending and then went to look at the outbox where I found an offending email (one that had been repeatedly sent). &nbsp;I deleted it. &nbsp;I'm now not using hotmail at all to send messages. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Still no suggestions... I've now set up the outlook app on my phone and I'm using Outlook on the internet. &nbsp;While this has stopped me sending multiple copies of emails, I'd much rather use the Mail apps on both iphone and mac laptop as I have other email
 accounts in the same place. &nbsp; I'm not getting this problem with the other email accounts so it looks like its an issue with Mail handling Hotmail / Outlook accounts. &nbsp;

<div>If testing in a new user account produces the same results, try updating to the latest version of Remote Desktop Connection (2.1.1) by visiting the link below:</div>

<p>I suggest you provide the following information to better understand the issue:</p>
<p>1. The screenshot of error message when you meet the issue.</p>
<p>2. The OS version and OneDrive version.</p>
<p>3. Check if the issue occurs when you sync another account.</p>

    <title>No care at Nokia Care - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No care at Nokia Care</h2>
                    I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I went to Nokia Care, Mirpur to fix my 6630. It suffers the problem of auto-restart.<br />
<br />
After servicing, the problem persisted. They took the phone again for servicing. This repeated three times with no positive result. I asked for the refund of service charge Tk.1000 as per contract, but I was denied. Although the phone restarted in front of
 them and myself in their office, they claimed that the phone was okay.<br />
<br />
I did not receive any answer when I asked what servicing was done . I was dumbfounded by their attitudes.<br />
<br />
I don't know where to complain against such an unfortunate event. What can I do?

<h3> mackattacker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word Autocorrect Language Incorrect</h2>
                    <p>My Language set in Windows 10 is English (United States). It is the only language I have on the list. In Microsoft Word 2016, my Language is set to English (United States) &lt;default&gt; and it is enabled and set for Proofing. My Display Language and Help Language
 are both set to 1. English &lt;default&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, when I go into Word Options &gt; Proofing &gt; AutoCorrect Options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The window that pops up is titled: AutoCorrect: Spanish (Spain).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I see no option to change the language for AutoCorrect anywhere. How do I change this?</p>

<p>The language for the AutoCorrect Options dialog is determined by the proofing language applied at the current insertion point, not by anything on a program-wide or document-wide basis. Since that proofing language can be changed on as little as a single
 character, you could see a different Options dialog just by moving the insertion point to another location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't already have the proofing language displayed on the status bar, right-click the status bar and click "Language" to put a check mark next to it. Which language does it display when you're about to open the AutoCorrect Options dialog? Does the
 language of the dialog match the one shown in the status bar?</p>

    <title>End user custom query Access 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            End user custom query Access 2016</h2>
                    <p>Good morning!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit of a hard to explain question, so please bear with me and feel free to ask more questions of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an access database of quality data I've built for my small employer. Total, about 400 records with data points for each record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally had a boat load of tables set up with all of the different data points for each procedure of collection - production data, packaging data, lab data etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-designed it to be much more simple and just put it all in one large table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performance has increased significantly and the data entry forms I built are lightning fast now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - with that being said. What I'd like to do is create a query for my end users that allow them to use a batch number, lets say, and pull up&nbsp;<em>any</em> data they wish to see. Rather than have a query for difference procedure areas, I'd like to be able
 to build something that works along the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. User enters batch number</p>
<p>2. User is prompted for what data points they'd like to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a lot of data points to choose from - somewhere over 100. I can't think of a feasible way to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! Ideas!</p>

<p>We'd need to see your current structure with an explanation of data vs. what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>Of course, I haven't seen your database, but this sounds like you've denormalized your table structure&nbsp;which is a bad idea and will nip you in the butt at a later date.&nbsp; Proper structure is critical in any database.&nbsp; "Wide" tables (more than 15-20 fields)&nbsp;are
 typically an indication of improper design!</p>

            The usual interface for this sort of thing would be a set of unbound correlated combo boxes and/or list boxes, in which the RowSource of each is progressively restricted by the selections in those above it in the hierarchy.&nbsp; This does require that the
 structure of the database correctly follows the established principles of the database relational model, however.&nbsp; As Daniel has pointed out, there may be a question mark over this.<br />
<br />
Before we can comment constructively, therefore, we do need to see the model for the database.&nbsp; The easiest way to provide this is to post an image of the database's relationships window, set out clearly so that all columns in each table are visible, and the
 relationships between tables are clearly set out.&nbsp; If by <em>'just put it all in one large table'</em> you mean that there is only one table in the database, the window would contain that one table only of course, but such a table would be in need of decomposition.<br />
<br />
You'll find an illustration of the use of correlated multi-select list boxes in CorrelatedLists.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file uses Northwind data to illustrate how one more customers can be selected in one list box, restricting the items in a second list box to those products, if any, ordered by the selected customers.&nbsp; Selecting one or more products in the second
 list box then restricts the rows returned in the form to the selected customers/products.<br />

            First, I have to say that Access is a relational database. A relational database should NOT have a single table. It is almost definitely designed in a denormalized way. While this may have helped performance, its going to cause you headache in other ways.
<br />
<br />Second, Without understanding what your data points are and what your database does its hard to advise you. 
<br />
<br />If, by data points, you mean fields in a table. Then you could build a query using the user selections on a form, then use that query as the Recordsource of a report.

<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally had multiple tables and was running into issues relating to performance and speed. I had also asked for input on this from an Access specific forum and for some reason it was recommended to combine into one large table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree it should be multi-tables - I'm not sure why it was suggested the other way but I've kept both "versions" to be safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some further info</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Database is meant to act as a QA repository for the brewery I work at.</p>
<p>2. Want to be able to input data points based on certain collection points - packaging data, fermentation data, yeast data, ABV, can seam analysis, etc.</p>
<p>3. Common identifier across all points is the Batch Number, which is the primary key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I've got forms built to act as data entry forms, that utilize queries to pull the data for existing values where appropriate.</p>
<p>5. Ultimate goal is to continue the data entry portion, but also offer the ability to query data based on the batch number, brand, yeast type etc. and also select what data is to be viewed rather than pulliing&nbsp;<em>all</em> data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sense?</p>

            The structure you've posted is really just a partition of a single table into various categories, not a modelling of the reality in terms of its 'relations'.<br />
<br />
When considering your model its is important to understand how a relational database represents the reality which it is modelling.&nbsp; It does so in terms of entity types and relationship types.&nbsp; An entity type is a class of the reality, e.g.&nbsp; each one of use
 is an entity of type people.&nbsp; In a company each member of staff is an entity of type employees.&nbsp; An entity type is not necessary a physical class, it could be a process for instance, e.g. Sales Orders.<br />
<br />
Each entity type will have attributes, e.g. the Peoples entity type can have attributes such as gender, date of birth, nationalities (not just one, my family has both Irish and British nationality – I'll come back to this later) etc.<br />
<br />
Entity types are related to each other in a number of ways.&nbsp; The entity type Customers is related to the entity type SalesOrders in a one-to-many relationship type, i.e. each customer can be the subject of many orders, but each order can relate to one customer
 only.&nbsp; In the case of People and Nationalities the relationship type is many-to-many, i.e. each person can be of one or more nationalies.&nbsp; In the case of SalesOrders (or purchase orders) the relationship type with products is many-to-many, in that each order
 can be for one or more products and each product can be in one or more orders.&nbsp; A many-to-many relationship type is modelled by a third table, e.g. OrderDetails which resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many relationship type's by having foreign
 key columns OrderID and ProductID.&nbsp; Note that a relationship type is really just a special kind of entity type so will often have non-key attributes, e.g. an OrderDetails will have attributes Quantity and UnitPrice, each modelled by a column in the table.<br />
<br />
A very important principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle.&nbsp; This requires that data is stored at column positions in rows in table and in no other way.&nbsp; Data must not be encoded as table names or column names.&nbsp; For instance a
 table FruitStocked would not have columns named Apples, Oranges, Bananas, Pears etc.&nbsp; It would have single column in which each fruit name would be a value in a separate row.<br />
<br />
Another important mechanism of the database relational model is Normalization this is a formal process by which a non-normalized table (such as you'd have in a spreadsheet for instance) is decomposed into a set of related tables.&nbsp; The key principle here is
 that each non-key column in a table is determined solely by the whole of the primary key of the table.&nbsp; A table which satisfies this requirement is in Third Normal Form (3NF).&nbsp; There are lower and higher normal forms, but 3NF is the one for relatively inexperienced
 developers to always bear in mind.<br />
<br />
The relational database model is far more complex than the few points I've addressed above of course.&nbsp; There is a vast amount of academic literature on the subject going back to Codd's original introduction of the model around 1970 in his seminal paper on the
 subject.&nbsp; The pints I've addressed above are some of the key issues, however.<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at a couple of files, DatabaseBasics.zip and Normalization.zip, in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
These little demo files offer a simple introduction to relational database design and the subject of normalization.&nbsp; The former includes sections on data entry and data retrieval in addition to modelling the reality by means of tables and relationships between
 them.&nbsp; For an illustration of how relationship types are built up across a database see Relationships.zip in the same OneDrive folder.<br />

<p>You know your business better than anyone else, and certainly far better than we do, so you are in the best position to identify its entity types and their attributes.&nbsp; For the moment forget about computers and databases and think about what makes up the
 model of your business in terms of the real world entity types and the real world relationship types between them.&nbsp; Then sit down with a pencil and paper and draw out the model as an 'entity relationship diagram'.&nbsp; This is similar to what you see in a database's
 relationship window in which each table is represented by a box, with directional lines indicating the relationships between them.<br />
<br />
The most striking thing about your current tables is that, from what columns are visible, each table seems to have the same set of columns, which in database terms means the same attributes.&nbsp; That would not be the case in a well structured database, where each
 table would have a distinct set of columns representing the attributes of the entity type which the table is modelling.<br />
<br />
If you download my DatabaseBasics.zip file from my OneDrive folder at the link I posted earlier, and go to the section
<em>'4.&nbsp; Bringing the model together'</em> you'll see that each of the tables in this simple model of a contacts database has columns which represent attributes of the entity type modelled by the table:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9b4b5f3-4698-4a42-8bde-c5d6e366d407?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9b4b5f3-4698-4a42-8bde-c5d6e366d407?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Contacts table for instance has FirstName, LastName, Address and CityID columns, the last being a foreign key, whereas the Cities table has City and RegionID columns.&nbsp; Apart from the keys such as CityID and RegionID, which enable the tables to be related,
 there is no duplication of columns in different tables.&nbsp; Note also how each table has a relatively small number of columns.&nbsp; This is a sign of well-structured model, in which a table can have very many rows, but a limited number of columns.&nbsp; Tables with very
 large numbers of columns, on the other hand, almost always indicate a poor design.&nbsp; Where it is necessary to output data as a large number of columns this would be done by a query which joins multiple tables on the keys.

<h2>            Office 365 Outlook on Desktop PC &#38; iPad</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 (home version) or Office 2016 or whatever it's called on my PC (Win 10).&nbsp; I wanted to put it on my iPad as well, which is one of the reasons I bought Office, , so I downloaded what appeared to be the correct Outlook app to the iPad.&nbsp; For
 weeks I have been trying to set up and sync my Talktalk email account, which I have always managed with Outlook,&nbsp;with the iPad, but nothing I try works, although the mail &amp; calendar apps that came with the iPad did sync with the PC's Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the connectivity between PC, Mac &amp; tablets (I also have an Android tablet) is not all it's cracked up to be.&nbsp; At present I've not much confidence in Office 365, although I'm stuck with it for a year, but I'm hoping there is a simple solution
 to make all the Office components work across all the platforms.&nbsp; That is apart from Publisher and Access, which I don't care about anyway.</p>

<p>Not sure what options you have used while sorting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Select the complete range of data which you wish to sort</p>
<p>- Click on DATA </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; SORT </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; select the column header on which you wish to sort your data</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; Select the Order in which you wish to sort your data</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data may not get properly sorted if after selecting the range, you just click on a-z&nbsp; or z-a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this Helps.</p>

            if you look at the 2 pics i sent, before and after sorting.&nbsp; I get the "#div/0!" sorted higher then the numerical values.&nbsp; how do i get the to appear at the bottom?

<p>I think, you may have to take care of this in your formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example&nbsp; if my formula&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A2/B2&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can overcome the "#Div/0!" error by re-writing the formula as&nbsp;&nbsp; =IF(B2=0,0,A2/B2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will replace all&nbsp;such errors with zero and then I believe the sorting would work as desired.</p>

<p>the divide by zero isn't the problem.&nbsp; its the sort function ranks it higher.&nbsp; i need to do percents.&nbsp; this is the formula i'm using.</p>
<p>=(E25)/SUM(E25:F25)</p>
<p>how would i adjust it to either show zero or change its ranking order.</p>
<p>your formula doesn't give a percent.</p>

<p>I feel that the '#Div/0!" error&nbsp; is a text and not a numeric and hence, </p>
<p>when the 'Sort' function works, it would sort the range accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In sorting order, numbers are considered lower than the text and hence when sorting in ascending order, the text (in our case the error msg) goes to the end - whereas while sorting in descending order, the text (in our case the error msg)&nbsp;is placed at the
 start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the formula which I had suggested earlier, then the sort function would sort the data in the right order as expected.</p>

<p>At first: It doesn't matter if you have a percent or usual value, a number is a number.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you want to have the #DIV errors at the bottom after a Z-A sort you must use a helper column:<br />
D2:&nbsp; =IFERROR(C2,0)</p>
<p>drag down and sort the data ZA by this column:</p>

Runtime error 2501 means that there was an attempt to open the report and it was cancelled. This can happen because the Report_Open event has code to set the Cancel argument to True, or perhaps the Report_NoData event doing the same thing.<br />
Inspect your code. Hopefully it will become evident then. <br />

When the error 2501 occurs, you can hit Ctrl+Break to break into the debugger, then use View &gt; Callstack to see the stack frames and find out who called who.<br />
