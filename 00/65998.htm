<h2>            New windows 7 64 with ie 11 - ie 11 can&#39;t do google searches, Can&#39;t do system restore due to error message corrupt C drive</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Windows 7 Professional 64 bit desktop running Windows 7 Professional. I bought Dell Concierge for support. I have had numerous issues with the computer but lately, my IE 11 Browser can't search on Google. When I enter a query it shoots up to
 the left part of the screen and doesn't yield anything when you hit the enter button or the search icon. I have performed virus scans and it is coming up no virus. I run MSE and Malwarebytes and have even ran my bleeping computer but no virus found. Tried
 to do a system restore yesterday to an earlier point in time on two different dates and the error message came back C drive corrupt 08x800ffff. Dell Conceirge said I needed to create another user account and copy all of my data for my business to the new user
 account and that would fix the problem. That didn't make sense to me but I went along with it anyway. They took 6 hours and called me back and ended the process in the middle of it incomplete. I called back and am still able to use the other side "supposed
 to be corrupt" . I NEED this problem solved and Dell is clueless. Why would setting up another account on the same corrupt machine be a solution? I spoke to a tech person locally and we are going to bring it in there and put it on the bench tonight to see
 if there are any viruses. Dell is saying that creating a new user account will get rid of a corrupt c drive that won't let me do system restore. That makes no sense to me but I am not a computer tech person. Also, Microsoft is aggressively pushing windows
 10 which I do not want at this time. They have sent out important updates that are the KB 3035583 update. We have a screen shot of this as of last week. I am frustrated as I know there are others with the same ie 11 issues. I eventually will go to windows
 10 but that is one year out for me as I run a small business and can't do it right now. Someone please answer me, if my c drive can't do a system restore date due to corrupt error message 08x800ffff then why would creating another user account and copying
 all of my data to the other user account fix the problem? It is the same computer?
</p>
<p>Also, is anyone else having problems with google and ie 11 - not getting searches back on google?

            Thank You so much! I am not a "techie" so I want to fully understand. How do I run the chkdsk/r in an elevated command prompt? Maybe I should just use the link you provided? Thank You for the tool. Are we all sure that tool is safe? Also, would you recommend
 using malwarebytes with mse or will they conflict?

            <p>The Windows 10 stop tool is very safe.&nbsp; It has been widely reviewed and recommended by expert sources, and I have had not a problem with it when used for several customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you call Dell tech support you're generally talking to minimally knowledgeable technicians who follow a check list of things to try and often fail to recognize more difficult problems.&nbsp; Setting up another account is sometimes a solution for problems
 caused by a corrupted user profile.&nbsp; I suspect Dell may have suggested this when they didn't know what else to do.&nbsp; The fact that it failed is further indication of some other problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can just as well use the other method to run the disk check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; You mentioned small business data involved.&nbsp; I suggest you be very careful and back up that data if you haven't done so already.&nbsp; In fact since you said you are going to see a "local tech person" (hopefully a good one) I suggest you don't try much
 first yourself and have that tech help you back up data and then check the drive.&nbsp; A virus or other problems are also possible, but I would want to check the drive first thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Malwarebytes on demand while you have MSE is fine. I wouldn't recommend using the paid resident version at the same time.</p>

            Yes, the Dell person shouldn't have had me "copy" most files to the "new account" until he checked it first to make sure it worked. I am taking the computer to Staples to a tech there who seems to be knowledgeable. I have talked to him in the past. I think
 this problem might have been caused by the Dell concierge software that is installed on the computer. The other night it popped up out of nowhere and asked me for UAC, which I said yes to . After it was finished, it had installed a new browser, search engine
 was bing and I was getting all kinds of error messages about the browser 2122 sandbox violations. Yesterday, when I initially called Dell, they said the solution was to go to Ie8 browser. Can you imagine that! I should have just ended the call there.

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a> and it reported no problems. I ran it from the old account but not sure if the computer's report was referring to the old account or the new account.

<p>The report said there were no problems or issues with the C drive but why couldn't it do a system restore? Maybe the computer scanned the new account?</p>

            <p>It doesn't matter which account is used to run the disk check.&nbsp; From your new information it sounds like there might be a malware issue and other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had seen bad support from Dell before, but your experience is a new low.&nbsp; I hope the tech you're going to see can help.&nbsp; (Big store operations like Staples don't inspire confidence.)&nbsp; Good luck and keep us posted.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error code 0xC1900209</strong> is an error that you’ll encounter when using Windows Update or trying to upgrade your operating system. It happens because an application is causing compatibility issues and blocking the update or upgrade process. In
 this article, we’ll look at a couple of ways you can handle the offending application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, we suggest that you perform a clean boot. <span>A <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After performing a clean boot, please go through the section&nbsp;</span><strong>How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><em><strong>Note</strong>: Please go through the section <strong>Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> of the</em><span>&nbsp;</span></span><em><span>article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing
 the issue.</span></em></span></p>

            <p>Thanks for email. I have had telephone line issues, so apologies for delay in replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not get any error messages when the issue occurs, the document simply does not print, nor does it appear in the print queue.</p>
<p>The printer is a wireless Canon Pixma MG3150 and is only a couple of months old.</p>
<p>The issue is not specific to Adobe Reader documents, the multi-page print function will not work using the document reader pre-installed on the machine as part of the Windows 8 package. I get a message when trying to print when opening the document using
 Adobe "Printer not shared with home group"</p>
<p>I made no changes to the computer since purchase other than to upload Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will have a detailed&nbsp;look at the help link and see if there is anything there that will assist but, at first glance, it seems that this specific issue is not covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for now</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>If you want to print 4 copies of original document on 1 page, <strong>merge </strong>
4 copies of the same original into one document.&nbsp; Save.&nbsp; THEN, choose "multiple" and "4 pages per sheet".&nbsp; Shazam!&nbsp; Print.&nbsp; Woo!</p>

                    <p>I purchased the game through the store on my Xbox One. Installed it. Tried to launch it and am unable to play it. I get the screen asking if I own the game. Yes, I do. No I don't have a disc. I purchased digitally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried every option in xbox assist. I uninstalled it and reinstalled. nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then spent 30 mins on the phone with xbox support. The guy on the phone had me clearing my MAC address, deleting my profile-&gt; adding then signing in on my profile, Hard reset, and then eventually resetting my console and then uninstalling/reinstalling
 the game. nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Decided to get a refund. The option does not exist for this game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span>Please make sure your <strong><span>Country or Region</span></strong>, <strong>
<span>Language</span></strong>, and <strong><span>Speech Language</span></strong> settings are all aligned with one of Cortana’s supported locale configurations. If these OS settings are not aligned, Cortana will not be available. For example, Cortana will

            The Skype App for Windows 8.x was discontinued some time ago.&nbsp; The upgrade path on that OS is Skype for Windows Desktop.&nbsp; You would either have to use the Desktop release or the web release on Windows 8.x.&nbsp; If you required an App release, you would have
 to upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10.&nbsp; If you have Windows RT 8.x, there is no upgrade path besides a supported system.<br />

<h2>            Text &#47; Wording in app&#47;program is not visible - windows 10 or surface problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have experience multiple times that "text" is not visible. i go to access an excel file when using excel and the titles of the sections New, open, etc are not visible. i also notice that it doesn't highlight the file with a "darker" line to denote that
 i'm selecting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Flipboard, the wordings were not visible on the titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it doesn't seem to be a individual program / app issue but a windows 10 or surface book issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately, &nbsp;i noticed that excel crashes more frequently with surface book / windows 10? Usually when i drop and drag a cell accidentally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the problem might be with the User Profile. Sometimes a minor corruption with the User Profile will cause this issue. Suggest you to setup another User Profile to test the issue. This will help us to find the root cause of the issue.

 Once you setup the new User Profile, please check and see if the problem still appears there.</span></p>

<p>I believe I've found a fix to the same problem. I had an XP system that would not boot as it had some corrupt data on the hard drive that chkdsk and other utilities could not fix.... so I use the repair function on the XP CD to end up with the same error
 just after selecting the user icon to login with.</p>
<p>Here's the fix... not easy, but so far it's working.</p>
<p>You'll need a second PC, an Internet connection and a CD burner.</p>
<p>Since the problem lies with Internet Explorer 7 or 8, which is already installed, you need to find a way to modify your repair CD to include Internet Explorer 7.</p>
<p>Essentially, you have to create a Windows XP slip stream CD. In simple terms, you have to make a new installation CD that includes Internet Explorer 7 in it. (you might as well make one that includes the latest service pack too)</p>
<p>Here's the link to the instructions on how to do this: http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=1848&amp;tag=col1;post-1848 (or Bing or Google this:&nbsp;Creating an XP SP3 slipstreamed ISO file)</p>
<p>If you follow the above directions to create the new boot cd successfully, then run it once again&nbsp;choosing&nbsp;the 2nd repair option (the one select enter for a new operating system then select R.... not the first one that gets you the command prompt)</p>
<p>I still had issues with Internet Explorer running once the repair was done, but I was able to get onto the system, archive the data and continue onward with a repair. I did this by installing Firefox using a USB key from another system then going to Microsoft
 Internet Explorer 8 installation page to update it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.... good luck</p>

<br />
Microsoft Feeds Synchronization has encountered a problem and needs to close.<br />
<br />
AppName: msfeedssync.exe AppVer: 8.0.6001.18702 ModName: user32.dll<br />

    <title>MSN Explorer Premium Keeps Crashing After Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MSN Explorer Premium Keeps Crashing After Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I did the free upgrade to Windows 10, and ever since then, my MSN Explorer is crashing constantly. I can't click more than two email messages without it signing me out over and over again. I called Microsoft for their help - held on the phone for 41 minutes
 just to get a tech person to answer!! Then the person TRIED to help me by remotely accessing my computer. That took another hour and twenty minutes before she told me: "Sorry, there's nothing we can do at this time. There have been a lot of problems with this
 upgrade and MSN Premium. You'll just have to access your email from now on by signing in through your other browser." - WHAT? I pay every month for the MSN Explorer service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked her if I should downgrade back to Windows 8 again and she said it wouldn't be a good idea because then none of my programs would work effectively. The files would become corrupted. UGH. This is a MICROSOFT product that isn't COMPATIBLE with their
 new operating system!?!?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She then said: "Sorry, I'll transfer you." and suddenly I was on hold again.... I've been holding NOW for another 48 minutes while I seek help on these threads. I can't tell you how much longer I'll be hanging here after I click SUBMIT.</p>
<p>Now I have to determine whether I just commit to cancelling my MSN service once and for all after having been a loyal customer for almost 20 years. Gmail, here I come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone seeking reviews: DO NOT UPGRADE, if you want your system to work. That's my advice. Microsoft won't help you, if you have any trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone out there who can advise ME on what to do with my system? I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm trying very hard to keep being patient here (after being on the phone line with Microsoft for about 2 hours)... Ugh</p>

            <p>Unless you are paying for MSN dial up alongside premium, I would seriously consider cancelling your subscription.
 support for ISPs and me paying for it didn't seem worth it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install MSN on my workstation, which runs both 7 and 10 in different partitions (more on that later), after reading your post and realized that
 3.5 (2007) to get the User Interface to load (some actions crash it, but at least loads fully). As in my other posts about WL and Outlook (click user name), you basically need to have Professional versions of Windows and sometimes enable developer tools (hence
 two versions) to get older programs to work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">want to use them you can stay with Windows 7</span>, but beware that what was Microsoft Update (an optional feature to update Office, games, and non-Windows files, called 'get updates for other programs' in
 control panel) is slowly being automatically applied (for security) as Windows 7 enters extended support. This means that
 programs difficult to keep working. This will probably happen slower for Home editions, or if MS update is off ('for windows only' is displayed), but it is coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> consider upgrading to their free replacements</span> online and off; including Outlook.com, Skype, MSN's homepage (the one site Microsoft themselves still run, not Fox Sports or others), etc..
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Or using other apps</span> such as Thunderbird and Sunrise Calendar (recommended by a friend). If your looking for a paid (no ad) mail service, I use Fastmail ($10/yr) for work and financial/personal matters. The other
 features mentioned <a href="http://get.msn.com/?lm=en-us#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
on the site</a>&nbsp;(e.g. McAfee, Webroot, the Reference library, etc.) aren't really worth paying for either as there are better options available for free (e.g. Avast, Bitdefender, various online references provided by my library) and paid.</p>

            <p>I receive a little dialog box saying: "MSN Explorer has stopped working - A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the programand notify you if a solution is available." Then "Close Program" click button. - This happens
 every third email I click onto...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft support and held on the phone for 2 hours and 39 minutes before finally getting to a tech person who could help me - or not - He took control of my computer and then decided, after another HOUR, that he couldn't do anything for me. He
 then transferred me to another "escalated tech person" - That person spent over an hour on my computer, as well, before deciding he couldn't help me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I was on the phone for over 4 hours and 33 minutes with Microsoft and got NOWHERE. In the end, they explained to me that "this is happening to everyone who has MSN Explorer right now. We're sorry for the inconvenience. Just go to the other browser
 for now and access your email that way until our techs figure out what's wrong." - WHAT?? This is a Microsoft program and they can't figure out why this isn't compatible with the new Windows 10 upgrade? Why would they come out with a new system without first
 making sure it worked with their others?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was transferred to the billing department and asked for a refund on my month's service, since I won't have a workable Premium service for a few weeks. I won't pay for a service I'm not able to use at the fault of Microsoft. But they said I could only get
 ONE month's credit, even if they can't figure out the issues. That's fine. I'll cancel the service and just use Google after that. I've lost respect for Microsoft anyway. It'll be unfortunate, however - I have used MSN email for many years and have enjoyed
 the system - I'll adjust.</p>

            <p>Sadly, I don't' think "the techs will (ever) figure out the issue" as it has been pretty well documented to be the really old code that both WL and MSN use. Even
 in future versions' warning. As half baked as the built in Mail is, the Outlook team probably spent most of their time getting that to download messages and didn't backport the code to the older programs, which would probably solve most of both programs' problems.</p>

            I had windows 8, the worst windows after Windows Vista. I had many problems, and I had hope windows 10 will solve it. It did just a few out of many. Now, my MSN explorer continue to crash. I spoke with other, they advise not to upgrade to Windows 10. but,
 Windows 8 is not a good option too. Can I go back to windows 7?

            I to have the same problem and have removed and downloaded msn once again and it still keeps happening. I have been with msn for 12 years now and this is the first time they have not been able to help. If they don't come up with a solution soon I will
 stop paying for something I cant use.

            That I where I am at as well. This last crash would not even let the MSN homepage load before it crashed. They said it was ADOBE flashplayer update that was the problem. So, I finally got that fixed. It worked fine for maybe 3 days and it's back to crashing
 again. It doesn't even have to be mail. It happens while reading articles from the MSN homepage. I receive a little dialog box saying: "MSN Explorer has stopped working - A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program
 and notify you if a solution is available." Then "Close Program" click button". My subscription is coming up for renewal. Will be a pain in the neck, but it looks like I will have to go with Gmail, which I despise!

            <p>My exact problem, too.&nbsp; Sometimes the butterfly flaps for a long time first, before the message.&nbsp; sometimes restarting my computer, or resetting my router helps, but that might just be a coincidence.&nbsp; Sometimes it works, sometimes, it doesn't.&nbsp; Even if I

<p>I am trying to download a free version of Abbyy FineReader. Every time I try to get to download page, I get the 'This Page Can't Be Displayed'. I have gone to different websites with the same results. I have it as bundled software on my laptop with Windows
 Home&nbsp;Premium. On my desktop I have the misfortune of having Windows Professional.&nbsp;What to do?</p>

<p>If you want a copy that does not come bundled with your system, it is going to have to be a "free trial version" and&nbsp; it is usually for a short period before you have to buy a full license.</p>
<p>There offers across the web for "free" full version downloads but I would not recommend using any of them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As to your question about the links, I think it's by design that the page cannot be displayed.<br />

<p>Yes, it is true that ALL purchases on the XBL Marketplace are non-refundable. It tells us in every product description for every purchase item and in the XBL Terms of Service. In the end, YOU are responsible for your account. Next time I would suggest putting
 the controller out of reach when you leave the room. If it was done while your son was playing a game then I suggest you create him his own silver account and set Parental Controls on it to avoid this from happening again.
