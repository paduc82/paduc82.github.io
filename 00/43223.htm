<h2>            Kid kicking me offline</h2>
                    
<p>So pretty much, i was in a party with one of my real life friends on xbox and this kid whos gamertag is
<strong>[GT REMOVED]</strong> was in the part also, and he kicked me offline repeatedly, For no apparent reason i was getting disconnected from xbox live and my ISP was nothing to do with it. I would like it very much so if)&nbsp;you people (xbox support team) would
 look into this matter because it has been happeneing a lot lately and is rather annoying&nbsp;I cannot play any games online without getting kick offline from this kid. Please xbox support do something to stop him from doing this to me as it is really annoying.
 I filed a complaint on him also. thank you for your time.</p>

<p>okay all he is doing is attacking your IP Address</p>
<p>So To Stop This Issue You Want To &nbsp;Do The Following</p>
<p>Computer connected directly to the modem</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Get to a command prompt. (START, run, cmd)</p>
<p>Type "ipconfig /release" (without the quotes, on the command line by itself).</p>
<p>Type "ipconfig /renew" (without the quotes, on the command line by itself).</p>
<p>or your second option is</p>
<p>Computer connected directly to the modem</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Get to a command prompt. (START, run, cmd).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Type "ipconfig /release" (without the quotes).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Shut down computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn off computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn off all ethernet hubs/switches.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn off cable/DSL modem.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Leave off overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn everything back on.</p>
<p>and finally is</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Log into the router's admin console. (Often <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://192.168.1.1/</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Release the IP address. (Method varies by router manufacturer)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn off router, ethernet hubs/switches, and the cable/DSL modem.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Leave off overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn everything back on.</p>
<p>If you are using a cable/DSL modem and a router, you may wish to connect your computer directly to the cable/DSL modem. Please note that this could significantly impact your system security. This allows your ISP's DHCP to issue you a new (hopefully changed)
 IP address based of the (hardware) MAC address of your computer's ethernet card.</p>
<p>If all the above has not worked to change your IP address and you have a router, check and see if there is a "Clone MAC Address" option. Using it should change your IP address; however, you'll only be able to do it once (in most cases).</p>
<p>These will not work in all cases. If all else fails contact your internet service provider (ISP) and ask them if they are able to change your IP address or how long your connection needs to be off for your IP address to change.</p>
<p>If you trying to change your IP address because you are just trying to access web based forums you may wish to attempt to configure your internet browser to use a proxy server.</p>

    <title>Pin prompt to logon to win 10 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pin prompt to logon to win 10 laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>After 1803 update, after booting the laptop, hitting any keyboard key does not bring up the pin prompt anymore. I can get the prompt to login to win 10 only by clicking the mouse button. Before the 1803 update hitting any keyboard key brought the prompt,
 as well as mouse button. Why it happened, and can I make it work same way 1709 release worked?</p>

<p>I'm not positive this is the same thing you are experiencing, but starting this afternoon, (05/30/18), my screen was not "waking up" when hitting the keyboard or clicking on my mouse and showing the MS password entry box, (I haven't set a PIN yet), to login
 after waking my laptop from closing it.&nbsp; (My "creator's update" 1803 that changed my login screen to include the PIN login option completed 05/22/18.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of frustration, after hitting enter over on my keyboard over and over again and clicking like crazy with my mouse, I hit "Alt/Cntl/Delete" just as a last resort, and "wallah!!!!" .... my MS sign-in entry box showed up!&nbsp; I then looked the "symptom" up
 on the internet and validated that is now an installed feature default in order to prevent bogus malware login screens from capturing in your MS password/PIN.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Evidently, you can disable this if needed, such as in disability access situations.&nbsp; I'm fine with it ... now that I KNOW about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like this is a good thing, quoting tenforums &lt;dot&gt; com, "It's important to keep your PC as secure as possible. One way to do this is to enable secure sign-in, which requires users to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete on the lock screen before signing in. This
 guarantees that the authentic Windows sign-in screen appears, protecting the system from programs that mimic a sign-in to retrieve password information. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wish they would tell us this before updating our systems in the middle of the night and expecting us to have hours to devote to reading update notes before using our systems.</p>

<h2>            Having trouble -- still unable to download IE 9, KB2117917, KB971512, etc</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
On my laptop, I have Windows Vista 32-bit OS, SP2, still stuck running IE 8.<br />
<br />
I can't download IE 9 because I can't download KB2117917.&nbsp; When I run the standalone installer for KB971512 (retrieved from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8594), it says the update doesn't apply to my system.&nbsp; It doesn't show an option
 to download this update in Windows Update, either, so I cannot download it from there.&nbsp; I don't think I already have downloaded it, but I suppose it is possible.&nbsp; I looked through my update history on Windows Update and didn't see it, but it's a long list
 so I may have missed it; however, if this is the case, then I ought to have no trouble downloading the other update(s), and every time I try it fails.<br />
<br />
In fact, many other updates continually fail each time I try to update them, even though a lot of time has passed since they were published (I guess I hoped maybe the issues that was causing the failures to be fixed eventually by other updates).&nbsp; These updates
 include KB2656362, KB2506212, KB2507618, KB2508429, KB2509553, KB2511455, KB2535512, KB2536275, KB2544893, KB2588516, KB2619339, KB2620704, KB2633171, KB2345586, and KB2641690.<br />
<br />
I do realize that these were all published quite some time ago, but I was just tolerating it before, and now I'm starting to get really frustrated with the fact that I can't download these updates and that each time I shut down my computer it wastes time trying,
 yet again, to do this unsuccessfully.&nbsp; If anybody has any thoughts/solutions about what I can do to fix the problems I'm having with any or all of these updates, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

<h2>            Latest WIN10 update, won&#39;t reboot &#40;2017 issue, not 2015&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just took the latest WIN10 (April 25, 2017) update on my PC but it won't restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It went thru all the blue "updating" screens, then it restarted. I got the windows logo, then it went black with just the circling dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to restart in safe mode but I don't know how to get to windows from there, it just puts me at a command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got to the advanced boot options and tried to repair it, but it came back with unable to repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have a 1TB hd you don't do back-ups, sorry. This PC is 3 years old and I've never had any issues until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the system is <strong>NOT </strong>an option!! Too many installed programs and corresponding data.

<h2>            windows failed to load as the system registry file is missing or corrupt</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having a massive issue with Windows 7 Home Premium. I believe this was caused by a recent Windows update which made changes to the registry, now when i try to load my PC it hangs at the Starting Windows screen, restarted, or BSOD's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is that i cannot access the startup repair options either from the hard drive, or from the Windows DVD.&nbsp; If i try to load from the DVD i get as far as press any key to load from DVD, a loading bar, and then it either crashes or hangs
 - I cannot get to the startup repair options, nor it seems can i even reinstall windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas how i.could access the recovery options or fix this issue? as right now my PC is a very large paperweight. Thanks you.</p>

<p>I have seen a number of posts in which people reported that they were unable to boot from the CD/DVD drive. Here are the most common reasons for such failures:<br />
a) The poster failed to set the correct boot order in the BIOS.<br />
b) The poster overlooked the prompt to press a key in order to boot from the CD/DVD drive.<br />
c) The boot CD/DVD was not a boot disk or was damaged. Using it on another machine confirmed this.<br />
d) Some BIOS setting was incorrect. Booting with some other boot CD/DVD (e.g. from here: http://pogostick.net/~pnh/ntpasswd/) confirmed this.<br />
e) The CD/DVD drive was damaged or unable to boot from a boot CD or DVD.<br />
f) The machine had a hardware problem (e.g. a motherboard problem) that prevented it from booting in any mode.</p>
<p>If none of the above apply then you might have a hardware problem in which case you need to get the machine serviced. A Windows Automatic Update cannot possibly affect the boot process from a boot CD/DVD.</p>

<p>Thank you but you misunderstand. The boot priority etc is fine and it DOES boot to disk, however while loading it hangs on the Starting Windows screen. It has so far, booted to disk successfully once since I posted the original message. Once there I attempted
 the automatic repair, but that did not work - and I am now stuck in a cycle of it hanging while loading again. I am going to keep attempting to get it to load from disk where I will try a system restore amongst other things pending any other help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>

<p>When you boot the machine with a Windows 7 Repair Disk then you get into the so-called Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). You do not get into Windows. The same happens when you boot the machine with your Windows 7 installation DVD and select "Repair".</p>
<p>Both of these modes are completely independent of the files and folders on your hard disk. Both modes give you access to the Windows System Restore facility.</p>

            nonetheless, before it loads the recovery environment it displays the starting windows screen/logo, at which point it hangs.

<p>hmmm.&nbsp; I am having the exact same problem.&nbsp; Apparently we are all having hardware problems since the last update.&nbsp; Obviously it could not be a Windows issue.</p>
<p>Does anyone besides Pegasus have anything constructive to offer?</p>
<p>Actually mine does not hang. It just takes hours to get to the System Recovery Options.&nbsp; After you pick an option (startup repair) it again takes hours to figure out there is nothing it knows how to do.&nbsp; I am going to let sit at the Windows logo ("Starting
 Windows") overnight to see if it will decide to boot up.</p>
<p>FYI - I rebooted my computer because the screen saver never came on (set for five minutes).&nbsp; Power save did not kick in either.&nbsp; After sitting all night it was still displaying as it was when I left it.&nbsp; It was running just fine - just no screen saver.</p>
<p>I have been all over the BIOS using settings known to work.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any insight you offer!</p>

            Hello again. I decided to crack open my case on the advice that it could be a hardware issue and lo and behold - one of the clasps on one of my RAM sticks had popped open. The PC was recognising the RAM was there as it was mostly connected, however it
 seems whenever it actually tried to use that stick, it crashed. Since re-affixing that clasp everything is back to normal. Thanks everyone, and Toad, I hope your solution is as irritatingly simple as mine

<p>Pegasus,</p>
<p>&nbsp; My apologies.&nbsp; I also had a hardware failure.&nbsp; My SSD would respond very very slowly.&nbsp; Apparently it was just coincidental that Windows had just updated or the restart triggered the failure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did have to boot Ubuntu from a disk to figure this out (I
 tried benchmarking my harddrives) because I do not know how to verify hardware when Windows doesn't boot (it looked normal in the BIOS).</p>
<p>Again, Pegasus correctly diagnosed the problem as a hardware issue.&nbsp; I am grateful we have patient people like Pegasus willing to help frustrated users.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - media player&#47;centre won&#39;t play videos at all</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have recently upgraded to Windows 7 and everything seemed to be working fine until I tried to watch a video. Whenever I do, Windows Media Player (WMP) opens in a small window (about 150 x 150) and the sound plays, but no video.<br />
<br />
If I try to open a video from within WMP I get the same problem, it plays as if it's a sound file. I even had the same thing happen a few minutes ago while trying to watch one of the video tutorials on this website!<br />
<br />
It also does the same thing through Windows Media Centre, and it won't play Live TV even though it has a signal.<br />
<br />
I've tried searching on here and elsewhere, but no luck.<br />
<br />
Can someone help please?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
Tino

<p>Hi Tinohead,</p>
<p>This might be an issue if the drivers are not updated after upgrading to Windows 7. Updating to latest drivers for Display Adapter and TV tuner card might help you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Device Manager in Start search.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Display Adapters in device manager window.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the Device.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Properties.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Driver Tab.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Update drivers.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.</p>
<p>Check if any exclamation marks are shown with the device. The exclamation mark shows an issue with the driver installed.</p>
<p>You may try uninstalling and re-installing the latest drivers for the Display adapter from the manufacturer’s website and check.</p>

            Assuming you are asking about Favorites in Internet Explorer, the following is from Internet Explorer help (and then search for "export favorites").&nbsp; It describes how to export your favorites to a file:<br />
<br />
Import or export favorites in Internet Explorer<br />
<br />
Favorites, also known as bookmarks, are a convenient way to organize and find webpages that you visit frequently. If you use Internet Explorer on several computers, you can save your favorites from one computer and then import that list to another computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;To export favorites<br />
Follow these steps on the computer that you're exporting your favorites from.<br />
<br />
Click to open Internet Explorer. <br />
<br />
Click the Favorites button, click the arrow next to the Add to Favorites button, and then click Import and Export.<br />
<br />
In the Import/Export Settings dialog box, click Export to a file, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
Select the Favorites check box, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
Select the folder that you want to export your favorites from, and then click Next.
<br />
<br />
By default, Internet Explorer creates a file called bookmark.htm in your Documents folder. If you want to use a name other than bookmark.htm or to store the exported favorites in a folder other than Documents, specify the new file and folder name.<br />
<br />
Click Export. If you already have a file by the same name, Internet Explorer will ask you to replace it. Click Yes if you want replace the file, or click No and type a new file name.<br />
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
If the folder you select cannot be written to, such as another user's Documents folder, the export will fail. Retry the export with another folder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;To import favorites<br />
Follow these steps on the computer that you want to import your favorites to.<br />
<br />
Click to open Internet Explorer. <br />
<br />
Click the Favorites button, click the arrow next to the Add to Favorites button, and then click Import and Export.<br />
<br />
In the Import/Export Settings dialog box, click Import from a file, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
Select the Favorites check box, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
By default, Internet Explorer imports from a file called bookmark.htm in your Documents folder, but you can tell it to import favorites that are saved under another name. Click Browse and select a file, or type a location and file name to import, or click Next
 to accept the default.<br />
<br />
Select the folder where you want to place the imported favorites, and then click Import.<br />
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
<br />
Notes<br />
To share or move favorites from one computer to another, export or copy the Bookmark.htm file to a disk or flash drive. You can then import your favorites from the disk or flash drive to the new computer.<br />
<br />
Favorites from previous versions of Internet Explorer can be imported into this version.<br />
<br />
To print your list of favorites, open Bookmark.htm in Internet Explorer and then click the Print button&nbsp; .<br />
<br />

    <title>Multiple Audio Output DOES NOT WORK in Win 7&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marshall5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Audio Output DOES NOT WORK in Win 7&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed a new OS, Windows 7 Ultimate, into my audio studio workstation.</p>
<p>I can no longer output sound through multiple audio devices simultaneously! This is a catastrophe at the moment.</p>
<p>I need to output sound through my PC speakers, and at the same time I need sound playing through my HDMI output from my video card. Windows 7 makes me set one device as default under Sound in Control Panel, and it only plays audio out of that one device
 I choose as default. I need BOTH devices playing sound at the same time!</p>
<p>My old OS, Windows XP, just allowed me to do this last night, so I know this issue is not hardware-related. I don't understand what is going on here. My "upgrade" feels like a downgrade!</p>
<p>How do I enable sound through two devices at the same time?</p>
<p>Please help as I have customers who I cannot properly demo audio equipment for today.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can have multiple audio applications playing to more than one audio device at a time. The application does need to have the ability to select which audio device to use. For the inbox Windows Media Player, here are the steps.</p>
<p>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Devices tab &gt; Select Speakers &gt; Properties.</p>
<p>Now in the drop down box you should see all the available devices.</p>
<p>You could then start another audio application and play to&nbsp;a different device.</p>
<p>If you want one application to play to all available audio devices, then the application would need to support that. Windows Media Player, unfortunately, does not.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chris</p>

            I take it you are telling me that I installed a new OS, and now I did indeed lose features by doing so.
<p>Why do you blame it on other applications?</p>
<p>It is not the applications fault, Windows 7 will not let me play audio over multiple devices at once, a feature which WINDOWS XP allowed me to do. This is not anyone elses problem but Microsofts.</p>
<p>Windows 7 handles the sound output. Windows 7 is disabling output to multiple devices. I am reinstalling XP and selling this operating system. This is for a business computer at a sound studio. I have to hear the signal that is being sent to the sound room.
 I can't be proofing the audio while people need to hear it at the same time as me.</p>

<p>sounds like microsoft. blame it on somebody else. it couldn't be windows 7's fault. (laughter.)</p>
<p>microsoft, get with it. first, hire some people willing to resolve issues your customers are putting in front of your face, instead of these zombie robots being paid to wonder aimlessly around this place pointing fingers at other companies.</p>
<p>this issue needs to be fixed. this is HUGE. windows xp could output two audio channels at once, and now windows 7 can only do one.</p>
<p>de-evolution, anyone? there's your money being put to use by bill gates. more like being put in a vice so it can be crammed into his master wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is pretty funny to me how they ignore the problem threads, like this one, avoiding at all costs responding to the actual issue at hand. i agree, that just want the thread to fall back so new people won't see W7's huge issues. i WON'T BUY WINDOWS 7 UNTIL
 THEY GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED. i recommend anyone else boycott them as well for ____ like this. why should we pay more to lose features? they must rely on the unsuspecting to rob people blind.</p>

<p>de-evolution, anyone? there's your money being put to use by bill gates. more like being put in a vice so it can be crammed into his master wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is pretty funny to me how they ignore the problem threads, like this one, avoiding at all costs responding to the actual issue at hand. i agree, that just want the thread to fall back so new people won't see W7's huge issues. i WON'T BUY WINDOWS 7 UNTIL
 THEY GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED. i recommend anyone else boycott them as well for ____ like this. why should we pay more to lose features? they must rely on the unsuspecting to rob people blind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glad to hear somebody else noticed this. I'm sure there are thousands of people with this same problem. If there's 1 person posting it in this place...well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>So lets hear it from you <em>PAID</em> Microsoft answer folks, is MS going to fix this audio problem with their software?</p>
<p>In the meantime, I reinstalled XP so that I could have the original functionality of multiple audio channel outputs.</p>

            OK, is there a solution for this yet?&nbsp; I need to run BOTH HDMI and the standard speaker jack in the rear of my computer
<br />
I used these direction and it was PERFECT....until I rebooted.&nbsp; then it won't work.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Open Sound panel </li><li>Select Speakers as the default playback device </li><li>Go to the "Recording" tab </li><li>Right click and enable "Show Disabled Devices" </li><li>A recording device called "Wave Out Mix", "Mono Mix" or "Stereo Mix" (this was my case) should appear

Also ( this is somewhat unrelated), I can only get sound out of my front 2 speakers if I set the device to Dolby 7.1 (which I have).&nbsp; If I set the device to

            ^^Thanks so much you two. <br />
<br />
This has been a constant hassle. Have a soundcard in my old case which I had to buy an optical out dongle for to get audio to my receiver. I could put that back into my new PC but then I still wouldn't get audio through HDMI to my TV. This solved that problem.
 Now I just need to turn my TV on and all the PC stuffs is working on it. No more fiddling around with settings all the time.<br />
<br />
It's such a stupid thing. I'm no programmer, but it seems like it'd be relatively simple to fix.<br />

            There are 100's of posts everywhere about people getting only 2 channel audio out of
<div>HDMI output running w7. It is not a driver problem, it is not a hardware problem, the problem is W7</div>
<div>does not work correctly in allowing more than 2 channel audio out thru HDMI.</div>
<div>While outputting out to optical works just fine.</div>
<div>This is a major problem as HDMI out is the output of choice today for many.</div>
<div>What this means is Microsoft does support CORRECTLY HDMI .</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am going to try this with W8 to see if the problem is still there as well.</div>

            I checked on W8 and it appears to have the same problem.
<div>I just hope I am wrong about the deficient HDMI audio in W7 and W8 from Microsoft</div>

<br />2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-window...</a> 
<br />  1. Win Store Trouble Shooter
<br />  2. Clear store Cache
<br />  3. Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
<br />  4. Reg hack for Connection errors
<br />  5. Re-Register the Store
<br />
<br />#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN 10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER

<br />
<br />Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
<br />
<br />Use the built in Trouble shooter
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
<br />Scroll down to the bottom 
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
<br /><a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-w...</a> 
<br />
<br />Run it 2 or 3 times.
<br />
<br />#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATES
<br />the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
<br />Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows...</a>

<br />
<br />Create a System restore point. (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402753...</a> )
<br />Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
<br />#1 Start a command prompt in Administrator Mode:
<br />In start menu search for CMD
<br />Right click on it
<br />Select “Run as Administrator”
<br />#2: Stop various Windows Update Service, Cryptographic, Background Intelligent Transfer Service,  and MSI Installer Windows services. 
<br />To do this, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. 
<br />
<br />Then type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />   net stop wuauserv 
<br />   net stop cryptSvc 
<br />   net stop bits 
<br />   net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />#3 Rename the folders used by Windows Update:
<br />   Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />   Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />
<br />Reconnect to the internet
<br />
<br />#4 Restart the services:
<br />   net start wuauserv 
<br />   net start cryptSvc 
<br />   net start bits 
<br />   net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />#5 Restart the computer:
<br />Reboot the computer
<br />open Windows Update 
<br />click Check for updates.
<br />
<br />RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
<br />Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
<br />
<br />Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

            Hello, try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />Microsoft recently released a Store improvements update for version 1709:
<br />KB4058043 
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" multiple times
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<p>Even though this works - <em>at least for me and some others</em> - I still get to the point being not able to install anything from the Store.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community. We understand you want to know which power state is best to use for your Surface. We're happy to guide you.<br />
<br />
How you use your Surface will determine whether you have to shut it down or leave it on sleep mode.<br />
<br />
If you're not going to use your Surface for a while, you may want to turn it off. If you're just stepping away for a small amount of time, then putting it on sleep mode will be more appropriate. It still depends on your personal preference.<br />
<br />
We never really know when our device will fail. However, there are things you can do&nbsp; to increase its longevity, like performing regular updates, less wear and tear, and regular maintenance on Surface.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Windows because account won&#39;t login</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my motherboard and CPU. As a result I have to reactivate Windows. I have a digital license linked to my MS account. I don't use my MS account to login to this computer because it's an HTPC with a single login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reactivated Windows on my laptop by just signing in with my MS account after a clean install so I know how it should work. However I can't login to my account through Windows Activation or through the add account screen. When I enter my email and password
 the dialog box closes immediately without doing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas on how to get logged in so I can get activated?</p>

<h2>            problems installing java with windows vista</h2>
                    I am having a heck of a time installing java on my new computer. Here's what I do....I go to java.com, click on install and follow all prompts. I am told that java is successfully installed. The icon is on my control panel, but when I try to use java&nbsp;I
 am told there is an application error.&nbsp; It says ' java.lang.classnotfoundexception:client.class'.
<br />
<br />
I have gone back to java.com and run their test to see if I actually have java and&nbsp;I am told that it has installed inproperly and applets are not availabe. I have tried to troubleshoot to see how to manually install the applets, but no success. I then uninstall
 the java program and retry again. I have even tried the offline version, to no avail.<br />
<br />
I am a pathetically incompetent when it comes to computers - &nbsp;the download seemed idiotproof - guess not. If anyone has any suggestions about what I can do, I certainly appreciate it!

<p>&nbsp;Hello cootiegirl,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I know you have uninstalled and reinstalled before with the download from Java.com.&nbsp;Please try these steps to see if it makes a difference.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Uninstall Java<br />
(Search and make sure you have uninstalled all versions of Java that are on your computer.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Run an application in Internet Explorer which will prompt you to download a java plug-in.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The reasoning behind this is you would install a fresh version of Java that might not error out).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Install the Java applet.<br />
<br />
Now try again and see if Java is correctly installed you can access programs that need Java.<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if these helped to resolve your issue or if you need further assistance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

<p><span>Hello, cootiegirl</span></p>
<p><span>You can try an offline Java install, the instructions for this are at the following link:
</span><a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/6000010400.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://java.com/en/download/help/6000010400.xml</span></a></p>
<p><span>After you download the installer file, browse to the file, right click on it and choose Run As Administrator. You may be prompted to enter your administrator
 password or to continue.</span></p>
<p><span>It might be best to uninstall Java before doing this.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this helps, or if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 Explorer.exe &#38; taskbar crash, refresh every 30 secs including any active windows</h2>
                    I have seen this problem on here before and there hasn't been a solution that worked. I am hoping someone can help me please!!!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Window explorer is very slow and laggy</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>every approx 30 seconds the taskbar pops up (with no programs pinned to it) and any windows open crash, even if in the middle of copying files etc.</div>
<div>A few seconds later the desktop is refreshed and the task bar appears normally.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is so annoying, it renders being able to do anything in windows explorer or on the desktop impossible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This issue seems to have been around for a few months and experience by others yet I am struggling to find a solution.</div>

            Hi  Kathy, my name is Andrew and I'm an Independent advisor here to help you.
<br />
<br />If you want to change the backup drive for File History, you have to stop the current process. I recommend that you try the instructions below to stop file history on an older drive and then restart it on a new drive:
<br />
<br />1. Go to the Settings
<br />2. Move to Update &amp; Security &gt; Backup
<br />3. Press More Options, scroll down to find Backup to a different drive section, then select Stop Using Drive
<br />4. Plug in the new storage drive, move to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Backup, and select Add a Drive.
<br />5. Refer to the article and follow the steps to restart File History and configure it 
<br />

<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />Andrew N.
