<p>Hi Alister,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft Arc Mouse features a single touch pad that allows you to scroll both vertically and horizontally. For best results, make sure your scrolling gestures are aligned towards the center of the touch pad, and using smooth motions. If you're having a
 problem with scrolling, we suggest that you configure mouse settings on the Control Panel. Please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/support/how-to/mouse/how-to-mouse_configctrlpanel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for the results. Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need further assistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>What the &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; is memtest.exe&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            What the &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; is memtest.exe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can somebody (possibly from Microsoft) please confirm what memtest.exe IS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just spent an entire day doing a complete reinstall to be virus free, now...i noticed on one of my other drives (D:) i have a 'Boot' folder.</p>
<p>In that folder are a bunch of language type files and at the bottom there is a memtest.exe file. I tried to delete the folder but i get an 'access denied' message. Usually, when i see an ODD folder, on a drive OTHER than the system drive, and i try to delete
 it and get an 'access denied' message...it means it's malicious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this IS supposed to be there...why would microsoft go ahead and create folders on adjacent drives? System Recovery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea what this thing is. I don't know if it's supposed to be there or not or what.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

            <p>Yes memtest.exe is suppose to be there. </p>
<p>It is a utility to allow you troubleshoot your installed memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must have left your other hard drive installed when you reinstalled Windows 7 and that drive must be installed on the motherboard in a position ahead of the drive on which you installed the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Windows does the installation, it uses the first drive it sees to install a System Reserved partition, that includes all the boot records, other diagnostics and space for Bitlocker, if you have the version of Windows 7 that supports it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid having the Reserved partition on another disk you should either make sure that the disk you are installing to is first or disconnect all other hard drives while installing.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 ALWAYS Resets to Wrong Time upon Reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greenraccoon23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 ALWAYS Resets to Wrong Time upon Reboot</h2>
                    <p>I know there's other threads for this question, but I couldn't find an answer in any of them that worked for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whenever I start up Windows 7, the time resets itself to 6 hours ahead. My time zone is set to Central time, which is correct, but the clock still resets itself to 6 hours ahead of Central time whenever I reboot. The time zone never changes, just the time
 itself. I've tried manually changing the clock, but it resets itself to 6 hours ahead when I reboot. I've tried resetting the clock by syncing with an internet server, but the clock resets itself to 6 hours ahead when I reboot. I've tried resetting the clock
 with a different internet server, but the clock resets itself to 6 hours ahead when I reboot. I've tried changing the startup type for the Windows Time service in Services.msc to "Disabled," "Manual," "Automatic," and "Automatic (Delayed)," but all four times
 the clock reset itself to 6 hours ahead when I rebooted. My BIOS time is correct and my time on my Ubuntu OS is also correct.<br />
<br />
I'm confused. The clock must really want to be 6 hours ahead because everything I try won't change it.</p>

<p>Yup, I already tried that. I tried Disabled, Automatic, Automatic (Delayed), and Manual, but I get the same result each time--the clock still sets itself 6 hours ahead.</p>

1- The scan showed that everything was fine.</p>
<p>2- The same results happen with the Guest account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found out that the clock resets itself to the wrong time only after I boot into my Ubuntu partition.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do you have any third-party clock applications installed on your computer? If yes, uninstall the same and check if that brings about any change in the clock timing.<br />
<br />
This issue may occur because of incorrect registry value <br />
or Generally the date and time of the system is associated with the battery which is placed on the mother board. it is silver in colour, round in shape. if you open the cabinet, you can easily identify the battery on the motherboard. This battery is called
 as CMOS Battery. In case there is a problem with CMOS battery you may contact with manufacturer or local tech.</div>
<p>
</p><div>I would suggest you try following steps and check if that helps. The step by step solution is as follows:<br />
1 Boot windows<br />
2 click start&gt;&gt;run and type <strong>regedit</strong>-&gt;click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
3 The windows registry editor should pop up Navigate with in the explorer to:<br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\CONTRO L\TIME ZONEINFORMATION\REALTIMEUNIVERSAL needs to have the value of "1"<br />
</strong>4 click on the <strong>TIMEZONE-INFORMATION </strong>"folder" from the navigation pane if you haven't already done so.<br />
5 This assumes the correct key doesn't exist. If it does, you will just change the existing key value right click on the white space within the folder. Select new&gt;DWORD value. Title the key real-time is universal. Set the value to<strong> "1".
</strong>Hexadecimal should be fine.<br />
6 Restart the computer and check.</div>
<div><strong>Important:</strong> Above steps tells you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry

            I have this same problem. When I boot into Ubuntu (located on a completely separate hard drive) and then subsequently shut down and boot into windows, the clock is six hours ahead. I too am in USA Central timezone.

            So a more thorough search shows that Ubuntu uses UTC while Windows uses Local Time. This problem can be solved by changing the Windows registry to use UTC or Ubuntu to use Local Time. Details here:&nbsp;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Make_Windows_use_UTC

            <p>Hello, thanks for &nbsp;your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot tell you yet. But yes, biggest chance it comes in from Chrome. Hardley using other browsers. I posted in Chrome Help Forum already. They could say, you have to be with Windows. And if you think about it, it's a much bigger chance. Look at my screenshot.
 You would expect these would start with empty buffers. Can be something in Chrome to leave it anywhere. But OS should take care properly.</p>

            <p>If the tooltip appeared on a particular browser, the issue may be with the browser. To further isolate the issue, please try checking how it goes on other browsers. We also suggest doing a clean reboot to check if it's not a 3rd party program that is causing
 the issue. Please check out this link for reference: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Unfortunately, it is not possible, even though you have an x86 processor in your Tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Factors include:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Most of these Android Tablets are not ACPI compliant which will result in power management issues. In fact, Windows would not even install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Also, the limited amount of internal storage would make it difficult to run Windows 8 on it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to purchase a dedicated Tablet with Windows 8.1 already preinstalled.</p>

<div>I go to this link:&nbsp;http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/ThemeID.27509700/Windows-7-Home-Premium/productID.235488300 but it should come up with a picture of Windows 7 Home Premium and "Add to Cart" etc. but it's not showing up...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's going on :?</div>

</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you
 already own&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Command Prompt (admin)</p>
<p>Enter the following command:</p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey</span></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click&nbsp;<span>Start</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Settings&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Update &amp; security&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;Activation</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Change the product key</span>&nbsp;then enter the new product key then click&nbsp;<span>Next&nbsp;</span>to

<p>
</p><p><span>If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt phone activation:</span></p>

</p><p><span>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer,&nbsp;</span><span>how do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system
 unit.&nbsp;It looks like the following:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.</li></ul>
<span>
<p><br />
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>I bought a retail box copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1; where do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>For Windows 7, the product key can be located on a pamphlet in inside the Windows 7 box.</p>

<p>You say you are "re-booting," but you probably don't mean that. To reboot is to restart the computer, to power it on, something that most people do at least once every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my guess is that what you mean is that you are *reinstalling* Windows, not rebooting the computer. If so, no key is needed. Reactivation will be automatic.</p>

<p>No, Windows 10 works just fine with mouse and keyboard. If you have a standard LCD or CRT monitor, it works just fine with that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is the Start Screen still available in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>See: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/how-to-enable-the-start-screen-in-windows-10/903cc78c-88b9-4161-9edc-00d5ad9561c6" title="Windows 8 first introduced in 2012 reimagined the user experience with the Start Screen. A new approach to interfacing with Windows. Since then, Microsoft has refined the user experience. Even though many found the experience overwhelming, it did win a loyal fan base. Windows 10 reintroduces the familiar Start menu experience, now called Start. It promises to provide the best of both worlds with acceptable compromises both Windows 8 and Windows 7 users will love and enjoy. In this article, we take a look at how Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 lovers who still like using the Start Screen can quickly enable it on the fly and orient themselves with some of the improvements.">

<h2>            Can&#39;t save to Documents folder after Fall Creator&#39;s Update</h2>
                    <p>After the Windows 10 Fall Creator's update (version 1704 to 1709) I can't save a file to my Documents folder or to my Desktop.&nbsp; I get an error message which says "File not found.&nbsp; Check the file name and try again."&nbsp; This happens from File/ Save As.&nbsp; I can
 save to my Users folder however.&nbsp; From File Explorer, I can cut the file and paste it into the Documents folder (or Desktop folder).&nbsp; I have administrative privileges on the computer.</p>
<p>The two non-administrative accounts on this computer have the same problem - they cannot save to their own Documents or Desktop folders.</p>
<p>I have two other computers running on Windows 10, each with only one, administrator, account.&nbsp; Both of hese computers have the same problem after the Fall Creator's update.&nbsp; This seems to be a bug introduced by the Fall Creator's update.</p>

<p>While experimenting to supply the answers to your questions, I seem to have found the root cause of the problem.&nbsp; I had turned on Controlled Folder Access in Windows Defender as soon as the Fall Creator's update was installed.&nbsp; I expected that most applications
 I use would be included in the access list, but that is not the case.&nbsp; Even some Microsoft applications are blocked, such as Notepad and Word 97.&nbsp; I could enable most applications by adding them to the allowed list, but I haven't found the relevant .exe file(s)
 for LibreOffice.&nbsp; Earlier I had problems trying to install an update to LibreOffice.&nbsp; Eventually I figured out that the installation failed when it tried to put an icon on the desktop.</p>
<p>For the time being I have turned Controlled Folder Access off.&nbsp; Once I figure out the necessary .exe files I will turn it back on.&nbsp; I like the added security, but Controlled Folder Access isn't quite ready for prime time yet,</p>
<p>The error messages all indicated that the program that was attempting to write the file couldn't find the folder.&nbsp; Apparently Controlled Folder Access hides the files for applications not on the list.</p>
<p>The Windows version is Windows 10 Pro, version 1709, build 16299.64</p>

    <title>Windows 10 crashing after installing graphics card drivers. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliemacau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 crashing after installing graphics card drivers.</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite a straight forward problem, I've been using windows 10 for about 4 months now and all of a sudden it crashed on me one day, then every time I would boot up my computer it would get to the Windows loading screeen, a heap of lines would appear across
 the screen, then go blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went into safe mode and used Display Driver Uninstaller to completely clear it, windows booted in normal mode again. Now every time I try to install the drivers for my graphics card it crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched around and it seems to be a common issue, i've had mostly black screens but on occasion blue screen with&nbsp;</p>
<p>nvlddmkm.sys error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a few different driver versions with NVIDIA and none work. I also tried the card on a Windows 7 machine and it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any fixes for this? Thanks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Mobo: ASUS Z-87 A</p>
<p>Video: EVGA GTX 780 Ti<br />
Processor: i7 4770k<br />
OS: Windows 10 64bit Home</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Charlie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might appear due to the compatibility of the graphics drivers. As a work around, I suggest you to install the drivers in compatibility
 mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the program in the compatibility mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a program or driver written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run properly in current Windows, then you could try using
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> on the program to hopefully allow it to run properly.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the program/game in the compatibility mode and check if it helps. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the program icon, click on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click the <strong>
Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check the <strong>
Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong> box and select the Preferred <strong>
Windows</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
Apply</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> button.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>I hope the information helps. If you need any further assistance, please feel free to contact us again. We will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

Did you verify, before upgrading and via a manual check of all hardware devices and manufacturers and not by some magical tool, that all hardware in the computer was supported under Windows 8?&nbsp; Did you then, after upgrading, download and install the latest
 software and drivers from said hardware manufacturers and install them?

            <p>I ran the web based installer which indicated no problems with my wired network card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed windows, applied all the updates that were available.&nbsp; And the machine ran fine until the next morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunday morning the machine said I had no network connection.&nbsp; I was able to connect to the router wirelessly.&nbsp; When I re-started the machine to see if that'd help I found that windows seemed to have installed another 4 updates during the night that required
 a restart.</p>

    <title>Time and date stamp for Surface Pro 2 camera - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauly308  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time and date stamp for Surface Pro 2 camera</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my Surface Pro 2 for work. &nbsp;I use it when I inspect properties. My clients require me to take measurements of the building and describe it using their online forms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am required to take 10 photos per property and most times I inspect 10 properties a day. &nbsp;I would like to use the camera in the Surface pro to take photos, however I am unable to get the time and date stamp on photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have photo editing software which will allow me to add them in later, however this (BatchPhoto) is to time consuming. &nbsp;I have a number of items on my checklist per property and while this is only one item on my checklist, when I multiply this by 10 or
 more each day, this one particular issue bugs me! &nbsp;It's to time consuming for me to add in time and date stamp later. &nbsp; &nbsp;Surely there is a solution where the instant the photo is captured, the time and date stamp is visible in the photo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to use the camera on the device to automatically include time and date stamp? &nbsp;Is there any apps you can recommend I download, ie a third party camera app which can help? &nbsp;There is a panasonic app I have noted in the app store however this
 does not open on my surface pro 2. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate some help people because this one issue can make my day so much more productive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand that you would like to have time and date stamps added to your photo directly through the camera application on the Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the camera app does not have this option. However, with the Surface Pro 2, you can install any software compatible with Windows 8 and any apps from the Store. &nbsp;You may be able to find another camera application that has this function included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for asking this question in the forums, and please let us know if you have any other questions in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Hello all, This is a new one. &nbsp;My Windows XP professional SP3 obtained some type of bug. &nbsp;I am now stuck on the blue screen at Mup.sys. &nbsp;I tried 25 hrs of every type of rescue I could find to no avail. &nbsp;I am currently booting XP off a thumb drive
 to access the internal hard drive. &nbsp;I can see all the files fine to recover them. &nbsp;But I go to the Documents and Settings folder to get the data out of 'My Documents' and it is no longer a folder, it is a file with no extension. &nbsp;the file is still named the
 'user' name that the folder should be named, but it is no longer a folder. &nbsp;The file is about 10G, which is probably the correct size. &nbsp;Did something change the attribute of this folder to a file? &nbsp;I've never seen anything like this.</strong></p>

<p>Hi Eddie,</p>
<p>Same problem here. I don't usually make "me too" posts but I see the thread is still young...</p>
<p>Luckily for me it's not such an important folder that has changed, but it is in our domain environment on our main file server (Windows 2003 Server). The user reports that she was renaming a recently created folder when she was unable to open it any more
 because it had changed into a file. In our case the file also seems to be the correct size (unlike most other corruptions of this kind where the file would be 32kb).</p>
<p>I've tried cheekily using the ren command to put a back slash at the start of the name to see if that solves it but it returns "The syntax of the command is incorrect".</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>Dave,</p>
<p>This seems to be an unusual or challenging problem as there has been no responses yet.&nbsp; I have continued to try a couple thing to no avail.&nbsp; I tried using file scavenger to see if I could recover an internal file within this file that was once a folder.&nbsp;
 I used a drive hex editor to change a bit at the beginning of the file which the operating systems uses to determine if it is a file or a folder.&nbsp; This actually turned it back into a folder except when I clicked it, there were 4 randomly name files with no
 extension or associations in it.&nbsp; I know that the information is still there, because using the hex editor, I can see all the file names that still exist.</p>
<p>I am running out of ideas.&nbsp; I typically back-up, but with a desktop and 3 laptops, it'll never be 100%</p>

                    <p><span><strong>Windows 7 Ultimate x64 SP1 – Version 6.1.7601</strong> (from ver).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My first indication of a problem occurred when I tried to add a <strong>
Windows Feature</strong> (Control Panel-&gt;Programs-&gt;Turn Windows features on or off). I was presented with the dreaded
<strong>blank box</strong> (no text at all).</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past 2 months, I have scoured the Internet looking for a solution.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have found many similar posts, with 4-5 enumerating the exact same error code and behavior I’m encountering.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All those threads eventually end with no resolution (except for those who opt to switch to Linux or Apple).</span></p>
<p><span>I have also been on the phone with MS Customer Support many times, spanning many hours—all to no avail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Steps I have taken more times than I like to admit:</strong></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>NOTE what appears to be a default version of 0.0.0.6 - </strong>
I have seen this in almost every post regarding errors with the component store.&nbsp; If you don't believe me, simply Google '0.0.0.6'.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>5)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Within the registry, I find the following:<br />
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Version=6.1.7601.17592=%SystemRoot%\winsxs\amd64_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7601.17592_none_672ce6c3de2cb17f</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>6)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If I go to Windows\winsxs, I find the folder:<br />
amd64_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7601.17592_none_672ce6c3de2cb17f</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>7)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Based on what I find in CBS.log, (see snippets above)
<span>&nbsp;</span>I can clearly see that CbsCore.dll is loaded (from folder in step #6 above), but cannot find the CSI store.&nbsp;From the CBS.log, I see:<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>I can clearly see that CbsCore.dll is loaded (from folder in step #6 above), but cannot find the CSI store.&nbsp;From the CBS.log, I see:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>‘Failed to get CSI store’, <em>and</em><br />
‘No store version format found; DLL store format 0.0.0.6’, <em>and</em><br />
‘Failed to initialize store parameters with boot drive:<span>&nbsp; </span>and Windows directory: ‘<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If I open CbsCore.dll in WordPad, I can find all three (3) error message strings with a simple search.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, it appears the problem originates within CbsCore.dll</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>8)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From there, you’ll see that error cascades into wcp.dll:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>‘No store version format found; DLL store format 0.0.0.6’, <em>and</em><br />
‘d:\win7sp1_gdr\base\wcp\componentstore\storelayout.cpp’, <em>and</em><br />
Error STATUS_SXS_COMPONENT_STORE_CORRUPT originated in function ComponentStore::CRawStoreLayout::OpenCanonicalDataKey expression: (null)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>As with CbsCore.dll, if I open wpc.dll, a simple search will find those error message strings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Although I was put through to Microsoft Customer Support level 2, my information was so far above their pay grade, they didn’t have a clue as to what&nbsp;I was saying.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As a software developer, I can see that one of the C++ source code files compiled and linked into wcp.dll was ‘d:\win7sp1_gdr\base\wcp\componentstore\storelayout.cpp’.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can even see the developer was working on their local drive d: (could be mapped, but drive d: nonetheless).<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can clearly see the name of the function that failed as well, ‘ComponentStore::CRawStoreLayout::OpenCanonicalDataKey’ and the parameter (null).</span></p>
<p><span>So, short of having a symbol file for ‘CbsCore.dll’, I would think this would be an easy problem to debug.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The developer who wrote the code should be able to give a definitive answer as to what caused the error.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But, we’re talking about MS here--where that’s not likely to happen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So, given the steps I’ve followed countless times, the information in the log files, tracing the error messages to specific DLL’s, and showing the order in which they are invoked (and the function, parameter, etc.)...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>...My question to anyone and everyone (especially MS) is: what is the root cause of the failure of CbsCore.dll to find the ‘CSI store’?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before responding with the same list of suggestions I see in every blog, please carefully review the steps I've already taken.&nbsp; Or, I'll keep referring you back to this post.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>NO</strong>, I do not have a restore point that goes back far enough to use (if I had only known earlier--but, there&nbsp;were no&nbsp;indications of a problem).&nbsp; I have a couple of backups of the registry.&nbsp; But, importing them has not worked--presumably
 because they were also created after the problem started.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>DO NOT</strong> simply tell me to re-install from scratch and run away—never to be heard from again.<span>&nbsp; That suggestion is a cop-out, and a sign of ignorance.&nbsp; In 25+ years of developing large complex software solutions, I would never suggest
 to my customer's that they back-up their data, and do a fresh install.&nbsp; Maybe I'm just too old-school, where customer service actually resolves&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;
</span>Every time I’ve been reduced to a ‘fresh’ install, it takes weeks to get the machine back to where I can use it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m an ultra-power user, and I need everything I have on the workstation--every day.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Even a task as simple as backing-up data is complicated by the large number of applications/tools/utilities—each with its own method for saving data.<br />
<br />
<strong>HELP!!!</strong> </span></p>

<h2>            Windows keeps asking me to install same updates over and over</h2>
                    My computer keeps asking me to install 6 updates (plus one extra), I do it and 5 minutes later it asks me to install the same updates. I have basically installed them over and over 100 times. I have tried installing them during shut down, It seems to do
 it but when I restart the machine it asks me again to install the SAME updates. I did a processor exchange a while back (from celeron to pentium) but not sure if the problems started then or later. Please help, my update history tells me that the same 6&nbsp; updates
 have been installed pretty much every day!

    <title>Copy and paste in Windows 10 file explorer resulting in corrupt copies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephgodino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy and paste in Windows 10 file explorer resulting in corrupt copies</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered a very serious issue with trying to copy and paste files to a backup hard drive in Windows file explorer by using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I determine whether my backups are complete and in agreement with each other by doing a casual comparison of the total bytes reported in the backup to the total bytes reported in the source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to check my backup collection more carefully by comparing the SHA-256 hashes of a collection of backed-up files to the SHA-256 hashes of the files on another mirror of the same collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I discovered that there were numerous mismatches, I determined which mirror had file corruption by trying to open the files with hashes that were in disagreement.&nbsp; I opened the corrupt files in a hex editor, and I found that the sizes and filenames
 were correct but the contents were zero in every byte.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the corrupt files, then tried to restore them by doing a Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V transfer from the clean mirror.&nbsp; The copies were corrupt after the transfer.&nbsp; I understand that what I am describing is symptomatic of a faulty hard drive.&nbsp; But I'm not
 convinced that I have that problem.&nbsp; I was able to get the files to successfully transfer if I copied them one-at-a-time instead of copying a whole folder at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also able to transfer the files successfully by using the "copy *.*" command in cmd.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else getting junk backup files by doing a copy and paste in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some notes:</p>

</p><p>I was copying from an NTFS volume to an exFAT volume.</p>
<p>If I decided to copy only one file, I was informed that it would be copied without all of its attributes saved in the source volume.</p>
<p>During my attempt to copy large files, the progress window told me that my transfer rate was 0 bytes/sec to the destination disk.</p>
<p>While the transfer rate was 0 bytes/sec, the names of several large files flashed successively in the progress window.</p>

<p>Lets accumulate all One Piece fans and see if we can aspire an RPG just like naruto's storm 2 gameplay. I for once am taking a stand for this flabbergasting topic of WHY is their no game on this console up to date. Lets gather all links and info about future
 One Piece games on the US market. Objective being to open up Microsoft's eyes on this investment which would end profitably good on both ends.</p>

<p>Namco Bandai and Tecmo Koei are currently collaborating on the title One Piece: Kaizoku
<span>Musō</span> for the Playstation 3. The game shares its core mechanics and style with the Dynasty Warriors franchise, as it is being developed by the same studio. It will cover all the major narrative arcs and end somewhere in
 the New World. You can check out the trailer if you follow the link <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55fxazkEtxk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>There's no game because there's no demand for it. Why would a company waste it's money?</p>
<p>[/quote]Actually, there's a huge demand for adaptations of the most popular of anime titles. Which is why there are all the DBZ and Naruto games. And I'm always hearing people mention that they want a Bleach or One Piece game. Fairy Tail is an up and comer
 as well.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As I understand the issue, you are unable to burn audio disc through windows media player and receive error message "Windows Media Player cannot burn to the disc because the drive is in use. Wait a few minutes for other burning tasks to complete and then
 try again". Please let me know if this is not correct. I understand that it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong><br />
1. Does it happen with any specific file or with all the files?<br />
2. What is the make and model number of the computer?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Let's first try the steps in the article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Burn a CD or DVD in Windows Media Player </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/burn-cd-or-dvd-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/burn-cd-or-dvd-media-player</a></p>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If this happen with all the files then I would suggest you to uninstall the CD or DVD drive, then try installing CD/DVD drive in compatibility mode and check if it helps.<br />
<div>I would suggest you to uninstall the CD/DVD drivers then, download the Windows 7 drivers from the manufacture website and install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
<div><strong>Step 1: Follow the steps provided below to uninstall the CD/DVD drivers.<br />
<br />
</strong>a) Move the mouse to<strong> bottom left corner </strong>and <strong>right-click on
</strong>the<strong> ‘Start icon’.<br />
</strong>b) Select<strong> ‘device manager’.<br />
c) Expand ‘</strong>DVD/CD-ROM drives’ and <strong>right-click </strong>on<strong> ‘drive’
</strong>and select <strong>‘uninstall’.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 2: Install the drivers for the CD/DVD in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
</strong>a) <strong>Download </strong>the CD/DVD drivers from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
b)<strong> Right-click </strong>on the <strong>driver </strong>and click on <strong>
‘properties’.<br />
</strong>c) Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility’ </strong>tab and check the box <strong>
‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ </strong>and sele<strong>ct Windows 7 operating system
</strong>from the drop down<strong>.<br />
</strong>d) Click on<strong> ‘Apply’</strong> and click <strong>‘OK’ </strong>and run the file to install it.</div>
<div>Give this a go; I’m confident you will find what you need here. But if you face any further issue please reply back to this post and I'll be happy to assist you further.</div>

            <p>I had an ephemeral version of this problem.&nbsp; Process Explorer revealed that Windows Media Player was standing on its left foot with its right foot (some part of the program had a handle for the CD drive (\Device\CdRom1)&nbsp;open and some other part didn't realize
 this).&nbsp; Exiting and restarting wmplayer fixed this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(This happened to me on Windows 10 on an HP Stream netbook with an external Samsung USB CD/DVD drive.&nbsp; But I doubt that any of that matters.&nbsp; Probably more important is that is was wmplayer.exe version 12.0.10011.16384.&nbsp; And that it only happened on the
 2nd CD I tried to burn from the same burn list in the same invocation of wmplayer)</p>

<h2>            Audio Recording Problem - Windows 10 Camera</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently having an issue with the Windows 10 Camera app.</p>
<p>I record video, but no sound is coming through on the final product.</p>
<p>I have updated the drivers that would do the problem (i.e, Microphone, Sound Card).</p>
<p>Still, no sound picked up.</p>
<p>Other recording apps (Sound Recorder and third party sound recorders don't work) for example windows expression encoder screen recorder works...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping me, although the solutions did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooters, but they said:</p>
<p>"Turn off audio effects and enhancements"</p>
<p>All my enhancements are off, so nothing was solved.</p>
<p>Also, previous videos recorded have sound, my browser plays sound, but new recorded videos don't.</p>
<p>I found out that when I record webcam video with movie maker, it works regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help?</p>
