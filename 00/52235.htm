<div>Can someone please provide a solution to stop windows from shuting down on me in the middle of tasks. I'm afraid I will lose all of my data. Also, I have already tried multiple hard drive and system checks that Microsoft recommended and no viruses could
 be found. The one hard drive check that went trough every file on my computer took a whole day. I also have tried uninstalling Adobe Flash Player because when I updated it that was when the problems started. Also, I had to uninstall Mozilla Firefox. Thank
 you in advance for any solutions to my problem.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>Check if the issue persists in the safe mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
<div>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong><br />
If the issue does not persist in the safe mode then try clean boot and check.<br />
There is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check.<br />
<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
Refer the&nbsp;link mentioned below&nbsp;to know more about clean boot procedure.<br />

<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;Performing a clean install&nbsp;erases all the data on the hard drive. Please make sure to take a back up of all the important data&nbsp;before performing a clean install.</span></span>
<br />
</p>
<div>Hope this information helps.</div>

<h3> nevilleness  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Xbox One controller doesn&#39;t work after update.</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p><p>Yesterday I&nbsp;bought my Xbox One Controller + wireless adapter&nbsp;to play on PC. I found the information that I can update it with Xbox&nbsp;Accessories app from Windows 10 Store (why not?!).&nbsp;I downloaded it and the app showed the message "Update is required" and then "Connect your&nbsp;controller via USB" or something like that. After that, the process started and at almost the end, it closed itself. Since then, my gamepad is recognized as "Controller" <strong>(only if it's connected by USB)</strong>&nbsp;and I can't use it. It looks like it is connecting&nbsp;to receiver (reconnecting using sync buttons is still available) but I can't play games&nbsp;with it at all&nbsp;and <strong>wirelessly is not available in the hardware manager</strong>. Please help me.</p><p>The ID is now: USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_02DD\7EED8ED498DF. I have no idea what was before but I think it may be different than original.</p><p>My controller is from the EX7-00002 package.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro and Kindle Reader</h2>
                    <p>I had no problem downloading the Kindle app to my Surface Pro.&nbsp; However, I was not able to move the newpaper or magazine subscriptions to the Surface.&nbsp; I called Amazon/Kindle and the tech told me that the reader for newpapers and magazines did not work with
 Windows 8.&nbsp; I will try getting the backwards compatibility feature of IE to open the app with windows 7, but I wanted to find out if there is a fix for this issue either in the pipeline or at least being thought about?&nbsp; Also, is this an Amazon issue or a Microsoft
 issue?&nbsp; I'd like to know which company to pester about this going forward.</p>

            This is a program that you can try on your Surface Pro.&nbsp; Calibre.&nbsp; Web link: http://calibre-ebook.com/<br />
<br />
It is a freeware ebook management program that has a built in converter.&nbsp; It gets updates all the time and what you can do after installing it on your Pro is to import the ebook into it and then hook up your Kindle Reader to it.&nbsp; It should recognize it and
 be able to send the ebook over to the Kindle in the proper format.<br />
<br />
Check their web site for details and it does get updates all the time with newer drivers for ebook readers.&nbsp; Potentially, it can import ebooks from any source and output to a device in the proper format for it.<br />

            <p>You have to check with the magazine sources and what formats they are in.&nbsp; The Calibre program is under constant development even though fully functional but does not support everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some companies have their own particular apps in order to eliminate 'bootlegging'.&nbsp; That means that the files will be specially encrypted and only those apps can open them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Surface RT or Surface 2 tablet, you can forget about installing anything other than what is in the Store.&nbsp; The RT line; the plug has been pulled on them but there are a few apps appearing to support the platform.&nbsp; That only means it took longer
 to develop the app than expected and they finally got them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the magazines I have seen require their own particular app to load them.&nbsp; Those apps generally support Android and iOS for the computer platforms and a few ebook readers out there which are Android based.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to check with the distributor of those magazines or the magazines themselves to find a solution.</p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />Try to unplug the keyboard and blow out the insides of it. If it is a laptop keyboard, then you need to go into drivers and uninstall the drivers then restart the PC. 
<br />
<br />Do so by clicking windows key + X &gt; device manager &gt; keyboards &gt;right click and uninstall yours. From there you can restart your PC. 
<br />
<br />Keep me updated.

<h2>            Tasks will not start</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10, none of my scheduled tasks will run. The required services (Task Scheduler, RPC, etc.) are automatic/running, but I can't even run a task manually - it will just say "queued" and never start. History shows when I kick off
 a task, but nothing gets kicked off by the Task Scheduler. Also, if I run the tasks individually (batch files) they work fine - they just never get started - ever - by the scheduler. Anyone have this problem and/or a solution?

            I'm not sure how this will help me. If the tasks run in safe mode, so what? It's not practical for me to run in safe mode, and they were all working just fine in Windows 8.1. So this is clearly an upgrade-related issue.<br />

<h2>            Hidden files &#40;jpegs&#41; not showing with Music folders &#61; why&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Recently had to buy a new computer. It has Windows 10 on it. Downloaded itunes and am prepared to install my music in itunes. But after selecting songs and getting them into itunes I use-to be able go back to my album folder so I could copy the hidden
 album art jpeg into itunes. But after setting folders to show hidden stuff it does not show the album art jpegs like it use-to in Windows 7. There use-to-be small.jpg and large jpegs and extra stuff in the hidden. but in Windows 10 this is missing. Any help
 or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            I had the same problem . Tried installing it several times and it always failed. Then one day it all of a sudden installed successfully. I think the only difference between the failed installs and the successful one was that I had my phone connected to
 my PC during the successful install. Try connecting your phone to the PC and then run the update.&nbsp;

<h2>            Will windows 7 drivers work on Win10&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">So I've been having trouble getting my new Win10 computer to recognize an HDD of mine.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I'm able to access and see it on my Win7 computer so I thought it might be a driver issue.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Upon further inspection I noticed that the HDD uses these drivers on Win7:</p>

<p class="contentStandard"><span>But only this driver on Win10:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>USBSTOR.SYS</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I was wondering if I could just take these drivers, move them over to Win10 on a flash drive, then put them in "C:\windows\system32\drivers" and they would
 function.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you had a 3rd&nbsp;party antivirus&nbsp;on the OS you upgraded OR if you&nbsp;have one<br />
now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender<br />
which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus.&nbsp;Despite&nbsp;all the hype&nbsp;out there<br />
Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are&nbsp;true superstars.<br />

<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
Right Click Start button - Control Panel - Troubleshooting - on right side click View all -
<br />
System Maintenance.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the<strong> major on-board and separate&nbsp;<br />
device&nbsp;</strong><strong>drivers</strong>.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update
<br />
those without&nbsp;Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Replacing the drivers from the manufacturer works well in theory, and that's what everyone is telling me to do, but my manufacturer is YIFANG. I've contacted them on numerous occasions and have yet to hear from them. In addition to that, their website
 says it was last updated in October of 2014. So I'm unable to get my drivers

<p>A lease is normally something that your DHCP server (which is built into your router) grants to the machines that demand an IP address. In other words, you set it yourself at some stage and you can modify it yourself any way you like. On my router it looks
 like so:</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Playback Issues</h2>

 watching. Both 4k and HD video is affected. My device is an Xbox One X.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">My xbox was working perfectly fine a few days go. On the 19th (a day after the most recent update) is when the issues started. I have reason to believe the issues and the new update are connected.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">FYI I do not take part in the beta updates of the Insider Club program. It's not the TV. It's not just youtube (game trailers that automatically play on a games store's page flicker green, xbox one x startul
 video also corrupted)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83c6a5fe-d482-46dd-837b-e2ac73b239a4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83c6a5fe-d482-46dd-837b-e2ac73b239a4?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out.&nbsp;<span>We have been seeing reports come in through the forums and other support platforms about this issue and it has been acknowledged. Xbox engineers will need to work together with YouTube app developers to find the
 root cause and either implement an update for the YouTube app from the developer or have a fix be implemented in&nbsp;the next&nbsp;console system update. We apologize for the inconvenience but rest assured this video playback issue is currently being worked on. Cheers

            <p><span>Hello Canaman,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suspect there might be some issue with Photo app database. Check for any update for photo app in Windows Store, if available install the same. Most probably it will fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Try to run the built-in Windows Store Apps troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows Key</strong> then type ‘<strong>troubleshoot</strong>’, select the
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> from the list and hit Enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>“View all” </strong>on the left panel and run “<strong>Windows Store Apps</strong>” troubleshooter from the list and see if it works.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Try to&nbsp;reset the Photo app database by following the below steps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows&nbsp;Key + R.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>

            I tried everything above and the only way I could fix the problem was to restore computer to factory and reinstall windows 10. Made sure all photos on IPhone (icloud)&nbsp;so I could transfer back.Not fun but it worked.

            Like I said previously, I am not the only one that uses this computer. But the only one having this problem. Will reinstalling Windows 10 cause any problems with the other users of this computer?

<h2>            Windows 10 reboots with memory dump and event shows bugcheck error</h2>
                    <p>hi..</p>
<p>getting this issue for the last week or so, now is a daily affair.&nbsp;<br />
Contacted MS support and was told that any level 2 is a "Paid Support" and asked me to restore windows to an earlier point.</p>
<p>They do not review the windows dump log created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could anyone assist? As I do not want to contribute to Bill Gate's retirement villa, any further. Thanks</p>

    <title>Remove a second &#40;unwanted and flawed&#41; boot up version of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thylacine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove a second &#40;unwanted and flawed&#41; boot up version of Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been running 8.1 64 bits on my computer for some time (Asus motherboard PZ77-V pro, i5-3570k, with 32 gbs of RAM) but there had been some small, accumulated problems from serial upgrades. &nbsp;I therefore decided to do a fresh install on a couple of new
 250 gb Samung SSDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the install from a Windows 8.1 64 bit disk was straightforward, to my surprise it came up with two Windows 8.1 operating systems. &nbsp;One works fine, the other goes immediately to the light blue crash screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research on this and most answers rely on modification to the boot.ini file which now, under 8.1, either does not exist or I can't locate. &nbsp;I did go to start-up options but there is no scope there for amending the boot file. &nbsp;I also had a look
 at the C: drive to see if there was two Windows folders but there is only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions to re-mediate this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<h2>            Dead Rising 3 onscreen grapple moves</h2>
                    
<p>if anyone could give me some advice on the grapple moves when you get grabbed by a zombie, i see a move that looks like to turn the left stick in a circle, i frantically do that, and the zombie still knocks me to the ground and kills me, i see a move that
 looks like you move the controller back and forth, that NEVER works for me, and i see where you have to mash the x button, would really like to play this game, but it gets frustrating having to start over every time i get grabbed, am i moving the stick in
 a circle too fast, am i mashing the x button to fast, any hints would help, THANKS</p>

<h2>            WlanSvc won&#39;t stay started</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to Windows 10, however, the wifi is not recognized, can only connect via Ethernet cable.&nbsp; WlanSvc is not started, went to services.msc and tried to start it, however, it would only stay started for about 3 seconds then stopped.&nbsp; After several attempts,
 received error code 1067, process terminated unexpectedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any advice?</p>

            <p>Hi Vardhaman S,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem and I followed your instructions but nothing changed. I have also another problem: start button doesn't work and the solutions I found on Internet about this issue can not solve this issue too. I don't know yet if there are also other
 problems.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems that on my computer these issues started with the last security update of Windows 10: if I uninstall this patch then all works fine, both WlanSvc and start button...</p>

</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have
 a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you already own&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to
 reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
