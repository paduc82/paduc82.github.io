<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 on Win7 x64 won&#39;t stay logged in to anything</h2>
                    <p>Internet Explorer 11 x64 on my Windows 7 x64 machine will not stay logged in to any site that allows users to stay logged in (e.g. Facebook, ISP, Stack Exchange, Amazon). My ISP is ATT.YAHOO.COM. As soon as I close IE or navigate away from the logged in
 site all the sites to which I was logged in to require me to sign back in. Mozilla Firefox has no such problems. I'm just about at my wit's end trying to figure out what's wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; General tab "Delete browsing history upon exit" the checkbox is unchecked. In the registry under "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\5.0" I tried renaming Cache and LowCache to Cache-Old
 and LowCache-Old. I tried this last on Dec 12, '15 and at first, it seemed to work. After applying that fix and rebooting, I was able to stay logged on to the sites I frequently visit during the day, but the next morning it was back to the same old behavior,
 not being able to stay logged on to ISP, Facebook, or Stack Exchange. Also, when I do log on, I often&nbsp;have to log on twice. For instance, when I logged on to Stack Exchange, I had new reputation change, but when I clicked on that icon, I was asked to log in
 again. This used to happen intermittently, but now it&nbsp;is constant. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Add-Ons that are enabled are Java, Norton Toolbar and ID protection, and Free Download Manager, none of which have ever caused problems, and I have turned off Norton's idle time tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the things I've tried&nbsp;as of Dec 26, '15:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Reset Internet Explorer defaults.<br />
2.&nbsp; Manually deleted cookies.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Deleted browsing history.<br />
4.&nbsp; Set Temp Internet Folder from 250 MB to 500.<br />
5.&nbsp; In "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Privacy" set CleanPassword to 0<br />
6.&nbsp; In "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\5.0" renamed "Cache" and "LowCache" to "Cache-Old" and "LowCache-Old" respectively.<br />
7.&nbsp; In "Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Security" unchecked "Empty Temporary Files folder when browser closed."<br />
8.&nbsp; Uninstalled and reinstalled Internet Explorer 11.<br />
9.&nbsp; In "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\BrowserStorage" set DefaultDomainCacheLimitInMb to from 1 to 500.<br />
10. In "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\BrowserStorage\AppCache" set AllowWebsiteCaches from 1 to 20.<br />
11. In "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\BrowserStorage\IndexedDb" set AllowWebsiteDatabases from 1 to 16.<br />
6 - 11 worked initially, but upon next day's restart, it was still broken, and redoing them only worked the one time (i.e. they didn't work again).</p>

            Method 1 is probably, to put it charitably, not practical.&nbsp; Method 2 I have already tried as well as Method 3.&nbsp; Neither of these worked.&nbsp; I'm sorry I omitted these items from my original list of things I've tried in my troubleshooting attempts.&nbsp; FWIW,
 on some days when I boot up in the morning, IE remembers my login credentials; most days, though, it does not.&nbsp; I have gotten so frustrated with IE, that I have made Mozilla Firefox my default browser, but I sure would like to get back to IE, as I'm more familiar
 with it, having formerly used it in my work environment.&nbsp; If it means anything, I actually supported an IE-based web application before I retired from AT&amp;T, which often meant having to troubleshoot IE itself , so I do know my way around it.<br />

            <p>This issue has been resolved by uninstalling Norton Internet Security (NIS). I also manually removed all references to "Norton" in the registry and manually deleted all directory entries. Apparently, NIS during its security scans was removing the temporary
 internet items that allows a user to stay logged in to their websites. NIS had options to omit Mozilla Firefox from those scans but not IE, and while some types of scans could be disabled in NIS, security scans could not. NIS was uninstalled on 21 January,
 2016, and I have remained logged in to my websites since then. Today is 27 January, 2016. This report may be updated as resolved. Thank you.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about that! May I know the version of Norton Internet Security you had? Could you please download the latest version of Norton Internet Security from here www.norton.com/install and let us know if you still have this issue? We will look into this for
 you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The new Microsoft Skype for Windows 10 (Skype UWP) application has never been present in the Startup tab. Windows apps are not managed the same way as Win32 application. The classic Skype for Windows Desktop is a Win32 application, Skype UWP is not.</span><span>

            I can't wait for Microsoft to finish "working on it." &nbsp;I gave up and installed MailWasher, which seems to work better than Outlook's native Junk Mail filter. &nbsp;Norton Anti-Spam does not support IMAP, so I turned it off.

            As far as specifications that comply with that particular standard I can't say, but creating templates is a rather routine process. What distinguishes one from another is what is designed into the template. That includes any page layout specs, Styles,
 Fields, or anything else needed by the documents that the template will be used to generate. The key is knowing the program, its features &amp; the requirements well enough to set up the 'base' document. Making it into a template is nothing more than a matter
 of using <span style="font-weight: bold">Save As</span> &amp; selecting the .dotx (.dotm if macros are included) file format.<br />
<br />

For more advanced information on creating templates the following should be useful... Not all have been updated specifically for Word 2011 &amp; the last is based on the PC versions, but the principles are the same:<br />

Anyone have any clue how to fix a Word issue? Though I have "Times New Roman, 12 point" as my default, "Normal"-labeled style, random sequences of words come out in Helvetica whenever I copy-paste ... and I can't change those sequences to Times New no matter
 what I try.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">
I've hit "Styles &gt; Clear formatting." I've blocked off the passages and gone to the Markup ribbon's "Font" field and changed it to Times New Roman and it won't change. And I've tried copy-pasting<span>&nbsp;it
 again with "Paste special &gt; Unformatted text" and "Paste and match formatting" -- nothing works.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This is on a MacBook Pro with the latest (High Sierra) OS. The issue started a few days ago, a few weeks after I updated to High Sierra. I've been using the most recent Word update for a couple months now, so
 the updating isn't the issue. And, of course, I've rebooted multiple times.</p>

<p><span>in.school.date/spon.atclass</span></p>
<p><span>in.school.date/</span><span>overdue.rate</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are hundreds of different text strings but they all start in the same way&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</span><span>in.school.date/</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>an example of the memo field would be</span></p>
<p><span>a03.qwerty.qwerty.in.school.date/current.passed.willnot.parse.in.school.date/spon.atclass.loadfromdbase.onload.run.in.school.date/lapsed.over.parsethrough</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So the text I need is always</span></p>
<p><span>in.school.date/</span></p>
<p><span>followed by a forward slash then a word then a full stop then another word (e.g.<span>&nbsp; /</span>spon.atclass)
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there any way to extract this and place each text string into a separate new record?</span></p>
<p><span>e.g.<br />
ID = 1<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
Textfield = in.school.date/lapsed.over</span></p>
<p><span>ID = 2<br />
Textfield = in.school.date/current.passed</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Taking your sample string as an example you can see how it works in the debug (aka 'immediate') window:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>strList="a03.qwerty.qwerty.in.school.date/current.passed.willnot.parse.in.school.date/spon.atclass.loadfromdbase.onload.run.in.school.date/lapsed.over.parsethrough"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First parse the string to return the substring between the first instance of the delimiter "in.school.date/" and the next instance, if any:</span></p>
<p><span>strItem = GetListItems(strList,"in.school.date/",2,1)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then parse the value returned by this to return the two substrings before the second instance of the
<span>&nbsp;</span>of the delimiter "."</span></p>
<p><span>? "in.school.date/" &amp; GetListItems(strItem,".",1,2)</span></p>
<p><span>in.school.date/current.passed</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then parse the full string again to return the substring between the second instance of the delimiter "in.school.date/" and the next instance if any:</span></p>
<p><span>strItem = GetListItems(strList,"in.school.date/",3,1)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Again parse the value returned by this to return the two substrings before the second instance of the
<span>&nbsp;</span>of the delimiter "."</span></p>
<p><span>? "in.school.date/" &amp; GetListItems(strItem,".",1,2)</span></p>
<p><span>in.school.date/spon.atclass</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Repeat this process, returning the substring between the subsequent instances of the delimiter "in.school.date/" and the next instance if any:</span></p>
<p><span>strItem = GetListItems(strList,"in.school.date/",4,1)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>? "in.school.date/" &amp; GetListItems(strItem,".",1,2)</span></p>
<p><span>in.school.date/lapsed.over</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once the last substring has been returned a zero length string will be returned if any further substrings are sought.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can see this in the debug window.</span></p>
<p><span>? Len(GetListItems(strList,"in.school.date/",5,1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>0 </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, for each row in the original table you'd need to put the two function calls in a loop, incrementing the value of the intStart argument in the first of the two function calls by 1 each time, and terminate the loop once the first of the function
 calls returns a zero-length string.<span>&nbsp; </span>At each iteration of the loop you would insert a row into the table with the value returned by the second of the two function calls.

<h2>            Virus malware</h2>
                    <p>I feel sorry for the person that gets this email :-( I have to tell you that in the last month since I've upgraded to Windows 10 my life my family's life has been practically ruined. I had a laptop running Windows 8 that was a great laptop but I really wanted
 to try the new software. So I went out and bought a new laptop and upgraded to Windows 10 home. But by the first day I noticed it had a pretty bad virus some kind of malware and it got worse and worse every day. Within the last month I have bought new office
 appointment for times totaling over $5,000. I run a small business from home and I have been out of commission for the whole month. I spend everyday resetting reinstalling my software just so I can get ahold of my customers and now I have to write everything
 down on paper because I don't trust anything that goes into my computer. I've had my identity stolen they've maxed out my credit cards opened up seven new credit cards, brought my credit score down 140 points in less than a month and did 27 hard pulls on my
 credit. The virus would take away my administrator rights I was only allowed to be a local user they would make it impossible for me to access my own documents and would be completely fine with me surfing the web or going to my bank or doing what not but if
 I ever tried to go to a support page for Microsoft or for my antivirus software that I purchased it would always stop me. It was almost like it was a learning virus, there's a couple times I get around it I'd turn it off and then use the function keys and
 recover the computer go into the BIOS changing things around to boot differently and after I would do that and reset it by the next time it would learn to change that so I could not do that. I tried even putting an administrator password on the BIOS nothing
 would work nothing would stop this from getting through I just now bought my 5th new pc yesterday and I'm hoping for the best. I formatted every single thing I own I've thrown away everything that possibly could be involved my routers my phone's my UPS my
 USB drives anything! I'm seriously lost and I don't know what else to do. I know my case was sent up to a level 2 technician but I've been so busy that I haven't even been able to get back to them. I do have my degree in computer technology and I really did
 think that I could take care of it so I tried to do that for the first few weeks, it was really embarrassing when I had to go to a computer shop to get a deep end because they said they could fix it for $150. That only lasted 24 hours and it was back. I'm
 almost to my breaking point and I think I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried downloading your malware , I've tried resetting the computer and recovering. As soon as I buy a new computer I create a recovery disk a backup disk I put it in Airplane Mode
 first but I don't know what it is it just keeps coming back. The only thing I can think of it's coming through my Microsoft account so I've made up a few different ones but that's still not helping. I've never heard of anything this bad and whoever is doing
 this I can't imagine they would want to hurt someone so bad that they don't even know just to get their ident</p>
<p>worked half the time it won't let me download it. It'll let me download my I bought AVG Internet Security from the store bitdefender, I tried your Windows Defender I tried upgrading to Windows Pro I put so much money into this and to no avail. If you guys
 know of any virus out there that's taking control of administrator rights and your computer and it seems like at night I know that there is a remote login and transferring information back to a virtual server if you know of anything out there that can clean
 that up let me know but it seems like nothing is working so far. Thank you for your help Shannon rotrock</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about all your problems, when a bad infection strikes it can be a nightmare to clean as any part of the code not cleaned can self propagate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the amount of infections there are, difficult to guess which strain this is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to approach?&nbsp; First&nbsp;I would disconnect from the internet.&nbsp; Then, backup (if you haven't already) your personal data and keep this separate of the laptop.&nbsp; Format the drives of the laptop do a full clean reinstall of windows.&nbsp; DO NOT CONNECT THE PERSONAL
 DATA YET!!&nbsp; Get windows and any applications (office etc) running to a basic level.&nbsp; Install and run A/V.&nbsp; Do everything possible to ensure the laptop is running well and clean of infection.&nbsp; As there is a chance of infection on the backup data, just plug
 the drive back in and scan/clean immediately.&nbsp; Once all clean then copy data back to laptop.&nbsp; Scan again!&nbsp; Finally reconnect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of scans/cleans at every step of the way and hopefully you can catch any remnants.</p>

<p>Several points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First note that this was not an e-mail message you sent. you posted to an online Microsoft forum on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Second, you are not addressing Microsoft here. <span><span><span>This is a peer support forum. We are all just users of this version of Windows here, helping each other if and when we can. We are not Microsoft employees (not even
 those of us with "Microsoft MVP" behind our names; that's an honorary title for having provided consistently helpful advice) except for an occasional Microsoft contractor or employee.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you want to complain to Microsoft about something, please contact them directly. Trying to do it here is just a waste of (figurative) breath</span>, and clutters up the forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3. If you are infected with malware, do not blame Microsoft and do not blame Windows. Malware infection result from your not practicing safe hex, or from your not running excellent ant-virus and other anti-malware ptogram. If the problem keeps
 recurring with new computers, it is almost certainly because of something dangerous you continue to do.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>A good additional point.&nbsp; If you are repeatedly getting infected then either the infection has not been fully cleansed or there is something you are doing (knowingly or unknowingly) that is exposing you to infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be worth doing some reading on the different types of cyber threat, lots of resources on the internet on this subject.&nbsp; Not everything is an old-school virus, malware can come from clicking a malicious link in an email for example.&nbsp; Also, you mention
 you've been subject to identity theft.&nbsp; Whilst this can happen from a security breach on your data it can also come from social engineering attacks, so for example someone looking at all your online profiles and piecing together information about you.&nbsp; Passwords
 as well, in addition to my previous recommendations for cleaning your laptop if you are experiencing continued breaches I would suggest a complete password change of all your passwords - making sure that the new passwords are random and strong.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but your computer seems to be infested with malware so at this point the only good option is to reinstall windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(bear in mind you will need your Product Key (on a laptop this is usually on the underside or on the box, and on a PC it is on the "tower" or on the box), so do have this before you start otherwise your life will be hell)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Using your non-infected Windows 8 PC, download this tool:&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Plug in a USB drive into any free port and open the tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Follow the instructions to flash Windows 10 to the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Shut down your infected PC and plug in the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. You will need to boot to the BIOS. This usually involves pressing either F2, DEL or F12 in the screen typically with your computers' makers' logo on it (just before Windows boots).</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. If successful, you should find yourself at a weird looking screen with different options. At the top there should be a tab called "Boot". Navigate to it using the arrow keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Look at the "Boot Order" make sure your USB drive is at the top of the list. If not move it there. (there should be a guide to what the keys do on the screen at the bottom).</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Press the key that is linked to "Save and Exit". This is usually F10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. The computer should reboot into the Windows installer. There might be an screen that says "Press any key to do so". Do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. You should now be in the Windows installer. Follow the instructions to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>
<p>

    <title>Conditional Subform Link - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ynwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Subform Link</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a form with a subform that I would like to have multiple master/child links.&nbsp; I only want them to be master links if the fields&nbsp;aren't blank(otherwise it filters everything out).&nbsp; I've been trying to accomplish this using vba, but I must admit i'm
 not very good at it.&nbsp; This is what I was using.&nbsp; The other problem is that the user can select from a drop down box that gets added to the record so I can't just have the code in the load event.</p>
<p>If Me.Part_Group &lt;&gt; "" Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Line_Locations_subform.LinkChildFields.Value = [Part_Group]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Line_Locations_subform.LinkMasterFields.Value = [Part_Group]</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            That may be the solution to my problem, but right now I guess my problem is also that I don't know what event to put it in.&nbsp; I have it in that fields beforeupdate and afterupdate, but can't get it to work.&nbsp; I put watches in to see how far it goes in the

<p>The Text box's AfterUpdate event would probably be where you want it.&nbsp; If the form's record source can return more that one record, you will likely also want it in the form's Current evet.&nbsp; That means that you will also need to add an Else block to the code
 to deal with cases when the field does not have a value.&nbsp; I just noticed that there are missing quotes too.&nbsp; Try it this way:</p>
<p>If Not IsNull(Me.Part_Group) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Line_Locations_subform.LinkChildFields = "[Part_Group]"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Line_Locations_subform.LinkMasterFields = "[Part_Group]"<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Line_Locations_subform.LinkChildFields = ""<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Line_Locations_subform.LinkMasterFields.Value = ""<br />
End If</p>
<p>If the code was not executing, double check the event property in the property sheet contains<br />

                    <p>Okay so i have a <span>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 (English) (Student Option) product key which i got back in November from NSW On the hub (Australian Board of studies), i tried to register it on my microsoft account but it keeps saying</span>
 "Office isn’t associated with this account." even though the key is 100% correct. Then i downloaded the office 2013 through the trial download page and put in my key for registration and it worked. My office on my computer is 100% registered (through product
 key) but on my microsoft account it says i dont have any microsoft products. How do i associate my key with my account so for future re installations on&nbsp; my computer (after i reformat), i can do so easily through my account..</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't associate Office Pro Plus 2013 with Microsoft Account. Only Office 2013 Home and Student, Home and Business and Professional, Office 365 Home Premium and University can be associate with MSa. Office Pro Plus 2013 can be purchased through Volume
 Licensing and you will get MAK or KMS product key and installation files would be found on Volume Licensing portal as well. As well Pro Plus is available through Home Use Program, where you receive product key as well as link for installation after your purchase
 on your business email. Looks like that your key is working with available trial, that you converted to full, so it would be the best to keep that installation if you will need to reinstall. Sure you can ask for installation files from where you get a key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, </p>

    <title>WebDAV access from File Manager gone from Belle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ztuka---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            WebDAV access from File Manager gone from Belle</h2>
                    
<p><strong>The Files (formerly File Manager) app has been stripped of its WebDAV feature.</strong></p>
<p>For me, this is a big inconvenience, as it means that N8, E6, 701 now has no built-in means of exchanging files with our home Synology NAS box. (AFAIK, Belle has no FTP, NFS or AFP
<strong>client</strong> "out of the box" or available in the Store, and I'd have to cough up £3 for MyExplorer to add a Windows file-sharing (SMB) client to N8, E6, 701 etc.)<br />
<br />
I don't know if anyone involved with Belle on the Nokia side, reads this forum, but after asking them why they felt they had to remove a genuinely-useful feature, I would plead with them either to restore the WebDAV client functionality to Files, or provide
 a separate app to enable some kind of file-sharing (WebDAV, SMB, FTP, whatever).<br />
<br />
If I have to pay for a third-party client to give me this functionality, no problem, then so be it, but I do have to ask why a 2012 smartphone platform is shipping without a single means of exchanging files over a network (and I don't count USB or Bluetooth
 file-transfer). For that matter: does anyone know why WebDAV was removed from Files?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm the only user who even noticed that WebDAV was gone, but I just had to "vent" a bit...</p>

<p>You are not alone. The request for Remote Drive is also in the Mike_Myers_N8 to-do list:</p>

<p>I&nbsp;don't know&nbsp;why Nokia had to remove WebDAV in Belle. There is&nbsp;very little information available about the
<em>under the hood</em> changes from Anna to Belle regarding memory and storage management.&nbsp;A growing list of apps no longer working&nbsp;is all we have ...</p>

<p>In this are Nokia Belle is far from perfect. Actually Nokia is non-existance since the years of 2006-2009..during that time they actually did something in this area...</p>
<p>I just cant believe that Nokia is removing this (webdav).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still believe that Nokia can manage to make something about streaming media files over webdav, for example; mecanto and spotify are using that technique in their apps. At least I think so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the area of servers from Synology, Netgear&nbsp;and Qnap there are former users of symbian and this is the cloud for users who wants their own servers. Look in their forums and activity and you recognize the former "bright"&nbsp;symbian users now are on other platforms
 than Nokia...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia have managed in betalabs to produce a wunderful app called <strong>Nokia Play</strong> to but in the other directon to
<strong>play from</strong> there are nothing, almost nothing at all for end users.</p>
<p><strong>Telexy.com had some applications for old symbian platform but none for Belle..</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have written before directly to Nokia regarding this and no answers of course.</p>
<p>When calling support they dont know anything about the phenomina..wunder why, 95% of that kind of users were high tech oriented and many of them now developing apps for the cloud among other streming services. Nu wunder why support nokia hardly gets any
 questions about this area anymore. That kind of users left Nokia 2009.</p>
<p>Pity, as the forward looking users have abonded otherwise a great platform which Belle is.</p>

<p>Well thats seems like someone is listening to you. Hopefully they will get enough people saying they want this feature back and it will be included, in a future update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if there are people out there that need this feature, leave a message here and send one to you local nokia office. Thats the only way you voice will be heard and only if you speak out. Dont think you are complaining or whinging, because you arent. you
 are highlighting a feature that you wish to use. The more people that say you need it, the more likely you are of getting it back again and the sooner it will be back.</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>﻿</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>myExplorer can not stream music files yet (they are fist copied to a temporary local cache on the phone and then played). We are planning to add music streaming feature in the future versions.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for access over 3G - it is possible if you have VPN connection to your home network (please note that in such case you need to set the VPN connection as the default Internet connection in your phone settings because myExplorer
 always uses the default Internet connection).</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also possible without VPN but you have to forward TCP port 445 of your computer through your router and then use the external IP address of your router to connect from myExplorer. This will work fine but it is not

<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are thinking about an integrated VPN solution that will work with myExplorer and will allow you remote access to the computer but it will require installing of a program on your computer to form the server part of the

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been looking for a file browser that is able to hook up via webdav to a NAS server and to play music.</p>
<p>I have a synology NAS and a Nokia E6 Symbian Anna soon Belle.</p>
<p>Is it possible to connect over 3G and use this product.</p>
<p>Would be nice to able to stream music without downloading the files and to que the music files.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if it isn’t possible to “hook up” to a NAS Serverm is it possible to use it over 3G and not just only WLAN for browsing files on a</p>
<p>Server, just like the built in filebrowser in Nokia Phones like E6, N8, X7, Nokia 701 etc..?</p>
<p>Seems impossible to find such a application..for music streaming, only mecanto is available and the application symplayer from</p>
<p>Telexy Network isn’t for Symbian 3-phones…I think there is quiet nice demand for applications like symplayer and other applications from</p>
<p>TELEXY.</p>

 traffic will go over unsecured connection. Here is what you have to do for this to work:</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Forward port 445 (or 139) on the file server (or NAS) in your router to another port (for example 22678 - the number is not important, what is important is to write it down for later).</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Create a new network share in myExplorer and type the external IP address of your router in the field "Computer IP address). If your external IP address is dynamic and you are using some kind of dynamic DNS, instead of IP
 address, please fill the DNS name of the router in the field "Computer DNS name".</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Fill in the port number from step 1 in the field "Port number"</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Select "Always ask" as access point because you may need to use different access points depending on your current physical location (3G on the road or Wi-Fi in the office, etc.).</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Please note that you will have to add exception to your firewall for port 445 or 139 as most firewalls block the ports 445 and 139 when the other IP address is not local. This is true even for the built-in firewall in Windows.</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. By using VPN network.&nbsp; This method is better from security point of view but it requires more work to setup. First you need to setup a VPN network from your phone to the LAN where the NAS is located. This can be done in
 few different ways and the concrete steps depend on what kind of VPN you are using. After you have working VPN, all you need to do is this:</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Fill in the NetBIOS name or the (local, not external) IP address of the computer.</strong></font><br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Select the created VPN access point as the access point for this network share.</strong></font><br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that both methods above require some knowledge about the networks. We are planning to create a tutorial, which explains the needed steps but it is not ready yet.</strong></font><br />

<h2>            Upgraded to Windows 10 now my OneNote notebooks are completely missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hardly ever use OneNote but decided to do some serious work on it about 2 weeks ago. Since then, I upgraded to Windows 10 and was returning to my notes to move the project forward. &nbsp;The notebook I was working in is missing and I cannot find it. &nbsp;A few
 other notebooks are missing but I don't care about those. &nbsp;I need this one with the 3-4 hours of brainstorming on it. &nbsp;Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw the notebook briefly last weekend but didn't do any work on it. I didn't delete the notebook after looking at it. I simply hit Alt+Tab to exit (Windows 8 didn't leave an open window for OneNote; it simply hid it in the background). &nbsp;Now, after this
 upgrade to Windows 10, I cannot find the notebook anywhere. &nbsp;I've checked the cache folder. I've opened up every visible notebook. I've checked at least 5 different forum discussions relating to lost notebooks and have followed all paths or instructions, but
 no luck. &nbsp;What else? I don't do any sort of backup with OneNote (hardly use it) but I did check the backup folders. Only two notebooks in there (the ones I could see). &nbsp;I tried searching for various phrases in All Notebooks - no dice. &nbsp;I tried searching my
 pc for OneNote files - no dice. &nbsp;I tried searching OneNote Live (online version) - no luck there either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at my wit's end and don't want to start all that work from scratch. &nbsp;I really wish that I never upgraded to Windows 10. I'd still have my files and Windows 8.1 was working perfectly fine for me before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>

            So I found my notebooks-in the lower right hand corner click "^". &nbsp;Right click on the cloud icon for Onedrive. &nbsp;Then click settings. Select the tab choose folders. &nbsp;Click the choose folders button. Select the drop down for OneNote Notebooks. &nbsp;I found my
 notebooks there and just had to reconnect them with my computer after I upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;However I can't for the life of me get them to sync again. &nbsp;But I at least hope this helps you get your brainstorming back so you can save it to a safer place!

            Hi bblyfdx. &nbsp;Thanks for the comment. I checked online with OneDrive to see if my lost notebooks were there, but nothing was present. I don't think that your solution would have helped me. &nbsp;I say "would" because I downgraded back to Windows 8 in search
 of these files. &nbsp;It worked....now, how to upgrade back to Windows 10? &nbsp;The system keeps forcing me to do all of these updates, started downloading Windows 10 for the upgrade, and then has me back to upgrading Windows 8 again. &nbsp;I swear - they just can't make
 this thing simple, can they? By "they", I mean Microsoft.

<h2>            Creating a &#34;raffle&#34; based on multiple criteria&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a fitness challenge at my work and we use a program that assigns points for activity. We are wanting to do a "Raffle" to pick winners based on fitness level and minimum points earned. For example, we have 3 winners for each fitness level (beg,
 intermediate, advanced). The users have to reach a minimum # of points to get entered into "bucket 1", then a higher minimum to get entered into "bucket 2" and then an even&nbsp; higher minimum to get entered into "bucket 3".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to take my excel list of users and generate a random name based on their fitness level and points range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I need to pick a name from the beginner group that earned between 12,000 points and 23,999 points, then I need a name picked from the same group that earned between 24,000 points and 34,000 points, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I can't find any "random name generator" that allows for multiple criteria.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you!!</p>

<p>The easiest thing to do is to insert a column of formulas, sized to match your data set, using the formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=RAND()</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then sort your entire data set based on that column, which will randomize your list of users.&nbsp; Then simply apply data filters to your table to show only the users with the correct fitness level, and use the top three for your raffle winners.</p>

<p>I don't think I understand. I have a list of 180+ users, some Beginner, some Intermediate, some Advanced. Each level needs 3 winners picked based on which "bucket" they've qualified for (bucket 1 for beginners is 12,000-23,999 pts; bucket 1 for intermediate
 is 24,000-34,999 pts; bucket 1 for advanced is 30,000-44,999 pts. Bucket 2 is a different range for each level, as well as bucket 3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to figure out how to do a random name pick based on their points and also based on fitness level. If I have to split out fitness levels in new sheet, I will. But I'd at least like to be able to pick the winners from each bucket per fitness level
 on one sheet.</p>

<h3> jaapo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t forward .eml attachments from within .eml attachment</h2>
                    <p>Outlook for iOS was recently updated to allow people to open .eml attachments (emails). &nbsp;This is wonderful and I thank Microsoft for this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues now, however, forwarding an .eml attachment from *within the .eml attachment*. &nbsp;So if somebody sends me an email with an .eml attachment and I open that .eml attachment so I can see the email and any attachments to it, if I choose to forward
 that email while viewing it, the outgoing email gets hung up in my outbox and won't go out. &nbsp;Please note that I can forward the original email to which the .eml attachment is attached, but that means my receipient gets the original email with the .eml attachment,
 as opposed to just a forwarded email, which would be simpler. &nbsp;It would be better if I had the choice of simplifying things by forwarding from within the email attachment itself.</p>

            Sounds weird. Have you soft reset your phone by pressing the volume down and power buttons for five seconds until the phone vibrates. If this doesn't work, then i suggest performing a backup of all personal data first then performing a hard reset as detailed
 here: <a href="http://mynokiablog.com/2011/11/08/how-to-hard-reset-nokia-wps-three-finger-restart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://mynokiablog.com/2011/11/08/how-to-hard-reset-nokia-wps-three-finger-restart/</a><br />
<br />
Failing that, you will need to take your phone back to your point of purchase, or your local Nokia care point for them to inspect. to locate your nearest Nokia Care point:

Your post is unclear. The main reason for this is that you do not mention which phone you're using. Anyow, things such as this can happen because of two (2) reasons:
<p>1. You have a branded phone, which contains software customised by your operator</p>
<p>2. You have a CV-variant, where CV stands for Country Version or Country Variant.</p>
<p>If the former is the case, you will need to wait until your operator releases the firmware for your specific model; Nokia's responsibility ends here.</p>
If the latter is the case, you will have to wait a bit longer, as not all CV's have been added to the database yet. To find out whether you have a CV or not, post the FULL output you have when you press *#0000# on this board (in this topic), and e-mail your
 product code to Nokia (you may choose to also post your product code on the board.

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it drives me crazy when I seem to be the only person with a bug, I want to let you know that I have the exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working with Microsoft support for three weeks now without being any closer to a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried all of the published solutions to include:</p>
<p>- reinstalling Office 365</p>
<p>- deleting all profiles and rebuilding them</p>
<p>- creating a new Hotmail account (same error with new account)</p>
<p>- deleting all the other Office 365 accounts (leaving only Hotmail and single Office 365 mailbox)</p>
<p>- changing permissions on Office 365 shared mailbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My android phone and iPad use the Outlook app without issue</p>
<p>2. I can send from the OWA browser without issue</p>
<p>3. If I create the email in the Office 365 account and then switch the from account to Hotmail it works as expected sending the email from Hotmail</p>
<p>4. I have been using this configuration without issue for several years</p>
<p>5. I lost the abilty to send Hotmail immediately after I renewed my Hotmail Premium subscription in September.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello RafaelM.Aburto,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please double confirm if this user has been assigned the Send As permission for this shared mailbox. For information about how to check this in the EAC or by using PowerShell, see&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj919240(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage
 permissions for recipients</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please also try the below steps to configure the shared mailbox as an additional mailbox to check it again:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span>&nbsp;menu,
 click&nbsp;Account Settings, and then click&nbsp;Account Settings.</span></li><li><span>Select your account, and then click&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Change</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>In the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Change Account</span><span>&nbsp;dialog

 click&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Enter the name of the mailbox, and then click&nbsp;OK.<br />
After you make this change, the additional mailbox is listed on the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced</span><span>&nbsp;tab in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft
 Exchange</span><span>&nbsp;dialog box.</span></li><li><span>In the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Exchange</span><span>&nbsp;dialog

 and then click&nbsp;Close.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello RafaelM.Aburto,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Add</span> button, there is a window pops up. Then you need type the effected shared mailbox SMTP address there to add it.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae273580-e686-4061-9a1c-ae87ffb78049?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae273580-e686-4061-9a1c-ae87ffb78049?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you fail to add that shared mailbox, please go to<span style="font-weight: bold"> Offline Global Address List</span> (OGAL)to check if that shared mailbox lists there.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/758140e2-65ca-4229-bf40-b129f86b8813?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/758140e2-65ca-4229-bf40-b129f86b8813?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that shared mailbox also don't list there,<span>&nbsp;
</span>please confirm if you have been assigned the <span style="font-weight: bold">
full access</span> permission. After you can see it in OGAL and then please try again to let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Word provides built-in heading styles, called Heading 1, Heading 2, etc., which you can apply, for example via the Apply Styles pane (Ctrl+Shift+S).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you convert the document to HTML, Heading 1 will be represented by &lt;H1&gt;&lt;/H2&gt; markup in HTML, and Heading 2 will be represented by &lt;H2&gt;&lt;/H2&gt; etc.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer 8 crashes whenever I open extremely large html files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 crashes whenever I open extremely large html files from the US Govt SEC website</h2>
                    
<p>I have an HP Pavilion dv3 with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp; Ever since i got this PC i have been unable to download the reports that public companies file on the SEC's EDGAR database (<a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically i just tried Microsoft's annual report and it's the only one that hasn't crashed&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000789019&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000789019&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
 I guess your finance department really knows how to code those files!</p>
<p>Citicgroup's annual report crashes: <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000120677410000406/citi_10k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000120677410000406/citi_10k.htm</a>.&nbsp; and GM's IPO prospectus crashes:<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467858/000119312510192195/ds1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467858/000119312510192195/ds1.htm</a>
 x</p>
<p>this one crashes almost instantly: <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/922487/000095012310105026/w80452e10vq.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/922487/000095012310105026/w80452e10vq.htm</a></p>
<p>as do most of the companies' that i try.</p>
<p>These files tend to be very long but they have almost no complicated formatting; they are mostly text.&nbsp; They all worked fine on earlier versions of IE and they all work on Firefox.</p>
<p>I followed every step listed at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/pc_ie_start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/gp/pc_ie_start</a>, including reregistering all microsoft components and performing a clean boot after disabling all non-microsoft services.&nbsp;Nothing helped.&nbsp; IE8 still crashes with only MS services running after a clean boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing i did not try was uninstalling and reinstalling IE8 since (a)&nbsp;my PC did not come with installation CDs and I'm afraid i wont be able to get it back and (b) the&nbsp;knowledgebase articles indicate that uninstalling IE8 merely disables it, so it
 would seem that disabling and re-enabling might not help anyways</p>
